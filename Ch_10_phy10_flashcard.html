  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **magnetism**?", answer: "A force of attraction or repulsion that arises between electrically charged particles due to their motion." },
    { question: "What are the two types of magnetic poles?", answer: "North and South poles." },
    { question: "What is the rule for the interaction of magnetic poles?", answer: "Like poles repel, and opposite poles attract." },
    { question: "What is a **magnetic field**?", answer: "A region of space around a magnet or a moving charge where magnetic forces are felt." },
    { question: "What is a **magnetic field line**?", answer: "A line used to represent a magnetic field, showing the direction of the force on a North pole." },
    { question: "Which direction do magnetic field lines point *outside* a magnet?", answer: "From the North pole to the South pole." },
    { question: "Where is a magnetic field strongest?", answer: "At the poles of a magnet where the field lines are most dense." },
    { question: "Can you isolate a single magnetic pole?", answer: "No. Magnetic poles always exist in pairs (monopoles do not exist)." },
    { question: "What is a **permanent magnet**?", answer: "A magnet that retains its magnetism without an external field or current." },
    { question: "What is an **electromagnet**?", answer: "A temporary magnet created by passing an electric current through a coil of wire." },
    { question: "What is a **ferromagnetic material**?", answer: "A material that is strongly attracted to magnets and can be permanently magnetized (e.g., iron, nickel, cobalt)." },
    { question: "What is a **paramagnetic material**?", answer: "A material that is weakly attracted to magnets but cannot be permanently magnetized (e.g., aluminum, platinum)." },
    { question: "What is a **diamagnetic material**?", answer: "A material that is weakly repelled by magnets (e.g., copper, water)." },
    { question: "What is a **magnetic domain**?", answer: "A microscopic region in a ferromagnetic material where the magnetic fields of atoms are aligned." },
    { question: "What is the **right-hand rule** for a current-carrying wire?", answer: "If the thumb points in the direction of current, the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field?", answer: "$$F = ILB\\sin\\theta$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the force on a moving charge in a magnetic field?", answer: "$$F = qvB\\sin\\theta$$" },
    { question: "What is the **motor effect**?", answer: "The force experienced by a current-carrying conductor when it is placed in a magnetic field." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of the **commutator** in a DC motor?", answer: "To reverse the direction of current every half-rotation to keep the motor spinning in the same direction." },
    { question: "What is **electromagnetic induction**?", answer: "The process of generating an electric current by moving a conductor through a magnetic field." },
    { question: "Who discovered that a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current?", answer: "Michael Faraday." },
    { question: "What is a **generator**?", answer: "A device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy using electromagnetic induction." },
    { question: "What is a **transformer**?", answer: "A device that uses induction to change the voltage of an alternating current (AC)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a motor and a generator?", answer: "A motor uses electricity to create motion, while a generator uses motion to create electricity." },
    { question: "How does the Earth act as a magnet?", answer: "Due to the motion of molten iron in its core, which generates a large magnetic field." },
    { question: "Which of Earth's magnetic poles is located near its geographic North Pole?", answer: "The magnetic South pole (which attracts the North pole of a compass)." },
    { question: "What are the **auroras** (Northern/Southern Lights)?", answer: "Charged particles from the sun interacting with the Earth's magnetic field." },
    { question: "What happens to a magnet when it is cut in half?", answer: "It creates two new magnets, each with its own North and South pole." },
    { question: "Why is a magnetic field considered a vector quantity?", answer: "Because it has both magnitude (strength) and direction." },
    { question: "How does the density of magnetic field lines relate to field strength?", answer: "Denser lines indicate a stronger magnetic field." },
    { question: "What is a **solenoid**?", answer: "A coil of wire that acts as an electromagnet when a current flows through it." },
    { question: "What is the core of an electromagnet typically made of?", answer: "Soft iron, which is easily magnetized and demagnetized." },
    { question: "What happens to the magnetic field of a current-carrying wire if the current is increased?", answer: "The magnetic field strength increases." },
    { question: "What happens to the force on a wire in a magnetic field if the current is reversed?", answer: "The direction of the force is reversed." },
    { question: "What is the principle behind a particle accelerator?", answer: "The force on a moving charge in a magnetic field is used to guide and accelerate charged particles." },
    { question: "What is the key to inducing a current in a wire?", answer: "There must be a relative motion between the wire and the magnetic field lines." },
    { question: "What is the difference between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) in this context?", answer: "A simple DC motor uses a commutator, while an AC generator naturally reverses its current." },
    { question: "What is a **magnetic shield**?", answer: "A barrier made of ferromagnetic material used to block or deflect a magnetic field." },
    { question: "How is the strength of an electromagnet increased?", answer: "By increasing the current, increasing the number of coils, or using a ferromagnetic core." },
    { question: "In a magnetic field, what is the force on a charged particle that is stationary?", answer: "Zero. The force only acts on a moving charge." }
