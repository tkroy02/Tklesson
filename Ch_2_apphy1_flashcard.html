  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **Newton's First Law**?", answer: "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force." },
    { question: "What is **inertia**?", answer: "The resistance of an object to a change in its state of motion." },
    { question: "What is the formula for **Newton's Second Law**?", answer: "$$\\sum\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}$$" },
    { question: "What does the symbol $$\\sum\\vec{F}$$ represent?", answer: "The net force, which is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object." },
    { question: "What is **Newton's Third Law**?", answer: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." },
    { question: "What is a **Free-Body Diagram** (FBD)?", answer: "A diagram that shows all the forces acting on a single object, represented as vectors originating from a single point." },
    { question: "What is the standard unit of force?", answer: "The Newton (N)." },
    { question: "What is the standard unit of mass?", answer: "The kilogram (kg)." },
    { question: "What is **weight** ($$F_g$$)?", answer: "The force of gravity acting on an object's mass." },
    { question: "What is the formula for weight?", answer: "$$F_g = mg$$" },
    { question: "What is the **Normal Force** ($$F_N$$)?", answer: "The contact force exerted by a surface on an object that is perpendicular to the surface." },
    { question: "If a book is resting on a table, what is the Normal Force equal to?", answer: "It is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force of gravity ($$F_N = mg$$)." },
    { question: "What is **Tension** ($$T$$)?", answer: "The force exerted by a string, rope, or cable when it is stretched taut." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **static friction** and **kinetic friction**?", answer: "Static friction acts on an object at rest. Kinetic friction acts on an object in motion." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the maximum static friction force?", answer: "$$f_s \\le \\mu_s F_N$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for kinetic friction force?", answer: "$$f_k = \\mu_k F_N$$" },
    { question: "In a friction problem, which is typically larger: the coefficient of static friction or the coefficient of kinetic friction?", answer: "The coefficient of static friction ($$\\mu_s$$) is typically larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction ($$\\mu_k$$)." },
    { question: "What must be true for an object to be in **equilibrium**?", answer: "The net force acting on it must be zero ($$\\sum\\vec{F} = 0$$)." },
    { question: "What can you say about the acceleration of an object in equilibrium?", answer: "Its acceleration is zero." },
    { question: "According to Newton's Third Law, if a person pushes on a wall, what is the reaction force?", answer: "The wall pushes back on the person with an equal and opposite force." },
    { question: "For an object sliding down an incline, what is the direction of the Normal Force?", answer: "Perpendicular to the surface of the incline." },
    { question: "For an object sliding down an incline, what is the direction of the friction force?", answer: "Parallel to the surface of the incline and opposite to the direction of motion." },
    { question: "In a system of two connected blocks, what force is the same for both blocks?", answer: "The tension in the string connecting them." },
    { question: "How do you solve for the acceleration of a system of objects?", answer: "Treat the entire system as a single object, and use $$F_{net} = m_{total}a$$." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of a **pulley** in a system of objects?", answer: "To change the direction of the tension force without changing its magnitude." },
    { question: "When are action-reaction forces equal in magnitude?", answer: "Always, according to Newton's Third Law." },
    { question: "Do action-reaction forces cancel each other out?", answer: "No, they act on two different objects and therefore cannot cancel each other out." },
    { question: "What does it mean for an object to be in **uniform circular motion**?", answer: "It is moving in a circle at a constant speed, but with a changing velocity due to a changing direction." },
    { question: "Is an object in uniform circular motion in equilibrium?", answer: "No, because its velocity is changing, which means it is accelerating, and therefore has a net force acting on it." },
    { question: "What is the direction of the net force on an object in uniform circular motion?", answer: "Towards the center of the circle (centripetal force)." },
    { question: "What is a **fictitious force**?", answer: "An apparent force that arises in a non-inertial reference frame (e.g., centrifugal force)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a mass and weight?", answer: "Mass is a measure of inertia, a fundamental property of matter. Weight is the force of gravity on that mass." },
    { question: "What happens to your weight if you go to the moon?", answer: "It decreases because the acceleration due to gravity is lower, but your mass remains the same." },
    { question: "What is the condition for an object to be considered 'weightless'?", answer: "It is in a state of free fall, where the Normal Force is zero." },
    { question: "What is the difference between an **external force** and an **internal force** on a system?", answer: "An external force acts on the system from outside. An internal force acts between objects within the system." },
    { question: "Why do we ignore internal forces when applying Newton's Second Law to a system?", answer: "Because internal forces always come in action-reaction pairs that cancel each other out." },
    { question: "In a free-body diagram, how is a force represented?", answer: "As an arrow (a vector) pointing in the direction of the force, with a length proportional to its magnitude." },
    { question: "For a book sliding to a stop, what is the direction of the net force?", answer: "Opposite to the direction of motion." },
    { question: "If an object is moving at a constant velocity, what can you say about the net force acting on it?", answer: "The net force is zero." },
    { question: "For a person standing in an elevator accelerating upward, what is the relationship between Normal Force and Weight?", answer: "The Normal Force is greater than the weight ($$F_N > mg$$)." }
