  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What does the Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) illustrate?", answer: "The maximum combination of two goods that an economy can produce given its available resources and technology." },
    { question: "What does a point on the PPF curve represent?", answer: "An efficient use of all resources." },
    { question: "What does a point inside the PPF curve signify?", answer: "An inefficient use of resources, where the economy is producing less than it could." },
    { question: "What does a point outside the PPF curve represent?", answer: "A production combination that is currently unattainable with the available resources and technology." },
    { question: "What concept is represented by the downward slope of the PPF?", answer: "Opportunity cost. To produce more of one good, you must produce less of another." },
    { question: "What is the principle of 'comparative advantage'?", answer: "The ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another producer." },
    { question: "What is the principle of 'absolute advantage'?", answer: "The ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce more of a good or service than competitors using the same amount of resources." },
    { question: "According to the Law of Demand, what is the relationship between price and quantity demanded?", answer: "As the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa." },
    { question: "According to the Law of Supply, what is the relationship between price and quantity supplied?", answer: "As the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa." },
    { question: "What is a 'demand curve'?", answer: "A graphical representation showing the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded over a period of time." },
    { question: "What is a 'supply curve'?", answer: "A graphical representation showing the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied over a period of time." },
    { question: "What is 'market equilibrium'?", answer: "The point where the supply and demand curves intersect, indicating a price where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded." },
    { question: "What is a 'shortage'?", answer: "A situation where the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied at the current market price." },
    { question: "What is a 'surplus'?", answer: "A situation where the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded at the current market price." },
    { question: "What causes a 'shift' in the demand curve?", answer: "A change in a non-price factor, such as consumer income, tastes, or the price of a related good." },
    { question: "What causes a 'shift' in the supply curve?", answer: "A change in a non-price factor, such as production costs, technology, or the number of sellers." },
    { question: "What is a 'market' in economics?", answer: "A place or mechanism where buyers and sellers interact to trade goods and services." },
    { question: "What is the term for a situation where a country's production capacity expands?", answer: "Economic Growth. This is shown by an outward shift of the PPF." },
    { question: "When a country specializes in producing a good for which it has a lower opportunity cost, it is engaging in what?", answer: "Trade based on comparative advantage." },
    { question: "What economic tool is used to analyze the trade-offs between producing two different goods?", answer: "The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)." }
