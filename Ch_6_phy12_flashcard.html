  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the key difference between **Alternating Current (AC)** and **Direct Current (DC)**?", answer: "AC periodically reverses direction, while DC flows in only one direction." },
    { question: "What does **RMS** stand for and what does it represent?", answer: "Root Mean Square. It represents the effective value of an AC voltage or current, which delivers the same power as a DC source." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the RMS voltage and the peak voltage for a sine wave?", answer: "$$V_{RMS} = \\frac{V_{peak}}{\\sqrt{2}}$$" },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the RMS current and the peak current ($$I_{peak}$$)?", answer: "$$I_{RMS} = \\frac{I_{peak}}{\\sqrt{2}}$$" },
    { question: "How does a **resistor** behave in an AC circuit?", answer: "The resistor's opposition to current, its resistance, is constant and independent of frequency." },
    { question: "What is the **phase relationship** between voltage and current in a purely resistive AC circuit?", answer: "They are in phase, meaning their peaks and zeros occur at the same time." },
    { question: "What is a **capacitor**?", answer: "An electrical component that stores energy in an electric field." },
    { question: "How does a capacitor behave in an AC circuit?", answer: "It opposes the change in voltage, with its opposition to current decreasing as frequency increases." },
    { question: "What is the **capacitive reactance** ($$X_C$$)?", answer: "The opposition a capacitor offers to alternating current." },
    { question: "What is the formula for capacitive reactance?", answer: "$$X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi fC}$$" },
    { question: "What is the **phase relationship** between voltage and current in a purely capacitive AC circuit?", answer: "The current leads the voltage by 90 degrees ($$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$$ radians)." },
    { question: "What is an **inductor**?", answer: "A coil of wire that stores energy in a magnetic field." },
    { question: "How does an inductor behave in an AC circuit?", answer: "It opposes changes in current, with its opposition to current increasing as frequency increases." },
    { question: "What is the **inductive reactance** ($$X_L$$)?", answer: "The opposition an inductor offers to alternating current." },
    { question: "What is the formula for inductive reactance?", answer: "$$X_L = 2\\pi fL$$" },
    { question: "What is the **phase relationship** between voltage and current in a purely inductive AC circuit?", answer: "The voltage leads the current by 90 degrees ($$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$$ radians)." },
    { question: "What is **impedance** ($$Z$$)?", answer: "The total opposition to alternating current in a circuit, combining resistance and reactance." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the impedance of a series RLC circuit?", answer: "$$Z = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}$$" },
    { question: "What is **Ohm's Law** for AC circuits?", answer: "$$V = IZ$$" },
    { question: "What is a **series RLC circuit**?", answer: "A circuit containing a resistor, inductor, and capacitor connected in series with an AC voltage source." },
    { question: "What is the condition for **resonance** in a series RLC circuit?", answer: "Inductive reactance equals capacitive reactance ($$X_L = X_C$$)." },
    { question: "What happens to impedance at resonance?", answer: "Impedance is at its minimum value, equal to the resistance ($$Z = R$$)." },
    { question: "What happens to the current at resonance?", answer: "Current is at its maximum value." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the **resonant frequency** ($$f_0$$)?", answer: "$$f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$$" },
    { question: "What is the **phase angle** ($$\\phi$$) of a series RLC circuit?", answer: "The angle between the voltage and current phasors, representing the phase difference." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the phase angle?", answer: "$$\\phi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{X_L - X_C}{R}\\right)$$ (also called the power factor angle)." },
    { question: "In a series RLC circuit, when is the voltage lagging the current?", answer: "When the circuit is capacitive ($$X_C > X_L$$), resulting in a negative phase angle." },
    { question: "What is **power factor**?", answer: "The ratio of true power (or real power) to apparent power in an AC circuit." },
    { question: "What is the formula for power factor?", answer: "$$PF = \\cos\\phi = \\frac{R}{Z}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the average power in a series RLC circuit?", answer: "$$P_{avg} = V_{RMS}I_{RMS}\\cos\\phi$$" },
    { question: "Why is power factor important?", answer: "A low power factor indicates an inefficient use of power, as a larger current is needed to deliver the same amount of useful energy." },
    { question: "What is a **transformer**?", answer: "A device that uses induction to change AC voltage from one level to another." },
    { question: "Why do transformers only work with AC, not DC?", answer: "Transformers require a changing magnetic flux to induce a voltage in the secondary coil, which is only produced by alternating current." },
    { question: "What is the **Transformer Equation**?", answer: "$$\\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \\frac{N_s}{N_p}$$" },
    { question: "What is a **step-up transformer**?", answer: "A transformer that increases voltage by having more turns on the secondary coil ($$N_s > N_p$$)." },
    { question: "What is a **step-down transformer**?", answer: "A transformer that decreases voltage by having fewer turns on the secondary coil ($$N_s < N_p$$)." },
    { question: "Why are high voltages used for long-distance power transmission?", answer: "To reduce current and minimize energy losses due to resistance ($$P_{loss} = I^2R$$)." },
    { question: "In an AC circuit, what is the instantaneous voltage?", answer: "$$V(t) = V_{peak}\\sin(2\\pi ft)$$." },
    { question: "What happens to the impedance of a series RLC circuit when the frequency is much lower than the resonant frequency?", answer: "The circuit becomes highly capacitive, and the impedance is dominated by $$X_C$$." },
    { question: "What happens to the impedance of a series RLC circuit when the frequency is much higher than the resonant frequency?", answer: "The circuit becomes highly inductive, and the impedance is dominated by $$X_L$$." }
