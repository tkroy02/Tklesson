  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What does **Newton's First Law of Motion** state?", answer: "An object in motion stays in motion with the same velocity, and an object at rest stays at rest, unless acted upon by an external net force." },
    { question: "What is **inertia**?", answer: "The tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion." },
    { question: "What property of an object is a measure of its inertia?", answer: "Mass." },
    { question: "What does **Newton's Second Law of Motion** state?", answer: "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass." },
    { question: "What is the formula for Newton's Second Law?", answer: "$$F_{net} = ma$$" },
    { question: "What is **Newton's Third Law of Motion**?", answer: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." },
    { question: "What is the unit of force?", answer: "The Newton (N)." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between **mass** and **weight**?", answer: "Mass is a measure of inertia, while weight is the gravitational force acting on an object ($$W = mg$$)." },
    { question: "What is a **free-body diagram**?", answer: "A diagram showing a single object isolated from its surroundings with all external forces acting on it represented by vectors." },
    { question: "What is **net force**?", answer: "The vector sum of all forces acting on an object." },
    { question: "What does it mean for an object to be in **equilibrium**?", answer: "The net force acting on the object is zero, so it has zero acceleration." },
    { question: "What is **normal force**?", answer: "The force exerted by a surface on an object in contact with it, acting perpendicular to the surface." },
    { question: "What is **tension**?", answer: "The force exerted by a string, rope, or cable when it is pulled taut." },
    { question: "What is the force of **friction**?", answer: "A force that opposes motion or attempted motion between two surfaces in contact." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **static** and **kinetic friction**?", answer: "Static friction prevents an object from starting to move, while kinetic friction acts on a moving object." },
    { question: "How does the force of friction depend on the normal force?", answer: "Friction is directly proportional to the normal force ($$f = \\mu N$$)." },
    { question: "In a horizontal push, if friction is the only opposing force, what is the net force?", answer: "$$F_{net} = F_{push} - F_{friction}$$" },
    { question: "When an object is in free fall, what is its net force (ignoring air resistance)?", answer: "$$F_{net} = mg$$ (its weight)." },
    { question: "What is the acceleration of a falling object when it reaches terminal velocity?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "Why is the normal force on a box on a horizontal surface equal to its weight?", answer: "Because there is no vertical acceleration, the upward normal force must balance the downward gravitational force." },
    { question: "What is the force of gravity on a $$10\\text{ kg}$$ object on Earth?", answer: "$$W = mg = (10)(9.8) = 98\\text{ N}$$." },
    { question: "When you push on a wall, what is the reaction force?", answer: "The wall pushing back on you with an equal and opposite force." },
    { question: "Do action-reaction pairs act on the same object?", answer: "No, they act on different objects." },
    { question: "Why does an object accelerate if the action-reaction forces are equal and opposite?", answer: "Because the forces in the pair act on *different* objects. The acceleration of an object depends on the net force *on that object*." },
    { question: "An elevator is moving up at a constant velocity. What is the net force on the elevator?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "An elevator is accelerating upward. How does the tension in the cable compare to the elevator's weight?", answer: "The tension is greater than the weight." },
    { question: "An elevator is accelerating downward. How does the tension in the cable compare to the elevator's weight?", answer: "The tension is less than the weight." },
    { question: "A person in an accelerating elevator feels a different apparent weight. What is this 'apparent weight'?", answer: "The normal force acting on the person." },
    { question: "If a rocket pushes hot gas downward, what is the reaction force?", answer: "The gas pushing the rocket upward (thrust)." },
    { question: "What is the formula relating friction, the coefficient of friction, and the normal force?", answer: "$$f = \\mu N$$" },
    { question: "What is a **coefficient of friction**?", answer: "A dimensionless number representing the ratio of the friction force to the normal force between two surfaces." },
    { question: "Why is it often harder to start pushing an object than to keep it moving?", answer: "Because the coefficient of static friction is usually greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction." },
    { question: "An object is pulled at a constant velocity. What can you say about the applied force and the friction force?", answer: "They are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction." },
    { question: "If an object is pushed with a force and it accelerates, what is the net force?", answer: "$$F_{net} = F_{push} - F_{friction}$$" },
    { question: "What is the difference between an object's weight on Earth and its weight on the Moon?", answer: "Its weight will be less on the Moon due to the weaker gravitational pull, but its mass will remain the same." },
    { question: "What is a **newton** defined as?", answer: "$$1\\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}^2$$" },
    { question: "A rope is pulled by two people with equal and opposite forces. What is the tension in the rope?", answer: "The tension is equal to the force exerted by one person." },
    { question: "When a car skids to a stop, which type of friction is acting on it?", answer: "Kinetic friction." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of drawing a free-body diagram?", answer: "To visualize all the forces on a single object to help calculate the net force and acceleration." },
    { question: "What is the normal force on a book sitting on a table in an elevator accelerating upwards?", answer: "Greater than the book's weight ($$N = mg + ma$$)." }
