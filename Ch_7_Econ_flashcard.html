  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the **demand for labour**?", answer: "The number of workers that firms are willing and able to hire at a given wage rate." },
    { question: "What is the **supply of labour**?", answer: "The number of workers willing and able to work at a given wage rate." },
    { question: "What is the **equilibrium wage rate**?", answer: "The wage at which the quantity of labour demanded equals the quantity of labour supplied." },
    { question: "What are the key determinants of labour **demand**?", answer: "The price of the firm's product, the productivity of workers, and the cost of other inputs." },
    { question: "What are the key determinants of labour **supply**?", answer: "The wage rate, non-monetary benefits of a job, workers' preferences for leisure, and the size of the working-age population." },
    { question: "What is a **trade union**?", answer: "An organization that acts as a collective bargaining agent for its members to improve working conditions, wages, and benefits." },
    { question: "How can a union influence wages?", answer: "By using its bargaining power to negotiate higher wages than the equilibrium wage rate." },
    { question: "What is the **minimum wage**?", answer: "A government-mandated price floor on the wage rate, setting the lowest hourly wage that an employer can legally pay workers." },
    { question: "What is the potential negative effect of a minimum wage increase?", answer: "It can lead to a surplus of labour, causing unemployment, particularly for low-skilled workers." },
    { question: "What is **human capital**?", answer: "The knowledge, skills, and experience that an individual possesses, which can be used to produce economic value." },
    { question: "How does human capital affect wages?", answer: "Workers with higher levels of human capital are generally more productive and can command higher wages." },
    { question: "What is a **monopsony** in the labour market?", answer: "A market structure where there is a single buyer of labour (a single employer) who has significant power to influence the wage rate." },
    { question: "How does a monopsony determine wages?", answer: "It hires fewer workers and pays a lower wage than a competitive labour market would." },
    { question: "What is **derived demand**?", answer: "The demand for a factor of production, like labour, which is derived from the demand for the goods or services that the factor helps produce." },
    { question: "How does a labour market's elasticity of demand affect a union's bargaining power?", answer: "If labour demand is inelastic, a union has more power to raise wages with little impact on employment." },
    { question: "What does a backward-bending labour supply curve illustrate?", answer: "That at very high wages, workers may choose to work fewer hours, as the higher income allows them to 'purchase' more leisure time." },
    { question: "What is the **wage-price spiral**?", answer: "A situation where rising wages lead to increased prices, which in turn leads to demands for even higher wages." },
    { question: "What is **wage discrimination**?", answer: "Paying different wages to different workers for the same job, often based on factors like gender, race, or age, which is illegal in many places." },
    { question: "What is a **living wage**?", answer: "A wage that is high enough to maintain a normal standard of living." },
    { question: "What is the **substitution effect** of a wage increase?", answer: "As wages rise, the opportunity cost of leisure increases, so a worker may choose to substitute more work for leisure." }
