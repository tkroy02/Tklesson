    // ========================
    {
        q: "Which best illustrates the concept of emergent properties in biology?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "<b>Emergent properties</b> are novel characteristics that arise at one level of biological organization (like a whole organ) that were not present at the simpler level (like an individual cell). Coordinated pumping of the heart is a complex function that emerges from the synchronized activity of billions of muscle cells, blood vessels, and nervous tissue working together."
    },
    {
        q: "Which experimental result would most directly support the claim that energy flows but matter cycles in an ecosystem?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "Energy flows through an ecosystem and is ultimately lost as <b>heat</b>. Measuring <b>heat loss</b> is the most direct way to support the 'energy flows' part of the claim. Matter (like Carbon, Oxygen, and Water) is <b>cycled</b> and conserved within the system."
    },
    {
        q: "A newly discovered extremophile thrives at 90°C in acidic volcanic pools. Which adaptation is most likely essential for survival?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "High temperatures (90°C) cause proteins to denature (unfold). Increased <b>ionic bonds</b> (salt bridges) and <b>disulfide bridges</b> (strong covalent bonds) provide the extra stability and rigidity needed to maintain the protein's functional 3D structure at extreme heat."
    },
    {
        q: "How could a researcher distinguish whether a trait difference between two related species is due to adaptation rather than phenotypic plasticity?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "<b>Adaptation</b> is a result of evolution (genetic change), while <b>phenotypic plasticity</b> is an individual's non-genetic response to the environment. Comparing allele frequency shifts across generations under controlled (identical) conditions is the only way to confirm a change in the underlying genetic basis, which defines adaptation."
    },
    {
        q: "Which physiological process is an example of negative feedback?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "<b>Negative feedback</b> works to reduce or eliminate the original stimulus. Sweating occurs when body temperature is high, and the evaporation of sweat cools the body, thereby reducing the original high temperature stimulus. Childbirth and platelet aggregation (Options A and B) are examples of positive feedback."
    },
    {
        q: "After a hurricane, a lizard population shows a sudden shift in allele frequencies unrelated to fitness. This is most consistent with:",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "A sudden, random, non-selective event (like a hurricane dramatically reducing population size) that causes a change in allele frequency is known as the <b>bottleneck effect</b>, a specific type of <b>genetic drift</b>."
    },
    {
        q: "Mutations that shorten intestinal microvilli would most directly impair:",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "Microvilli are tiny projections on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. Their primary function is to vastly <b>increase the surface area</b> available for the absorption of digested nutrients. Shortening them directly reduces the area available for this function."
    },
    {
        q: "Which null hypothesis would be appropriate for testing whether a trait is adaptive?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "The <b>null hypothesis</b> is the default assumption that there is no relationship or no effect. If a trait is <b>not adaptive</b>, its frequency will not be acted upon by natural selection and should, therefore, remain constant or change only due to random chance (drift)."
    },
    {
        q: "A lab models emergent behavior by increasing the size of neuronal networks. Which prediction matches emergent property expectations?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "Emergent properties are non-linear; complexity arises <b>disproportionately</b> or exponentially as the number of interacting parts and connections increases. The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts."
    },
    {
        q: "Which molecular evidence best reconciles unity and diversity in biology?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "All life shares <b>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)</b> because ribosomes are essential for protein synthesis (<b>unity</b>). However, differences in the rRNA sequences are used to define the major <b>domains</b> of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya), demonstrating <b>diversity</b>."
    },
    // ========================
    // Chapter 2: Carbohydrates & Nucleic Acids (Q11–Q20)
    // ========================
    {
        q: "Which change would most directly alter starch into a molecule structurally similar to cellulose?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "Starch is composed of α-glucose monomers linked by <b>α-1,4 glycosidic linkages</b>. Cellulose is also composed of glucose but linked by <b>β-1,4 linkages</b>. This small structural change results in vastly different shapes and digestibility (starch is easily digestible; cellulose is not)."
    },
    {
        q: "Which test best distinguishes cellulose from glycogen?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "The <b>Iodine test</b> (Lugol's solution) tests for the presence of tightly coiled helical polysaccharides. <b>Glycogen</b> and <b>starch</b> form these tight coils and turn blue-black/brown. <b>Cellulose</b> is an uncoiled, linear polymer and does not give a positive result."
    },
    {
        q: "Which is an accurate structural-function relationship of carbohydrates?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "<b>Glycogen</b> is the animal energy storage molecule. It is <b>highly branched</b> (via α-1,6 linkages) which creates many exposed ends where glucose can be rapidly cleaved off by enzymes during sudden high-energy demand."
    },
    {
        q: "A point mutation changes UAU → UAC in mRNA. Why might this 'silent' mutation still affect protein function?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "Both UAU and UAC code for the same amino acid (phenylalanine), so the resulting protein sequence is unchanged (<b>silent</b>). However, <b>codon bias</b> means UAU may be rare, slowing down the ribosome and causing translational stalling, which can lead to inefficient translation or protein misfolding."
    },
    {
        q: "Which outcome would you expect if you labeled nucleotides with radioisotopes in dividing cells?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "In a dividing cell, both DNA and RNA synthesis occur. However, <b>RNA incorporates more label</b> because it is constantly being <b>transcribed, degraded, and re-transcribed</b> (high turnover), whereas DNA is only replicated once per cell cycle."
    },
    {
        q: "DNA methylation in promoter regions most often results in:",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "<b>Methylation</b> is an epigenetic mechanism where methyl groups are added to DNA bases, typically Cytosine. When this occurs in the <b>promoter region</b>, it physically blocks or hinders the binding of <b>transcription factors</b>, leading to <b>gene silencing</b>."
    },
    {
        q: "Two genes encode identical proteins, but one uses rare codons. Likely consequence?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "Similar to Q14, the use of <b>rare codons</b> slows down the ribosome, as the cell must wait longer for the matching rare tRNA to arrive. This slower, less efficient translation process often results in the production of <b>fewer protein molecules</b> and/or improper folding."
    },
    {
        q: "Why is RNA more chemically reactive than DNA?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "RNA has a <b>hydroxyl group (-OH) on the 2' carbon</b> of its ribose sugar. This group makes RNA susceptible to attack by water (hydrolysis), making it much less chemically stable and more reactive than DNA, which lacks this oxygen atom (deoxyribose)."
    },
    {
        q: "A plasmid with both bacterial and eukaryotic origins of replication is placed in bacteria. Likely result?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "The <b>bacterial origin of replication</b> will be recognized by the bacterial replication machinery, allowing the plasmid to replicate stably. The <b>eukaryotic origin</b> will be ignored because the bacterial cell lacks the specific proteins required to initiate replication from that sequence."
    },
    {
        q: "Which best explains how RNA can act both as information and as a catalyst?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "RNA's single strand allows it to fold into complex 3D shapes stabilized by internal <b>secondary structures</b> (like hairpins and loops). These structures create binding pockets that can act as <b>catalytic sites</b> (like those found in ribozymes and the ribosome), allowing it to catalyze reactions while the primary sequence still holds genetic <b>information</b>."
    },
    // ========================
    // Chapter 3: Proteins, Fats, Enzymes (Q21–Q30)
    // ========================
    {
        q: "Which change is most likely to denature a protein irreversibly?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "High concentrations of <b>urea</b> or similar denaturing agents (like guanidinium chloride) disrupt the non-covalent interactions (like hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions) that stabilize the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. If the conditions are extreme enough, the protein may unfold completely and be unable to refold correctly, leading to <b>irreversible denaturation</b>."
    },
    {
        q: "Which feature best explains why triglycerides store more energy than polysaccharides?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "Energy is released when reduced carbon bonds are oxidized. Fatty acids contain long chains of pure <b>C-H bonds</b> (highly reduced) and <b>fewer oxygen atoms</b> than carbohydrates (like glucose, which has 6 oxygen atoms). This high degree of reduction means they yield significantly more energy per gram when oxidized during cellular respiration."
    },
    {
        q: "If a protein has multiple polypeptide chains, disruption of which level of structure separates them?",
        answer: "D",
        explanation: "The <b>quaternary structure</b> is the level of protein organization that involves the association of two or more separate polypeptide chains (subunits) into a functional protein complex (like hemoglobin). Disrupting this level separates the individual subunits."
    },
    {
        q: "Sickle-cell hemoglobin differs from normal hemoglobin because:",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "Sickle-cell anemia is caused by a <b>single base-pair substitution</b> (point mutation) in the β-globin gene, which results in a <b>single amino acid substitution</b> (Glutamic acid → Valine). This change alters the secondary and tertiary structure, causing hemoglobin to aggregate into fibers."
    },
    {
        q: "Which observation best supports the induced-fit model of enzyme activity?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "The <b>induced-fit model</b> states that the enzyme is flexible and changes its shape (conformation) slightly to achieve a tighter fit when the substrate binds. Option A directly describes this event."
    },
    {
        q: "Competitive inhibition can be overcome by:",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "A <b>competitive inhibitor</b> mimics the substrate and binds to the active site. Increasing the <b>substrate concentration</b> overwhelms the inhibitor, making it statistically more likely that a substrate molecule will bind to the active site, effectively reversing the inhibition."
    },
    {
        q: "Which property of phospholipids is most critical for membrane self-assembly?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "The <b>amphipathic</b> (having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts) nature of phospholipids is the critical feature. When placed in water, the hydrophobic tails spontaneously cluster inward, and the hydrophilic heads face the water, forming the bilayer driven by the second law of thermodynamics."
    },
    {
        q: "An enzyme shows maximal activity at pH 2. Where is this enzyme most likely found?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "The <b>stomach lumen</b> is the only location on the list with a highly acidic environment (pH 1.5-3.5) necessary for an enzyme like <b>pepsin</b> to function optimally. Most intracellular and other extracellular enzymes (cytosol, small intestine) function optimally near neutral pH (6.5-8.0)."
    },
    {
        q: "Why are unsaturated fats typically liquid at room temperature?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "<b>Unsaturated fats</b> contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, which introduce a <b>kink or bend</b> in the hydrocarbon tail. These kinks prevent the molecules from packing tightly together, resulting in a lower melting point and a liquid state at room temperature (e.g., oils)."
    },
    {
        q: "Which result supports the claim that enzymes lower activation energy but do not alter ΔG?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "Enzymes increase the <b>rate</b> of a reaction by lowering the <b>activation energy</b> but do <b>not change the overall free energy change (ΔG)</b> or the <b>equilibrium</b> position. Therefore, the same amount of product is formed, but it is formed much faster."
    },
    // ========================
    // Chapter 4: Cell Theory & Structure (Q31–Q40)
    // ========================
    {
        q: "Which experimental result most strongly supports the endosymbiotic theory for mitochondria?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "The <b>endosymbiotic theory</b> posits that mitochondria originated from an aerobic prokaryote engulfed by a host cell. The presence of <b>circular DNA</b> (like a bacterium) and <b>70S ribosomes</b> (like a bacterium, not the 80S found in the eukaryotic cytosol) provides the strongest molecular evidence for their prokaryotic ancestry."
    },
    {
        q: "Which organelle is most directly involved in glycoprotein modification and secretion?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "The <b>Golgi apparatus</b> (or Golgi complex) receives proteins and lipids from the ER, modifies them (especially adding or modifying carbohydrate groups to make <b>glycoproteins</b>), sorts them, and packages them into vesicles for <b>secretion</b> outside the cell."
    },
    {
        q: "Which cell structure would be abundant in pancreatic cells specialized for enzyme secretion?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes (which are proteins) into the small intestine. Protein synthesis for secretion occurs on <b>ribosomes</b> attached to the <b>Rough ER</b>. The Rough ER is the entry point for proteins destined for secretion or membrane insertion, making it highly abundant in secretory cells."
    },
    {
        q: "Which evidence distinguishes prokaryotic from eukaryotic cells?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "The most fundamental structural difference is the presence of a <b>nucleus</b> and <b>membrane-bound organelles</b> (like mitochondria, ER, Golgi) in eukaryotes, which are absent in prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea)."
    },
    {
        q: "Which prediction follows from the cell theory?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "A central tenet of the <b>cell theory</b> is that all cells come from pre-existing cells (<b>Omnis cellula e cellula</b>). Therefore, cells must arise through cell division."
    },
    {
        q: "A mutation prevents motor proteins from functioning. Which process is most directly affected?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "<b>Motor proteins</b> (like kinesin and dynein) use ATP to 'walk' along <b>microtubules</b> and actively transport vesicles, chromosomes, and organelles throughout the cell. Loss of motor function halts this critical directed movement."
    },
    {
        q: "Why are cells typically small?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "Cell size is constrained by the need for efficient exchange with the environment. Smaller cells have a <b>higher surface-area-to-volume ratio</b>, meaning the cell membrane (surface area) is large enough relative to the cell's interior volume to allow nutrients to enter and waste to exit fast enough to support the cell's metabolism."
    },
    {
        q: "Which finding best explains why lysosomal storage diseases cause cellular damage?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "<b>Lysosomes</b> contain hydrolytic enzymes necessary to break down cellular macromolecules (like old organelles, lipids, and carbohydrates). In lysosomal storage diseases, one of these enzymes is defective, causing the undigested macromolecules to accumulate and swell the lysosome, ultimately damaging the cell."
    },
    {
        q: "Which feature is unique to plant cells compared to animal cells?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "The <b>central vacuole</b> (used for turgor, storage, and waste breakdown) is a key feature of mature plant cells. Animal cells have small, transient vacuoles or vesicles, but not a large central vacuole. Both cell types have plasma membranes, mitochondria, and ribosomes."
    },
    {
        q: "Which organelle most directly contributes to apoptosis signaling?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "<b>Apoptosis</b> (programmed cell death) is often initiated by the <b>Mitochondrion</b>. In response to specific signals, the mitochondrion releases proteins (like cytochrome c) from its inner compartment into the cytosol, triggering the caspase cascade that executes the cell."
    },
    // ========================
    // Chapter 5: Membrane Transport (Q41–Q50)
    // ========================
    {
        q: "Which best describes the movement of oxygen into red blood cells?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "Oxygen (O₂) is a small, nonpolar molecule. It can pass directly through the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer <b>down its concentration gradient</b> without the assistance of a protein. This process is called <b>simple diffusion</b>."
    },
    {
        q: "A plant cell is placed in a hypotonic solution. Which outcome occurs?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "A <b>hypotonic</b> solution has a lower solute concentration than the cell. Water moves into the cell via osmosis. The rigid <b>cell wall</b> prevents the cell from bursting, allowing it to swell until the cell membrane is pushed firmly against the wall, making the cell firm or <b>turgid</b>."
    },
    {
        q: "Which is true of facilitated diffusion but not of active transport?",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "<b>Facilitated diffusion</b> is a form of passive transport, meaning it moves molecules <b>down the concentration gradient</b> and <b>does not require metabolic energy (ATP)</b>. Active transport moves molecules <i>against</i> the gradient and <i>does</i> require energy."
    },
    {
        q: "A sodium–potassium pump transports:",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "The Na⁺/K⁺ pump is an <b>electrogenic antiporter</b>. It pumps <b>3 Na⁺ ions out</b> of the cell and <b>2 K⁺ ions into</b> the cell for every molecule of ATP consumed. This creates both a chemical gradient and a voltage difference across the membrane."
    },
    {
        q: "Which scenario best illustrates secondary active transport?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "<b>Secondary active transport</b> (or co-transport) uses the energy stored in the gradient of one molecule (like the Na⁺ gradient built by the pump) to move a second molecule (like glucose) against its own gradient. The Na⁺/glucose symporter is the classic example."
    },
    {
        q: "Which occurs if an animal cell is placed in a hypertonic solution?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "A <b>hypertonic</b> solution has a higher solute concentration than the cell. Water moves out of the cell via osmosis, causing the animal cell to shrivel, a process called <b>crenation</b>."
    },
    {
        q: "Which explains why ions cannot easily cross lipid bilayers without transport proteins?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "Ions (like Na⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺) are electrically <b>charged</b>. The inner core of the lipid bilayer is composed of nonpolar, hydrophobic fatty acid tails. The high energetic cost of moving a charged particle through this nonpolar region prevents simple diffusion."
    },
    {
        q: "Which transport mechanism is used by white blood cells to engulf bacteria?",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: "<b>Phagocytosis</b> (literally 'cell eating') is the process by which a cell engulfs a large particle, like a bacterium, by extending pseudopods around it and packaging it into a large vacuole (phagosome)."

    {
        q: "If ATP production stops, which process would immediately cease?",
        answer: "D",
        explanation: "<b>Active pumping of ions</b> (like Na⁺/K⁺ pumps) requires direct energy from ATP hydrolysis. All forms of <b>passive transport</b> (diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis) rely only on gradients and would continue until those gradients are depleted."
    },
    {
        q: "Which outcome is expected if aquaporins are blocked in kidney cells?",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: "<b>Aquaporins</b> are channel proteins that allow for rapid, facilitated diffusion of water. In the kidneys, they are crucial for reabsorbing water from the filtrate back into the body. Blocking them would severely impair water reabsorption, leading to the <b>inability to concentrate urine</b> and excessive water loss."
