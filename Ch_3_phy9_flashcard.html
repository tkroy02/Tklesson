 const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **distance**?", answer: "The total length of the path an object travels." },
    { question: "What is **displacement**?", answer: "The change in an object's position, including the direction of the change." },
    { question: "Is distance a scalar or vector quantity?", answer: "Distance is a **scalar** quantity because it only has magnitude (size)." },
    { question: "Is displacement a scalar or vector quantity?", answer: "Displacement is a **vector** quantity because it has both magnitude and direction." },
    { question: "What is **speed**?", answer: "The rate at which an object covers distance." },
    { question: "What is **velocity**?", answer: "The rate at which an object changes its position, including the direction of motion." },
    { question: "Is speed a scalar or vector quantity?", answer: "Speed is a **scalar** quantity." },
    { question: "Is velocity a scalar or vector quantity?", answer: "Velocity is a **vector** quantity." },
    { question: "What is the formula for average speed?", answer: "$$Average Speed = \\frac{Total Distance}{Total Time}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for average velocity?", answer: "$$Average Velocity = \\frac{Displacement}{Total Time}$$" },
    { question: "What is **acceleration**?", answer: "The rate at which an object's velocity changes." },
    { question: "What are the three ways an object can accelerate?", answer: "By speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **speed** and **velocity**?", answer: "Meters per second (m/s)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **acceleration**?", answer: "Meters per second squared (m/s²)." },
    { question: "On a **position-time graph**, what does the slope of the line represent?", answer: "The object's **velocity**." },
    { question: "On a position-time graph, what does a straight, horizontal line mean?", answer: "The object is **at rest** (not moving)." },
    { question: "On a position-time graph, what does a straight line with a constant slope mean?", answer: "The object is moving at a **constant velocity**." },
    { question: "On a position-time graph, what does a curved line mean?", answer: "The object is **accelerating** (its velocity is changing)." },
    { question: "On a **velocity-time graph**, what does the slope of the line represent?", answer: "The object's **acceleration**." },
    { question: "On a velocity-time graph, what does a straight, horizontal line mean?", answer: "The object is moving at a **constant velocity** (zero acceleration)." },
    { question: "On a velocity-time graph, what does a positive slope mean?", answer: "The object is **speeding up** (positive acceleration)." },
    { question: "On a velocity-time graph, what does a negative slope mean?", answer: "The object is **slowing down** (negative acceleration or deceleration)." },
    { question: "On a velocity-time graph, what does the area under the curve represent?", answer: "The object's **displacement**." },
    { question: "What is the formula for average acceleration?", answer: "$$a = \\frac{v_f - v_i}{t}$$ (change in velocity divided by time)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between average speed and instantaneous speed?", answer: "Average speed is the total distance over the total time; instantaneous speed is the speed at a particular moment." },
    { question: "If a car travels 50 km and returns to its starting point, what is its total displacement?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "A runner takes 10 seconds to run 100 meters. What is their average speed?", answer: "10 m/s." },
    { question: "An object is moving at a constant velocity. What is its acceleration?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a scalar and a vector quantity?", answer: "A scalar has only magnitude; a vector has both magnitude and direction." },
    { question: "On a velocity-time graph, if the line crosses the x-axis, what does that mean?", answer: "The object has changed direction." },
    { question: "What is **uniform motion**?", answer: "Motion at a constant velocity (constant speed and direction)." },
    { question: "What is **non-uniform motion**?", answer: "Motion in which the velocity is changing (the object is accelerating)." },
    { question: "What is the slope of a line on a graph?", answer: "The steepness of the line, calculated as 'rise over run' or the change in the y-variable divided by the change in the x-variable." },
    { question: "What does a line with a steeper slope represent on a position-time graph?", answer: "A **faster velocity**." },
    { question: "What does a line with a steeper slope represent on a velocity-time graph?", answer: "A **greater acceleration**." },
    { question: "If an object's position-time graph is a straight line going downwards, what does that mean?", answer: "The object is moving at a constant velocity in the negative direction." },
    { question: "What is the term for negative acceleration?", answer: "Deceleration or slowing down." },
    { question: "If a car's speed is 50 mph, what can you say about its velocity?", answer: "You cannot determine its velocity because you do not know its direction." },
    { question: "In a velocity-time graph, what does a horizontal line above the x-axis represent?", answer: "A constant positive velocity." },
    { question: "How do you calculate the displacement from a velocity-time graph?", answer: "By finding the area of the shape under the curve." }
