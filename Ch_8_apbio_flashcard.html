  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **genetic engineering**?", answer: "The direct manipulation of genes for practical purposes." },
    { question: "What is **recombinant DNA**?", answer: "A DNA molecule formed by combining genetic material from two different sources." },
    { question: "What is a **plasmid**?", answer: "A small, circular DNA molecule in bacteria, often used as a vector for genetic engineering." },
    { question: "What is the function of **restriction enzymes**?", answer: "To cut DNA molecules at specific, short nucleotide sequences, creating 'sticky ends'." },
    { question: "What is the function of **DNA ligase**?", answer: "To join DNA fragments together by forming new phosphodiester bonds." },
    { question: "What is **gel electrophoresis**?", answer: "A technique used to separate DNA fragments by size by pushing them through a gel matrix with an electric current." },
    { question: "Why does DNA move toward the positive electrode in gel electrophoresis?", answer: "The phosphate groups in the DNA backbone give the molecule a negative charge, so it is attracted to the positive electrode." },
    { question: "What is **PCR**?", answer: "Polymerase Chain Reaction, a technique used to amplify a specific segment of DNA to produce millions of copies." },
    { question: "What are the three main steps of a single PCR cycle?", answer: "Denaturation, annealing, and extension." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of **denaturation** in PCR?", answer: "To heat the DNA sample to a high temperature to separate the double-stranded DNA into single strands." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of **annealing** in PCR?", answer: "To cool the sample to allow primers to bind to their complementary sequences on the single DNA strands." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of **extension** in PCR?", answer: "To allow a heat-stable DNA polymerase (like Taq polymerase) to synthesize new DNA strands." },
    { question: "What is the function of **Taq polymerase**?", answer: "A heat-stable DNA polymerase used in PCR that can withstand the high temperatures required for denaturation." },
    { question: "What does **CRISPR-Cas9** stand for?", answer: "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9." },
    { question: "What is the role of the **Cas9** protein in the CRISPR system?", answer: "It is a nuclease that acts as a pair of molecular scissors to precisely cut DNA at a specific location." },
    { question: "What is the role of the **guide RNA** in the CRISPR system?", answer: "It is a short RNA molecule that guides the Cas9 protein to the target DNA sequence to be cut." },
    { question: "What is **gene therapy**?", answer: "The process of introducing a new, healthy gene into an individual's cells to treat a genetic disorder." },
    { question: "What are **transgenic organisms**?", answer: "Organisms that have had foreign DNA (a gene from another species) introduced into their genome." },
    { question: "What are some common applications of biotechnology in agriculture?", answer: "Creating crops with increased nutritional value, resistance to pests or herbicides, or a longer shelf life." },
    { question: "What is a key ethical concern regarding human germline editing?", answer: "The changes would be heritable and passed down to future generations, with unknown long-term consequences." },
    { question: "How is gel electrophoresis used in forensics?", answer: "To create a 'DNA fingerprint' by comparing the unique band patterns of different DNA samples." },
    { question: "What is **gene cloning**?", answer: "The production of multiple, identical copies of a single gene." },
    { question: "What is the main purpose of a **DNA vector** in genetic engineering?", answer: "To carry a foreign gene into a host cell for cloning or expression." },
    { question: "What is a **DNA library**?", answer: "A collection of an organism's DNA fragments stored and replicated in vectors." },
    { question: "What are **sticky ends**?", answer: "The single-stranded overhangs created when DNA is cut by restriction enzymes; they allow for the joining of DNA fragments." },
    { question: "What is **gene editing**?", answer: "A type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, or replaced at a specific location in the genome." },
    { question: "What is the difference between somatic gene therapy and germline gene therapy?", answer: "Somatic therapy affects only body cells and is not heritable; germline therapy affects reproductive cells and is heritable." },
    { question: "Why is CRISPR considered a more efficient and precise gene editing tool than older methods?", answer: "It can be programmed to target a specific DNA sequence with high accuracy, whereas older methods were less specific." },
    { question: "What is a common ethical concern about genetically modified organisms (GMOs)?", answer: "They may lead to a decrease in biodiversity or have unforeseen impacts on the ecosystem." },
    { question: "What is **bioinformatics**?", answer: "The use of computational tools to analyze and interpret large biological data sets, such as DNA sequences." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of a **DNA probe**?", answer: "A labeled molecule (often radioactive or fluorescent) used to find a specific nucleotide sequence." },
    { question: "What is **transformation** in genetic engineering?", answer: "The uptake of foreign DNA from the surrounding environment by a cell." },
    { question: "What is the role of a **reporter gene** in genetic engineering?", answer: "A gene that is attached to a gene of interest and is used to determine if the host cell has successfully taken up the foreign DNA (e.g., an antibiotic resistance gene)." },
    { question: "What is **cloning**?", answer: "The production of a genetically identical individual from a single somatic cell of an organism." },
    { question: "What is a key ethical consideration in human reproductive cloning?", answer: "The potential for human rights violations, psychological harm to the clone, and a lack of genetic diversity." },
    { question: "What is **DNA sequencing**?", answer: "The process of determining the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule." },
    { question: "How does PCR differ from natural DNA replication?", answer: "PCR is done in vitro (in a lab) and uses cycles of heating and cooling, while natural replication occurs in a living cell and requires many more enzymes." },
    { question: "How does gel electrophoresis relate to DNA fingerprinting?", answer: "Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size, and the resulting banding pattern is a unique DNA fingerprint for an individual." },
    { question: "What is a **DNA fingerprint**?", answer: "An individual's unique banding pattern of DNA fragments, often used in forensics and paternity testing." },
    { question: "What is a **GMO**?", answer: "A genetically modified organism, one whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques." }
