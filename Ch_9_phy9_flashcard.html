  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **electricity**?", answer: "The flow of electric charge, typically carried by electrons." },
    { question: "What are the two types of electric charge?", answer: "Positive (+) and negative (-)." },
    { question: "What is **static electricity**?", answer: "An imbalance of electric charges on the surface of a material, often caused by friction." },
    { question: "What is **current electricity**?", answer: "The continuous flow of electric charge through a conductor." },
    { question: "What is an **electric circuit**?", answer: "A complete, closed path through which electric charges can flow." },
    { question: "What is **voltage**?", answer: "The electric potential energy difference per unit charge between two points in a circuit. It's the 'push' that moves the electrons." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for voltage?", answer: "The Volt (V)." },
    { question: "What is **electric current**?", answer: "The rate of flow of electric charge." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for electric current?", answer: "The Ampere (A)." },
    { question: "What is **resistance**?", answer: "The opposition to the flow of electric current." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for resistance?", answer: "The Ohm (Ω)." },
    { question: "What is **Ohm's Law**?", answer: "The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit. " },
    { question: "What is the formula for Ohm's Law?", answer: "V = IR (Voltage = Current x Resistance)." },
    { question: "A circuit has a voltage of 12 V and a resistance of 3 Ω. What is the current?", answer: "4 A (I = V / R = 12 / 3 = 4)." },
    { question: "A circuit has a current of 2 A and a resistance of 6 Ω. What is the voltage?", answer: "12 V (V = IR = 2 x 6 = 12)." },
    { question: "What is the resistance of a circuit with a voltage of 9 V and a current of 3 A?", answer: "3 Ω (R = V / I = 9 / 3 = 3)." },
    { question: "What is a **series circuit**?", answer: "A circuit in which components are connected end-to-end, so there is only one path for the current to flow." },
    { question: "What is a **parallel circuit**?", answer: "A circuit in which components are connected across the same two points, creating multiple paths for the current to flow." },
    { question: "What happens if one bulb goes out in a series circuit?", answer: "All the other bulbs will also go out, because the circuit is broken." },
    { question: "What happens if one bulb goes out in a parallel circuit?", answer: "The other bulbs will stay on, because the current can still flow through the other paths." },
    { question: "What is a **conductor**?", answer: "A material that allows electric current to flow easily through it (e.g., copper, silver)." },
    { question: "What is an **insulator**?", answer: "A material that does not allow electric current to flow easily through it (e.g., plastic, rubber)." },
    { question: "Why are electrical wires often covered in rubber or plastic?", answer: "Because these materials are insulators that prevent electric shock and short circuits." },
    { question: "What is a **short circuit**?", answer: "An unintended, low-resistance path for electric current to flow, which can cause a large current and generate a lot of heat." },
    { question: "What is a **fuse** or a **circuit breaker**?", answer: "Safety devices that stop the flow of electric current if it becomes too high." },
    { question: "What is the difference between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC)?", answer: "DC flows in only one direction, while AC periodically reverses direction." },
    { question: "What is a **battery**?", answer: "A device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy to produce a direct current (DC)." },
    { question: "What is the role of a **resistor** in a circuit?", answer: "To reduce the flow of current and control the amount of energy that is converted into heat or light." },
    { question: "In a series circuit, how is the total resistance calculated?", answer: "By adding the individual resistances (R_total = R₁ + R₂ + ...)." },
    { question: "In a parallel circuit, how is the total resistance calculated?", answer: "By using the reciprocal formula (1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ...)." },
    { question: "How does the total voltage in a series circuit relate to the voltage drops across each resistor?", answer: "The total voltage is the sum of the individual voltage drops." },
    { question: "In a parallel circuit, how does the voltage across each component relate?", answer: "The voltage is the same across all components." },
    { question: "A current of 0.5 A flows through a 20 Ω resistor. What is the voltage across the resistor?", answer: "10 V (V = 0.5 x 20 = 10)." },
    { question: "What is **power** in an electrical circuit?", answer: "The rate at which electrical energy is converted into another form, such as heat or light." },
    { question: "What is the formula for electrical power?", answer: "P = IV (Power = Current x Voltage)." },
    { question: "A lightbulb is rated at 60 W and operates on a 120 V circuit. What is the current flowing through it?", answer: "0.5 A (I = P / V = 60 / 120 = 0.5)." },
    { question: "What does the symbol 'Ω' stand for?", answer: "The Ohm, the unit of resistance." },
    { question: "Why do we use alternating current (AC) in our homes?", answer: "It is more efficient to transmit over long distances." },
    { question: "What is an **ammeter** used for?", answer: "To measure electric current." },
    { question: "What is a **voltmeter** used for?", answer: "To measure voltage." }
