  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is a **force**?", answer: "A push or a pull on an object." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for force?", answer: "The Newton (N)." },
    { question: "What is a **vector quantity**?", answer: "A quantity that has both magnitude and direction." },
    { question: "What is **net force**?", answer: "The overall force acting on an object when all individual forces are combined." },
    { question: "What does it mean for forces to be **balanced**?", answer: "The net force is zero, resulting in no change in the object's motion." },
    { question: "What does it mean for forces to be **unbalanced**?", answer: "The net force is greater than zero, causing the object to accelerate." },
    { question: "What is **Newton's First Law**?", answer: "An object in motion stays in motion and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force." },
    { question: "What is **inertia**?", answer: "The tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion." },
    { question: "What does an object's **mass** tell you about its inertia?", answer: "The more mass an object has, the more inertia it has and the more it resists a change in motion." },
    { question: "What is **Newton's Second Law**?", answer: "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass ($F=ma$)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for Newton's Second Law?", answer: "$$F = ma$$ (Force = mass x acceleration)." },
    { question: "What is the force required to accelerate a 5 kg object at 2 m/s²?", answer: "10 Newtons ($F = 5 \\times 2 = 10$ N)." },
    { question: "If a net force of 20 N is applied to a 4 kg object, what is its acceleration?", answer: "5 m/s² ($a = 20 / 4 = 5$ m/s²)." },
    { question: "What is **Newton's Third Law**?", answer: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." },
    { question: "When a rocket pushes gas downward, what is the reaction force?", answer: "The gas pushes the rocket upward, causing it to launch." },
    { question: "What is a **contact force**?", answer: "A force that acts on an object by direct physical contact (e.g., friction, a push)." },
    { question: "What is a **non-contact force**?", answer: "A force that acts on an object at a distance without touching it (e.g., gravity, magnetism)." },
    { question: "What is **gravity**?", answer: "A non-contact force that pulls objects toward each other, especially toward the center of a planet." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **mass** and **weight**?", answer: "Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass." },
    { question: "What is the formula for calculating an object's weight on Earth?", answer: "$$Weight = mass \\times g$$ (where g is the acceleration due to gravity, approx. 9.8 m/s²)." },
    { question: "What is **friction**?", answer: "A force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **static friction** and **kinetic friction**?", answer: "Static friction prevents an object from starting to move; kinetic friction acts on a moving object." },
    { question: "Why is a car seat belt an example of Newton's First Law?", answer: "When the car stops, your body continues to move forward due to its inertia until the seat belt applies an unbalanced force to stop you." },
    { question: "If you push a wall, why does the wall not move?", answer: "The wall pushes back on you with an equal and opposite force, and its mass is too large for your force to cause a noticeable acceleration." },
    { question: "What is **air resistance**?", answer: "A type of friction or drag force that acts on objects moving through the air." },
    { question: "What is **terminal velocity**?", answer: "The constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium (like air) prevents further acceleration." },
    { question: "What is a **free-body diagram**?", answer: "A diagram showing all the forces acting on an object, represented as arrows." },
    { question: "What is the **normal force**?", answer: "The support force exerted upon an object that is in contact with another stable object, acting perpendicular to the surface." },
    { question: "What is **thrust**?", answer: "The force that propels a rocket or other vehicle forward, often produced by pushing a gas in the opposite direction." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between force and acceleration?", answer: "They are directly proportional; if you increase the force, you increase the acceleration." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between mass and acceleration?", answer: "They are inversely proportional; if you increase the mass, you decrease the acceleration (for the same force)." },
    { question: "Why does a bowling ball require more force to accelerate than a tennis ball?", answer: "Because the bowling ball has a greater mass, and thus greater inertia." },
    { question: "If a force of 10 N pushes an object with a mass of 2 kg, what is the object's acceleration?", answer: "5 m/s²." },
    { question: "What is the force required to accelerate a 70 kg person at 3 m/s²?", answer: "210 N." },
    { question: "In a tug-of-war, if the net force is zero, what can you say about the teams?", answer: "They are pulling with equal and opposite forces, so neither team is accelerating." },
    { question: "How does Newton's Third Law apply to walking?", answer: "Your feet push on the ground (action force), and the ground pushes back on your feet (reaction force) to propel you forward." },
    { question: "A force of 15 N pushes an object. If the object's mass is 3 kg, what is its acceleration?", answer: "5 m/s²." },
    { question: "What is the formula for weight?", answer: "$$W = mg$$." },
    { question: "What is the force of gravity on a 5 kg object on Earth?", answer: "Approximately 49 N ($5 \\times 9.8 = 49$)."},
    { question: "What is the difference between a push and a pull?", answer: "A push is a force that moves an object away from you, while a pull is a force that moves an object toward you." }
