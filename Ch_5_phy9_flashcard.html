  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **work** in physics?", answer: "The transfer of energy that occurs when a force causes an object to move in the same direction as the force." },
    { question: "What is the formula for work?", answer: "Work = Force x distance x cos(θ)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **work**?", answer: "The Joule (J)." },
    { question: "If you push a wall with a force of 100 N but the wall doesn't move, how much work have you done?", answer: "Zero work, because there was no displacement." },
    { question: "What is **energy**?", answer: "The ability to do work or cause a change." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **energy**?", answer: "The Joule (J)." },
    { question: "What is **kinetic energy**?", answer: "The energy of motion." },
    { question: "What is the formula for kinetic energy?", answer: "KE = ½mv²." },
    { question: "A 2 kg object is moving at 3 m/s. What is its kinetic energy?", answer: "9 Joules (KE = 0.5 x 2 x 3² = 9 J)." },
    { question: "What is **potential energy**?", answer: "Stored energy due to an object's position or state." },
    { question: "What is **gravitational potential energy**?", answer: "The energy an object has due to its position above the ground." },
    { question: "What is the formula for gravitational potential energy?", answer: "PE = mgh." },
    { question: "A 5 kg ball is held 2 meters above the ground. What is its potential energy?", answer: "98 Joules (PE = 5 x 9.8 x 2 = 98 J)." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Conservation of Energy**?", answer: "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed from one form to another." },
    { question: "What is **mechanical energy**?", answer: "The sum of an object's kinetic energy and potential energy." },
    { question: "When a roller coaster car goes down a hill, what energy conversion is happening?", answer: "Gravitational potential energy is being converted into kinetic energy." },
    { question: "When a rubber band is stretched, what kind of energy is stored in it?", answer: "Elastic potential energy." },
    { question: "What is **power** in physics?", answer: "The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred." },
    { question: "What is the formula for power?", answer: "Power = Work / Time or P = E / t." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **power**?", answer: "The Watt (W)." },
    { question: "A person does 100 Joules of work in 5 seconds. What is their power?", answer: "20 Watts (P = 100 / 5 = 20 W)." },
    { question: "If you lift a 10 kg box 1 meter, how much work have you done?", answer: "98 Joules (W = Fd = (10 x 9.8) x 1 = 98 J)." },
    { question: "What is **efficiency**?", answer: "The ratio of useful energy output to the total energy input." },
    { question: "What is a common example of an energy transformation from chemical to kinetic energy?", answer: "A car engine using gasoline to move the car." },
    { question: "What is the difference between kinetic energy and thermal energy?", answer: "Kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object, while thermal energy is the internal kinetic energy of its particles." },
    { question: "When a car brakes, what happens to its kinetic energy?", answer: "It is converted into thermal energy (heat) due to friction." },
    { question: "What does it mean if an object has zero kinetic energy?", answer: "The object is not moving." },
    { question: "An object is lifted to a certain height. How does its potential energy change?", answer: "Its potential energy increases as its height increases." },
    { question: "A lightbulb uses 100 J of electrical energy and produces 20 J of light energy. What is its efficiency?", answer: "20% (Efficiency = (20 / 100) x 100% = 20%). "},
    { question: "What is a kilowatt-hour (kWh)?", answer: "A unit of energy equal to 1000 Watts of power expended for one hour." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between power, force, and velocity?", answer: "P = Fv (Power equals force times velocity)." },
    { question: "If a person runs up stairs, are they doing work?", answer: "Yes, they are applying a force to lift their body against gravity, causing a displacement." },
    { question: "An object is at rest. What is its kinetic energy?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "A ball is thrown straight up into the air. At its highest point, what is its kinetic energy?", answer: "Zero (for an instant before it begins to fall)." },
    { question: "A ball is thrown straight up. At its highest point, what is its potential energy?", answer: "Maximum." },
    { question: "An elevator lifts a 500 kg object 10 meters in 20 seconds. How much power is used?", answer: "2450 Watts (W = (500 x 9.8) x 10 = 49000 J. P = 49000 / 20 = 2450 W)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a high-power and a low-power device?", answer: "A high-power device does a lot of work in a short amount of time; a low-power device does the same amount of work over a longer time." },
    { question: "Can work be negative?", answer: "Yes, when a force is applied in the direction opposite to the displacement." },
    { question: "What is the definition of a Joule?", answer: "The work done when a force of one Newton moves an object one meter." },
    { question: "What is an energy transformation?", answer: "The process of changing energy from one form to another." }
