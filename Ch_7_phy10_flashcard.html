  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **sound**?", answer: "A mechanical wave that is produced by vibrations and requires a medium to travel." },
    { question: "What type of wave is sound?", answer: "A longitudinal wave (particles vibrate parallel to the direction of energy transfer)." },
    { question: "How does the speed of sound vary in different media?", answer: "It is fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases." },
    { question: "What determines the **pitch** of a sound?", answer: "The frequency of the sound wave." },
    { question: "What determines the **loudness** of a sound?", answer: "The amplitude of the sound wave." },
    { question: "What is the unit for the intensity level of sound?", answer: "The decibel (dB)." },
    { question: "What is an **echo**?", answer: "A distinct sound produced by the reflection of sound waves." },
    { question: "What is **reverberation**?", answer: "A prolonged sound caused by multiple, closely spaced reflections." },
    { question: "What is the **Doppler effect**?", answer: "The apparent change in frequency of a wave due to the relative motion of the source and observer." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the speed of sound?", answer: "$$v = f\\lambda$$" },
    { question: "What is **infrasound**?", answer: "Sound waves with a frequency below the human hearing range ($$< 20\\text{ Hz}$$)." },
    { question: "What is **ultrasound**?", answer: "Sound waves with a frequency above the human hearing range ($$> 20,000\\text{ Hz}$$)." },
    { question: "What is the typical range of human hearing?", answer: "$$20\\text{ Hz to } 20,000\\text{ Hz}$$." },
    { question: "What is the **principle of superposition**?", answer: "When two or more waves overlap, the resulting displacement is the sum of the individual displacements." },
    { question: "What is **constructive interference** of sound waves?", answer: "When two waves overlap and their compressions and rarefactions align, resulting in a louder sound." },
    { question: "What is **destructive interference** of sound waves?", answer: "When a compression of one wave overlaps with a rarefaction of another, resulting in a quieter or no sound." },
    { question: "What are **beats**?", answer: "The periodic variation in loudness caused by the interference of two sound waves with slightly different frequencies." },
    { question: "What is the formula for beat frequency?", answer: "$$f_{beat} = |f_1 - f_2|$$" },
    { question: "What is **resonance**?", answer: "The increase in amplitude of a vibration when the frequency of an applied force matches the natural frequency of the object." },
    { question: "How does the temperature of air affect the speed of sound?", answer: "The speed of sound increases as the air temperature increases." },
    { question: "How does humidity affect the speed of sound in air?", answer: "It increases slightly as humidity increases." },
    { question: "Why can't sound travel in a vacuum?", answer: "Because it is a mechanical wave and requires a medium to transmit energy." },
    { question: "What is the **quality** or **timbre** of a sound?", answer: "The property that distinguishes two sounds with the same pitch and loudness, often due to a combination of frequencies." },
    { question: "What is a **sound barrier**?", answer: "The high-drag region of air resistance encountered by an object as it approaches the speed of sound." },
    { question: "What is the speed of sound in dry air at $$20°\text{C}$$?", answer: "$$343\text{ m/s}$$." },
    { question: "How does the human ear process sound?", answer: "Sound waves are collected by the outer ear and cause the eardrum to vibrate, which then transmits the vibrations to the inner ear." },
    { question: "What part of the ear helps with balance?", answer: "The semicircular canals." },
    { question: "What is a **compression** in a sound wave?", answer: "A region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are crowded together." },
    { question: "What is a **rarefaction** in a sound wave?", answer: "A region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are spread apart." },
    { question: "What is **acoustics**?", answer: "The science that deals with the production, control, transmission, reception, and effects of sound." },
    { question: "How does a musical instrument produce sound?", answer: "By creating a vibration that propagates as a sound wave." },
    { question: "What is the effect of moving the sound source towards an observer?", answer: "The observer perceives a higher pitch due to the Doppler effect." },
    { question: "What is the effect of moving the sound source away from an observer?", answer: "The observer perceives a lower pitch due to the Doppler effect." },
    { question: "What is the inverse square law of sound intensity?", answer: "Sound intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source." },
    { question: "What are **overtones**?", answer: "Frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental frequency of a vibrating object." },
    { question: "What is the **fundamental frequency**?", answer: "The lowest frequency of a standing wave that can be produced by a vibrating object." },
    { question: "What is a **shock wave**?", answer: "A high-pressure wave produced by an object traveling faster than the speed of sound." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the period and pitch of a sound?", answer: "The period is the inverse of the frequency, so a shorter period means a higher pitch." },
    { question: "Can sound waves be polarized?", answer: "No, because they are longitudinal waves." },
    { question: "What is the key difference between an echo and reverberation?", answer: "An echo is a single, clear reflection, while reverberation is a mix of many overlapping reflections." }
