    { question: "What is **reflection**?", answer: "The bouncing of light off a surface." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Reflection**?", answer: "The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection ($$\\theta_i = \\theta_r$$)." },
    { question: "What is **refraction**?", answer: "The bending of light as it passes from one medium to another." },
    { question: "What is **Snell's Law**?", answer: "$$n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2$$" },
    { question: "What is a **real image**?", answer: "An image formed where light rays actually converge, and it can be projected onto a screen." },
    { question: "What is a **virtual image**?", answer: "An image formed where light rays appear to diverge from, but do not actually converge. It cannot be projected." },
    { question: "What is a **plane mirror**?", answer: "A flat mirror that produces a virtual, upright, and same-size image." },
    { question: "What is a **concave mirror**?", answer: "A mirror that curves inward and can form both real and virtual images." },
    { question: "What is a **convex mirror**?", answer: "A mirror that curves outward and always forms a virtual, upright, and smaller image." },
    { question: "What is the **focal point** of a mirror or lens?", answer: "The point where parallel light rays converge or appear to diverge from after reflection or refraction." },
    { question: "What is **dispersion**?", answer: "The separation of light into its component colors, as seen in a prism." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the speed of light in a vacuum?", answer: "$$c = \\lambda f$$" },
    { question: "What is the speed of light in a vacuum?", answer: "$$3.00 \\times 10^8\\text{ m/s}$$" },
    { question: "What is **total internal reflection**?", answer: "The complete reflection of a light ray at the boundary of two media when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle." },
    { question: "What is a **converging lens**?", answer: "A lens that is thicker in the middle and causes parallel light rays to converge to a focal point." },
    { question: "What is a **diverging lens**?", answer: "A lens that is thinner in the middle and causes parallel light rays to spread out." },
    { question: "What is the **thin lens equation**?", answer: "$$\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for magnification?", answer: "$$M = \\frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$" },
    { question: "How does light travel?", answer: "In straight lines, as an electromagnetic wave." },
    { question: "What color of light has the longest wavelength?", answer: "Red." },
    { question: "What color of light has the shortest wavelength?", answer: "Violet." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection?", answer: "They are equal ($$\\theta_i = \\theta_r$$)." },
    { question: "What is the **normal line**?", answer: "A line perpendicular to a surface at the point where a light ray strikes it." },
    { question: "What is the **index of refraction (n)**?", answer: "A measure of how much a medium slows down light." },
    { question: "When light enters a medium with a higher index of refraction, does it bend toward or away from the normal?", answer: "Toward the normal." },
    { question: "When light enters a medium with a lower index of refraction, does it bend toward or away from the normal?", answer: "Away from the normal." },
    { question: "What are the two types of mirrors?", answer: "Plane and spherical (concave and convex)." },
    { question: "What are the two types of lenses?", answer: "Converging and diverging." },
    { question: "What happens to the focal length of a concave mirror?", answer: "It is positive." },
    { question: "What happens to the focal length of a convex mirror?", answer: "It is negative." },
    { question: "What happens to the focal length of a converging lens?", answer: "It is positive." },
    { question: "What happens to the focal length of a diverging lens?", answer: "It is negative." },
    { question: "What is a **ray diagram**?", answer: "A drawing that uses a few representative light rays to determine the position and size of an image." },
    { question: "How does a magnifying glass work?", answer: "It is a converging lens that creates a virtual, magnified, and upright image." },
    { question: "What is the property of light that allows fiber optics to work?", answer: "Total internal reflection." },
    { question: "What is the primary characteristic of an image formed by a plane mirror?", answer: "It is virtual, upright, and laterally inverted (reversed)." },
    { question: "How is light different from sound?", answer: "Light is a transverse electromagnetic wave, while sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave." },
    { question: "What is **chromatic aberration**?", answer: "The failure of a lens to focus all colors of light to the same point." },
    { question: "What is **spherical aberration**?", answer: "The failure of a spherical mirror to focus all parallel light rays to a single point." },
    { question: "What is the primary function of a telescope?", answer: "To make distant objects appear closer by gathering more light and magnifying the image." }
