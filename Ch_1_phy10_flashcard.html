  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **kinematics**?", answer: "The branch of mechanics that describes motion without considering its causes (forces)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **scalar** and a **vector**?", answer: "A scalar has magnitude only (e.g., speed), while a vector has both magnitude and direction (e.g., velocity)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **distance** and **displacement**?", answer: "Distance is the total path length traveled (scalar), while displacement is the change in position from start to end (vector)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **speed** and **velocity**?", answer: "Speed is the rate of change of distance (scalar), while velocity is the rate of change of displacement (vector)." },
    { question: "What is **acceleration**?", answer: "The rate of change of velocity." },
    { question: "What is the first kinematic equation for constant acceleration?", answer: "$$v_f = v_i + at$$" },
    { question: "What is the second kinematic equation?", answer: "$$\\Delta d = v_i t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$$" },
    { question: "What is the third kinematic equation?", answer: "$$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\\Delta d$$" },
    { question: "What is the acceleration due to gravity (g) on Earth?", answer: "Approximately 9.8 m/s², directed downward." },
    { question: "What is **free-fall motion**?", answer: "The motion of an object solely under the influence of gravity, with air resistance ignored." },
    { question: "On a **position-time graph**, what does a straight, horizontal line mean?", answer: "The object is at rest (zero velocity)." },
    { question: "On a **velocity-time graph**, what does a straight, horizontal line mean?", answer: "The object has constant velocity (zero acceleration)." },
    { question: "On a **position-time graph**, what does the slope represent?", answer: "Velocity." },
    { question: "On a **velocity-time graph**, what does the slope represent?", answer: "Acceleration." },
    { question: "On a **velocity-time graph**, what does the area under the curve represent?", answer: "Displacement." },
    { question: "What is the formula for average velocity?", answer: "$$v_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta d}{\\Delta t}$$" },
    { question: "An object is thrown straight up. What is its velocity at the highest point of its path?", answer: "Zero (for an instant)." },
    { question: "An object is thrown straight up. What is its acceleration at the highest point of its path?", answer: "Still 9.8 m/s² downward." },
    { question: "What is **two-dimensional (2D) kinematics**?", answer: "The study of motion in two dimensions, typically broken down into separate x and y components." },
    { question: "What is a **projectile**?", answer: "An object that is thrown or launched into the air and is only affected by gravity." },
    { question: "How is a projectile's horizontal motion different from its vertical motion?", answer: "Horizontal motion has zero acceleration, while vertical motion is affected by the acceleration of gravity." },
    { question: "What is the shape of a projectile's path (trajectory)?", answer: "A parabola." },
    { question: "What is **vector resolution**?", answer: "The process of breaking a vector into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components." },
    { question: "How do you calculate the horizontal component of an initial velocity ($v_i$) at an angle (θ)?", answer: "$$v_{ix} = v_i \\cos(\\theta)$$" },
    { question: "How do you calculate the vertical component of an initial velocity ($v_i$) at an angle (θ)?", answer: "$$v_{iy} = v_i \\sin(\\theta)$$" },
    { question: "What is **range** in projectile motion?", answer: "The total horizontal distance traveled by a projectile." },
    { question: "What is the formula for horizontal displacement in projectile motion?", answer: "$$\\Delta d_x = v_{ix}t$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for average acceleration?", answer: "$$a_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$$" },
    { question: "What are the common sign conventions used in kinematics?", answer: "Up or right is usually positive, and down or left is usually negative." },
    { question: "What does a negative value for displacement mean?", answer: "The object's final position is in the negative direction from its starting point." },
    { question: "What does a negative value for acceleration mean?", answer: "The object is slowing down or accelerating in the negative direction." },
    { question: "How do you find the total distance from a velocity-time graph?", answer: "By adding the areas of all sections, treating all areas as positive." },
    { question: "A cyclist travels 10 km north and then 5 km south. What is her total distance?", answer: "15 km." },
    { question: "A cyclist travels 10 km north and then 5 km south. What is her final displacement?", answer: "5 km north." },
    { question: "How can you tell if an object is accelerating from a velocity-time graph?", answer: "If the line has a non-zero slope." },
    { question: "What is the formula for finding the magnitude of a resultant vector from its x and y components?", answer: "$$R = \\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}$$" },
    { question: "When are the horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's motion independent?", answer: "They are always independent of each other (they don't affect each other)." },
    { question: "What is the velocity of a projectile at its maximum height?", answer: "The vertical velocity is zero, but the horizontal velocity is constant (if we ignore air resistance)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for displacement?", answer: "The meter (m)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for acceleration?", answer: "The meter per second squared (m/s²)." }
