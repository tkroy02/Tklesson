  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is a **production function**?", answer: "A mathematical relationship that describes the maximum output that can be produced with a given set of inputs." },
    { question: "What is the **short run** in economics?", answer: "A period of time during which at least one input (like a factory or land) is fixed and cannot be changed." },
    { question: "What is the **long run** in economics?", answer: "A period of time during which all inputs, including the size of the factory, are variable." },
    { question: "What are **fixed costs**?", answer: "Costs that do not change with the level of output (e.g., rent, insurance)." },
    { question: "What are **variable costs**?", answer: "Costs that vary with the level of output (e.g., raw materials, wages for production workers)." },
    { question: "What is **total cost**?", answer: "The sum of a firm's fixed costs and variable costs." },
    { question: "What is **marginal cost**?", answer: "The additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of a good or service." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns**?", answer: "The principle that as more units of a variable input are added to a fixed input, the marginal product of the variable input will eventually decrease." },
    { question: "What is **marginal product**?", answer: "The change in total output that results from employing one additional unit of a variable input, like labor." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between marginal cost and marginal product?", answer: "Marginal cost falls when marginal product rises, and marginal cost rises when marginal product falls." },
    { question: "What is **average total cost**?", answer: "Total cost divided by the quantity of output produced." },
    { question: "What is the shape of the short-run average total cost curve?", answer: "It is U-shaped, reflecting the effects of diminishing returns." },
    { question: "What are **economies of scale**?", answer: "A situation in which a firm's average total cost of production decreases as its scale of output increases." },
    { question: "What are **diseconomies of scale**?", answer: "A situation in which a firm's average total cost of production increases as its scale of output increases." },
    { question: "What causes diseconomies of scale?", answer: "Management difficulties, coordination problems, and other inefficiencies that arise as a firm becomes too large." },
    { question: "What are **constant returns to scale**?", answer: "A situation in which a firm's average total cost remains constant as its scale of output increases." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the short-run average total cost curves and the long-run average cost curve?", answer: "The long-run average cost curve is an envelope that touches the bottom of all possible short-run average total cost curves." },
    { question: "What is the primary goal of a firm in a market economy?", answer: "To maximize profit, which is the difference between total revenue and total cost." },
    { question: "If a firm's total cost is $500 and it produces 100 units, what is its average total cost?", answer: "$5 per unit ($500 / 100 units)." },
    { question: "What is the term for the revenue a firm earns from selling one additional unit of output?", answer: "Marginal Revenue." }
