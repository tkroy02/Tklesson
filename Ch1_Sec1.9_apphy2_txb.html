      <h1>Section 1.9: Conceptual Questions (Fluids)</h1>
      <p>
        These conceptual questions encourage deeper understanding of fluids, 
        beyond calculations. They focus on reasoning, interpretation, and 
        qualitative thinking.
      </p>

      <h2>Conceptual Questions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Why does a steel ship float on water even though steel is denser than water?
        </li>
        <li>
          Two identical balloons are inflated — one with helium and one with air. 
          Explain why the helium balloon rises in air while the other does not.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you dive into a swimming pool and swim downward, you feel your ears “pop.” 
          Why does this happen? How is it related to pressure?
        </li>
        <li>
          Imagine two connected containers with water at different heights. 
          Why does water flow until the heights are equal, even if the shapes of the containers differ?
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does squeezing a plastic water bottle make the water squirt out of a small hole?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Practice with Explanations</h2>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Why is it easier to float in saltwater than in freshwater?</p>
      <button onclick="document.getElementById('solution1').style.display='block'">Show Explanation</button>
      <div id="solution1" style="display:none; margin-top:10px;">
        Saltwater is denser than freshwater. According to Archimedes’ principle, 
        the buoyant force equals the weight of displaced fluid. Since saltwater 
        has greater density, a smaller volume displacement provides enough force 
        to balance body weight — making floating easier.
