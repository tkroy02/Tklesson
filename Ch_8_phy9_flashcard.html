    const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **light** in physics?", answer: "Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels as a transverse wave." },
    { question: "How fast does light travel in a vacuum?", answer: "Approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s, or 300,000,000 m/s." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **luminous object** and an **illuminated object**?", answer: "A luminous object produces its own light (e.g., the Sun), while an illuminated object reflects light (e.g., the Moon)." },
    { question: "What is a **ray** in the study of light?", answer: "A straight line with an arrowhead showing the direction in which light waves are traveling." },
    { question: "What is **reflection**?", answer: "The bouncing back of light from a surface." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Reflection**?", answer: "The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection." },
    { question: "What is the **angle of incidence**?", answer: "The angle between an incoming light ray and the normal." },
    { question: "What is the **angle of reflection**?", answer: "The angle between the reflected light ray and the normal." },
    { question: "What is the **normal**?", answer: "An imaginary line drawn perpendicular to a surface at the point where a light ray strikes it." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **specular reflection** and **diffuse reflection**?", answer: "Specular reflection is from a smooth surface and produces a clear image. Diffuse reflection is from a rough surface and scatters light in many directions." },
    { question: "Give an example of **specular reflection**.", answer: "Light reflecting off a mirror or a still body of water." },
    { question: "Give an example of **diffuse reflection**.", answer: "Light reflecting off a piece of paper or a brick wall." },
    { question: "What is a **plane mirror**?", answer: "A flat mirror that produces a virtual, upright image that is the same size as the object and laterally inverted." },
    { question: "What does it mean for an image to be **virtual**?", answer: "The image is formed where light rays appear to diverge from; it cannot be projected onto a screen." },
    { question: "What does it mean for an image to be **real**?", answer: "The image is formed where light rays actually converge; it can be projected onto a screen." },
    { question: "What is a **concave mirror**?", answer: "A curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the inside, like a spoon's bowl. It can form both real and virtual images." },
    { question: "What is a **convex mirror**?", answer: "A curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the outside, like the back of a spoon. It only forms virtual, upright, and smaller images." },
    { question: "What is the **focal point** of a concave mirror?", answer: "The point on the principal axis where light rays parallel to the axis converge after reflecting off the mirror." },
    { question: "What is the **focal point** of a convex mirror?", answer: "The point on the principal axis from which reflected parallel light rays appear to diverge." },
    { question: "Why are convex mirrors used as security mirrors in stores?", answer: "They provide a wide field of view, showing a large area in a small, upright image." },
    { question: "Why are concave mirrors used in car headlights?", answer: "They are used to focus light from the bulb into a concentrated, parallel beam." },
    { question: "How do we see an object?", answer: "Light reflects off the object and travels into our eyes." },
    { question: "What is the **principal axis** of a curved mirror?", answer: "The straight line passing through the center of curvature and the vertex of the mirror." },
    { question: "What is the term for a virtual image that appears reversed left-to-right?", answer: "Laterally inverted." },
    { question: "What is **magnification**?", answer: "The ratio of the image height to the object height." },
    { question: "When an object is placed in front of a plane mirror, what is the relationship between the object distance and the image distance?", answer: "The object distance is equal to the image distance." },
    { question: "If you move towards a plane mirror, what happens to your image?", answer: "Your image also moves towards you at the same speed." },
    { question: "In a concave mirror, where should an object be placed to create a real, inverted, and magnified image?", answer: "Between the focal point and the center of curvature." },
    { question: "In a concave mirror, where should an object be placed to create a virtual, upright, and magnified image?", answer: "Inside the focal point (between the mirror and the focal point)." },
    { question: "When looking at yourself in a convex mirror, is the image you see real or virtual?", answer: "Virtual." },
    { question: "What is the **center of curvature** of a curved mirror?", answer: "The center of the sphere from which the mirror was a part." },
    { question: "What is the law that governs the behavior of light as it reflects off a surface?", answer: "The Law of Reflection." },
    { question: "What kind of image is formed by a plane mirror?", answer: "A virtual, upright, and laterally inverted image." },
    { question: "What type of light source is the Sun?", answer: "A luminous source." },
    { question: "What is the speed of light in water?", answer: "It is slower than in a vacuum." },
    { question: "If a light ray strikes a mirror at an angle of incidence of 30°, what is the angle of reflection?", answer: "30°." },
    { question: "When light rays from a distant object hit a concave mirror, they are reflected and converge at what point?", answer: "The focal point." },
    { question: "How can you tell the difference between a concave and a convex mirror by looking at your reflection?", answer: "A concave mirror can produce an inverted image, while a convex mirror always produces an upright image." },
    { question: "What is the term for the process of a light wave bouncing off an object?", answer: "Reflection." },
    { question: "In a ray diagram, what does a solid line represent?", answer: "The actual path of a light ray." }
