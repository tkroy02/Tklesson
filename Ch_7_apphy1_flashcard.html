    { question: "What is the rotational analog of linear displacement?", answer: "Angular displacement (Δθ), measured in radians." },
    { question: "What is the rotational analog of linear velocity?", answer: "Angular velocity (ω), measured in radians per second (rad/s)." },

    { question: "What is the formula to relate tangential acceleration to angular acceleration?", answer: "$$a_t = r\\alpha$$" },
    { question: "What is **Torque**?", answer: "The rotational equivalent of force; it causes an object to rotate or change its rotational motion." },
    { question: "What is the formula for torque?", answer: "$$\\tau = rF\\sin\\theta$$" },
    { question: "What is the rotational analog of Newton's First Law?", answer: "An object in rotational motion will stay in rotational motion with constant angular velocity unless acted upon by a net torque." },
    { question: "What is the rotational analog of Newton's Second Law?", answer: "$$\\tau_{net} = I\\alpha$$" },
    { question: "What is the rotational analog of mass?", answer: "**Rotational inertia** (I), which is a measure of an object's resistance to a change in its rotational motion." },
    { question: "What does rotational inertia depend on?", answer: "The mass of the object and how that mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation." },
    { question: "For a point mass, what is the formula for rotational inertia?", answer: "$$I = mr^2$$" },
    { question: "State the law of **Conservation of Angular Momentum**.", answer: "The angular momentum of a closed, isolated system remains constant." },
    { question: "What is the formula for angular momentum?", answer: "$$L = I\\omega$$" },
    { question: "In an isolated system, what is the relationship between the initial and final angular momentum?", answer: "$$L_{initial} = L_{final}$$ or $$I_i\\omega_i = I_f\\omega_f$$" },

    { question: "What is the total kinetic energy of a rolling object?", answer: "The sum of its translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy ($$K_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$$)." },
    { question: "What condition is necessary for an object to roll without slipping?", answer: "$$v = r\\omega$$" },
    { question: "When a figure skater pulls their arms in, what happens to their rotational inertia and angular speed?", answer: "Their rotational inertia decreases, and their angular speed increases to conserve angular momentum." },
    { question: "What is the angular analog of linear momentum?", answer: "**Angular momentum** ($$L$$)." },
    { question: "A spinning disk slows down due to friction. Is angular momentum conserved?", answer: "No, because there is an external torque (friction) acting on the system." },
    { question: "If a net torque is applied to an object, what will it do?", answer: "It will undergo angular acceleration." },
    { question: "Which is harder to stop, a rotating solid disk or a rotating ring of the same mass and radius?", answer: "The ring, because its mass is distributed farther from the axis of rotation, giving it a larger rotational inertia." },
    { question: "How does the torque applied to a door change as you get closer to the hinges?", answer: "It decreases for the same amount of applied force." },
    { question: "What is the condition for an object to be in **rotational equilibrium**?", answer: "The net torque acting on it must be zero." },
    { question: "If an object is in both translational and rotational equilibrium, what are the conditions?", answer: "The net force is zero ($$\\sum\\vec{F}=0$$) and the net torque is zero ($$\\sum\\tau=0$$)." },
    { question: "What does the area under an angular acceleration vs. time graph represent?", answer: "The change in angular velocity ($$\\Delta\\omega$$)." },
    { question: "What does the slope of an angular velocity vs. time graph represent?", answer: "Angular acceleration ($$\\alpha$$)." },
    { question: "When a rolling object goes up an incline, what energy transformations occur?", answer: "Translational and rotational kinetic energy are converted into gravitational potential energy." },
    { question: "Does an object's rotational inertia change if the axis of rotation is changed?", answer: "Yes, its value depends on the axis of rotation." },
    { question: "Is angular momentum a vector or a scalar?", answer: "A **vector** quantity." },

    { question: "What is the rotational analog of the kinematic equations?", answer: "$$\\omega_f = \\omega_i + \\alpha t$$; $$\\Delta\\theta = \\omega_i t + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2$$; $$\\omega_f^2 = \\omega_i^2 + 2\\alpha\\Delta\\theta$$" },
    { question: "Does a rolling object ever slip when it is in an ideal rolling motion?", answer: "No, the point of contact with the ground is instantaneously at rest." },
