      {
        "question": "A block slides down a frictionless incline. What is its acceleration?",
        "type": "mcq",
        "options": ["5 m/s²", "8.66 m/s²", "10 m/s²", "50 m/s²"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using a = g sin θ..."
      },

        "question": "Which of the following are vector quantities? (Select all that apply)",
        "type": "multiple_response",
        "options": [
          "Velocity",
          "Speed",
          "Displacement",
          "Distance",
          "Acceleration",
          "Time"
        ],
        "answer": ["A", "C", "E"],
        "explanation": "Vector quantities have both magnitude and direction. Velocity, displacement, and acceleration are vectors. Speed, distance, and time are scalars."

        "options": [
          "Gravitational force (weight)",
          "Normal force",
          "Friction force",
          "Tension force",
          "Applied force"
        ],
        "answer": ["A", "B", "C"],
        "explanation": "The block experiences weight (gravity), normal force from the surface, and friction. There is no tension or applied force shown."

### Option 2: Using Local Images (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Create an images folder structure:
```
project-root/
├── quizzes/
│   └── ap-physics-1/
│       ├── exam-quiz1.json
│       └── images/
│           ├── question1-diagram.png
│           ├── question5-circuit.png
│           └── question12-projectile.png
