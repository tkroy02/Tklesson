  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is a **gene**?", answer: "A segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or RNA molecule, determining a trait." },
    { question: "What is an **allele**?", answer: "An alternative version of a gene." },
    { question: "What is a **genotype**?", answer: "The genetic makeup or set of alleles of an organism." },
    { question: "What is a **phenotype**?", answer: "The observable physical and physiological traits of an organism, determined by its genotype." },
    { question: "What does it mean to be **homozygous**?", answer: "Having two identical alleles for a given gene (e.g., **AA** or **aa**)." },
    { question: "What does it mean to be **heterozygous**?", answer: "Having two different alleles for a given gene (e.g., **Aa**)." },
    { question: "What is Mendel's **Law of Segregation**?", answer: "The two alleles for a heritable trait separate (segregate) during gamete formation and end up in different gametes." },
    { question: "What is Mendel's **Law of Independent Assortment**?", answer: "Alleles for different genes assort independently of each other during gamete formation." },
    { question: "What is a **Punnett square**?", answer: "A diagram used to predict the outcomes of a particular cross or breeding experiment." },
    { question: "In a monohybrid cross of two heterozygous parents (Aa x Aa), what is the expected genotypic ratio?", answer: "1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa." },
    { question: "In a monohybrid cross of two heterozygous parents (Aa x Aa), what is the expected phenotypic ratio?", answer: "3 dominant phenotype : 1 recessive phenotype." },
    { question: "What is the **multiplication rule** of probability?", answer: "The probability of two or more independent events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities." },
    { question: "What is the **addition rule** of probability?", answer: "The probability of any one of two or more mutually exclusive events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities." },
    { question: "What is a **pedigree**?", answer: "A family tree that describes the relationships among parents and children and the patterns of inheritance of a particular trait." },
    { question: "In a pedigree, how are affected individuals typically represented?", answer: "By a shaded circle (female) or square (male)." },
    { question: "How can you identify an **autosomal recessive** trait from a pedigree?", answer: "It skips generations, and affected individuals often have unaffected parents who are carriers." },
    { question: "How can you identify an **autosomal dominant** trait from a pedigree?", answer: "It appears in every generation, and affected individuals have at least one affected parent." },
    { question: "How can you identify an **X-linked recessive** trait from a pedigree?", answer: "More males than females are affected, and it often skips a generation through an unaffected carrier mother." },
    { question: "What is the genotype of a carrier for a recessive genetic disorder?", answer: "Heterozygous (e.g., **Aa**)." },
    { question: "What is an example of an autosomal recessive disorder?", answer: "Cystic fibrosis or sickle-cell disease." },
    { question: "What is an example of an autosomal dominant disorder?", answer: "Huntington's disease or achondroplasia." },
    { question: "What is an example of an X-linked recessive disorder?", answer: "Color blindness or hemophilia." },
    { question: "If an allele is dominant, does that mean it is more common in the population?", answer: "No, a dominant allele is not necessarily more common. For example, the allele for six fingers is dominant, but it is very rare." },
    { question: "What is **codominance**?", answer: "When both alleles are fully expressed in the phenotype of a heterozygote (e.g., AB blood type)." },
    { question: "What is **incomplete dominance**?", answer: "When the phenotype of a heterozygote is an intermediate blend of the two homozygous phenotypes (e.g., red and white flowers creating pink flowers)." },
    { question: "What is a **test cross**?", answer: "A cross between an individual with an unknown genotype (showing the dominant phenotype) and a homozygous recessive individual to determine the unknown genotype." },
    { question: "What is **polygenic inheritance**?", answer: "When two or more genes have an additive effect on a single phenotype (e.g., skin color or height)." },
    { question: "What is a **karyotype**?", answer: "An ordered display of the pairs of chromosomes from a cell, often used to detect chromosomal abnormalities." },
    { question: "Why are males more susceptible to X-linked recessive disorders?", answer: "Because they only have one X chromosome, so a single recessive allele on that chromosome will be expressed." },
    { question: "What is the probability of a heterozygous carrier mother and an unaffected father having an affected child with an autosomal recessive disorder?", answer: "25% (1/4)." },
    { question: "What is a **dihybrid cross**?", answer: "A cross between two individuals that are heterozygous for two different genes (e.g., AaBb x AaBb)." },
    { question: "In a dihybrid cross of two heterozygous parents, what is the expected phenotypic ratio?", answer: "9:3:3:1." },
    { question: "What is a **carrier**?", answer: "An individual who is heterozygous for a recessive allele but does not show the trait." },
    { question: "How many alleles for a single gene does a human inherit from each parent?", answer: "One allele from each parent, for a total of two." },
    { question: "What are **linked genes**?", answer: "Genes that are located close together on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together, violating the Law of Independent Assortment." },
    { question: "What is the name for a condition where an organism has an abnormal number of chromosomes?", answer: "**Aneuploidy**." },
    { question: "What is an example of aneuploidy?", answer: "Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Segregation**'s connection to meiosis?", answer: "It reflects the separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I of meiosis." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Independent Assortment**'s connection to meiosis?", answer: "It reflects the random orientation of homologous pairs during metaphase I of meiosis." },
    { question: "What does it mean for a gene to be **sex-linked**?", answer: "The gene is located on a sex chromosome (X or Y)." }
