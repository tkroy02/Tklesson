  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the key difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?", answer: "Eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, while prokaryotic cells do not." },
    { question: "What is the function of the **nucleus**?", answer: "It houses the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controls the cell's activities." },
    { question: "What is the function of **ribosomes**?", answer: "They are the sites of protein synthesis (translation)." },
    { question: "What is the function of the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**?", answer: "A network of membranes involved in protein and lipid synthesis and transport." },
    { question: "What is the difference between the rough ER and the smooth ER?", answer: "Rough ER has ribosomes on its surface and synthesizes proteins; smooth ER lacks ribosomes and synthesizes lipids." },
    { question: "What is the function of the **Golgi apparatus**?", answer: "It modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to other organelles." },
    { question: "What is the function of the **lysosomes**?", answer: "They contain hydrolytic enzymes that digest and recycle worn-out cell parts and break down foreign substances." },
    { question: "What is the function of the **mitochondria**?", answer: "They are the site of cellular respiration, producing ATP (the cell's energy currency)." },
    { question: "What is the function of **chloroplasts**?", answer: "They are the sites of photosynthesis in plant cells and algae." },
    { question: "What is the function of the **vacuole**?", answer: "A large sac in plant cells that stores water and nutrients and provides structural support." },
    { question: "What is the function of the **cytoskeleton**?", answer: "A network of protein fibers that gives the cell its shape, provides structural support, and facilitates movement." },
    { question: "What is the primary component of the cell membrane?", answer: "A **phospholipid bilayer**." },
    { question: "What does it mean for the cell membrane to be **selectively permeable**?", answer: "It allows some substances to pass through more easily than others." },
    { question: "Explain the **fluid mosaic model** of the cell membrane.", answer: "The membrane is a fluid structure with a 'mosaic' of various proteins and other molecules embedded in or attached to a phospholipid bilayer." },
    { question: "What is **passive transport**?", answer: "The movement of substances across a membrane without the use of cellular energy (ATP)." },
    { question: "What is **diffusion**?", answer: "The passive movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration." },
    { question: "What is **osmosis**?", answer: "The passive diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane." },
    { question: "What is **facilitated diffusion**?", answer: "The passive transport of molecules across a membrane with the help of transport proteins." },
    { question: "What is **active transport**?", answer: "The movement of substances across a membrane against their concentration gradient, requiring cellular energy (ATP)." },
    { question: "What is the function of the sodium-potassium pump?", answer: "An example of active transport that pumps sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell against their concentration gradients." },
    { question: "What is a **hypertonic solution**?", answer: "A solution with a higher solute concentration than the cell, causing water to leave the cell and the cell to shrink." },
    { question: "What is a **hypotonic solution**?", answer: "A solution with a lower solute concentration than the cell, causing water to enter the cell and the cell to swell." },
    { question: "What is an **isotonic solution**?", answer: "A solution with the same solute concentration as the cell, resulting in no net movement of water." },
    { question: "What is **endocytosis**?", answer: "The process of a cell taking in materials by forming vesicles from the plasma membrane." },
    { question: "What is **exocytosis**?", answer: "The process of a cell expelling materials by fusing vesicles with the plasma membrane." },
    { question: "What is the difference in DNA structure between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?", answer: "Prokaryotic DNA is a single circular chromosome in the cytoplasm; eukaryotic DNA is linear and found in multiple chromosomes in the nucleus." },
    { question: "Which organelle is responsible for breaking down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen?", answer: "Peroxisomes." },
    { question: "What are **transport proteins**?", answer: "Proteins that span the cell membrane and assist in the movement of substances across it." },
    { question: "What is the primary function of the **cell wall**?", answer: "To provide structural support and protection to the cell; found in plant cells, fungi, and bacteria." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a plant cell and an animal cell?", answer: "Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, which animal cells lack." },
    { question: "What is the theory that explains how eukaryotic cells evolved from prokaryotic cells?", answer: "The **endosymbiotic theory**, which suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes." },
    { question: "What is the function of **plasmids** in prokaryotic cells?", answer: "Small, circular DNA molecules that can replicate independently and often carry genes for antibiotic resistance." },
    { question: "What is **pinocytosis**?", answer: "A form of endocytosis in which the cell takes in fluid ('cell drinking')." },
    { question: "What is **phagocytosis**?", answer: "A form of endocytosis in which the cell takes in large particles or other cells ('cell eating')." },
    { question: "What is the role of cholesterol in the cell membrane?", answer: "It helps maintain the membrane's fluidity and stability by preventing it from becoming too rigid or too fluid at different temperatures." },
    { question: "What is a **concentration gradient**?", answer: "The difference in the concentration of a substance between two areas." },
    { question: "Which type of transport moves molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration?", answer: "Active transport." },
    { question: "What is the function of a **flagellum** or **cilia**?", answer: "They are hair-like appendages used for cell movement." },
    { question: "Where is the DNA of a prokaryotic cell located?", answer: "In the **nucleoid** region of the cytoplasm." },
    { question: "Which type of transport is responsible for a cell taking in glucose?", answer: "Facilitated diffusion, as glucose is too large to pass through the membrane on its own but does not require energy to move down its gradient." }
