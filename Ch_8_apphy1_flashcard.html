  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the definition of **density**?", answer: "Mass per unit volume ($$\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$$)." },
    { question: "What is the definition of **pressure**?", answer: "Force per unit area ($$P = \\frac{F}{A}$$)." },
    { question: "What are the standard SI units for pressure?", answer: "Pascals (Pa), which is equivalent to newtons per square meter ($$N/m^2$$)." },
    { question: "How does pressure change with depth in a fluid?", answer: "It increases linearly with depth." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the pressure at a depth $$h$$ in a fluid?", answer: "$$P = P_0 + \\rho gh$$" },
    { question: "What is **Pascal's Principle**?", answer: "A pressure change applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the container." },
    { question: "What is the principle behind a hydraulic lift?", answer: "Pascal's Principle, where a small force over a small area creates a large force over a large area." },
    { question: "What is the formula relating forces and areas in a hydraulic system?", answer: "$$\\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \\frac{F_2}{A_2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the definition of **buoyant force**?", answer: "The upward force exerted by a fluid on a submerged object." },
    { question: "State **Archimedes' Principle**.", answer: "The buoyant force on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object." },
    { question: "What is the formula for buoyant force?", answer: "$$F_B = \\rho_{fluid}gV_{submerged}$$" },
    { question: "An object is floating. How does its weight compare to the buoyant force on it?", answer: "The buoyant force is equal to the object's weight ($$F_B = F_g$$)." },
    { question: "An object is sinking. How does its weight compare to the buoyant force on it?", answer: "The object's weight is greater than the buoyant force ($$F_g > F_B$$)." },
    { question: "What is the condition for an object to float?", answer: "The object's average density must be less than or equal to the density of the fluid." },
    { question: "What is **Bernoulli's Principle**?", answer: "As the speed of a fluid increases, the pressure within the fluid decreases." },
    { question: "State the full **Bernoulli's Equation**.", answer: "$$P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 + \\rho gh_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho gh_2$$" },
    { question: "What is the **Continuity Equation**?", answer: "For an incompressible fluid, the flow rate is constant: $$A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$$" },
    { question: "In the continuity equation, what does $$A$$ represent and what does $$v$$ represent?", answer: "$$A$$ is the cross-sectional area of the pipe, and $$v$$ is the speed of the fluid." },
    { question: "What is a **streamline**?", answer: "A line in a fluid that is tangent to the velocity vector of the fluid at every point." },
    { question: "Why does the water coming out of a faucet get thinner as it falls?", answer: "Because its speed increases due to gravity, and to maintain constant flow rate, the cross-sectional area must decrease (Continuity Equation)." },
    { question: "In a horizontal pipe, where is the pressure lowest?", answer: "At the point where the fluid speed is highest." },
    { question: "How does an airplane wing create lift?", answer: "The curved top forces air to travel faster over the top surface, creating lower pressure there and a net upward force (Bernoulli's Principle)." },
    { question: "How does a siphon work?", answer: "It uses gravity to create a pressure difference that moves the fluid from a higher reservoir to a lower one." },
    { question: "What are the characteristics of an **ideal fluid**?", answer: "Incompressible, non-viscous, with laminar flow." },
    { question: "Is the buoyant force on a submerged object greater in fresh water or saltwater?", answer: "Saltwater, because it is denser." },
    { question: "If a floating object is pushed down further into the water, what happens to the buoyant force?", answer: "It increases, as more fluid is displaced." },
    { question: "How does the pressure at the bottom of a container with a fluid depend on the container's shape?", answer: "It doesn't. Pressure depends only on the fluid density and depth, not the shape of the container." },
    { question: "What does the term $$\\rho gh$$ represent in Bernoulli's equation?", answer: "Gravitational potential energy per unit volume." },
    { question: "What does the term $$\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$$ represent in Bernoulli's equation?", answer: "Kinetic energy per unit volume." },
    { question: "When a fluid flows from a wider pipe into a narrower pipe, what happens to its speed?", answer: "Its speed increases." },
    { question: "When a fluid flows from a wider pipe into a narrower pipe, what happens to its pressure?", answer: "Its pressure decreases." },
    { question: "What is **viscosity**?", answer: "A measure of a fluid's resistance to flow." },
    { question: "When does Bernoulli's Principle not apply?", answer: "When there is viscosity or turbulence." },
    { question: "How is the human body's blood pressure affected by blood flow speed?", answer: "In narrower blood vessels, blood flows faster, and the pressure on the vessel walls decreases." },
    { question: "What happens to the pressure on a swimmer as they dive deeper into the water?", answer: "The pressure increases due to the increasing weight of the water column above them." },
    { question: "An object is fully submerged. How does its volume compare to the volume of the displaced fluid?", answer: "They are equal." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a liquid and a gas in terms of density?", answer: "Liquids have a definite volume and are nearly incompressible, while gases fill their container and are highly compressible." },
    { question: "What is the **absolute pressure** at a point in a fluid?", answer: "The sum of the atmospheric pressure and the gauge pressure." },
    { question: "What happens to the buoyant force on a submerged object as it is taken to a higher altitude?", answer: "It decreases slightly, due to the decrease in the density of the air." },
    { question: "Why is a large cruise ship able to float?", answer: "Because its average density (including the air inside the hull) is less than the density of the water it displaces." }
