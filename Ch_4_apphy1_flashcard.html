  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the definition of **Work** in physics?", answer: "Work is done when a force causes a displacement of an object in the same direction as the force." },
    { question: "What is the formula for work done by a constant force?", answer: "$$W = Fd\\cos\\theta$$where$$\\theta$$ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors." },
    { question: "What is the **Work-Energy Theorem**?", answer: "The net work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy ($$W_{net} = \\Delta K$$)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for **Kinetic Energy**?", answer: "$$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for **Gravitational Potential Energy**?", answer: "$$U_g = mgh$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for **Elastic Potential Energy** stored in a spring?", answer: "$$U_s = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$" },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy**?", answer: "In the absence of non-conservative forces (like friction), the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) of a system remains constant ($$E_i = E_f$$)." },
    { question: "What is **Power**?", answer: "The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred." },
    { question: "What is the formula for power?", answer: "$$P = \\frac{W}{t} = Fv\\cos\\theta$$" },
    { question: "What is the standard SI unit for work and energy?", answer: "The Joule (J)." },
    { question: "What is the standard SI unit for power?", answer: "The Watt (W)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **conservative** and **non-conservative** force?", answer: "Work done by a conservative force (like gravity) is path-independent. Work done by a non-conservative force (like friction) is path-dependent and converts mechanical energy to other forms." },
    { question: "When a person holds a heavy box but does not move, is work being done on the box?", answer: "No, because there is no displacement, so the work done is zero." },
    { question: "A ball is thrown straight up. At its highest point, what can you say about its kinetic and potential energy?", answer: "Its kinetic energy is at a minimum (zero), and its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum." },
    { question: "As a spring is compressed, what happens to the energy of the system?", answer: "The kinetic energy of the object doing the compressing is converted into elastic potential energy stored in the spring." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of an **energy bar chart**?", answer: "To visually represent the energy transformations within a system at different points in time." },
    { question: "What is **efficiency**?", answer: "The ratio of useful energy output to total energy input, often expressed as a percentage." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between work and energy?", answer: "Work is the process of transferring energy, and a change in energy is equivalent to the work done." },
    { question: "If the velocity of an object is doubled, what happens to its kinetic energy?", answer: "It becomes four times as large ($$K \\propto v^2$$)." },
    { question: "How does the work done by friction affect a system's mechanical energy?", answer: "It causes the mechanical energy of the system to decrease." },
    { question: "What is the principle of **Conservation of Total Energy**?", answer: "The total energy of an isolated system (including mechanical, thermal, etc.) remains constant." },
    { question: "What is **thermal energy**?", answer: "Energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules; it is often the result of work done by friction." },
    { question: "How is the work done by a variable force on a force-displacement graph represented?", answer: "As the area under the curve." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the average power in terms of force and velocity?", answer: "$$P = F_{average}v_{average}\\cos\\theta$$" },
    { question: "If you lift a book at a constant speed, what is the net work done on the book?", answer: "The net work is zero, because the net force is zero (lifting force equals gravity), and thus there is no change in kinetic energy." },
    { question: "What does the slope of a Power vs. Velocity graph represent?", answer: "If the force is constant, the slope is the value of the force." },
    { question: "Why is a roller coaster's potential energy at the top of a hill not quite equal to its kinetic energy at the bottom?", answer: "Because some of the mechanical energy is converted into thermal energy by the work done by friction and air resistance." },
    { question: "What happens to the potential energy of a pendulum as it swings from its highest point to its lowest point?", answer: "It is converted into kinetic energy." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the escape velocity from a planet's gravitational field?", answer: "$$v_{escape} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$$" },
    { question: "What is a **zero energy point** in a potential energy diagram?", answer: "A reference point from which potential energy is measured, often chosen to be ground level for gravitational potential energy." }
