  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is a **quantum**?", answer: "The minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction. It's the smallest indivisible unit of energy." },
    { question: "What is **Planck's Hypothesis**?", answer: "Energy is not continuous but is emitted or absorbed in discrete packets called quanta." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the energy of a photon?", answer: "$$E = hf$$ (where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency." },
    { question: "What is the value of **Planck's constant** ($$h$$)?", answer: "$$6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$$" },
    { question: "What is the **photoelectric effect**?", answer: "The emission of electrons from a material when light shines on it." },
    { question: "What is the key experimental observation that the photoelectric effect posed for classical physics?", answer: "Electrons are only emitted when the light's frequency is above a certain threshold, regardless of intensity." },
    { question: "What is the **work function** ($$\\phi$$)?", answer: "The minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a material." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the maximum kinetic energy of an emitted photoelectron?", answer: "$$K_{max} = hf - \\phi$$" },
    { question: "What is a **photon**?", answer: "A quantum of light, or the basic particle of all electromagnetic radiation." },
    { question: "What is **wave-particle duality**?", answer: "The concept that every particle or quantum entity may be described as either a particle or a wave." },
    { question: "What is the **de Broglie wavelength**?", answer: "The wavelength associated with a moving particle, showing its wave-like properties." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the de Broglie wavelength?", answer: "$$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$$ where $$p$$ is momentum." },
    { question: "What did the **double-slit experiment** demonstrate about electrons?", answer: "That electrons, like light waves, can exhibit an interference pattern, demonstrating their wave-like nature." },
    { question: "What is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**?", answer: "It is impossible to know both the exact position and the exact momentum of a particle at the same time." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the position-momentum uncertainty principle?", answer: "$$\\Delta x \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the **Bohr Model** of the atom?", answer: "A model that proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, quantized energy levels." },
    { question: "What is an **electron shell**?", answer: "A principal energy level that electrons occupy in the Bohr model." },
    { question: "What happens when an electron transitions from a higher to a lower energy level?", answer: "It emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between the levels ($$\\Delta E = hf$$)." },
    { question: "What is the **quantum mechanical model** of the atom?", answer: "A model that describes electrons as occupying probable regions of space (orbitals) rather than fixed orbits." },
    { question: "What is a **wave function** ($$\\psi$$)?", answer: "A mathematical function that describes the quantum state of a particle." },
    { question: "What does the square of the wave function ($$|\\psi|^2$$) represent?", answer: "The probability density of finding the particle at a particular location." },
    { question: "What is **quantum tunneling**?", answer: "A quantum mechanical phenomenon where a particle can pass through a potential energy barrier even if it does not have enough energy to do so classically." },
    { question: "What is the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**?", answer: "No two electrons in the same atom can have the same four quantum numbers." },
    { question: "What are the four **quantum numbers**?", answer: "Principal ($$n$$), Azimuthal ($$l$$), Magnetic ($$m_l$$), and Spin ($$m_s$$)." },
    { question: "What is a **blackbody**?", answer: "An idealized object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence." },
    { question: "What was the **ultraviolet catastrophe**?", answer: "A prediction of classical physics that a blackbody would radiate an infinite amount of energy at high frequencies, which was not observed experimentally." },
    { question: "How did Max Planck solve the ultraviolet catastrophe?", answer: "By proposing that energy is quantized, meaning it can only be radiated in discrete units." },
    { question: "What is a **quantum leap**?", answer: "The instantaneous transition of an electron from one energy level to another, absorbing or emitting a photon." },
    { question: "What is the unit of work function and kinetic energy in the photoelectric effect?", answer: "Joules (J), but it is often expressed in electron-volts (eV)." },
    { question: "What is the **Compton effect**?", answer: "The scattering of a photon by a charged particle, resulting in a decrease in photon energy and an increase in its wavelength." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a classical particle and a quantum particle?", answer: "A classical particle has a definite position and momentum, while a quantum particle's properties are described by probabilities." },
    { question: "What is the role of a potential energy barrier in quantum mechanics?", answer: "It is a region of space that a particle must pass through, and quantum tunneling allows it to pass through it even if its energy is insufficient." },
    { question: "What is **Schrödinger's cat**?", answer: "A thought experiment illustrating the paradox of quantum superposition, where a cat is simultaneously both alive and dead." },
    { question: "What is the **ground state** of an atom?", answer: "The lowest possible energy state of an electron in an atom." },
    { question: "What is an **excited state**?", answer: "Any energy state higher than the ground state." },
    { question: "What determines the color of light emitted by an atom?", answer: "The specific energy difference between the electron's initial and final energy levels, which corresponds to the energy of the emitted photon." },
    { question: "Why is the Bohr Model considered a simplified model today?", answer: "It fails to account for the wave nature of the electron and doesn't explain the fine details of atomic spectra." },
    { question: "What is the **stopping potential** in the photoelectric effect?", answer: "The minimum reverse voltage required to stop the most energetic photoelectrons from reaching the collector electrode." },
    { question: "What is the significance of the wave-particle duality for everyday objects?", answer: "The de Broglie wavelength for macroscopic objects is so infinitesimally small that their wave-like properties are undetectable." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the momentum of a photon and its wavelength?", answer: "$$p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$$" }
