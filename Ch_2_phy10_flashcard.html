  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is a **force**?", answer: "A push or pull on an object." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for force?", answer: "The Newton (N)." },
    { question: "What is **dynamics**?", answer: "The study of how forces affect motion." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **mass** and **weight**?", answer: "Mass is the amount of matter in an object, while weight is the force of gravity on that mass." },
    { question: "What is the formula for calculating weight?", answer: "$$W = mg$$" },
    { question: "What is **Newton's First Law of Motion**?", answer: "An object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force (Law of Inertia)." },
    { question: "What is **Newton's Second Law of Motion**?", answer: "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass." },
    { question: "What is the formula for Newton's Second Law?", answer: "$$\\Sigma F = ma$$" },
    { question: "What is **Newton's Third Law of Motion**?", answer: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." },
    { question: "What is **inertia**?", answer: "The tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion." },
    { question: "How does mass relate to inertia?", answer: "The greater the mass of an object, the greater its inertia." },
    { question: "What is a **free-body diagram**?", answer: "A diagram that shows all the forces acting on a single object." },
    { question: "What is **net force**?", answer: "The vector sum of all forces acting on an object." },
    { question: "What is the **force of gravity** on an object?", answer: "The force that pulls an object toward the center of the Earth. It's also called weight." },
    { question: "What is the **normal force**?", answer: "The perpendicular force exerted by a surface to support the weight of an object resting on it." },
    { question: "What is **tension**?", answer: "The force exerted by a rope, string, or cable when it is pulled taut." },
    { question: "What is **friction**?", answer: "A force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are in contact." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **static friction** and **kinetic friction**?", answer: "Static friction prevents an object from starting to move, while kinetic friction acts on a moving object." },
    { question: "What is the formula for kinetic friction?", answer: "$$f_k = \\mu_k N$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for maximum static friction?", answer: "$$f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N$$" },
    { question: "What is a **coefficient of friction**?", answer: "A dimensionless number that represents the roughness between two surfaces." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between $\\mu_s$ and $\\mu_k$?", answer: "The coefficient of static friction ($\\mu_s$) is always greater than or equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction ($\\mu_k$)." },
    { question: "What is an **applied force**?", answer: "A force that is exerted on an object by a person or another object." },
    { question: "What is **air resistance**?", answer: "A type of fluid friction that acts on objects moving through the air." },
    { question: "When is the net force on an object zero?", answer: "When the object is at rest or moving with a constant velocity (zero acceleration)." },
    { question: "What is the principle of a simple **pulley system**?", answer: "It changes the direction of a force, making it easier to lift heavy objects." },
    { question: "How does the force of gravity change with altitude?", answer: "It decreases as altitude increases." },
    { question: "What is the formula for gravitational force between two objects?", answer: "$$F_g = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the value of the universal gravitational constant, $G$?", answer: "$$6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2$$" },
    { question: "When an object is in **free-fall**, what is the only force acting on it (ignoring air resistance)?", answer: "The force of gravity (its weight)." },
    { question: "How does the acceleration of a falling object change as it approaches terminal velocity?", answer: "Its acceleration decreases until it reaches zero." },
    { question: "What is **terminal velocity**?", answer: "The constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium (like air) prevents further acceleration." },
    { question: "What are the two main types of forces?", answer: "Contact forces (e.g., friction, applied force) and non-contact forces (e.g., gravity, magnetic force)." },
    { question: "Why is it harder to push a box from rest than to keep it moving?", answer: "Static friction is greater than kinetic friction." },
    { question: "If you push on a wall, why doesn't the wall move?", answer: "The wall exerts an equal and opposite force on you, according to Newton's Third Law." },
    { question: "What is the difference between balanced and unbalanced forces?", answer: "Balanced forces result in zero net force and no change in motion. Unbalanced forces result in a net force and acceleration." },
    { question: "What force causes an object to slow down and eventually stop when it slides across a surface?", answer: "Friction." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the impulse-momentum theorem?", answer: "$$J = \\Delta p$$ or $$F\\Delta t = m\\Delta v$$" },
    { question: "What is **impulse**?", answer: "The change in momentum of an object." },
    { question: "What happens to the normal force on a box if you push down on it?", answer: "The normal force increases to support the additional downward force." }
