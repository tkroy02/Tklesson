    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a simple Mendelian cross, a homozygous dominant tall plant is crossed with a homozygous recessive short plant. If the F1 generation is self-fertilized, what is the expected phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation?",
        "options": ["1:2:1", "3:1", "9:3:3:1", "1:1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "P: TT x tt → F1: all Tt. Selfing F1: Tt x Tt → F2 genotypic ratio 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt, yielding a phenotypic ratio of 3 tall (T_) : 1 short (tt)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mendel’s Law of Segregation states that during gamete formation, the two alleles for a trait separate. At what stage of meiosis does this physical separation occur?",
        "options": ["Prophase I", "Metaphase II", "Anaphase I", "Telophase II"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Law of Segregation is physically manifested during Anaphase I of meiosis, when homologous chromosomes (each carrying one of the two alleles) are pulled to opposite poles of the cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A researcher is studying two traits in fruit flies: wing shape (W/w) and body color (G/g). If the genes are on different chromosomes, what is the probability of producing an offspring with the genotype Wwgg from a cross between WwGg and WwGg parents?",
        "options": ["1/16", "1/8", "3/16", "1/4"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Probability of Ww from Ww x Ww = 1/2. Probability of gg from Gg x Gg = 1/4. Since genes assort independently, combined probability = (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scenarios best illustrates Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment?",
        "options": ["A pea plant with purple flowers produces some offspring with white flowers.", "The inheritance of coat color in labs does not affect the inheritance of tail length.", "Linked genes on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together.", "A pink snapdragon is produced from a red and a white parent."],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Independent Assortment states that alleles of different genes segregate independently of one another. Option B describes two traits that are inherited without influencing each other, directly illustrating this law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A test cross is performed to determine the genotype of a dominant-phenotype individual. Which of the following should be the genotype of the other parent in the cross?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Heterozygous", "Homozygous recessive", "Hemizygous"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A test cross involves crossing the individual with an unknown genotype (showing the dominant phenotype) with a homozygous recessive individual. The offspring phenotypes reveal the unknown genotype."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a mother has type A blood (I^A i) and a father has type B blood (I^B i), what is the probability they will have a child with type O blood?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross: I^A i x I^B i. Possible offspring genotypes: I^A I^B (AB), I^A i (A), I^B i (B), ii (O). The probability of type O (ii) is 1/4, or 25%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the expected phenotypic ratio of a cross between two individuals heterozygous for two traits (AaBb × AaBb), assuming independent assortment and complete dominance?",
        "options": ["3:1", "1:1:1:1", "9:3:3:1", "9:7"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is the standard dihybrid cross. With independent assortment and complete dominance, the phenotypic ratio is 9 (A_B_) : 3 (A_bb) : 3 (aaB_) : 1 (aabb)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pedigree shows a trait appearing in every generation. Affected children always have at least one affected parent. What is the most likely mode of inheritance?",
        "options": ["Autosomal recessive", "Autosomal dominant", "X-linked recessive", "Y-linked"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A trait appearing in every generation (vertical transmission) where affected individuals always have an affected parent is characteristic of an autosomal dominant disorder."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two genes are 50 map units apart on the same chromosome, what is their expected recombination frequency?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "One map unit (centimorgan) equals 1% recombination frequency. At 50 map units apart, the genes are so far apart they behave as if unlinked, resulting in a recombination frequency of 50% (the maximum)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A woman who is a carrier for Hemophilia (X-linked recessive) marries a man without hemophilia. What is the probability that their son will have hemophilia?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Carrier mother: X^H X^h. Father: X^H Y. Sons inherit their X chromosome from their mother. There is a 50% chance a son inherits the X^h chromosome from his mother and will have hemophilia (X^h Y)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a calculated χ² value is much higher than the critical value at p = 0.05, what should the researcher conclude?",
        "options": ["The null hypothesis is accepted.", "The observed data significantly deviates from the expected ratios.", "The sample size was too small.", "The genes are definitely on different chromosomes."],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A chi-square value exceeding the critical value means the probability (p-value) of getting the observed results by chance is less than 0.05. This leads to rejection of the null hypothesis, concluding the deviation is statistically significant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mendel’s pea plants showed 'either-or' variation (e.g., purple vs. white). This is an example of:",
        "options": ["Polygenic inheritance", "Discrete variation", "Environmental influence", "Epistasis"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Traits that fall into distinct, separate categories (like Mendel's flower color) are examples of discrete (or qualitative) variation, typically controlled by one or two genes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents a dihybrid test cross?",
        "options": ["AaBb × AaBb", "AABB × aabb", "AaBb × aabb", "aaBB × AAbb"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A dihybrid test cross involves crossing an individual with an unknown dihybrid genotype (or to check for linkage) with a tester that is homozygous recessive for both traits: AaBb × aabb."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In certain cattle, crossing a red cow with a white cow produces 'roan' offspring (hairs are a mix of distinct red and white). This is:",
        "options": ["Incomplete dominance", "Codominance", "Multiple alleles", "Epistasis"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Roan cattle exhibit codominance. Both alleles (red and white) are fully and distinctly expressed in the heterozygote, resulting in a phenotype showing both colors separately."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Recombination frequencies: A-B = 12%, B-C = 7%, A-C = 5%. What is the gene order?",
        "options": ["A-B-C", "B-A-C", "A-C-B", "C-A-B"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The smallest RF is between A and C (5%), so they are closest. Since A-B (12%) > B-C (7%), B must be farther from A than C is. The linear order that fits is A - C - B, with distances A-C=5, C-B=7, and A-B=12."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason why linked genes do not follow Mendel's second law?",
        "options": ["They are located on the same chromosome.", "They undergo crossing over too frequently.", "They are always recessive.", "They only occur in prokaryotes."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment assumes genes are on different chromosomes. Linked genes are physically located on the same chromosome and therefore tend to be inherited together, violating independent assortment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a cross AaBbCc × AaBbCc, what is the probability of producing an aabbcc offspring?",
        "options": ["1/16", "1/32", "1/64", "1/8"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For each independently assorting gene, the probability of homozygous recessive (aa) from Aa x Aa is 1/4. For three genes, the combined probability is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/64."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A trait is passed from mothers to all offspring (male and female), but never from fathers. This suggests:",
        "options": ["X-linked dominant", "Autosomal dominant", "Mitochondrial inheritance", "Y-linked"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother (via the egg's cytoplasm) and is passed on to all her children, regardless of sex. This pattern is distinct from sex-linked inheritance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The phenotypic ratio of 9:3:4 in a dihybrid cross is a classic indicator of:",
        "options": ["Incomplete dominance", "Codominance", "Recessive epistasis", "Lethal alleles"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A 9:3:4 ratio results from recessive epistasis. In this interaction, the homozygous recessive genotype at one gene locus (e.g., 'ee') masks the expression of alleles at a second gene locus, converting the typical 9:3:3:1 into 9:3:4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a polygenic trait in humans?",
        "options": ["Cystic fibrosis", "ABO blood group", "Skin color", "Huntington's disease"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Skin color is a classic polygenic trait, influenced by the additive effects of multiple genes, resulting in a continuous range of phenotypes. The other options are Mendelian (single-gene) traits."
