        "question": "What is the primary function of the nuclear pore complex?",
        "options": [
          "To synthesize ribosomal RNA",
          "To regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The nuclear pore complex is a sophisticated channel that actively regulates the transport of macromolecules like RNA and proteins, allowing for selective exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm."

          "A region of condensed chromatin"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The nuclear envelope is a double lipid bilayer—an inner and outer nuclear membrane—that encloses the genetic material. It is perforated by nuclear pores that control molecular traffic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the nucleolus located, and what is its primary role?",
        "options": [
          "Attached to the rough ER; protein synthesis",
          "In the cytoplasm; ATP production",
          "Inside the nucleus; ribosome assembly",
          "Embedded in the nuclear envelope; DNA replication"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The nucleolus is a dense region within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized and ribosomal subunits are assembled before their export to the cytoplasm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the structural difference between chromatin and chromosomes?",
        "options": [
          "They are made of different types of DNA",
          "Chromatin is condensed DNA, while chromosomes are decondensed",
          "Chromatin is decondensed DNA and proteins, while chromosomes are highly condensed structures",
          "Chromosomes are only found in prokaryotes"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Chromatin is the complex of DNA and histone proteins that exists in a loose, fibrous form during interphase, allowing for gene expression. Chromosomes are the same material tightly condensed and visible during cell division."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which component provides structural support to the nuclear envelope?",
        "options": [
          "The nucleolus",
          "The nuclear lamina",
          "The chromatin",
          "The nuclear pores"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The nuclear lamina is a dense meshwork of intermediate filaments (lamins) lining the inner surface of the nuclear envelope. It provides mechanical support and helps organize the nuclear contents."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During protein synthesis, where is mRNA transcribed and where does it travel to be translated?",
        "options": [
          "Transcribed in the cytoplasm; translated in the nucleus",
          "Transcribed in the nucleus; translated in the cytoplasm",
          "Transcribed and translated in the nucleus",
          "Transcribed and translated in the cytoplasm"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "mRNA is transcribed from DNA within the nucleus. It is then processed and exported through nuclear pores to the cytoplasm, where it binds to ribosomes for translation into protein."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the primary proteins associated with DNA in chromatin?",
        "options": [
          "Actin and myosin",
          "Tubulin and dynein",
          "Histones",
          "Keratin"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Histones are the primary protein components of chromatin. DNA wraps around histone complexes to form nucleosomes, which help package the long DNA molecules into a more compact, manageable form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the nuclear envelope during mitosis in most animal cells?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes more rigid to protect the chromosomes.",
          "It expands to accommodate chromosome movement.",
          "It disassembles into small vesicles.",
          "It remains completely intact."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In open mitosis (characteristic of most animal cells), the nuclear envelope disassembles to allow the spindle fibers direct access to the chromosomes. It reforms around the separated chromosome sets in the daughter cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The outer membrane of the nuclear envelope is continuous with what other cellular structure?",
        "options": [
          "The Golgi apparatus",
          "The rough endoplasmic reticulum",
          "The plasma membrane",
          "The mitochondrial membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The outer membrane of the nuclear envelope is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and is often studded with ribosomes, reflecting its role in protein synthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecules would require active transport through a nuclear pore to enter the nucleus?",
        "options": [
          "A small, nonpolar molecule like oxygen",
          "A fully assembled ribosome",
          "A water molecule",
          "A small ion like potassium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Small molecules can diffuse freely through nuclear pores, but large macromolecules and complexes, like fully assembled ribosomal subunits or transcription factors, require active, signal-mediated transport."
