        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The core structure of all biological membranes is a phospholipid bilayer - two layers of phospholipids arranged with their hydrophobic tails facing inward and hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous environment."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the membrane described as 'selectively permeable'?",
        "options": [
          "It allows all substances to pass freely",
          "It prevents any substances from crossing",
          "It allows some substances to cross more easily than others",
          "It only allows water to pass through"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
