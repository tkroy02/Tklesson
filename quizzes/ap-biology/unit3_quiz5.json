        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Competitive inhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration, which increases the likelihood of substrate rather than inhibitor binding to the active site."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is enzyme specificity important in metabolic pathways?",
        "options": [
          "It allows multiple reactions to occur simultaneously without interference",
          "It makes enzymes more expensive to produce",
          "It limits the number of possible reactions",
          "It requires more different types of enzymes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enzyme specificity ensures that each step in a metabolic pathway is controlled separately, allowing precise regulation and preventing unwanted side reactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of activation energy in chemical reactions?",

          "It is the energy consumed by enzymes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Activation energy is the initial energy investment required to break existing bonds and start a chemical reaction, creating an energy barrier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do enzymes stabilize the transition state of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "By increasing the activation energy",
          "By binding most tightly to the transition state",
          "By consuming the transition state",
          "By creating a permanent bond with the substrate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Enzymes work by binding most tightly to the transition state (the high-energy intermediate between substrate and product), thereby stabilizing it and lowering the activation energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would be the consequence if a key enzyme in a metabolic pathway stopped functioning?",
        "options": [
          "The entire pathway would accelerate",
          "The pathway would stop or be significantly disrupted",
          "Other enzymes would take over its function",
          "The cell would produce more of that enzyme"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since metabolic pathways are sequential, with each enzyme catalyzing a specific step, the failure of one enzyme can stop the entire pathway, potentially causing cellular dysfunction."
