    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing temperature initially affect enzyme reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "Rate decreases continuously",
          "Rate increases due to more frequent collisions",
          "Rate stays the same",
          "Rate becomes unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At lower temperatures, increasing temperature provides more kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions between enzymes and substrates, thus increasing the reaction rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does enzyme activity decrease at very high temperatures?",
        "options": [
          "Substrates become too energetic",
          "Enzymes denature and lose their shape",
          "The reaction becomes too fast to control",
          "Products re-bind to enzymes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "High temperatures disrupt the hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions that maintain an enzyme's specific 3D shape, causing denaturation and loss of function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the temperature at which an enzyme has maximum activity called?",
        "options": [
          "Denaturation point",
          "Optimum temperature",
          "Maximum velocity",
          "Saturation point"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The optimum temperature is the specific temperature at which an enzyme's catalytic activity is highest, balancing increased collision frequency with the risk of denaturation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does pH affect enzyme activity?",
        "options": [
          "It has no effect on enzymes",
          "It only affects the substrate, not the enzyme",
          "It can alter the enzyme's shape and charge of the active site",
          "It only affects the rate of product formation"
        ],
        "answer": " ",
        "explanation": "pH affects the charges on amino acid residues in the active site and can disrupt hydrogen bonding, altering the enzyme's shape and its ability to bind substrates effectively."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Pepsin, a digestive enzyme in the stomach, works best at a pH of 2. What would happen to its activity in the small intestine where pH is around 8?",
        "options": [
          "Its activity would increase",
          "Its activity would decrease significantly",
          "Its activity would remain the same",
          "It would start digesting different substrates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pepsin is adapted to the stomach's acidic environment. At the basic pH of the small intestine, it would denature and lose most of its activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the reaction rate as substrate concentration increases, assuming a constant amount of enzyme?",
        "options": [
          "Rate increases linearly indefinitely",
          "Rate increases until all active sites are occupied",
          "Rate decreases as substrate interferes",
          "Rate remains constant regardless of substrate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The rate increases with substrate concentration until a point where all enzyme active sites are continuously occupied (saturation). Beyond this point, the rate plateaus at Vmax."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the term for the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of its maximum velocity (Â½ Vmax)?",
        "options": [
          "Saturation constant",
          "Michaelis constant (Km)",
          "Optimum concentration",
          "Inhibition point"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Michaelis constant (Km) is a measure of an enzyme's affinity for its substrate. A low Km indicates high affinity, as the enzyme reaches half its maximum speed at a low substrate concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A competitive inhibitor affects enzyme activity by:",
        "options": [
          "Binding to an allosteric site and changing the enzyme's shape",
          "Binding to the active site, competing with the substrate",
          "Denaturing the enzyme permanently",
          "Binding to the substrate instead of the enzyme"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A competitive inhibitor has a molecular structure similar to the substrate, allowing it to bind reversibly to the active site and block the substrate from binding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a non-competitive inhibitor reduce enzyme activity?",
        "options": [
          "By binding to the active site",
          "By binding to an allosteric site and changing the enzyme's shape",
          "By increasing the enzyme's Km",
          "By denaturing the substrate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A non-competitive inhibitor binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme, causing a conformational change that reduces the enzyme's catalytic efficiency, often decreasing Vmax without changing Km."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can the effect of a competitive inhibitor be overcome?",
        "options": [
          "By decreasing the pH",
          "By increasing the substrate concentration",
          "By decreasing the temperature",
          "By adding a non-competitive inhibitor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because a competitive inhibitor competes directly with the substrate for the active site, flooding the system with substrate outcompetes the inhibitor and restores the reaction rate towards Vmax."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of a non-competitive inhibitor on Vmax and Km?",
        "options": [
          "Decreases Vmax; no change to Km",
          "Increases Vmax; decreases Km",
          "No change to Vmax; increases Km",
          "Decreases both Vmax and Km"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A non-competitive inhibitor reduces the number of functional enzyme molecules, thereby decreasing the maximum reaction rate (Vmax), but does not affect the enzyme's affinity for the substrate (Km remains unchanged)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is allosteric activation?",
        "options": [
          "An activator binds to the active site",
          "An activator binds to a site other than the active site, increasing activity",
          "An activator denatures the enzyme",
          "An activator competes with the inhibitor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An allosteric activator binds to a regulatory site on the enzyme, inducing a conformational change that increases the enzyme's affinity for its substrate or its catalytic efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Heavy metal ions like lead or mercury can irreversibly inhibit enzymes by:",
        "options": [
          "Competing with the substrate",
          "Binding strongly to cysteine residues, disrupting disulfide bonds",
          "Acting as allosteric activators",
          "Increasing the pH of the environment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Heavy metals can bind covalently to sulfhydryl groups (-SH) on cysteine residues, disrupting the enzyme's tertiary structure and causing irreversible inhibition, which is a form of toxicity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is operating at its Vmax, what is the limiting factor for the reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "Substrate concentration",
          "Enzyme concentration",
          "pH of the solution",
          "Inhibitor concentration"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At Vmax, all enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate. The only way to increase the rate further is to add more enzyme."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an enzyme's optimal pH often relate to its environment?",
        "options": [
          "There is no relationship",
          "It is always neutral (pH 7)",
          "It is adapted to the pH where it normally functions",
          "It is the same for all enzymes in an organism"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Enzymes evolve to have an optimal pH that matches their working environment (e.g., pepsin in the acidic stomach, trypsin in the basic small intestine)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is feedback inhibition in a metabolic pathway?",
        "options": [
          "The product of a pathway inhibits an early enzyme",
          "The substrate activates the last enzyme",
          "An inhibitor feeds back to activate the enzyme",
          "The enzyme inhibits its own product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Feedback inhibition is a regulatory mechanism where the end product of a metabolic pathway binds to an allosteric site on an enzyme early in the pathway, shutting down the pathway when the product is abundant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What visual shape does a graph of reaction rate vs. substrate concentration typically have for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction?",
        "options": [
          "A straight line increasing",
          "A straight line decreasing",
          "A hyperbolic curve",
          "A bell-shaped curve"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The graph is hyperbolic, showing an increasing rate that eventually levels off at Vmax as the enzyme active sites become saturated with substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a graph without an inhibitor, how does a competitive inhibitor change the graph of reaction rate vs. substrate concentration?",
        "options": [
          "It lowers the Vmax and the curve plateaus lower",
          "It increases the Km, requiring more substrate to reach Â½ Vmax",
          "It decreases the Km, requiring less substrate",
          "It changes the graph to a straight line"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A competitive inhibitor increases the apparent Km (the curve shifts to the right), meaning more substrate is needed to achieve half of Vmax, but the Vmax remains unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason enzyme activity is so sensitive to its environmental conditions?",
        "options": [
          "Enzymes are consumed in reactions",
          "Enzyme function depends on a precise, fragile 3D structure",
          "Enzymes are made of unstable materials",
          "Substrates are always rare"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An enzyme's catalytic power comes from its specific three-dimensional shape, which is maintained by weak chemical interactions (like hydrogen bonds) that are easily disrupted by changes in temperature, pH, or the presence of inhibitors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an experiment, adding more enzyme to a reaction mixture increases the rate. What can you conclude was the initial limiting factor?",
        "options": [
          "The substrate concentration was too low",
          "The temperature was too high",
          "The enzyme concentration was limiting the rate",
          "An inhibitor was present"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If adding more enzyme increases the reaction rate, it indicates that the system was not yet saturated with enzyme, meaning enzyme concentration was the limiting factor for the rate."
