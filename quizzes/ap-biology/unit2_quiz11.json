      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental process by which a less specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type?",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following animal cells is specialized for transmitting electrical signals?",
        "options": [
          "Erythrocyte (red blood cell)",

          "Adipocyte (fat cell)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Neurons are highly specialized for rapid communication. They have long extensions (axons and dendrites) and contain ion channels and neurotransmitters that allow them to generate and transmit electrical and chemical signals."

          "Transport of sugars"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Root hair cells are specialized epidermal cells that project from the root surface, dramatically increasing the surface area for the absorption of water and mineral nutrients from the soil."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What structural adaptation makes red blood cells (erythrocytes) efficient at oxygen transport?",
        "options": [
          "They have a large nucleus for protein synthesis.",
          "They are packed with mitochondria for energy.",
          "They are biconcave discs with no nucleus, maximizing space for hemoglobin.",
          "They have contractile proteins for movement."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The biconcave shape increases the surface area for gas exchange, and the lack of a nucleus and other organelles allows more room for hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Sclerenchyma cells have thick, lignified secondary cell walls and are dead at maturity. They provide rigid support to parts of the plant that are no longer growing, such as fibers in wood and bark."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of guard cells in plant leaves?",

          "To transport water through the xylem"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Guard cells are specialized pairs of cells that surround each stoma. They change shape by taking in or losing water, which opens or closes the stoma to control gas exchange (CO2 in, O2 and H2O vapor out) and transpiration."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a pancreatic beta cell demonstrate cellular specialization?",

          "It generates electrical impulses.",
          "It synthesizes and secretes the hormone insulin.",
          "It engulfs pathogens by phagocytosis."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pancreatic beta cells are specialized endocrine cells. Their primary function is to monitor blood glucose levels and secrete the hormone insulin in response, which is crucial for regulating blood sugar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental molecular basis for cell differentiation?",
        "options": [
          "Different cells contain different genes.",
          "Different cells activate (express) different genes.",
          "Different cells have different types of DNA.",
          "Different cells lose unnecessary genes."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Nearly all cells in an organism have the same genome. Differentiation occurs due to differential gene expressionâ€”different sets of genes are turned on or off in different cell types, leading to the production of different proteins and thus, different structures and functions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "They are only found in embryos."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can both renew themselves through cell division (self-renewal) and differentiate into various specialized cell types under certain conditions. They are found in both embryos and adult tissues."

          "Gas exchange"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Xylem vessel elements are specialized cells that are dead at maturity. Their end walls break down, forming long, hollow tubes ideal for the efficient transport of water and dissolved minerals from roots to shoots."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is a sperm cell structurally specialized for its function?",
        "options": [

          "It has a flagellum for motility and a streamlined head containing DNA."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Sperm cells are highly specialized for fertilization. The flagellum provides motility to reach the egg, the head is packed with DNA and capped with an acrosome containing enzymes to penetrate the egg, and the midpiece is packed with mitochondria for energy."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a key difference between parenchyma and sclerenchyma cells in plants?",
        "options": [
          "Only parenchyma cells have cell walls.",
          "Parenchyma cells are often alive at maturity, while sclerenchyma cells are dead.",
          "Sclerenchyma cells are the main site of photosynthesis.",
          "Parenchyma cells provide rigid structural support."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Parenchyma cells are typically alive at maturity and have thin, flexible walls. They perform many functions like photosynthesis and storage. Sclerenchyma cells, in contrast, are dead at maturity and have thick, lignified walls specialized for support."
