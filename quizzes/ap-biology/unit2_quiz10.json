      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary role of signal transduction in cell communication?",
        "options": [
          "To produce more signaling molecules",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Signal transduction is the process of converting an extracellular signal into an intracellular response. It often involves a cascade of molecular interactions that relay, amplify, and distribute the signal."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A ligand is a molecule that specifically binds to a larger molecule, such as a receptor. In cell signaling, the signaling molecule acts as the ligand that binds to its specific receptor."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Receptors have specific binding sites that are complementary in shape and chemistry to their particular signaling molecules, ensuring that only the correct signal triggers a response in the target cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of second messengers in signal transduction?",
        "options": [
          "They are the initial signaling molecules",
          "They relay signals from receptors to target molecules in the cell",
          "They terminate the signaling process",
          "They serve as the cellular response"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Second messengers are small, non-protein molecules or ions (like cAMP, Ca²⁺, or IP₃) that relay signals inside the cell after the first messenger (the extracellular signal) has been received. They help amplify and distribute the signal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of membrane receptor works by activating G proteins when a ligand binds?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "GPCRs are a major class of membrane receptors that, when activated by ligand binding, interact with G proteins, which then activate other intracellular signaling pathways."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during the cellular response phase of cell signaling?",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is signal amplification important in cell signaling?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure the signal weakens as it spreads",
          "To allow a small number of signaling molecules to affect major cellular changes",
          "To prevent any cellular response from occurring",
          "To make the signaling process slower and more controlled"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Signal amplification enables a single signaling molecule to activate multiple downstream molecules, creating a large intracellular response from a minimal extracellular signal. This makes cellular responses efficient and significant."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Signal termination is crucial for preventing over-response. Common mechanisms include degradation of the signaling molecule, receptor desensitization or internalization, and degradation of second messengers."

          "Rapid secretion of hormones",
          "Synthesis of new proteins over time",
          "Quick change in cell movement"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Signals that affect gene expression (often through intracellular receptors or certain membrane receptor pathways) lead to slower, longer-lasting responses like the synthesis of new proteins, which can alter cell function, growth, or differentiation over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do ligand-gated ion channels function in signal transduction?",

          "They directly alter gene transcription"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ligand-gated ion channels are membrane receptors that open or close in response to binding a specific signaling molecule, allowing specific ions to flow across the membrane, which can rapidly change the membrane potential or ion concentration in the cell."
