      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pea plant with genotype Rr (R = red, r = white) is crossed with a homozygous recessive plant (rr). Which fraction of the offspring will display the dominant phenotype?",
        "options": ["25%", "50%", "75%", "100%"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a test cross for a single trait. Rr x rr yields 1/2 Rr (red, dominant) and 1/2 rr (white, recessive). Therefore, 50% show the dominant phenotype."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population has the following genotypes for a single trait: 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa. Which statement about the phenotypic ratio is correct if A is dominant?",
        "options": ["3 dominant : 1 recessive", "1 dominant : 3 recessive", "1:2:1", "All offspring display the dominant phenotype"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With A dominant, both AA and Aa individuals show the dominant phenotype. This constitutes 25% + 50% = 75% of the population. The aa individuals (25%) show the recessive phenotype. The ratio is 3:1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heterozygous individual for a trait shows the dominant phenotype. Which is true regarding its alleles?",
        "options": ["Both are dominant", "One dominant, one recessive", "Both recessive", "Multiple alleles present"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A heterozygote has two different alleles for a gene. In simple dominance, the dominant allele is expressed, masking the recessive allele in the phenotype."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A breeder crosses two heterozygous plants for a trait (Tt × Tt). Which fraction of offspring is expected to be homozygous?",
        "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A cross of Tt x Tt yields a genotypic ratio of 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt. Homozygous offspring are TT and tt, which together make up 2 out of 4 possibilities, or 1/2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plant expresses a recessive trait. Which is always true about its genotype?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Heterozygous", "Homozygous recessive", "Phenotype cannot determine genotype"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A recessive phenotype is only expressed when no dominant allele is present. Therefore, the genotype must be homozygous recessive (e.g., aa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cross between Aa × aa is performed. Which fraction of offspring is heterozygous?",
        "options": ["0", "1/4", "1/2", "1"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This cross produces two genotypes: Aa (heterozygous) and aa (homozygous recessive), each with a probability of 1/2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A child displays the dominant phenotype, but one parent is homozygous recessive. Which genotype could the child have?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Heterozygous", "Homozygous recessive", "Cannot be determined"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If one parent is homozygous recessive (aa), they can only contribute a recessive allele (a) to the child. For the child to show the dominant phenotype, they must have received a dominant allele from the other parent. Therefore, the child must be heterozygous (Aa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A homozygous dominant plant is crossed with a heterozygote. Which fraction of offspring is homozygous dominant?",
        "options": ["0", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cross: AA x Aa. The AA parent always contributes A. The Aa parent contributes A 50% of the time and a 50% of the time. This yields 50% AA and 50% Aa offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population has genotype frequencies: 40% AA, 40% Aa, 20% aa. What is the frequency of the recessive allele?",
        "options": ["0.2", "0.4", "0.5", "0.6"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The frequency of the recessive allele (a) is calculated as: q = (2*aa + Aa) / (2*total). q = (2*0.2 + 0.4) / 2 = (0.4 + 0.4) / 2 = 0.8 / 2 = 0.4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heterozygous cross (Bb × Bb) is performed. Which fraction of offspring will be homozygous dominant?",
        "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "0"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cross Bb x Bb yields 1 BB : 2 Bb : 1 bb. Homozygous dominant (BB) offspring represent 1 out of 4, or 1/4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pea plant with genotype RrYy is self-crossed. The R gene controls flower color, and Y gene controls seed shape. Which statement is correct?",
        "options": ["The plant is homozygous for both traits", "The plant is heterozygous for both traits", "The plant is homozygous R only", "The plant is heterozygous R only"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The genotype RrYy indicates the plant carries two different alleles for the R gene (R and r) and two different alleles for the Y gene (Y and y). Therefore, it is heterozygous for both traits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A child exhibits a recessive trait. Both parents show the dominant phenotype. Which is true about the parents’ genotypes?",
        "options": ["Both homozygous dominant", "Both heterozygous", "One heterozygous, one homozygous dominant", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a child to express a recessive trait (aa), they must inherit a recessive allele from each parent. Since both parents show the dominant phenotype, they must each carry at least one dominant allele. The only way for them to have a recessive child is if they are both heterozygous (Aa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cross produces offspring: 1 AA, 2 Aa, 1 aa. Which fraction of offspring is heterozygous?",
        "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The genotypic ratio is 1:2:1. The heterozygous (Aa) individuals represent 2 out of the total 4 offspring, or 1/2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A parent shows a dominant trait but has unknown genotype. Crossing it with a homozygous recessive produces some recessive offspring. Which is true about the parent?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Heterozygous", "Homozygous recessive", "Polygenic"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a test cross. If the unknown parent were homozygous dominant (AA), all offspring would show the dominant phenotype. The appearance of any recessive offspring (aa) proves the unknown parent contributed a recessive allele (a), meaning it is heterozygous (Aa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population has equal frequencies of A and a alleles. Which is true about genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?",
        "options": ["50% AA, 50% aa", "25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa", "25% AA, 25% Aa, 50% aa", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If p = q = 0.5, then p² = 0.25 (AA), 2pq = 0.5 (Aa), and q² = 0.25 (aa)."
      },

        "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A cross of Aa x Aa yields 3/4 of offspring with the dominant phenotype (AA and Aa) and 1/4 with the recessive phenotype (aa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heterozygous individual is crossed with a homozygous recessive individual. What fraction of offspring is expected to show the recessive phenotype?",
        "options": ["0", "1/4", "1/2", "1"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cross: Aa x aa. The recessive phenotype (aa) occurs when the heterozygous parent contributes the recessive allele (a), which happens 50% of the time. The homozygous recessive parent always contributes a recessive allele."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plant expresses the dominant phenotype but is heterozygous. Which is true about its alleles?",
        "options": ["Both dominant", "One dominant, one recessive", "Both recessive", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A heterozygous individual possesses one dominant and one recessive allele. The dominant phenotype is expressed because the dominant allele masks the effect of the recessive allele."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two heterozygotes (Aa × Aa) are crossed. Which fraction of offspring will be homozygous?",
        "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The cross Aa x Aa yields offspring with the genotypic ratio 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 tt. Homozygous offspring are AA and aa, which together constitute 2 out of 4 possibilities, or 1/2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A child is heterozygous for a trait. One parent is homozygous dominant and the other is homozygous recessive. Which fraction of offspring from this cross would be heterozygous?",
        "options": ["0", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Cross: AA x aa. The AA parent contributes only A alleles, and the aa parent contributes only a alleles. All offspring from this cross will be Aa (heterozygous)."
