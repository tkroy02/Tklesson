        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary structural shape of a DNA molecule?",
        "options": ["Double helix", "Globular protein", "Single strand", "Triple helix"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA forms a double helix structure, as discovered by Watson and Crick using Franklin's X-ray diffraction images."

        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a component of a DNA nucleotide?",
        "options": ["Nitrogenous base", "Deoxyribose sugar", "Amino acid", "Phosphate group"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A DNA nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. Amino acids are building blocks of proteins, not DNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Chargaff's rules, which base always pairs with Cytosine?",
        "options": ["Thymine", "Adenine", "Uracil", "Guanine"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Chargaff's rules state that Cytosine (C) always pairs with Guanine (G) through three hydrogen bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of bond holds the two strands of DNA together between the nitrogenous bases?",
        "options": ["Hydrogen bonds", "Peptide bonds", "Covalent bonds", "Ionic bonds"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen bonds hold complementary base pairs together: A-T pairs have 2 hydrogen bonds, C-G pairs have 3 hydrogen bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a DNA sample contains 20% Adenine, what percentage of the sample is Guanine?",
        "options": ["50%", "80%", "20%", "30%"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "According to Chargaff's rules: A = T and C = G. If A = 20%, then T = 20%, leaving 60% for C + G. Since C = G, each is 30%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which enzyme is responsible for 'unzipping' the DNA double helix during replication?",
        "options": ["Helicase", "Ligase", "Primase", "DNA Polymerase"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helicase unwinds and separates the two DNA strands by breaking hydrogen bonds, creating the replication fork."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During replication, in which direction is the new DNA strand always synthesized?",
        "options": ["3' to 5'", "Left to right", "Top to bottom", "5' to 3'"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a growing strand, so synthesis always proceeds 5' → 3'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the short fragments of DNA produced on the lagging strand called?",
        "options": ["Primers", "Introns", "Nucleosomes", "Okazaki fragments"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Okazaki fragments are short, discontinuous DNA segments synthesized on the lagging strand, later joined by ligase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which enzyme 'glues' or joins DNA fragments together, particularly on the lagging strand?",
        "options": ["RNase", "DNA Polymerase I", "Topoisomerase", "Ligase"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "DNA ligase seals nicks between Okazaki fragments by forming phosphodiester bonds, creating a continuous strand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "DNA replication is described as 'semi-conservative' because:",
        "options": [
          "The double helix only partially unzips",
          "Each new molecule contains one original strand and one new strand",
          "The process uses very little energy",
          "Only half of the DNA is copied during each cycle"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In semi-conservative replication, each daughter DNA molecule contains one original (parental) strand and one newly synthesized strand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of DNA Primase in replication?",
        "options": [
          "To unwind the double helix",
          "To add the final poly-A tail",

          "To remove errors in the DNA sequence"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Primase synthesizes short RNA primers that provide a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase to begin adding nucleotides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'backbone' of the DNA molecule?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The DNA backbone consists of alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups connected by phosphodiester bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the specific name of the sugar found in DNA?",
        "options": ["Lactose", "Deoxyribose", "Ribose", "Glucose"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "DNA contains deoxyribose sugar (lacks an oxygen atom at the 2' carbon), while RNA contains ribose sugar."
      },

        "question": "Which nitrogenous base is a pyrimidine that pairs with Guanine?",
        "options": ["Cytosine", "Uracil", "Thymine", "Adenine"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cytosine is a pyrimidine that pairs with Guanine (a purine) through three hydrogen bonds in DNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The two strands of a DNA molecule run in opposite directions. This property is known as being:",
        "options": ["Antiparallel", "Perpendicular", "Co-dominant", "Symmetrical"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA strands are antiparallel: one runs 5'→3', the other runs 3'→5'. This affects replication machinery directionality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of DNA in a cell?",
        "options": ["Building cell walls", "Transporting oxygen", "Providing immediate energy", "Storing genetic information"],

        "options": ["DNA Polymerase", "Ligase", "Amylase", "Helicase"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA polymerase has proofreading (3'→5' exonuclease) activity that detects and removes incorrectly paired nucleotides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sequence of DNA that codes for a specific protein is called a:",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A gene is a segment of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or functional RNA molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the lagging strand have to be synthesized in fragments?",
        "options": [
          "Because the lagging strand is shorter than the leading strand",
          "Because there aren't enough nucleotides available",
          "Because it lacks a phosphate backbone",
          "Because DNA polymerase only works in the 5' to 3' direction"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes 5'→3', and the lagging strand template runs 3'→5', it must be synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments."
