      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plant has two alleles for flower color: one for red (R) and one for white (r). Its genotype is RR. What is the plant’s phenotype?",
        "options": ["Red", "White", "Heterozygous", "Homozygous"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The genotype RR is homozygous dominant. The dominant allele (R) for red color is expressed, determining the phenotype."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plant has the genotype Rr for flower color. Which statement is correct?",
        "options": ["Plant is homozygous dominant", "Plant is heterozygous", "Plant is homozygous recessive", "Plant’s phenotype is white"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The genotype Rr consists of two different alleles for the same gene, which is the definition of heterozygous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cross between two heterozygous tall pea plants (Tt × Tt) is performed. Which of the following is the genotypic ratio of offspring?",
        "options": ["1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt", "3 tall : 1 short", "1 Tt : 1 tt", "2 TT : 2 Tt"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monohybrid cross between two heterozygotes yields a genotypic ratio of 1 homozygous dominant (TT) : 2 heterozygous (Tt) : 1 homozygous recessive (tt)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A homozygous recessive individual (aa) is crossed with a heterozygote (Aa). What proportion of offspring will be homozygous recessive?",
        "options": ["0", "1/4", "1/2", "1"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The cross is aa x Aa. The aa parent always contributes 'a'. The Aa parent contributes 'a' 50% of the time. Therefore, 50% (1/2) of offspring will be aa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pea plant is heterozygous for a single trait. Which of the following describes its alleles?",
        "options": ["Two identical alleles", "One dominant and one recessive allele", "Two recessive alleles", "Multiple genes for the trait"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A heterozygote, by definition, has two different alleles. In classic Mendelian genetics, this is typically one dominant and one recessive allele."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a population, the alleles A and a occur at equal frequency. Which of the following terms describes this situation?",
        "options": ["Homozygous", "Heterozygous", "Allelic equilibrium", "Co-dominance"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When two alleles are present at equal frequencies (p = q = 0.5), it is often referred to as a state of allelic equilibrium, a key concept in population genetics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person has genotype AA for a trait. Which of the following is true?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Homozygous recessive", "Heterozygous", "Co-dominant"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The genotype AA has two identical copies of the dominant allele, making it homozygous dominant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pea plant displays a dominant phenotype. Its genotype could be:",
        "options": ["AA only", "Aa only", "AA or Aa", "aa"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A dominant phenotype masks the recessive allele. It can be expressed by either a homozygous dominant (AA) or a heterozygous (Aa) genotype."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a cross of Aa × Aa, what is the probability of producing a homozygous offspring?",
        "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The cross Aa x Aa produces offspring with genotypes: 1 AA, 2 Aa, 1 tt. The homozygous offspring are AA and aa, which together make up 2 out of 4 possibilities, or 1/2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two heterozygous parents (Bb × Bb) produce offspring. Which of the following describes a heterozygous child?",
        "options": ["Same alleles (BB or bb)", "One dominant and one recessive allele", "Two recessive alleles only", "Cannot be determined"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A heterozygous individual has two different alleles for a gene, which in this context means one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A breeder crosses two plants, one homozygous dominant (TT) and one homozygous recessive (tt). What percentage of offspring will be heterozygous?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The cross TT x tt produces only Tt offspring, as the TT parent only contributes T alleles and the tt parent only contributes t alleles. All offspring are heterozygous (100%)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In humans, brown eyes (B) are dominant over blue (b). Which genotype results in a blue-eyed phenotype?",
        "options": ["BB", "Bb", "bb", "B_"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The recessive phenotype (blue eyes) is only expressed when an individual lacks a dominant B allele, meaning they must have the homozygous recessive genotype (bb)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pea plant has genotype RrYy (R = round, r = wrinkled; Y = yellow, y = green). Which statement is correct?",
        "options": ["Plant is homozygous for both traits", "Plant is heterozygous for both traits", "Plant is homozygous for R only", "Plant is heterozygous for R only"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The genotype RrYy indicates the plant has two different alleles for the seed shape gene (R and r) and two different alleles for the seed color gene (Y and y). Therefore, it is heterozygous for both traits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Punnett square shows 4 offspring: 1 RR, 2 Rr, 1 rr. Which statement is correct?",
        "options": ["Genotypic ratio = 3:1", "Phenotypic ratio = 1:2:1", "Genotypic ratio = 1:2:1", "All offspring display recessive phenotype"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The results 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr represent the classic genotypic ratio of 1:2:1 from a cross between two heterozygotes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a heterozygous cross Aa × Aa, what fraction of offspring will display the dominant phenotype?",
        "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Offspring with genotypes AA or Aa will display the dominant phenotype. These constitute 3 out of the 4 possible genotype outcomes (AA, Aa, aA, aa), or 3/4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plant is homozygous for a recessive trait. Its genotype is:",
        "options": ["AA", "Aa", "aa", "BB"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Homozygous for a recessive trait means the individual possesses two copies of the recessive allele, represented as aa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a dihybrid cross (AaBb × AaBb), what fraction of offspring is expected to be heterozygous for both traits?",
        "options": ["1/16", "1/4", "1/2", "1/8"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The probability of being heterozygous for one trait (Aa) is 1/2. For two independent traits, the probability of being heterozygous for both (AaBb) is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person carries one dominant allele for a trait and one recessive allele. Which term best describes this genotype?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Homozygous recessive", "Heterozygous", "Polygenic"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is the literal definition of a heterozygous genotype: possessing two different alleles for a gene, one dominant and one recessive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A breeder wants to ensure all offspring are heterozygous. Which cross should they perform?",
        "options": ["AA × AA", "AA × aa", "Aa × Aa", "aa × aa"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A cross between a homozygous dominant (AA) and a homozygous recessive (aa) will always produce offspring that inherit one dominant and one recessive allele, resulting in 100% heterozygous (Aa) offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Punnett square predicts offspring for a monohybrid cross. 1 offspring is RR, 2 are Rr, 1 is rr. Which term describes the individuals with different alleles for the trait?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Homozygous recessive", "Heterozygous", "Polygenic"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Individuals with the genotype Rr have two different alleles (R and r) for the trait, making them heterozygous."
