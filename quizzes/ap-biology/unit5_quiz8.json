    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pea plant shows a dominant phenotype for flower color. Its genotype is unknown. A cross with a homozygous recessive plant produces 50% dominant and 50% recessive offspring. What is the genotype of the unknown plant?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Heterozygous", "Homozygous recessive", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A test cross yielding a 1:1 phenotypic ratio is diagnostic for a heterozygous genotype. The unknown plant (Aa) crossed with (aa) produces equal numbers of Aa (dominant) and aa (recessive) offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plant has genotype AaBb. Gametes are formed during meiosis. Which concept explains the variety of gametes produced?",
        "options": ["Law of segregation", "Law of independent assortment", "Pleiotropy", "Epistasis"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Law of Independent Assortment states that alleles for different genes segregate independently into gametes. For AaBb, this allows for four gamete types: AB, Ab, aB, and ab."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monohybrid cross (Aa × Aa), what is the expected phenotypic ratio?",
        "options": ["3:1", "1:2:1", "1:1", "2:2"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Assuming complete dominance, the offspring of Aa x Aa will show a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a dihybrid cross (AaBb × AaBb), what fraction of offspring is expected to show both dominant traits?",
        "options": ["9/16", "3/16", "1/4", "1/16"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For independent assortment with complete dominance, the phenotype 'both dominant' (A_B_) occurs in 9 out of the 16 possible genotypic combinations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heterozygous plant (Rr) is crossed with a homozygous recessive plant (rr). R = red flowers, r = white. Which is true about the offspring?",
        "options": ["All red", "50% red, 50% white", "25% red, 75% white", "All white"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The cross Rr x rr is a test cross, producing a 1:1 phenotypic ratio: half Rr (red) and half rr (white)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A child’s blood type is AB. The mother is type A and the father is type B. Which inheritance pattern explains this?",
        "options": ["Complete dominance", "Incomplete dominance", "Codominance", "Polygenic inheritance"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The ABO blood group system exhibits codominance. The A and B alleles are both fully expressed in the phenotype of an individual with the AB genotype."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cross of Rr × Rr produces 1 RR, 2 Rr, and 1 rr offspring. What is the genotypic ratio?",
        "options": ["3:1", "1:2:1", "2:2", "1:1:1:1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The given results—1 homozygous dominant, 2 heterozygous, 1 homozygous recessive—represent the classic 1:2:1 genotypic ratio for a monohybrid cross."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pea plant shows a heterozygous phenotype for a trait with incomplete dominance. Which is true about its genotype?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Homozygous recessive", "Heterozygous", "Cannot be determined"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In incomplete dominance, the heterozygote produces a unique intermediate phenotype. Therefore, an individual showing the 'heterozygous phenotype' (e.g., pink from red and white) must have a heterozygous genotype (Rr)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A fruit fly with genotype X^wY (white-eyed male) is crossed with a red-eyed female X^WX^w. What fraction of male offspring will have white eyes?",
        "options": ["0", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Male offspring inherit their X chromosome from their mother. The mother (X^WX^w) can pass either X^W (red) or X^w (white) with equal probability. Therefore, 50% of sons will be X^wY (white-eyed)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a test cross, an unknown plant with a dominant phenotype produces all offspring showing the dominant trait when crossed with a homozygous recessive. What is the unknown genotype?",
        "options": ["Homozygous dominant", "Heterozygous", "Homozygous recessive", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the unknown plant is homozygous dominant (AA), all offspring from a test cross (AA x aa) will be heterozygous (Aa) and display the dominant phenotype."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cross between two parents yields offspring with an unusual phenotypic ratio: 1:2:1. Which inheritance pattern does this suggest?",
        "options": ["Complete dominance", "Incomplete dominance", "Codominance", "Sex-linked"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio (rather than 3:1) is characteristic of incomplete dominance, where the heterozygote has a distinct phenotype from either homozygote."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population has blood type phenotypes: 25% A, 25% B, 50% AB, 0% O. Which explanation is most likely?",
        "options": ["Multiple alleles with codominance", "Polygenic inheritance", "Complete dominance", "Epistasis"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This distribution involves the ABO blood group system, which is governed by multiple alleles (I^A, I^B, i) where A and B are codominant. The absence of type O suggests a specific, non-equilibrium allele frequency in this population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pedigree shows that a trait appears in every generation and affects males and females equally. What is the most likely pattern of inheritance?",
        "options": ["Autosomal dominant", "Autosomal recessive", "X-linked dominant", "X-linked recessive"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A trait that appears in every generation (vertical transmission) and has equal male/female affected individuals is classic for an autosomal dominant disorder."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two genes are located close together on the same chromosome. Which statement is correct?",
        "options": ["They assort independently", "They are linked and tend to be inherited together", "They exhibit codominance", "They always show recessive phenotypes"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Genetic linkage occurs when genes are physically close on a chromosome. They do not assort independently; instead, they tend to be inherited together as a unit unless separated by crossing over."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Chi-squared test comparing observed and expected offspring phenotypes yields a p-value of 0.35. What does this indicate?",
        "options": ["The difference is likely due to chance", "The difference is highly significant", "The experiment is invalid", "The null hypothesis must be rejected"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A p-value > 0.05 (like 0.35) means there is no statistically significant difference between observed and expected values. The deviation is likely due to random sampling error, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A dihybrid cross (AaBb × AaBb) is performed. Expected ratio for independent assortment is 9:3:3:1. Observed ratio is 8:4:4:0. Which could explain the deviation?",
        "options": ["Linkage", "Codominance", "Incomplete dominance", "Polygenic inheritance"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A significant deviation from 9:3:3:1, especially a severe reduction or absence of one phenotypic class (here, the double recessive class is 0), is strong evidence for genetic linkage between the two genes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mother is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder. Her son expresses the disorder. Which statement is true?",
        "options": ["Father must also express the disorder", "Son inherited the X chromosome from mother", "Disorder is dominant", "Son inherited X chromosome from father"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For an X-linked recessive disorder, males (XY) express it if their single X chromosome carries the recessive allele. A son always inherits his Y chromosome from his father and his X chromosome from his mother. Therefore, the affected son must have inherited the affected X from his carrier mother."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In pea plants, crossing two heterozygotes for flower color with incomplete dominance yields 25% red, 50% pink, 25% white. Which conclusion is correct?",
        "options": ["Trait shows complete dominance", "Trait shows codominance", "Trait shows incomplete dominance", "Trait is polygenic"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio from a cross of two heterozygotes, with a distinct intermediate phenotype (pink), is the defining characteristic of incomplete dominance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A test cross is used to determine if a tall pea plant is homozygous (TT) or heterozygous (Tt). Which result confirms the plant is homozygous?",
        "options": ["100% tall offspring", "50% tall, 50% short", "25% tall, 75% short", "1:2:1 ratio"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a test cross (T_ x tt), if the tall plant is homozygous dominant (TT), all offspring will be Tt and therefore tall. A result of 100% tall offspring confirms homozygosity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Chi-squared test, observed phenotypes deviate from Mendelian ratios. Which conclusion is most appropriate?",
        "options": ["Difference may be due to chance", "Genes are always linked", "Experiment must be repeated", "Mendel’s laws are invalid"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Statistical tests are designed to assess whether deviations are meaningful. The most measured scientific conclusion is that the observed difference may simply be due to random chance, unless the chi-square test indicates statistical significance (p < 0.05)."
