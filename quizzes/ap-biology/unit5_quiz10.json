    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A researcher calculates a χ² value of 5.2 for a dihybrid cross. The critical value for 3 degrees of freedom at p = 0.05 is 7.82. What is the correct conclusion?",
        "options": ["Reject the null hypothesis; the genes are linked.", "Fail to reject the null hypothesis; deviation is due to chance.", "The data is invalid.", "The sample size is too small."],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the calculated chi-square value is less than the critical value, the deviation between observed and expected results is not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and the deviation is likely due to random chance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In fruit flies, a wild-type (BbVv) is crossed with a black, vestigial fly (bbvv). Offspring: 415 wild-type, 92 black-normal, 88 gray-vestigial, 405 black-vestigial. What is the recombination frequency?",
        "options": ["9%", "18%", "82%", "50%"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The recombinant offspring (non-parental phenotypes) are black-normal (92) and gray-vestigial (88). Total offspring = 1000. Recombination Frequency = (92 + 88) / 1000 = 180/1000 = 0.18 = 18%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A homozygous red-eyed female (X-linked dominant) is crossed with a white-eyed male. What is the most likely result?",
        "options": ["All offspring will have red eyes.", "All males will have white eyes.", "50% of females will have white eyes.", "All females will have white eyes."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let R = red (dominant), r = white. Female: X^R X^R. Male: X^r Y. All daughters (X^R X^r) and all sons (X^R Y) will inherit the dominant X^R from the mother and therefore have red eyes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "One gene controls color (B black, b brown); a second gene (E/e) determines pigment deposition. If a dog is Bbee, what is its phenotype?",
        "options": ["Black", "Chocolate (Brown)", "Yellow", "Spotted"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In Labrador coat color, the E locus exhibits recessive epistasis. The homozygous recessive condition (ee) blocks pigment deposition regardless of the B/b genotype, resulting in a yellow coat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Recombination frequencies: A-B (20%), A-C (8%), C-D (15%), B-C (12%). What is the gene order?",
        "options": ["A-C-B-D", "A-B-C-D", "D-A-B-C", "B-A-C-D"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The smallest RF is A-C (8%), so A and C are closest. B-C (12%) and A-B (20%) indicate B is on the other side of C from A. C-D (15%) places D relative to C. The linear order consistent with all distances is A - C - B - D."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a plant with genotype PpTt is self-pollinated and the genes are linked so closely that no crossing over occurs, what is the expected phenotypic ratio?",
        "options": ["9:3:3:1", "3:1", "1:1:1:1", "1:2:1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With complete linkage, the alleles on each chromosome are inherited as a single unit. The cross is effectively between two heterozygous 'loci' (e.g., PT/pt x PT/pt), which yields a 3:1 phenotypic ratio among the offspring, as only parental combinations are produced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A woman with mitochondrial disease has children with a healthy man. What percentage of their children are expected to inherit the disease?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Mitochondria (and their DNA) are inherited exclusively from the mother via the egg's cytoplasm. Therefore, all children (100%) of an affected mother will inherit her mitochondrial DNA and the associated disease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cross AaBb × aabb yields: 45% AaBb, 45% aabb, 5% Aabb, and 5% aaBb. How many map units apart are these genes?",
        "options": ["0", "10", "90", "50"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a test cross. The recombinant offspring (Aabb and aaBb) total 10% (5% + 5%). Recombination frequency is equivalent to map distance in centimorgans. Therefore, the genes are 10 map units apart."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Solenoid' structure of DNA packaging?",
        "options": ["DNA wrapped around a single histone.", "A helical fiber formed by the coiling of nucleosomes (30-nm fiber).", "The final condensed metaphase chromosome.", "The linear sequence of nucleotides."],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The solenoid is the 30-nm fiber, a level of chromatin structure where strings of nucleosomes coil into a helical, tube-like structure. This represents a higher order of compaction than individual nucleosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an X-linked recessive pedigree, an unaffected female has an affected father. What is her genotype?",
        "options": ["X^R X^R", "X^R X^r", "X^r X^r", "X^R Y"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Her affected father (X^r Y) must have passed his affected X chromosome (X^r) to her. Since she is unaffected, she must also have a normal X chromosome (X^R) from her mother. Therefore, she is a heterozygous carrier: X^R X^r."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation if the aa genotype is lethal in utero?",
        "options": ["3:1", "2:1", "1:2:1", "9:3:3:1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross Aa x Aa. Normal Mendelian ratio would be 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa. If aa is lethal and dies, the surviving offspring consist of 1 AA and 2 Aa, all displaying the dominant phenotype. This yields a phenotypic ratio of 2:1 among viable offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Crossing two pink snapdragons (Rr × Rr) results in what probability of a red (RR) offspring?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In incomplete dominance, Rr individuals are pink. The cross Rr x Rr yields a genotypic and phenotypic ratio of 1 RR (red) : 2 Rr (pink) : 1 rr (white). The probability of a red (RR) offspring is 1/4, or 25%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many different types of gametes can be produced by an individual with the genotype AaBbCcDd (assuming independent assortment)?",
        "options": ["4", "8", "16", "32"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The number of different gamete types is 2^n, where n is the number of heterozygous gene pairs. Here, n=4 (Aa, Bb, Cc, Dd), so 2^4 = 16 different gamete combinations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A trait showing a 'bell-curve' or continuous distribution in a population is likely:",
        "options": ["Single-gene", "Polygenic", "Environmental only", "Codominant"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Polygenic traits, influenced by the additive effects of multiple genes (and often the environment), typically show a continuous range of variation that forms a normal (bell-curve) distribution in a population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When does Lyonization (X-inactivation) occur in female mammals?",
        "options": ["Gametogenesis", "Early embryonic development", "Puberty", "Fertilization"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "X-inactivation, the process by which one of the two X chromosomes is randomly silenced in each somatic cell of a female mammal, occurs during early embryonic development."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two genes have a recombination frequency of 50%. This indicates they are:",
        "options": ["Very close together.", "On different chromosomes (or very far apart on the same one).", "Alleles of the same gene.", "Located on a plasmid."],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A recombination frequency of 50% is the maximum observable value. It indicates that the genes are assorting independently, which is true if they are on different chromosomes or are so far apart on the same chromosome that crossing over always occurs between them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes 'Pleiotropy'?",
        "options": ["One gene influencing multiple unrelated traits.", "Multiple genes influencing one trait.", "One gene masking another.", "Environmental influence on genes."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pleiotropy is a phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple, often seemingly unrelated, phenotypic traits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a cross AaBb × AaBb, what is the probability of the offspring being AaBb?",
        "options": ["1/16", "1/4", "9/16", "1/2"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Probability of Aa from Aa x Aa = 1/2. Probability of Bb from Bb x Bb = 1/2. Since the genes assort independently, the probability of AaBb = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of non-disjunction occurring during Meiosis I?",
        "options": ["Two normal and two aneuploid gametes.", "Four aneuploid gametes (two n+1, two n-1).", "Four normal gametes.", "Polyploid offspring."],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Non-disjunction in Meiosis I involves the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate. This results in all four gametes being aneuploid: two have an extra chromosome (n+1), and two are missing a chromosome (n-1)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A man with Type AB blood and a woman with Type O blood have a child. Which blood type is impossible?",
        "options": ["Type A", "Type B", "Type AB", "None; all are possible."],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Man: I^A I^B. Woman: ii. The child must inherit an i allele from the mother. The child can inherit either I^A (resulting in I^A i, Type A) or I^B (resulting in I^B i, Type B) from the father. It is impossible for the child to inherit both I^A and I^B, as the mother cannot contribute an I^A or I^B allele. Therefore, Type AB is impossible."
