        "question": "What is the fundamental structural difference between saturated and unsaturated fats?",
        "options": [
          "Saturated fats have double bonds; unsaturated fats do not",
          "Saturated fats have no double bonds; unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Phospholipids are amphipathic - their hydrophilic phosphate heads face outward toward water, while hydrophobic fatty acid tails face inward, spontaneously forming bilayers in aqueous environments."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the basic structure of a phospholipid?",
