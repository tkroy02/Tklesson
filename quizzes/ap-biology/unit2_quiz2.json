      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most fundamental structural difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?",
        "options": [
          "Prokaryotic cells are always smaller",
          "Eukaryotic cells lack genetic material",

          "Only eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The defining characteristic is that prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus, while eukaryotic cells have one. Their DNA is located in a nucleoid region instead."
