      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In order for an animal mutation to affect a population’s genetic diversity, the mutation must take place:",
        "options": ["In the somatic cells", "During prophase", "In the gametes", "During telophase"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Only mutations in gametes (germline mutations) can be passed to offspring and thereby enter the gene pool, affecting the population's genetic diversity. Somatic mutations affect only the individual and are not heritable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During metaphase I of meiosis I, homologous pairs of chromosomes are situated along the metaphase plate. The orientation of each pair is random, resulting in a 50% chance that a particular daughter cell will get the maternal chromosome and a 50% chance it will get the paternal chromosome. This is one aspect of sexual reproduction that contributes to genetic variation, and is called:",
        "options": ["Independent assortment", "Separation of homologs", "Cytokinesis", "Reductional division"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Independent assortment refers to the random alignment of homologous chromosome pairs during metaphase I. This random sorting creates many different combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes in the resulting gametes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During prophase I of meiosis, a reciprocal exchange of genetic material between nonsister chromatids produces chromosomes with new combinations of maternal and paternal alleles. This is called:",
        "options": ["Synapsis", "Crossing over", "Codominance", "Reductional division"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Crossing over is the physical exchange of DNA segments between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes during prophase I. It creates recombinant chromosomes with new allele combinations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is not a difference between the cell cycle (mitosis) and meiosis?",
        "options": [
          "The cell cycle produces cells for growth and repair. Meiosis produces gametes.",
          "Cells divide one time in the cell cycle. Cells divide two times in meiosis.",
          "The cell cycle produces cells genetically identical to the parent cell. Meiosis produces cells genetically different from the parent and from each other.",
          "In the cell cycle, crossing over takes place during metaphase. In meiosis, crossing over takes place during prophase I."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Crossing over does NOT occur during the mitotic cell cycle. It is a unique event of prophase I in meiosis. Therefore, this statement is false and identifies a non-existent difference."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects 1 in 3,500 males born in the United States. This disease is characterized by the progressive loss of coordination and weakening of the muscles. This disorder was traced to the absence of a muscle protein called dystrophin, for which the gene is located on the X chromosome. This gene is an example of:",
        "options": ["An X inactivation", "A Barr body", "A sex-linked gene", "Recombination"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A gene located on a sex chromosome (in this case, the X chromosome) is termed a sex-linked gene. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sexual reproduction produces variation within populations through which mechanism(s)?",
        "options": ["Crossing over", "Independent assortment of homologous chromosomes", "Random fertilization", "All of the above"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All three listed mechanisms are major sources of genetic variation in sexually reproducing populations: 1) Crossing over (recombination during prophase I), 2) Independent assortment (during metaphase I), and 3) Random fertilization (any sperm can fertilize any egg)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Most heritable variation involves characteristics that vary along a continuum within a population. These characters are referred to as:",
        "options": ["Quantitative characters", "Discrete characters", "Hereditary characters", "Heterozygous characters"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Quantitative characters are traits that show continuous variation (like height, skin color, or metabolic rate), typically influenced by multiple genes (polygenic inheritance) and often the environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Humans have a 2n number of 46. If one chromosome fails to split during anaphase of Meiosis II, which of the following gamete combinations will occur?",
        "options": ["46,46,45,47", "45,45,47,47", "22,22,24,24", "23,23,22,24"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Meiosis II starts with two haploid (n=23) cells, each with 23 duplicated chromosomes. Nondisjunction in Meiosis II in one of these cells leads to one gamete with an extra chromatid (24) and one missing one (22). The other cell from Meiosis I divides normally, producing two normal gametes (23). The final set is 23, 23, 22, 24."

        "question": "Identify the inheritance pattern shown in the pedigree.",
        "image": "images/geno1.png",
        "options": [
          "X-Linked Dominant",
          "X-Linked recessive",
          "Autosomal recessive",
          "Mitochondrial inheritance"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is Mitochondrial inheritance. The pattern is characterized by: 1) Affected females pass the trait to ALL of their children (sons and daughters), 2) Affected males do NOT pass the trait to any of their children. This is because mitochondria (and their DNA) are inherited exclusively from the egg. Ruling out other patterns: X-Linked Dominant would require affected fathers to pass the trait to all daughters, which does not occur here. X-Linked Recessive typically shows up more in males and can skip generations. Autosomal Recessive is statistically improbable, as it would require unaffected fathers to be carriers to produce this many affected offspring from affected mothers, and it wouldn't explain why affected fathers have zero affected children."

        "question": "What is the probability of getting an offspring with the genotype of AaBbCc by crossing parents with the genotypes of AaBBcc x AaBbCC?",
        "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "1/8", "2/3"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For gene A (Aa x Aa), probability of Aa = 1/2. For gene B (BB x Bb), probability of Bb = 1/2. For gene C (cc x CC), probability of Cc = 1. Multiplying independent probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) * 1 = 1/4."
