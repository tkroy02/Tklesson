          "Zeroth Law",
          "First Law",
          "Second Law",
          "Third Law"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The First Law of Thermodynamics is the principle of conservation of energy - total energy in a closed system remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a negative ΔG value indicate about a chemical reaction?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A negative ΔG (Gibbs free energy change) means the reaction releases free energy and can occur spontaneously."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, what happens to useful energy in every energy transformation?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Second Law states that entropy (disorder) increases, and with each energy transfer, some energy becomes unavailable to do work, typically lost as heat."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "ATP hydrolysis (ATP → ADP + Pi) has a large negative ΔG (~ -30.5 kJ/mol), making it spontaneous and able to drive other cellular processes."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, the system can do no work, so the free energy change is zero (ΔG = 0)."

        "question": "What is the biological significance of coupling endergonic and exergonic reactions?",
        "options": [
          "To waste energy as heat",
          "To make both reactions spontaneous",
          "To allow energy-releasing reactions to drive energy-requiring ones",
          "To decrease entropy in the cell"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cells couple reactions so the negative ΔG of exergonic reactions (like ATP hydrolysis) can provide the energy needed for endergonic reactions (like biosynthesis)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction has ΔH = -50 kJ/mol and ΔS = +0.1 kJ/mol·K at 25°C, what is ΔG?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = -50 - (298 × 0.1) = -50 - 29.8 = -79.8 kJ/mol ≈ -80 kJ/mol. Negative ΔG indicates spontaneity."
      },

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing temperature affect the spontaneity of a reaction with positive ΔS?",
        "options": [
          "Makes it less spontaneous",
          "Makes it more spontaneous",
          "Has no effect",
          "Always makes it non-spontaneous"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For reactions with positive ΔS, the -TΔS term becomes more negative as temperature increases, making ΔG more negative and the reaction more spontaneous."
      },
      {

          "Cells can violate thermodynamic laws",
          "Complex structures decrease total entropy"
        ],
        "explanation": "Cells create local order but use energy from food/sunlight, and the metabolic processes release heat, increasing the entropy of the surroundings more than the decrease within the cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between activation energy and Gibbs free energy?",
        "options": [
          "They are the same thing",
          "ΔG determines if a reaction occurs; Ea determines how fast",
          "Ea determines if a reaction occurs; ΔG determines how fast",
          "They are unrelated concepts"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "ΔG tells us whether a reaction is thermodynamically favorable, while activation energy (Ea) is the energy barrier that determines the reaction rate."

          "K_eq = 1",
          "K_eq = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Positive ΔG means the reaction favors reactants at equilibrium, so K_eq < 1 (since K_eq = [products]/[reactants])."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do enzymes affect the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of a reaction?",

          "They do not change ΔG"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Enzymes are catalysts that lower activation energy and speed up reactions, but they do not change the ΔG or the equilibrium position."
