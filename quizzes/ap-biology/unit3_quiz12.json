    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of fermentation?",
        "options": [
          "To produce large amounts of ATP",
          "To regenerate NAD⁺ from NADH so glycolysis can continue",
          "To produce oxygen for the cell",
          "To break down glucose completely into CO₂ and H₂O"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fermentation's main role is to oxidize NADH back to NAD⁺, which is required as an electron acceptor in glycolysis. This allows glycolysis to continue producing a small amount of ATP when oxygen is absent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two common types of fermentation?",
        "options": [
          "Lactic acid and alcoholic fermentation",
          "Aerobic and anaerobic fermentation",
          "C3 and C4 fermentation",
          "Day and night fermentation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The two main types are lactic acid fermentation (produces lactate) and alcoholic fermentation (produces ethanol and CO₂). Both regenerate NAD⁺ for glycolysis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In lactic acid fermentation, what is pyruvate converted to?",
        "options": [
          "Ethanol and CO₂",
          "Lactate",
          "Acetyl CoA",
          "Glucose"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate acts as an electron acceptor and is reduced to lactate, while NADH is oxidized to NAD⁺."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What problem does the C4 photosynthetic pathway solve that C3 plants face?",
        "options": [
          "Lack of water",
          "Photorespiration",
          "Too much ATP production",
          "Insufficient light"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "C4 plants minimize photorespiration, a wasteful process that occurs when Rubisco fixes oxygen instead of CO₂, which happens more frequently in hot, dry conditions when stomata are closed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do C4 plants initially fix carbon dioxide differently from C3 plants?",
        "options": [
          "They use Rubisco in bundle sheath cells",
          "They fix CO₂ into a 4-carbon compound in mesophyll cells",
          "They only fix CO₂ at night",
          "They don't use the Calvin cycle"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "C4 plants initially fix CO₂ into oxaloacetate (a 4-carbon molecule) in mesophyll cells using PEP carboxylase, which doesn't bind oxygen. This 4-carbon compound then transports CO₂ to bundle sheath cells for the Calvin cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the key adaptation of CAM plants?",
        "options": [
          "They perform light reactions at night",
          "They separate carbon fixation and the Calvin cycle spatially",
          "They separate carbon fixation and the Calvin cycle temporally (day vs. night)",
          "They don't perform photosynthesis at all"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "CAM plants open their stomata at night to take in CO₂ and fix it into organic acids, then close stomata during the day and use the stored CO₂ for the Calvin cycle, reducing water loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of fermentation is used in making bread and alcoholic beverages?",
        "options": [
          "Lactic acid fermentation",
          "Alcoholic fermentation",
          "Acetic acid fermentation",
          "Mixed acid fermentation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Alcoholic fermentation by yeast produces ethanol and CO₂. The CO₂ causes bread to rise, while both products are important in brewing and winemaking."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does lactic acid fermentation commonly occur in humans?",
        "options": [
          "In brain cells during thinking",
          "In muscle cells during intense exercise",
          "In red blood cells constantly",
          "In liver cells after eating"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "During vigorous exercise when oxygen delivery to muscle cells can't keep up with demand, muscle cells perform lactic acid fermentation to continue producing ATP from glycolysis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What environmental conditions favor C4 and CAM plants over C3 plants?",

          "Cool, moist environments",
          "Hot, dry environments",
          "Dark, cold environments",
          "Nutrient-poor soils"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "C4 and CAM adaptations are advantageous in hot, dry conditions where plants need to conserve water by closing stomata, which would cause photorespiration problems in C3 plants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the ATP yield from one glucose molecule undergoing fermentation compared to aerobic respiration?",
        "options": [
          "Much higher (about 10x more)",
          "About the same",
          "Much lower (only 2 ATP from glycolysis)",
          "Zero ATP"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fermentation only produces 2 ATP per glucose (from glycolysis), compared to about 30-32 ATP from complete aerobic respiration. It's much less efficient but faster and doesn't require oxygen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which enzyme do C4 plants use for initial carbon fixation that has no affinity for oxygen?",
        "options": [
          "Rubisco",
          "PEP carboxylase",
          "ATP synthase",
          "Hexokinase"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "PEP carboxylase has a high affinity for CO₂ and no affinity for oxygen, unlike Rubisco, making it much more efficient at carbon fixation when CO₂ concentrations are low."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the lactate produced in human muscles?",
        "options": [
          "It is excreted in sweat",
          "It is converted back to pyruvate in the liver",
          "It is used directly for energy",
          "It is exhaled as CO₂"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Most lactate is transported to the liver where it can be converted back to pyruvate and then to glucose via gluconeogenesis (the Cori cycle)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a C4 plant?",

          "Oak tree"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pineapple, cacti, and jade plants are CAM plants adapted to very arid conditions where water conservation is critical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't fermentation continue indefinitely in human muscles?",
        "options": [
          "It requires too much oxygen",
          "Lactate accumulation causes fatigue and pH changes",
          "It produces too much ATP",
          "It consumes all the available glucose"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lactate accumulation decreases pH in muscle cells, interfering with enzyme function and contributing to muscle fatigue, limiting how long fermentation can sustain activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main advantage of CAM photosynthesis?",

          "Higher maximum rate of photosynthesis",
          "Excellent water efficiency",
          "Better nutrient uptake",
          "Faster growth rate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The main advantage of CAM photosynthesis is extreme water efficiency, as stomata only open at night when evaporation rates are lowest."
      },

          "Ethanol, CO₂, and NAD⁺",
          "Pyruvate and NADH",
          "Glucose and O₂"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Yeast and some bacteria convert pyruvate to ethanol and CO₂, while regenerating NAD⁺ from NADH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do C4 plants spatially separate the initial carbon fixation from the Calvin cycle?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C4 plants fix CO₂ initially in mesophyll cells, then transport 4-carbon compounds to bundle sheath cells where the Calvin cycle occurs, physically separating these processes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is photorespiration?",
        "options": [

          "A specialized form of fermentation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Photorespiration occurs when Rubisco binds oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, producing a product that cannot be used in the Calvin cycle and must be recycled at a cost of ATP and carbon loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which metabolic pathway is common to both aerobic respiration and all types of fermentation?",
