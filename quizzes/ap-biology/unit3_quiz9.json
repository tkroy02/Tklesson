        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "One ATP (or GTP, depending on the organism) is produced directly via substrate-level phosphorylation when succinyl CoA is converted to succinate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the waste products of the Citric Acid Cycle?",

          "It only functions under cyclic conditions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The cycle is regenerated because the 4-carbon oxaloacetate that begins the cycle is re-formed at the end, ready to combine with another acetyl CoA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the total number of CO₂ molecules released per glucose molecule from the Citric Acid Cycle?",

          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "B",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The cycle is a central hub because it completes the oxidation of not only glucose (via pyruvate) but also fatty acids and amino acids, generating high-energy electrons for the ETC."
      },
      {

        "question": "Which vitamin-derived coenzyme is essential for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which creates Acetyl CoA for the cycle?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Key enzymes like isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase are allosterically inhibited by high levels of ATP and NADH, signaling that the cell's energy needs are met."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would happen if the supply of oxaloacetate was depleted?",
        "options": [
          "The cycle would run faster",

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Oxaloacetate is essential to start the cycle by accepting the acetyl group. If depleted, the cycle halts, and acetyl CoA accumulates, often leading to ketone body synthesis."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Succinate dehydrogenase is Complex II of the electron transport chain. It is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and passes electrons directly to FAD."

        "question": "What is the main importance of the high-energy electron carriers (NADH, FADH₂) produced by the cycle?",
        "options": [
          "They are the final products of respiration",
          "They store energy that will be used to make most of the ATP",

          "They are used to directly power muscle contraction"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary value of the Citric Acid Cycle is the production of NADH and FADH₂. These carry high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain, where their energy is used to create a proton gradient that drives most ATP synthesis."
