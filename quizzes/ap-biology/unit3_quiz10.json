      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which electron carrier delivers electrons to Complex II of the electron transport chain?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "FADH₂ delivers electrons directly to Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), which then passes them to ubiquinone (CoQ). This bypasses Complex I."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "FADH₂ donates electrons to Complex II, which does not pump protons. Therefore, fewer protons are pumped per electron from FADH₂ compared to NADH, which donates electrons to Complex I."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Oxygen's crucial role is to accept electrons at the end of the chain (from Complex IV), forming water. This removal of electrons allows the chain to continue functioning."
      },
      {

        "question": "What would be the immediate consequence if oxygen was suddenly removed from a cell undergoing aerobic respiration?",
        "options": [
          "ATP production would increase",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Without oxygen to accept electrons, the electron transport chain would halt. This would stop proton pumping, the proton gradient would collapse, and ATP synthesis via chemiosmosis would cease."
      },

          "10 ATP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The current estimate is that each NADH yields about 2.5 ATP. This is because its electrons cause the pumping of enough protons to generate approximately 2.5 ATP via ATP synthase."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the function of the rotor in the ATP synthase complex?",

          "To accept electrons from NADH"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The flow of protons through a channel in ATP synthase causes a rotor subunit to spin. This mechanical energy drives conformational changes in the catalytic knob that produce ATP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a mobile electron carrier in the electron transport chain?",

          "ATP synthase"
        ],
        "answer": "C",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do uncouplers (like DNP) affect oxidative phosphorylation?",
        "options": [
          "They increase ATP production",
          "They block electron flow",
          "They allow protons to bypass ATP synthase, dissipating the gradient as heat",
          "They inhibit ATP synthase directly"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Uncouplers make the inner mitochondrial membrane leaky to protons. This dissipates the proton gradient without ATP synthesis, causing energy to be released as heat instead."
      },

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The energy released as electrons are passed from the high-energy carriers NADH and FADH₂ to progressively lower energy acceptors in the chain is used to pump protons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which complex in the electron transport chain receives electrons directly from NADH?",
        "options": [

          "Complex II",
          "Complex III",
          "Complex IV"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) is the entry point for electrons from NADH. It accepts electrons from NADH and transfers them to ubiquinone (CoQ)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of the stepwise movement of electrons through the chain?",

          "To create water molecules one atom at a time"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The stepwise transfer of electrons through a series of carriers allows the energy to be released in small increments. This energy is captured efficiently to pump protons, rather than being lost all at once as heat or light."
