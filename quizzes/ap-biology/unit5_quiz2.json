      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which event occurs during prophase of mitosis?",
        "options": ["Sister chromatids separate", "Chromosomes condense and become visible", "Nuclear membrane reforms", "DNA replication occurs"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Prophase is characterized by the condensation of chromatin into visible chromosomes and the beginning of spindle formation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell with 8 chromosomes enters mitosis. How many chromatids are present at metaphase?",
        "options": ["8", "16", "32", "4"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "After S-phase, each chromosome is duplicated and consists of two sister chromatids. 8 chromosomes * 2 chromatids each = 16 chromatids at metaphase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The mitotic spindle is directly responsible for:",
        "options": ["DNA replication", "Cytokinesis", "Aligning chromosomes at the metaphase plate", "Formation of the nuclear envelope"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The spindle, made of microtubules, attaches to chromosomes via kinetochores to move and align them during metaphase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which phase of mitosis ensures that each daughter cell receives identical genetic material?",
        "options": ["Prophase", "Metaphase", "Anaphase", "Telophase"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "During anaphase, sister chromatids (now individual chromosomes) are pulled apart to opposite poles, ensuring each new cell gets an identical set."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A chemical disrupts microtubule formation in a cell. Which phase of mitosis would be most affected?",
        "options": ["Prophase", "Metaphase", "Anaphase", "All of the above"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Microtubules form the mitotic spindle, which is essential for chromosome movement in prophase (alignment), metaphase (maintaining position), and anaphase (separation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the difference between cytokinesis in plant and animal cells?",
        "options": ["Plant cells use a cleavage furrow; animal cells use a cell plate", "Animal cells divide before mitosis ends; plant cells divide after", "Plant cells form a cell plate; animal cells form a cleavage furrow", "Cytokinesis only occurs in animal cells"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Animal cells pinch apart using a contractile ring (cleavage furrow). Plant cells build a new cell wall from vesicles that fuse to form a cell plate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which phase do sister chromatids become individual chromosomes?",
        "options": ["Metaphase", "Anaphase", "Telophase", "Prophase"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the onset of anaphase, the centromeres split, and the sister chromatids separate, each becoming an independent daughter chromosome."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best explains why mitosis is essential for multicellular organisms?",
        "options": ["It produces gametes", "It increases genetic variation", "It allows for growth, repair, and maintenance", "It reduces chromosome number"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mitosis produces genetically identical cells, enabling an organism to grow from a zygote, replace damaged cells, and renew tissues."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mutation causes a cell to skip metaphase. What is the most likely consequence?",
        "options": ["DNA will not replicate", "Chromosomes may not align properly", "Cytokinesis will not occur", "The nuclear membrane will not dissolve"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Metaphase alignment at the metaphase plate is crucial for the equal segregation of chromosomes. Skipping it would lead to random and unequal distribution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If nondisjunction occurs during mitosis, what is the most likely result?",
        "options": ["Increased genetic variation", "Two identical daughter cells", "Daughter cells with unequal chromosome numbers", "Gametes with half the chromosome number"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Nondisjunction is the failure of sister chromatids to separate. In mitosis, this produces one daughter cell with an extra chromosome (trisomy) and one missing a chromosome (monosomy)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which structure attaches to the centromere during mitosis?",
        "options": ["Ribosome", "Spindle fiber", "Nuclear envelope", "Cell plate"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Kinetochore microtubules (spindle fibers) attach to the kinetochore protein complex at the centromere to pull chromosomes apart."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A somatic human cell undergoes mitosis. How many chromosomes will each daughter cell contain?",
        "options": ["23", "46", "92", "138"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Mitosis produces genetically identical, diploid (2n) daughter cells. Human somatic cells are diploid, containing 46 chromosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Binary fission differs from mitosis primarily because binary fission:",
        "options": ["Occurs in eukaryotes", "Involves spindle fibers", "Does not include a nucleus", "Produces genetically diverse offspring"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Binary fission is prokaryotic cell division. Prokaryotes lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, simplifying the process compared to mitosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which organism primarily reproduces by binary fission?",
        "options": ["Yeast", "Amoeba", "Bacteria", "Fern"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Bacteria are prokaryotes and reproduce asexually through binary fission. Amoebas (eukaryotes) also divide similarly but the process is not called binary fission in the same strict sense."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During binary fission, DNA replication begins at a specific sequence called the:",
        "options": ["Centromere", "Origin of replication", "Telomere", "Spindle checkpoint"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The origin of replication is the specific site on the circular bacterial chromosome where DNA synthesis is initiated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about binary fission is correct?",
        "options": ["It produces four daughter cells", "It occurs only in multicellular organisms", "It results in two genetically identical cells", "It requires meiosis"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Binary fission is a form of asexual reproduction where a single prokaryotic cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the rate of binary fission compare to mitosis?",
        "options": ["Binary fission is slower due to more checkpoints", "Binary fission is faster due to simpler cell structure", "Both occur at the same rate", "Binary fission only occurs once per life cycle"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The absence of a nucleus, organelles, and a complex mitotic apparatus allows binary fission to occur much faster than mitosis under ideal conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population of bacteria rapidly increases in number. Which process is responsible?",
        "options": ["Meiosis", "Mitosis", "Binary fission", "Budding"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Bacteria increase their population through rapid, repeated rounds of binary fission."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which feature is shared by both mitosis and binary fission?",
        "options": ["Formation of a spindle apparatus", "Presence of a nuclear envelope", "Production of identical daughter cells", "Occurrence only in eukaryotes"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both processes are mechanisms of asexual reproduction that result in the production of genetically identical offspring from a single parent cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which situation would most likely increase genetic variation in organisms that reproduce by binary fission?",
        "options": ["Increased rate of cell division", "DNA mutations", "Shorter cell cycle", "Identical environmental conditions"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since binary fission produces clones, mutation is the primary source of new genetic variation in bacterial populations."
