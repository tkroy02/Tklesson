    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A microscope image shows a eukaryotic cell in which chromosomes are condensed but not yet aligned at the center of the cell. The nuclear envelope is beginning to break down. Which phase of mitosis is shown?",
        "options": ["Interphase", "Prophase", "Metaphase", "Anaphase"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The condensation of chromosomes and breakdown of the nuclear envelope are key events of prophase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A researcher observes cells where chromosomes are lined up along the equatorial plane, with spindle fibers attached to centromeres from opposite poles. What is the primary purpose of this stage?",
        "options": ["DNA replication", "Separation of sister chromatids", "Ensuring equal chromosome distribution", "Formation of the nuclear membrane"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Metaphase alignment at the metaphase plate ensures that when separation occurs, each daughter cell receives an identical and complete set of chromosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A drug prevents the shortening of spindle fibers during mitosis. Which outcome is most likely?",
        "options": ["Chromosomes fail to replicate", "Sister chromatids fail to separate", "Cytokinesis occurs prematurely", "Nuclear membranes form too early"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shortening of spindle fibers (kinetochore microtubules) is the motor for chromosome movement during anaphase. Preventing this would halt separation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A somatic cell has 12 chromosomes. After mitosis and cytokinesis, two daughter cells are formed. How many chromosomes are present in each daughter cell?",
        "options": ["6", "12", "24", "48"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Mitosis conserves chromosome number. A diploid somatic cell (2n=12) produces genetically identical diploid daughter cells (2n=12)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mutation causes the centromeres of sister chromatids to fail to divide. Which phase of mitosis is directly affected?",
        "options": ["Prophase", "Metaphase", "Anaphase", "Telophase"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The division of centromeres, allowing sister chromatids to separate, is the event that defines the start of anaphase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Plant cells treated with a chemical fail to form a cell plate after mitosis. What process is being disrupted?",
        "options": ["DNA replication", "Chromosome condensation", "Cytokinesis", "Spindle formation"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In plant cells, the cell plate is the structure that forms during cytokinesis to divide the cytoplasm and form a new cell wall."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A tissue sample shows many cells actively dividing, indicating rapid growth. Which role of mitosis best explains this observation?",
        "options": ["Genetic variation", "Production of gametes", "Growth and tissue repair", "Reduction of chromosome number"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The proliferation of somatic cells through mitosis is the basis for growth and the replacement of damaged or old cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell skips the metaphase checkpoint due to a regulatory failure. What is the most likely consequence?",
        "options": ["DNA will not be copied", "Chromosomes may not attach properly to spindle fibers", "Cytokinesis will not occur", "Nuclear envelopes will not reform"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The metaphase checkpoint ensures all chromosomes are bi-oriented (attached to spindle fibers from both poles). Bypassing it risks aneuploidy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During cell division, chromosomes move toward opposite poles of the cell. Which phase is being observed?",
        "options": ["Prophase", "Metaphase", "Anaphase", "Telophase"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The movement of chromosomes to opposite poles is the defining characteristic of anaphase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student compares normal cells to cancer cells and finds cancer cells divide more frequently. Which change most likely contributes to this observation?",
        "options": ["Increased chromosome number", "Loss of cell cycle regulation", "Failure of DNA replication", "Reduced spindle fiber formation"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cancer is fundamentally a disease of unregulated cell division, often due to mutations in genes that control the cell cycle checkpoints."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bacterial cell begins DNA replication at a single origin and grows longer before splitting into two cells. Which process is being described?",
        "options": ["Mitosis", "Meiosis", "Binary fission", "Budding"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is a precise description of binary fission in prokaryotes: replication from one origin, cell elongation, and division into two daughter cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population of bacteria doubles every 30 minutes under optimal conditions. Which feature of binary fission allows for this rapid growth?",
        "options": ["Presence of a nucleus", "Multiple chromosomes", "Simple cellular organization", "Genetic recombination"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The absence of a nucleus and complex organelles streamlines the process of replication and division, enabling extremely fast generation times."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Unlike eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles. How does this affect cell division?",
        "options": ["Binary fission requires spindle fibers", "Binary fission occurs without mitotic phases", "Binary fission produces four cells", "Binary fission involves meiosis"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The lack of a nucleus and mitotic spindle means prokaryotic division (binary fission) is a continuous process, not divided into prophase, metaphase, etc."
      },

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Binary fission is an asexual process resulting in genetically identical daughter cells, barring any new mutations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "DNA replication errors occur occasionally during binary fission. What is the most likely result over many generations?",
        "options": ["Decreased population size", "Increased genetic variation", "Slower cell division", "Identical populations"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the absence of sexual reproduction, mutations (replication errors) are the primary source of new genetic variation in a bacterial population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bacterial cell divides, and each daughter cell receives one copy of the chromosome. Which shared feature does this process have with mitosis?",
        "options": ["Spindle apparatus formation", "Equal distribution of genetic material", "Presence of centrioles", "Nuclear envelope breakdown"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both mitosis and binary fission are mechanisms to ensure the faithful and equal distribution of genetic material to offspring cells."

        "question": "A new antibiotic blocks DNA replication in bacteria. Which process is directly affected?",
        "options": ["Translation", "Binary fission", "Protein folding", "Cell signaling"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Binary fission requires DNA replication to provide a genome for each daughter cell. Blocking replication halts division."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Binary fission allows bacteria to adapt rapidly to environmental changes. Which factor contributes most to this adaptability?",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bacterial colony shows resistance to an antibiotic after several generations. Which process most likely allowed resistance to spread?",
        "options": ["Meiosis", "Binary fission combined with mutation", "Mitosis in host cells", "Sexual reproduction"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Resistance arises from a random mutation. That mutant cell then reproduces via binary fission, rapidly cloning itself and spreading the resistance trait."
