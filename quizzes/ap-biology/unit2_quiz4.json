        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Active transport requires cellular energy (usually ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient, while passive transport moves substances down their concentration gradient without energy input."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What process describes the net movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration?",

          "Diffusion",
          "Facilitated diffusion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Diffusion is the passive movement of molecules from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration, driven by the intrinsic kinetic energy of the molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is osmosis?",
        "options": [
          "The diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane",
          "The active transport of ions against their gradient",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A red blood cell placed in a hypertonic solution will:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a hypertonic solution, the solute concentration outside the cell is higher than inside. Water will leave the cell by osmosis, causing it to shrink and shrivel (crenate)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the key characteristic of facilitated diffusion?",

          "Osmosis"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to move sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, both against their concentration gradients, making it a classic example of active transport."

          "It will become turgid (swell against cell wall)",
          "It will remain unchanged",
          "It will burst"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a hypotonic solution, water enters the plant cell by osmosis. The cell swells, and the rigid cell wall prevents bursting, creating turgor pressure that makes the cell turgid."
      },

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Channel proteins form hydrophilic tunnels that allow specific ions or water molecules to pass through by facilitated diffusion, following their electrochemical gradients."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does active transport maintain concentration gradients that differ from equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "By allowing substances to reach equilibrium faster",
          "By using energy to pump substances against their gradients",
          "By making the membrane more permeable",
          "By destroying excess molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Active transport uses cellular energy to move substances against their concentration gradients, allowing cells to maintain internal environments that differ significantly from their surroundings."

          "Using the energy of one substance moving down its gradient to drive another substance against its gradient",
          "Transport that only occurs in pairs of molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In cotransport, a transport protein couples the 'downhill' movement of one substance (usually Na⁺ or H⁺) to the 'uphill' movement of another substance (like glucose or amino acids)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't ions and large polar molecules diffuse directly through the lipid bilayer?",
        "options": [
          "They are too small",
          "They are hydrophobic and get stuck",
          "They are hydrophilic and cannot cross the hydrophobic interior",
          "They are repelled by membrane proteins"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ions and large polar molecules are hydrophilic and cannot dissolve in the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer, so they require transport proteins to cross the membrane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the direction of water movement when a cell is in an isotonic solution?",
        "options": [
          "Water moves into the cell only",
          "Water moves out of the cell only",
          "Water moves in both directions at equal rates",
          "No water movement occurs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In an isotonic solution, solute concentration is equal inside and outside the cell. Water still moves across the membrane, but it enters and leaves at the same rate, resulting in no net water movement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of ATP in active transport?",
        "options": [
          "It makes the membrane more fluid",
          "It phosphorylates transport proteins, changing their shape",
          "It creates concentration gradients",
          "It dissolves in the lipid bilayer"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In active transport, ATP typically phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) the transport protein, causing a conformational change that moves substances across the membrane against their gradient."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do carrier proteins differ from channel proteins in facilitated diffusion?",
        "options": [
          "Carrier proteins require energy; channel proteins do not",
          "Carrier proteins undergo shape changes; channel proteins form tunnels",
          "Channel proteins are faster but less specific",
          "Carrier proteins only work for active transport"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Carrier proteins bind specific molecules and change shape to transport them across the membrane, while channel proteins form hydrophilic tunnels that allow specific molecules to pass through."

          "Diffusion stops completely"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The rate of simple diffusion increases with the concentration gradient because there's a greater difference in molecular concentration driving the net movement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the sodium-potassium pump essential for nerve cell function?",
        "options": [
          "It produces ATP for energy",
          "It maintains the resting membrane potential",
          "It transports neurotransmitters",
          "It builds the myelin sheath"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The sodium-potassium pump maintains the electrochemical gradient essential for nerve impulse transmission by keeping sodium concentration high outside and potassium high inside the cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is plasmolysis?",

          "The active transport of water"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Plasmolysis occurs when plant cells are placed in hypertonic solutions - water leaves the cell, the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall, and the cell shrinks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does facilitated diffusion become saturated at high solute concentrations?",
        "options": [
          "The membrane becomes less permeable",
          "All available transport proteins are occupied",
          "The concentration gradient reverses",
          "ATP production decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Facilitated diffusion shows saturation kinetics because there are a limited number of transport proteins. When all proteins are occupied, the transport rate cannot increase further."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between osmosis and osmotic pressure?",
        "options": [
          "Osmotic pressure prevents osmosis from occurring",
          "Osmotic pressure is the force that would be needed to stop osmosis",
          "They are completely unrelated processes",
          "Osmosis creates pressure that destroys osmotic gradients"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Osmotic pressure is the pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of water across a semipermeable membrane. It measures the tendency of a solution to take in water by osmosis."

          "Facilitated diffusion through channel proteins",
          "Active transport by ion pumps",
          "Osmosis"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Active transport mechanisms like the sodium-potassium pump are essential for establishing and maintaining the ion gradients that differ from equilibrium, which are crucial for neuronal signaling."
