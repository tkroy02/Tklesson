      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of mitochondria?",
        "options": [
          "To perform photosynthesis",
          "To synthesize proteins for export",
          "To generate ATP through cellular respiration",
          "To break down macromolecules using hydrolytic enzymes"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. They generate most of the cell's supply of ATP through the process of cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of sugars and fats in the presence of oxygen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is strong evidence supporting the endosymbiotic theory for the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts?",
        "options": [
          "They are both part of the endomembrane system.",
          "They both have a single linear chromosome.",
          "They contain their own circular DNA and ribosomes.",
          "They are both synthesized by the Golgi apparatus."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The endosymbiotic theory is supported by several facts: mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own circular DNA (like bacteria), their own 70S ribosomes, a double membrane, and they replicate independently of the cell cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which part of the mitochondrion does the Krebs (Citric Acid) cycle occur?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The mitochondrial matrix is the fluid-filled space inside the inner membrane. It contains the enzymes for the Krebs cycle, which completes the oxidation of organic fuels, producing NADH and FADH2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the electron transport chain (ETC) located in the mitochondrion?",

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The inner mitochondrial membrane, which is highly folded into cristae to increase surface area, contains the protein complexes of the electron transport chain. This is where the proton gradient is established for ATP synthesis."

          "To store the cell's genetic information"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plants and algae. They convert light energy into chemical energy, storing it in the bonds of carbohydrates like glucose."

          "The intermembrane space"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The thylakoid membranes contain chlorophyll and the protein complexes for the light-dependent reactions. Here, light energy is captured and converted into ATP and NADPH, and water is split, releasing oxygen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Grana"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The stroma is the fluid-filled space surrounding the thylakoids. It contains the enzymes for the Calvin cycle, which uses ATP and NADPH from the light reactions to fix carbon dioxide into sugar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the theory that explains how mitochondria and chloroplasts likely evolved from free-living prokaryotes?",

          "The Induced Fit Model"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Endosymbiotic Theory proposes that an ancestral eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthetic cyanobacterium (which evolved into chloroplasts) and an aerobic prokaryote (which evolved into mitochondria), forming a symbiotic relationship."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key structural feature shared by both mitochondria and chloroplasts?",

          "NADH and FADH2"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The light-dependent reactions convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP (chemical fuel) and NADPH (reducing power). These two molecules are then used in the Calvin cycle to reduce carbon dioxide and build glucose."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis is established in the intermembrane space in mitochondria. Where is it established in chloroplasts?",
        "options": [
          "In the stroma",
          "In the thylakoid space (lumen)",
          "In the intermembrane space",
          "In the cytoplasm"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In chloroplasts, during the light-dependent reactions, protons are pumped from the stroma into the thylakoid space (lumen). ATP is synthesized as protons flow back down their concentration gradient into the stroma through ATP synthase."

          "Chloroplasts break down glucose to make ATP, while mitochondria build glucose using light.",
          "Mitochondria break down energy-rich molecules to make ATP, while chloroplasts use light to build energy-rich molecules.",
          "Mitochondria and chloroplasts both use the energy from sunlight to produce ATP."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mitochondria are catabolic; they harvest energy stored in glucose and other molecules to produce ATP. Chloroplasts are anabolic; they use light energy to build energy-rich glucose molecules from carbon dioxide and water."
