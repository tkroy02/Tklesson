      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A human somatic cell has 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids joined at a centromere. How many homologous pairs are present in this cell?",
        "options": ["23", "46", "92", "2"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A diploid human cell has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes (one from each parent), totaling 46 individual chromosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A diagram shows a chromosome with DNA wrapped around histone proteins, forming nucleosomes. This structure primarily helps with:",
        "options": ["Producing mRNA", "Compacting DNA for cell division", "Replicating centromeres", "Crossing over"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Nucleosomes are the fundamental unit of chromatin packaging. They coil and fold DNA into a more compact, organized structure essential for fitting DNA into the nucleus and for chromosome segregation during division."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A karyotype of a human cell is shown. Chromosomes are arranged in homologous pairs by size and shape. Which of the following best describes the homologs?",
        "options": ["Identical DNA sequences", "Same genes in same order, possibly different alleles", "Completely unrelated sequences", "Sister chromatids"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Homologous chromosomes are matching pairs—one maternal, one paternal. They carry the same genes at the same loci, but the specific DNA sequences (alleles) for those genes can differ."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During interphase, a cell has 46 chromosomes, each consisting of a single chromatid. After S phase, how many chromatids are present?",
        "options": ["46", "23", "92", "184"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "During S phase, each chromosome is replicated. The 46 single-chromatid chromosomes become 46 chromosomes, each composed of two identical sister chromatids, for a total of 92 chromatids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A scientist labels the centromere of a chromosome with a fluorescent marker. Which of the following functions does the centromere serve?",
        "options": ["Attaches sister chromatids to spindle fibers", "Initiates DNA replication", "Contains RNA polymerase", "Forms the nuclear membrane"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The centromere is the site where kinetochore proteins assemble. The kinetochore is the structure that attaches chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic or meiotic spindle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metaphase chromosome is shown with two sister chromatids. Which of the following is true?",
        "options": ["Chromatids are homologous", "Chromatids are identical copies", "Chromatids are unrelated", "Chromatids have different genes"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sister chromatids are produced during DNA replication and are identical copies of the same DNA molecule, joined together at the centromere until anaphase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A human somatic cell undergoes G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Which phase is responsible for DNA synthesis?",
        "options": ["G1", "S", "G2", "M"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The S phase (Synthesis phase) is dedicated to DNA replication."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A diagram shows the four phases of interphase: G1, S, G2, and M. Which checkpoint ensures DNA is undamaged before replication?",
        "options": ["G1 checkpoint", "G2 checkpoint", "Metaphase checkpoint", "Cytokinesis checkpoint"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The G1 checkpoint (or restriction point) assesses cell size, nutrients, and DNA integrity. If DNA is damaged, the cell cycle halts to allow repair before committing to DNA synthesis in S phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell is prevented from passing the G2 checkpoint. Which is the likely outcome?",
        "options": ["Cell enters mitosis with damaged DNA", "Cell cycle is halted until damage is repaired", "Cytokinesis occurs prematurely", "Chromosome number doubles"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The G2 checkpoint verifies that DNA replication in S phase is complete and accurate. If DNA damage is detected or replication is incomplete, the cell cycle arrests to facilitate repair, preventing the propagation of errors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A eukaryotic chromosome is composed of DNA and histone proteins. During metaphase, the chromosome appears highly condensed. Why is this condensation important?",
        "options": ["Allows crossing over", "Facilitates accurate segregation", "Prevents transcription", "Initiates S phase"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Chromosome condensation prevents the long DNA fibers from tangling, making them structurally robust and easy for the spindle apparatus to maneuver, ensuring accurate segregation to daughter cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A diagram shows homologous chromosomes pairing and exchanging segments. This event occurs during:",
        "options": ["Prophase I", "Metaphase I", "Anaphase I", "Telophase II"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crossing over, the physical exchange of segments between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, is a hallmark event of Prophase I of meiosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell with 8 chromosomes undergoes meiosis. How many chromosomes are present in each daughter cell after meiosis I?",
        "options": ["8", "4", "16", "2"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Meiosis I is a reductional division. It separates homologous chromosomes. A diploid cell (2n=8) will produce two haploid (n=4) daughter cells at the end of meiosis I."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During meiosis II, sister chromatids separate. Which phase of mitosis is most similar?",
        "options": ["Prophase", "Metaphase", "Anaphase", "Telophase"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The separation of sister chromatids in anaphase of mitosis and anaphase II of meiosis is mechanistically identical and serves the same purpose: to distribute one copy of each chromosome to a new cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metaphase I cell is shown with homologous pairs aligned at the metaphase plate. Which checkpoint ensures proper spindle attachment before anaphase I?",
        "options": ["G1 checkpoint", "G2 checkpoint", "Metaphase checkpoint", "S phase checkpoint"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The metaphase checkpoint (spindle assembly checkpoint) monitors the attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules. It ensures all chromosomes are bi-oriented before the separation of homologs in anaphase I."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A researcher observes nondisjunction in meiosis I. What is the likely outcome?",
        "options": ["All gametes are normal", "Two gametes have an extra chromosome, two lack one", "Sister chromatids fail to separate in meiosis II", "Gametes have identical chromosomes"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Nondisjunction in meiosis I is the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate. This results in two gametes receiving both homologs (n+1) and two gametes receiving neither (n-1)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A diagram shows independent assortment of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I. Which concept is illustrated?",
        "options": ["Crossing over", "Genetic variation", "DNA replication", "Chromosome condensation"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Independent assortment refers to the random orientation of homologous pairs at metaphase I, which generates diverse combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes in gametes, a major source of genetic variation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell passes the metaphase checkpoint of meiosis I successfully. Which event is most likely verified?",
        "options": ["DNA replication complete", "Chromosomes properly attached to spindle fibers", "Homologous chromosomes have separated", "Cytokinesis completed"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The metaphase checkpoint's sole function is to verify that all chromosomes are correctly attached to the spindle apparatus via their kinetochores before anaphase begins."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A gamete ends up with 22 autosomes and an X chromosome. Which process most likely produced this result?",
        "options": ["Normal meiosis", "Nondisjunction during meiosis", "Mitosis", "Binary fission"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While 22+X is a normal female gamete, the phrasing implies an assessment of chromosome count in a context where abnormality is relevant. An unusual chromosome number (like 22+X from a male or 24,X) would result from nondisjunction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During meiosis II, a scientist measures DNA content per chromosome in a cell with 4 chromosomes. How many chromatids are present in metaphase II?",
        "options": ["2", "4", "8", "16"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At the start of meiosis II, a haploid cell has its chromosomes still in a duplicated state (each chromosome = 2 sister chromatids). A cell with 4 chromosomes thus contains 4 * 2 = 8 chromatids at metaphase II."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell in metaphase I has homologous chromosomes attached to spindle fibers. Which statement is true?",
        "options": ["Each pair consists of sister chromatids and homologous chromosomes", "Chromosomes are haploid", "Homologs are genetically identical", "The cell is already diploid after meiosis I"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In metaphase I, homologous chromosomes (each consisting of two sister chromatids) are paired. This structure is called a tetrad. The homologous chromosomes are not genetically identical; they are homologous."
