      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In guinea pigs, black coat color (B) is dominant over white (b). If two heterozygous black guinea pigs are crossed, what percentage of their offspring would be expected to be homozygous recessive?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "75%"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross: Bb × Bb. Expected genotypic ratio: 1 BB : 2 Bb : 1 bb. Homozygous recessive (bb) = 1/4 = 25%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The phenomenon where one gene masks the expression of another gene at a different locus is called:",
        "options": ["Pleiotropy", "Epistasis", "Codominance", "Incomplete dominance"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Epistasis occurs when one gene affects the expression of another gene at a different locus. Example: Coat color in labs where the E/e gene determines if pigment is deposited, masking the B/b gene for black/brown color."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In humans, attached earlobes are recessive to free earlobes. If a man with attached earlobes (ee) marries a woman who is heterozygous for free earlobes (Ee), what is the probability their first child will have attached earlobes?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cross: ee × Ee. Punnett square: 50% Ee (free) and 50% ee (attached). Probability of attached earlobes = 50%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements about homologous chromosomes is correct?",
        "options": [
          "They are identical copies of each other",
          "They separate during mitosis",
          "They carry the same genes but may have different alleles",
          "They are only present in haploid cells"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Homologous chromosomes are pairs (one maternal, one paternal) that carry the same genes at the same loci but may have different alleles. They separate during meiosis I, not mitosis, and are present in diploid cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pea plant with genotype YyRr is crossed with a plant with genotype yyrr. If the genes are on different chromosomes, what proportion of offspring would be expected to have the recessive phenotype for both traits?",
        "options": ["1/16", "1/8", "1/4", "1/2"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is a test cross for two independently assorting genes. YyRr produces 4 gamete types: YR, Yr, yR, yr in equal proportion. yyrr produces only yr gametes. Offspring with recessive phenotype for both traits (yyrr) come only from yr gamete from YyRr parent. Probability = 1/4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In cats, the gene for coat color is X-linked. A calico cat (XᴮXᵇ) is crossed with an orange male (XᴮY). What percentage of male offspring would be expected to be black?",
        "options": ["0%", "25%", "50%", "100%"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Calico female: XᴮXᵇ (heterozygous). Orange male: XᴮY. Male offspring inherit Y chromosome from father and one X from mother. From mother: 50% chance of Xᴮ (orange), 50% chance of Xᵇ (black). Therefore, 50% of male offspring would be black (XᵇY)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The principle of segregation states that:",
        "options": [
          "Alleles of different genes assort independently during gamete formation",
          "Homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis I",
          "Sister chromatids separate during meiosis II",
          "Allele pairs separate during gamete formation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Mendel's Law of Segregation states that allele pairs separate (segregate) during gamete formation so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. This corresponds to the separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a pedigree, if an autosomal recessive trait appears in offspring of unaffected parents, what must be true about the parents?",
        "options": [
          "Both parents are homozygous recessive",
          "Both parents are heterozygous carriers",
          "One parent is homozygous dominant, the other heterozygous",
          "One parent is homozygous recessive, the other heterozygous"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For an autosomal recessive trait to appear in offspring of unaffected parents, both parents must be heterozygous carriers (Aa × Aa). Their genotypes allow them to be unaffected (dominant phenotype) while carrying the recessive allele that can combine to produce affected offspring (aa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a diploid cell with 24 chromosomes undergoes meiosis, how many chromosomes will each resulting gamete have?",
        "options": ["6", "12", "24", "48"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Meiosis reduces chromosome number by half. Diploid (2n) = 24 chromosomes, so haploid (n) gametes will have 12 chromosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In chickens, rose comb (R) is dominant over single comb (r). If two heterozygous rose-combed chickens are crossed, and 16 offspring are produced, how many would be expected to have single combs?",
        "options": ["1", "4", "8", "12"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross: Rr × Rr. Expected phenotypic ratio: 3 rose : 1 single. With 16 offspring, expected single comb = (1/4) × 16 = 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would produce the greatest genetic variation in offspring?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis in somatic cells",
          "Binary fission in bacteria",
          "Asexual reproduction in plants",
          "Sexual reproduction with crossing over"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Sexual reproduction with crossing over produces the greatest genetic variation due to: 1) Independent assortment of chromosomes, 2) Crossing over during prophase I, and 3) Random fertilization. The other options produce genetically identical or nearly identical offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A test cross is performed to determine the genotype of a dominant phenotype individual. This involves crossing it with:",
        "options": [
          "A homozygous dominant individual",
          "A heterozygous individual",
          "A homozygous recessive individual",
          "Any individual with the dominant phenotype"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A test cross involves crossing an individual of unknown genotype (but dominant phenotype) with a homozygous recessive individual. If any recessive offspring appear, the unknown parent must be heterozygous. If all offspring show dominant phenotype, the unknown is likely homozygous dominant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a certain plant, red flowers (R) are incompletely dominant over white flowers (r), with heterozygotes being pink. If two pink flowers are crossed, what phenotypic ratio would be expected in the offspring?",
        "options": [
          "All red",
          "1 red : 2 pink : 1 white",
          "3 red : 1 white",
          "1 pink : 1 white"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross: Rr (pink) × Rr (pink). Genotypic ratio: 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr. Phenotypic ratio: 1 red (RR) : 2 pink (Rr) : 1 white (rr)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During which phase of meiosis does crossing over occur?",
        "options": ["Metaphase I", "Anaphase I", "Prophase I", "Telophase II"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Crossing over occurs during Prophase I of meiosis, specifically during the pachytene substage when homologous chromosomes are paired (synapsed) and non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous individuals (AaBb × AaBb), if the genes are linked with 20% recombination frequency, how would the phenotypic ratio differ from the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio?",
        "options": [
          "There would be more parental phenotypes than expected",
          "There would be more recombinant phenotypes than expected",
          "The ratio would be exactly 9:3:3:1",
          "All offspring would show the same phenotype"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Linked genes do not assort independently. With 20% recombination frequency, only 20% of gametes are recombinant types. This means parental combinations (the original combinations from the grandparents) will be overrepresented in offspring compared to the 9:3:3:1 ratio expected for independent assortment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A woman with type O blood marries a man with type AB blood. What blood types are possible in their children?",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In rabbits, black fur (B) is dominant over brown fur (b). Short fur (S) is dominant over long fur (s). If two heterozygous black, short-furred rabbits (BbSs) are crossed, what is the probability of getting a brown, long-furred rabbit?",
        "options": ["1/16", "3/16", "9/16", "3/4"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For independently assorting genes: BbSs × BbSs. Probability of brown (bb) = 1/4. Probability of long (ss) = 1/4. Combined probability (bbss) = (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16."
      },

          "Haploid, duplicated chromosomes",
          "Haploid, unduplicated chromosomes",
          "Diploid, duplicated chromosomes",
          "Diploid, unduplicated chromosomes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the end of meiosis I: The cell is haploid (n) because homologous chromosomes have separated, but each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids (duplicated). Sister chromatids separate in meiosis II."
