    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary function of the endomembrane system?",
        "options": [
          "Synthesis of proteins and lipids",
          "Modification and sorting of macromolecules",
          "Detoxification of harmful substances",
          "ATP production through cellular respiration"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "ATP production is the primary function of mitochondria. The endomembrane system (ER, Golgi, vesicles, lysosomes) is responsible for the synthesis, modification, sorting, and breakdown of macromolecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary role of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)?",
        "options": [
          "Calcium ion storage",
          "Lipid and steroid synthesis",
          "Protein synthesis and initial modification",
          "Breakdown of fatty acids"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The RER is 'rough' due to the presence of ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface. These ribosomes synthesize proteins that are concurrently translocated into the RER lumen for folding and initial modifications like glycosylation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transport vesicles that bud from the ER most likely fuse with which organelle?",
        "options": [
          "The Golgi apparatus",
          "Lysosomes",
          "Peroxisomes",
          "The nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Proteins synthesized in the RER are packaged into transport vesicles that travel to and fuse with the cis face of the Golgi apparatus for further processing, sorting, and packaging."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of the Golgi apparatus?",
        "options": [
          "To synthesize phospholipids for all cellular membranes",
          "To modify, sort, and package proteins and lipids for storage or transport",
          "To assemble ribosomal subunits",
          "To oxidize fatty acids"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Golgi acts as the cell's 'post office.' It receives products from the ER, modifies them (e.g., adding carbohydrate tags), sorts them, and packages them into vesicles for delivery to their final destinations (lysosomes, plasma membrane, or secretion)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles that contain...",
        "options": [
          "Photosynthetic pigments",
          "Powerful hydrolytic enzymes",
          "The cell's genetic material",
          "Enzymes for the citric acid cycle"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lysosomes contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes (acid hydrolases) that function best at an acidic pH to break down macromolecules, old organelles, and ingested pathogens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are the hydrolytic enzymes of lysosomes prevented from digesting the cell's own cytoplasm?",
        "options": [
          "They are only active in the neutral pH of the cytoplasm",
          "They are sequestered within the lysosomal membrane",
          "The cytoplasm contains specific enzyme inhibitors",
          "They are synthesized in an inactive form and only activated in the lysosome"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The lysosomal membrane sequesters the destructive hydrolytic enzymes from the cytosol. Additionally, the internal pH of lysosomes is maintained at around 4.5-5.0, which is optimal for these enzymes but denatures most cytoplasmic enzymes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary role of peroxisomes?",
        "options": [
          "Intracellular digestion using acidic hydrolases",
          "Oxidation of fatty acids and detoxification of harmful substances like hydrogen peroxide",
          "Synthesis of secretory proteins",
          "Storage of calcium ions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Peroxisomes contain enzymes that oxidize fatty acids and amino acids, producing hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as a by-product. They also contain the enzyme catalase, which converts this toxic H₂O₂ into water and oxygen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which organelle is responsible for the synthesis of most of a cell's membrane phospholipids?",
        "options": [
          "The rough ER",
          "The smooth ER",
          "The Golgi apparatus",
          "Lysosomes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) lacks ribosomes and is a primary site for lipid synthesis, including phospholipids and steroids. It also plays roles in carbohydrate metabolism, detoxification, and calcium ion storage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vesicle carrying digestive enzymes that fuses with a phagocytic vesicle (containing a captured bacterium) is most likely a...",
        "options": [
          "Peroxisome",
          "Transport vesicle",
          "Lysosome",
          "Lipid droplet"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This describes the process of phagocytosis. A lysosome fuses with the phagosome (the vesicle containing the ingested material), forming a phagolysosome where the hydrolytic enzymes digest the contents."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct pathway a secretory protein (like insulin) takes from its synthesis to its release from the cell?",
        "options": [
          "Golgi → RER → Vesicle → Plasma Membrane",
          "RER → Vesicle → Golgi → Vesicle → Plasma Membrane",
          "SER → Golgi → Lysosome → Plasma Membrane",
          "Nucleus → RER → Golgi → Plasma Membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A secretory protein is synthesized by ribosomes on the RER, enters the RER lumen, is packaged into a transport vesicle to the Golgi for modification, and is then packaged into a secretory vesicle that fuses with the plasma membrane for exocytosis."
