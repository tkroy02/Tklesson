      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A eukaryotic cell is observed under a microscope. Its DNA is uncondensed, and the cell is metabolically active, producing proteins and increasing the number of mitochondria. Which phase of the cell cycle is most likely occurring?",
        "options": ["M", "G1", "S", "G2"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "G1 (Gap 1) is a phase of growth and high metabolic activity where the cell prepares for DNA replication. Chromatin is uncondensed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell has just completed DNA replication and is preparing for mitosis. Which phase is this?",
        "options": ["G1", "S", "G2", "Cytokinesis"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The G2 phase occurs after S phase (DNA synthesis) and serves as a final preparation and growth period before the cell enters mitosis (M phase)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a lab observation, chromosomes are condensed, spindle fibers attach to centromeres, and the nuclear envelope breaks down. Which phase is being observed?",
        "options": ["Prophase", "Metaphase", "Anaphase", "Telophase"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Prophase is characterized by chromosome condensation, formation of the mitotic spindle, and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate during cell division. Why is this stage critical?",
        "options": ["Ensures equal segregation of chromatids", "DNA replication occurs", "Cell grows in size", "Cytoplasm divides"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metaphase alignment at the equatorial plane ensures that when sister chromatids separate in anaphase, they are pulled to opposite poles, guaranteeing each new cell receives an identical set of chromosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During an experiment, a scientist compares cytokinesis in plant and animal cells. Which of the following is correct?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cdks, when bound to their cyclin partners, phosphorylate target proteins to drive the cell cycle forward. Inhibiting Cdks halts progression through the cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell detects DNA damage and halts before entering S phase. Which checkpoint is responsible?",
        "options": ["G1 checkpoint", "G2 checkpoint", "Metaphase checkpoint", "S checkpoint"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The G1 checkpoint (restriction point) assesses DNA integrity, cell size, and nutrient availability. If DNA damage is detected, the cycle arrests to allow repair before committing to replication."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MPF is a Cdk-cyclin complex that triggers the onset of mitosis. Its concentration peaks at the G2/M transition, initiating nuclear envelope breakdown and other early mitotic events."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell continues dividing uncontrollably, ignoring signals to stop. Which is the most likely explanation?",
        "options": ["Cyclin levels too low", "Cdk activity inhibited", "Cell cycle control disrupted", "Cytokinesis incomplete"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Uncontrolled cell division is a hallmark of cancer, typically caused by mutations that disrupt normal cell cycle control mechanisms, such as in tumor suppressor genes (e.g., p53) or proto-oncogenes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A germ cell has 8 chromosomes (4 homologous pairs). After meiosis I, each daughter cell has:",
        "options": ["4 chromosomes", "8 chromosomes", "2 chromosomes", "16 chromosomes"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes. A diploid cell (2n=8) will produce two haploid (n=4) daughter cells at the end of Meiosis I."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During meiosis II, sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles. Which stage of mitosis is most similar?",
        "options": ["Prophase", "Metaphase", "Anaphase", "Telophase"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The separation of sister chromatids in Anaphase II of meiosis is mechanistically identical to the separation of sister chromatids in Anaphase of mitosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metaphase I cell has homologous pairs aligned at the spindle. Spindle fibers are properly attached. Which checkpoint ensures accurate chromosome segregation?",
        "options": ["G1 checkpoint", "G2 checkpoint", "Metaphase checkpoint", "Cytokinesis checkpoint"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The metaphase checkpoint (spindle assembly checkpoint) monitors the attachment of spindle fibers to chromosomes. It prevents anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly bi-oriented, ensuring accurate segregation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Nondisjunction occurs during meiosis I in a human cell. What is the outcome in gametes?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Nondisjunction in Meiosis I results in the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate. This yields two gametes with an extra chromosome (n+1) and two gametes missing a chromosome (n-1)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell exhibits independent assortment of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I. What is the main evolutionary advantage?",
        "options": ["Rapid cell division", "Genetic variation", "DNA repair", "Identical gametes"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Independent assortment refers to the random alignment of homologous pairs at metaphase I. This random sorting generates a vast diversity of chromosome combinations in gametes, increasing genetic variation in offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Meiosis produces gametes, while mitosis produces somatic cells. Which of the following is true?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The primary function of meiosis is to reduce the chromosome number by half (from diploid to haploid) to produce gametes for sexual reproduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During meiosis, crossing over fails to occur. Which is the most likely consequence?",
        "options": ["Gametes genetically identical to parents", "Gametes always inviable", "Homologous chromosomes fail to separate", "Cell cycle arrests"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crossing over shuffles alleles between homologous chromosomes. Without it, the only source of genetic shuffling is independent assortment. The resulting gametes would be genetically identical to the parental combinations present in the original diploid cell (barring new mutations)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student compares mitosis and meiosis: Both involve DNA replication. Both involve spindle fibers. Only one produces haploid cells. Which statement is correct?",
