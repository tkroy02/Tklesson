    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of ribosomes?",
        "options": [
          "Lipid synthesis",
          "ATP production",
          "Protein synthesis",
          "Intracellular digestion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ribosomes are complex macromolecules made of rRNA and protein. Their sole function is to carry out protein synthesis (translation) by reading mRNA sequences and assembling amino acids into polypeptide chains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where in the cell can ribosomes be found?",
        "options": [
          "Attached to the rough ER only",
          "Suspended in the cytosol only",
          "Inside the nucleus",
          "Both suspended in the cytosol and attached to the rough ER"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Ribosomes are found in two locations: 'free' ribosomes are suspended in the cytosol and make proteins that function within the cytosol, while 'bound' ribosomes are attached to the rough ER and make proteins destined for membranes, secretion, or lysosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a key structural difference between the central vacuole in plant cells and the smaller vacuoles in animal cells?",
        "options": [
          "Only plant vacuoles are membrane-bound.",
          "The plant central vacuole is a permanent, large structure that maintains turgor pressure.",
          "Animal cell vacuoles are used for storage, but plant vacuoles are not.",
          "Plant vacuoles perform intracellular digestion, but animal vacuoles do not."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The plant central vacuole is a defining organelle that can occupy up to 90% of the cell's volume. It stores water, ions, and pigments, and its turgor pressure provides structural support for the plant. Animal cells have smaller, more temporary vacuoles for various functions."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary role of the centrosome in animal cells?",
        "options": [
          "To synthesize and organize microtubules",
          "To be the site of cellular respiration",
          "To store the cell's genetic material",
          "To break down fatty acids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The centrosome is a microtubule-organizing center. It contains a pair of centrioles and serves as the site where microtubule assembly is initiated. It is crucial for organizing the mitotic spindle during cell division."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the core structural arrangement of microtubules in both cilia and flagella?",
        "options": [
          "A solid bundle of actin filaments",
          "A '9+0' arrangement of microtubules",
          "A '9+2' arrangement of microtubules",
          "A random network of intermediate filaments"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Most motile cilia and flagella have a characteristic '9+2' axoneme structure: a ring of nine outer microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair of single microtubules. This structure is essential for their whip-like movement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the functions of cilia and flagella typically differ in eukaryotic cells?",
        "options": [
          "Cilia are for sensation, flagella are for movement.",
          "Cilia move the cell itself, while flagella move fluid over the cell's surface.",
          "Flagella are typically more numerous and shorter than cilia.",
          "Cilia are often numerous and move fluid, while flagella are usually few and long, propelling the cell."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Cilia are usually short, numerous, and hair-like, often working in coordinated beats to move fluid or particles along a cell's surface (e.g., in the trachea). Flagella are typically long, few in number (often just one or two), and used for cellular propulsion (e.g., sperm cell)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which motor protein is responsible for the bending movement of cilia and flagella?",
        "options": [
          "Kinesin",
          "Myosin",
          "Dynein",
          "Actin"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Dynein arms, which are motor proteins attached to the outer microtubule doublets, 'walk' along adjacent doublets. Using ATP, this activity causes the doublets to slide past each other, which is converted into the bending motion of the cilium or flagellum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the function of food vacuoles?",
        "options": [
          "To perform photosynthesis",
          "To store genetic material",
          "To form by phagocytosis and store ingested food",
          "To pump water out of the cell"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Food vacuoles are formed when a cell engulfs solid food particles through phagocytosis. The vacuole then fuses with a lysosome, where the ingested material is digested."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following structures is NOT membrane-bound?",
        "options": [
          "Lysosome",
          "Ribosome",
          "Vacuole",
          "Golgi Apparatus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane. They are non-membranous organelles composed of rRNA and proteins, which distinguishes them from other organelles like the lysosome, vacuole, and Golgi."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Primary cilia, found on many animal cells, are generally...",
        "options": [
          "Motile and used for propulsion",
          "Non-motile and act as sensory antennae",
          "Used for intracellular digestion",
          "The site of protein synthesis"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Most cells in the human body have a single, non-motile primary cilium that functions as a sensory organelle, detecting chemical and mechanical signals from the environment (e.g., light, flow, hormones)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Contractile vacuoles are essential for the survival of many freshwater protists. What is their primary function?",
        "options": [
          "Storing food",
          "Pumping excess water out of the cell",
          "Generating ATP",
          "Synthesizing proteins"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Freshwater protists live in a hypotonic environment where water constantly diffuses into the cell. The contractile vacuole actively pumps this excess water out to prevent the cell from lysing (bursting)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental structural component of the centrosome's centrioles?",
        "options": [
          "Microfilaments (Actin)",
          "Intermediate Filaments",
          "Microtubules",
          "Collagen"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Centrioles are composed of nine triplets of microtubules arranged in a cylinder. These microtubules form the core structure around which the centrosome organizes the cytoplasmic microtubules."
