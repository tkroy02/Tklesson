      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the pH scale actually measure?",
        "options": [
          "The concentration of hydroxide ions (OH⁻)",
          "The concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺)",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The system H₂CO₃ ⇌ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻ can shift in either direction: HCO₃⁻ absorbs excess H⁺, and H₂CO₃ can donate H⁺ when needed, maintaining stable blood pH."
      },
      {
