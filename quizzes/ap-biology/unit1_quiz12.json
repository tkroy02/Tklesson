        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A polymer is a large molecule composed of many repeating subunits called monomers. Proteins are one type of polymer, but the description fits any polymer (carbohydrates, nucleic acids)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The unique properties of water that make it essential for life are primarily a result of:",
        "options": [
          "Its low specific heat capacity",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Water's cohesion, adhesion, high specific heat, and solvent properties are all emergent properties resulting from hydrogen bonding between its polar molecules."
      },
      {

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The pH scale is logarithmic. A decrease of 3 pH units means the [H⁺] has increased by 10³, or 1000 times."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary structure of a protein is determined by:",

          "The number of polypeptide subunits"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. This sequence dictates all higher levels of protein folding and function."
      },

          "They are both purines",
          "They form two hydrogen bonds and have compatible shapes",
          "They are covalently bonded to the sugar-phosphate backbone"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds, and their molecular structures are complementary, allowing them to fit together within the double helix. Guanine and cytosine form three hydrogen bonds."

          "Condensation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Hydrolysis breaks polymers into monomers by adding a water molecule to break the bonds (in this case, glycosidic linkages). Dehydration synthesis does the opposite."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solution with a pH of 2 is considered a(n):",

          "The number of fatty acids attached to glycerol"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Saturated fats have no double bonds between carbon atoms in their hydrocarbon tails (they are 'saturated' with hydrogen), while unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds, creating kinks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student denatures a protein by heating it. Which level of protein structure is most directly and immediately disrupted?",

          "Quaternary"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While heat disrupts all non-covalent bonds, the tertiary structure—the overall 3D shape of a single polypeptide—is the most directly affected, causing the protein to unfold and lose function. The primary structure (sequence) remains intact."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'central dogma' of molecular biology describes the flow of information as:",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A buffer is a substance that helps a solution resist changes in:",

        "question": "The R-group (side chain) of an amino acid determines all of the following EXCEPT:",
        "options": [

          "The primary structure of the protein",
          "The specific interactions that stabilize tertiary structure",
          "The sequence of nucleotides in the gene that codes for it"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The DNA nucleotide sequence determines the amino acid sequence (primary structure), including which R-group is present. The R-group itself does not determine the DNA sequence; it's the other way around."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key structural difference between DNA and RNA?",

          "DNA is single-stranded; RNA is double-stranded",
          "DNA has a hydroxyl group on the 2' carbon; RNA does not",
          "DNA has deoxyribose sugar; RNA has ribose sugar"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The fundamental chemical difference is the sugar: DNA has deoxyribose (lacking an oxygen on the 2' carbon), while RNA has ribose. This makes DNA more stable. RNA has uracil instead of thymine and is typically single-stranded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The cohesion of water molecules, which allows for the transport of water against gravity in plants, is a result of:",

          "Ionic dissociation of water"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cohesion is the attraction between like molecules. Water's cohesion is due to hydrogen bonding between water molecules, which creates a continuous 'column' of water that can be pulled up through a plant's xylem."

          "Is stabilized primarily by peptide bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Quaternary structure is the association of two or more polypeptide chains (subunits) into one functional protein complex, such as hemoglobin which has four subunits."

        "question": "Which of the following best summarizes the relationship between dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis?",
        "options": [
          "They are both catabolic processes that release energy",
          "Dehydration synthesis assembles polymers, and hydrolysis breaks them down",
          "Hydrolysis creates monomers, and dehydration synthesis creates polymers",
          "Both B and C are correct"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Dehydration synthesis (anabolic) builds polymers from monomers by removing water. Hydrolysis (catabolic) breaks down polymers into monomers by adding water. They are reverse processes central to the dynamic state of cellular metabolism."
