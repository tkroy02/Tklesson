    "subtitle": "13.4: Systems of Nonlinear Inequalities",
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Graphing regions defined by non-linear boundaries",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which region is represented by the inequality $x^2 + y^2 \\le 16$?",
        "options": [
          "The interior of a circle with radius 4, including the boundary.",
          "The exterior of a circle with radius 4, including the boundary.",
          "The interior of a circle with radius 16, excluding the boundary.",
          "The area above a parabola with vertex at $(0, 0)$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation $x^2 + y^2 = 16$ describes a circle of radius 4. The 'less than or equal to' sign indicates the shaded region is inside the circle and the boundary is solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Describe the graph of the system: $y > x^2$ and $y < 4$.",
        "options": [
          "The region inside the parabola $y = x^2$ but below the horizontal line $y = 4$.",
          "The region outside the parabola $y = x^2$ and above the line $y = 4$.",
          "A circle centered at the origin with radius 2.",
          "A V-shaped region in the first quadrant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y > x^2$ shades the 'inside' or upper part of the parabola bowl. $y < 4$ limits that region to everything below the line $y = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the inequality $y \\le -x^2 + 4$, what type of boundary line should be used and where is the shading?",
        "options": [
          "Solid line, shaded below the parabola.",
          "Dashed line, shaded above the parabola.",
          "Solid line, shaded above the parabola.",
          "Dashed line, shaded inside the parabola."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $\\le$ symbol indicates a solid boundary. Since it is 'less than' the negative parabola, we shade the region below the curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is the origin $(0, 0)$ a solution to the system: $x^2 + y^2 > 9$ and $y < x^2 + 1$?",
        "options": [
          "No, it fails the first inequality.",
          "No, it fails the second inequality.",
          "Yes, it satisfies both.",
          "No, it fails both."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Checking $(0, 0)$: $0^2 + 0^2 > 9$ is $0 > 9$, which is false. Even though it satisfies the second ($0 < 1$), it must satisfy both to be a solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a system where $x^2 + y^2 \\le 25$ and $x^2 + y^2 \\ge 9$, what shape is the feasible region?",
        "options": [
          "An annulus (ring-shaped region).",
          "A smaller circle inside a larger circle.",
          "Two separate circles that do not touch.",
          "A square inside a circle."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The region is inside the circle of radius 5 but outside the circle of radius 3, creating a ring or 'donut' shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many intersection points define the vertices of the region bounded by $y \\ge x^2$ and $y \\le 9$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "0",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parabola and the line intersect where $x^2 = 9$, which is at $x = 3$ and $x = -3$. This creates two vertices: $(3, 9)$ and $(-3, 9)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the boundary for the inequality $y < \\sqrt{x}$?",
        "options": [
          "A dashed half-parabola opening to the right.",
          "A solid line with a slope of 1.",
          "A dashed circle centered at $(0, 0)$.",
          "A dashed V-shape."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y = \\sqrt{x}$ is the upper half of a horizontal parabola. It is dashed due to the strict inequality ($<$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which point satisfies the system: $y > x^2 - 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 < 4$?",
        "options": [
          "$(0, 0)$",
          "$(2, 2)$",
          "$(0, -2)$",
          "$(5, 0)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $(0, 0)$: $0 > -1$ (True) and $0 < 4$ (True). The point $(2, 2)$ fails the circle ($4 + 4 < 4$ is False)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system consists of $y \\ge x^2 + 1$ and $y \\le x^2 - 1$, how many solutions exist?",
        "options": [
          "No solution",
          "Infinitely many",
          "One solution",
          "Two solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first inequality shades above a parabola starting at $y=1$. The second shades below a parabola starting at $y=-1$. The regions never overlap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Describe the boundary line for $\\frac{x^2}{9} + \\frac{y^2}{16} > 1$.",
        "options": [
          "A dashed ellipse.",
          "A solid ellipse.",
          "A dashed circle.",
          "A solid hyperbola."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation is an ellipse with different semi-axes ($a=3, b=4$). The symbol ($>$) dictates a dashed boundary."
