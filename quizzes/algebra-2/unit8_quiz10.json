    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in a proof by mathematical induction?",
        "options": [
          "Prove the 'Base Case' (usually n=1)",
          "Assume the statement is true for all n",
          "Solve for x",
          "Find the common difference"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must first show the statement works for the very first integer in the set."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Inductive Step, we assume the statement is true for $n = k$. What is this assumption called?",
        "options": [
          "The Inductive Hypothesis",
          "The Base Case",
          "The Recursive Rule",
          "The Conclusion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'Inductive Hypothesis' is the temporary assumption that the formula works for some arbitrary integer k."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After assuming the statement is true for $n = k$, what is the goal of the next step?",
        "options": [
          "To prove it is true for $n = k + 1$",
          "To prove it is true for $n = 1$",
          "To find the sum of the series",
          "To find the common ratio"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Induction relies on showing that truth at one step ($k$) forces truth at the next step ($k+1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mathematical induction is most similar to which real-world analogy?",
        "options": [
          "A falling row of dominoes",
          "A balancing scale",
          "A revolving door",
          "A road map"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the first one falls and each one knocks down the next, they all fall."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose you want to prove $1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. What is the Base Case ($n=1$)?",
        "options": [
          "$1 = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2}$",
          "$1 = 2$",
          "$n = 1$",
          "$1 + 2 = 3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plugging 1 into both sides gives $1 = 1$, which confirms the base case is true."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is induction useful for proving formulas for series?",
        "options": [
          "It proves the formula for an infinite number of cases",
          "It makes the calculations shorter",
          "It eliminates the need for algebra",
          "It only works for geometric series"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Induction allows us to conclude a statement is true for all $n$ without testing every single number (which would take forever!)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Base Case is true, but the Inductive Step fails, what can you conclude?",
        "options": [
          "The statement is not true for all n",
          "The statement is true for all n",
          "The statement is only true for n=1",
          "The statement is a geometric sequence"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both steps must be successful for the proof to be valid for all integers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Mathematical Induction can be used to prove properties of divisibility.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Induction is often used to prove that expressions like $n^3 - n$ are always divisible by a certain number (like 3)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you prove a statement for $n=1$ and then prove that $k \\Rightarrow k+1$, you have proven the statement for:",
        "options": [
          "All positive integers",
          "Only even integers",
          "Only k integers",
          "All real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Induction covers the set of natural numbers ($1, 2, 3...$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What mathematical symbol is often used at the end of a successful proof?",
        "options": [
          "Q.E.D. (or a square box)",
          "$\\sum$",
          "$\\infty$",
          "$\\Delta$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
