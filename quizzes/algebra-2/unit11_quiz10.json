      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An oceanographer measures the tide. The high tide is $12$ feet and the low tide is $2$ feet. What is the midline ($k$) of the trigonometric model?",
        "options": [
          "7 feet",
          "5 feet",

          "14 feet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The midline is the average of the max and min: $(12 + 2) / 2 = 7$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amplitude is the distance from the midline to the max: $12 - 7 = 5$ feet (or $(12-2)/2$)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Ferris wheel ticket costs \\$15. The wheel has a diameter of $40$ meters and the bottom of the wheel is $2$ meters off the ground. What is the maximum height reached by a rider?",

          "22 meters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Max height = Diameter + Height of bottom. $40 + 2 = 42$ meters."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The temperature in a city fluctuates between $60^{\\circ}$F and $90^{\\circ}$F every $24$ hours. If $t=0$ represents midnight and the low temperature occurs at midnight, which function best models this using a negative cosine graph?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Midline = 75, Amplitude = 15. Period = 24, so $b = 2\\pi/24 = \\pi/12$. A negative cosine starts at the minimum."

          "Sine",
          "Cosine",
          "Negative Sine",
          "Negative Cosine"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At 15 seconds, the rider has completed 1/4 of the cycle. 1/4 of a cycle from the bottom puts the rider exactly at the midline (22 meters)."
