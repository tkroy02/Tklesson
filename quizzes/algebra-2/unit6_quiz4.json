    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the formula $A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$, what does the variable $n$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The number of times interest is compounded per year",
          "The number of years the money is invested",
          "The annual interest rate as a decimal",
          "The principal amount invested"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The variable $n$ defines the compounding frequency (e.g., monthly $n=12$, quarterly $n=4$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an investment is compounded 'semi-annually', what value should be used for $n$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "4",
          "12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Semi-annually means twice per year, so $n = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents an interest rate of $4.5\\%$ as a decimal ($r$) for use in the formula?",

          "0.045",
          "0.45",
          "4.5",
          "0.0045"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide by 100: $4.5 / 100 = 0.045$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the balance after 1 year if $\\$1,000$ is invested at a $6\\%$ interest rate compounded quarterly.",

          "$\\$1,262.48$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$A = 1000(1 + 0.06/4)^{4 \\cdot 1} = 1000(1.015)^4 \\approx 1061.36$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the total amount $A$ as the compounding frequency $n$ increases (while $P$, $r$, and $t$ remain constant)?",
        "options": [
          "It increases",
          "It decreases",
          "It stays the same",
          "It becomes negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More frequent compounding results in more 'interest on interest,' leading to a higher final balance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you invest money for 18 months, what value should be used for $t$ (time in years)?",

          "0.18",
          "1.8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Time $t$ must be in years. $18$ months $/ 12$ months per year $= 1.5$ years."

          "Quarterly",
          "Annually"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Daily compounding is the most frequent among the choices, resulting in the highest yield."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the formula $A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$, the expression $(1 + \\frac{r}{n})$ represents the:",

          "Periodic growth factor",
          "Total interest rate",
          "Initial principal",
          "Annual percentage yield"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the factor by which the principal is multiplied each compounding period."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Interest $= A - P$. So, $560 - 500 = 60$."

          "Hourly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are 365 days in a standard year, so $n=365$ represents daily compounding."
