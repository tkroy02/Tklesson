    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the second term in the expansion of $(x + y)^4$?",

          "x^4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Row 4 coefficients are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. The second coefficient is 4. The powers are x^(4-1) and y^1, giving 4x^3y."

        "explanation": "Coefficients (1,3,3,1) multiplied by powers: 1(2x)^3 + 3(2x)^2(1) + 3(2x)(1)^2 + 1(1)^3. This simplifies to 8x^3 + 12x^2 + 6x + 1."

          "Only the first and last are negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the binomial is a subtraction, the terms with odd powers of 'y' (the 2nd, 4th, etc.) will be negative."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 3rd term uses r=2 (since we start at r=0). Term = binom(10,2) * x^(10-2) * y^2 = 45x^8y^2."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The x^2 term is the 3rd term. binom(4,2) * x^2 * 3^2 = 6 * x^2 * 9 = 54x^2."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1(x^3) + 3(x^2)(-2) + 3(x)(-2)^2 + 1(-2)^3 = x^3 - 6x^2 + 12x - 8."

        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "16"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first term is (x^2)^4. Using the power of a power rule, $2 \cdot 4 = 8$."
