      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Person A can complete a job in 4 hours and Person B can complete the same job in 6 hours, what is the standard rational equation to find the time ($t$) it takes them to finish together?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{t}$",
          "$4 + 6 = t$",
          "$\\frac{4 + 6}{2} = t$",
          "$\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} = t$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To solve work problems, you add the rates of work. The rate is the reciprocal of the time (1 job per $n$ hours)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the equation $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{t}$, how long does it take Person A and B to finish together?",
        "options": [
          "2.4 hours",
          "5 hours",
          "10 hours",
          "2 hours"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "LCD is $12t$. $3t + 2t = 12 \\Rightarrow 5t = 12 \\Rightarrow t = 2.4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A boat travels 20 miles upstream against a 2 mph current and 20 miles downstream with the same current. If $x$ is the boat's speed in still water, which expression represents the time spent traveling upstream?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{20}{x - 2}$",
          "$\\frac{20}{x + 2}$",
          "$\\frac{x - 2}{20}$",
          "$20(x - 2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Time is $\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}}$. Upstream, the current slows the boat down, so the rate is $x - 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a large pump can empty a pool in 8 hours and a small pump takes 12 hours, which equation represents the pool being emptied by both pumps?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{t}$",
          "$12 - 8 = t$",
          "$\\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{t}$",
          "$\\frac{t}{8} + \\frac{t}{12} = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both A and D are actually mathematically equivalent models for the same situation ($t$ being the total time), but A is the standard rate-addition form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plane flies 600 miles with a 40 mph tailwind and 600 miles back against the same wind. If the total trip takes 5 hours, which equation finds the plane's speed ($x$) in still air?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{600}{x + 40} + \\frac{600}{x - 40} = 5$",
          "$\\frac{600}{x + 40} = \\frac{600}{x - 40}$",
          "$600(x + 40) + 600(x - 40) = 5$",
          "$\\frac{x + 40}{600} + \\frac{x - 40}{600} = 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total Time = Time with wind + Time against wind. Using $t = d/r$, we get the sum of the two rational expressions equal to 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Working alone, it takes Mario 3 hours longer than Luigi to paint a room. Together they can paint it in 2 hours. If $x$ is Luigi's time, which equation is correct?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x + 3} = \\frac{1}{2}$",
          "$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}$",
          "$x + (x + 3) = 2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x - 3} = 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Luigi's rate is $1/x$. Mario's rate is $1/(x+3)$. Their combined rate is $1/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the 'Work' formula, what does the number '1' typically represent in the equation $\\frac{t}{t_1} + \\frac{t}{t_2} = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "One whole job completed",
          "One hour of time",
          "The speed of the faster worker",
          "The number of workers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The right side of the equation represents the portion of the job completed. '1' represents 100% or one full task."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels 150 miles at a certain speed. If the speed is increased by 10 mph, the trip takes 45 minutes ($0.75$ hours) less. What is the correct setup to find the original speed $x$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{150}{x} - \\frac{150}{x + 10} = 0.75$",
          "$\\frac{150}{x} + \\frac{150}{x + 10} = 0.75$",
          "$\\frac{x}{150} - \\frac{x + 10}{150} = 0.75$",
          "$150x - 150(x + 10) = 0.75$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The slower time (original) minus the faster time (new) equals the time saved (0.75 hours)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are solving for time in a work problem and get a negative value for $x$, what should you conclude?",
        "options": [
          "The solution is extraneous (time cannot be negative)",
          "You must take the absolute value",
          "The workers are working in reverse",
          "The math is correct, but the situation is impossible"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In real-world applications, values like time, distance, and speed must be positive. Negative results are extraneous."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pipe can fill a tank in 5 hours, while a drain can empty it in 10 hours. If both are open, which equation represents the time ($t$) to fill the tank?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{t}$",
          "$\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{t}$",
          "$5 + 10 = t$",
          "$\\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{t}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the drain is removing water, its rate is subtracted from the pipe's filling rate."
