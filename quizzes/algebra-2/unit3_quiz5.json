      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Factor Theorem, if $x - 3$ is a factor of a polynomial $f(x)$, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "$f(3) = 0$",
          "$f(-3) = 0$",
          "$f(0) = 3$",
          "The remainder of $f(x) \\div (x + 3)$ is $0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Factor Theorem states that $(x - k)$ is a factor if and only if $f(k) = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 3$ and $f(1) = 0$, which of these is a factor of $f(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$(x - 1)$",
          "$(x + 1)$",
          "$(x - 3)$",
          "$(x + 5)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $k$ is a zero (root), then $(x - k)$ is the corresponding factor. Since $1$ is a zero, $(x - 1)$ is a factor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A polynomial has zeros at $x = -2$, $x = 0$, and $x = 5$. Which of the following could be the function?",
        "options": [
          "$f(x) = x(x + 2)(x - 5)$",
          "$f(x) = (x - 2)x(x + 5)$",
          "$f(x) = (x + 2)(x - 5)$",
          "$f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 10$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zeros at $-2$, $0$, and $5$ correspond to factors $(x - (-2)) = (x + 2)$, $(x - 0) = x$, and $(x - 5)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$(-4, 0)$",
          "$(0, -4)$",
          "$(4, 0)$",
          "$(0, 4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The roots (zeros) of a function are the $x$-coordinates where the graph crosses the $x$-axis ($y = 0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Use the Factor Theorem to determine if $(x + 2)$ is a factor of $f(x) = x^3 + 8$.",
        "options": [
          "Yes, because $f(-2) = 0$",
          "No, because $f(-2) = 16$",
          "Yes, because $f(2) = 0$",
          "No, because $f(2) = 16$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Check $f(-2)$: $(-2)^3 + 8 = -8 + 8 = 0$. Since the result is $0$, $(x + 2)$ is a factor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $(x - 1)$ and the remainder is $7$, is $(x - 1)$ a factor of $f(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "No, because the remainder must be $0$",
          "Yes, because the remainder is positive",
          "Yes, because $1$ is a root",
          "There is not enough information"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a binomial to be a factor, the remainder of the division must be exactly $0$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the zeros of the factored polynomial $f(x) = (x + 1)^2(x - 6)$.",

          "$1$ and $-6$",
          "$-1$ only",
          "$1$ and $6$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set each factor to zero: $x + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -1$; $x - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 6$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $x = k$ is a zero of multiplicity $2$ for the function $f(x)$, what does this mean for the factor $(x - k)$?",
        "options": [
          "The factor $(x - k)$ is squared in the function's equation",
          "The function has two different factors",
          "The graph passes through $(2, 0)$",
          "The remainder of $f(x) \\div (x - k)$ is $2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplicity refers to how many times a particular factor is repeated in the polynomial."

          "$1$",

          "$11$",
          "$-1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The function is $1(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$. The leading coefficient (of $x^3$) is the 'a' value provided, which is $1$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the graph of a polynomial touches the $x$-axis at $(5, 0)$ but does not cross it, what can you conclude about the root $x = 5$?",
        "options": [
          "It has an even multiplicity (like $2, 4, \\dots$)",
          "It has an odd multiplicity (like $1, 3, \\dots$)",
          "It is not a real root",
          "The factor is $(x + 5)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a graph 'bounces' off the axis, the root has an even multiplicity. If it 'crosses' the axis, it has an odd multiplicity."

        "90": "Perfect! You've connected the dots between algebraic factors and graphical behavior.",
        "70": "Good job. Remember: if the root is $k$, the factor is $(x - k)$. Watch those signs!",
        "50": "Keep practicing. The Factor Theorem is just a specialized version of the Remainder Theorem where the remainder is $0$.",
