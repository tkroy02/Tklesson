    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the geometric definition of a parabola?",
        "options": [
          "The set of points equidistant from a focus and a directrix.",
          "The set of points where the sum of distances to two foci is constant.",
          "A set of points that forms a perfect circle around a center.",
          "The set of points where the difference of distances to two foci is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A parabola is defined by its relationship to a single point (focus) and a single line (directrix)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $(x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)$, what does the value $p$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The distance from the vertex to the focus.",
          "The total width of the parabola.",
          "The slope of the tangent line.",
          "The distance between the x-intercepts."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parameter $p$ is the directed distance from the vertex to the focus. It also equals the distance from the vertex to the directrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which way does the parabola $(y - 3)^2 = -8(x + 1)$ open?",
        "options": [
          "To the left",
          "To the right",
          "Upward",
          "Downward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the $y$ term is squared, it is a horizontal parabola. Since $4p = -8$ (a negative value), it opens to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the vertex of the parabola $(x + 5)^2 = 12(y - 2)$?",
        "options": [
          "(-5, 2)",
          "(5, -2)",
          "(-5, -2)",
          "(2, -5)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertex $(h, k)$ is found by looking at the values subtracted from $x$ and $y$. Here, $h = -5$ and $k = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $p = 3$ and the vertex is at $(0, 0)$ for a parabola opening upward, where is the focus located?",
        "options": [
          "(0, 3)",
          "(3, 0)",
          "(0, -3)",
          "(-3, 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an upward-opening parabola, the focus is $p$ units above the vertex. $(0, 0 + 3) = (0, 3)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equation of the directrix for the parabola $x^2 = 4y$?",
        "options": [
          "y = -1",
          "y = 1",
          "x = -1",
          "x = 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Here $4p = 4$, so $p = 1$. Since it opens upward, the directrix is a horizontal line $p$ units below the vertex: $y = 0 - 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A parabola has a focus at $(2, 0)$ and a directrix at $x = -2$. What is its equation?",
        "options": [
          "y^2 = 8x",
          "x^2 = 8y",
          "y^2 = -8x",
          "x^2 = -8y"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertex is halfway between $(2, 0)$ and $x = -2$, which is $(0, 0)$. $p = 2$, and it opens right. $(y - 0)^2 = 4(2)(x - 0)$ simplifies to $y^2 = 8x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Latus Rectum' of a parabola is a line segment through the focus. Its total length is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "|4p|",
          "|2p|",
          "p^2",
          "|p|"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The absolute value of the coefficient $4p$ gives the width of the parabola at the focus, known as the length of the latus rectum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the equation of a parabola is $y = \\frac{1}{4}x^2$, what is its focus?",
        "options": [
          "(0, 1)",
          "(0, 4)",
          "(1, 0)",
          "(0, 0.25)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rewrite as $x^2 = 4y$. Comparing to $x^2 = 4py$, we see $4p = 4$, so $p = 1$. The focus is at $(0, 1)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which real-world application utilizes the reflective property of a parabola's focus?",
        "options": [
          "Satellite dishes and flashlights",
          "Suspension bridge cables",
          "The path of a thrown baseball",
          "All of these"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While all are related to parabolas, the reflective property (rays hitting the curve and reflecting to the focus) is specific to satellite dishes and light reflectors."
