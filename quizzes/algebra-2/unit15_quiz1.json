    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the requirement for adding two matrices together?",
        "options": [
          "They must have the same dimensions.",
          "They must both be square matrices.",
          "The number of columns in the first must match the rows in the second.",
          "They must contain only positive integers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix addition is performed element-wise, so the matrices must have identical dimensions for every element to have a corresponding partner."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since a $3 \\times 2$ matrix and a $2 \\times 3$ matrix do not have the same dimensions, they cannot be added."
      },

          "Additive Identity Property ($A + 0 = A$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix addition behaves very similarly to regular addition; it is both commutative and associative, and an additive identity (the zero matrix) exists."
