    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the $z$-score of a value $x = 85$ in a normal distribution with a mean $\\mu = 70$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma = 10$?",
        "options": ["1.5", "15", "-1.5", "0.85"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Apply the $z$-score formula: $z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. Here, $z = \\frac{85 - 70}{10} = 1.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A data point has a $z$-score of $-2.0$. If the mean of the distribution is 100 and the standard deviation is 5, what is the value of the data point?",
        "options": ["90", "110", "95", "105"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Use the formula $x = \\mu + z\\sigma$. So, $x = 100 + (-2.0)(5) = 100 - 10 = 90$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the standard normal distribution, what are the values for the mean $(\\mu)$ and standard deviation $(\\sigma)$?",
        "options": ["$\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1$", "$\\mu = 1, \\sigma = 0$", "$\\mu = 100, \\sigma = 15$", "$\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 0$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, a standard normal distribution always has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A measurement is normally distributed with $\\mu = 800$ and $\\sigma = 50$. What is the $z$-score for a value of 725?",
        "options": ["-1.5", "1.5", "-0.75", "-1.25"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$z = \\frac{725 - 800}{50} = \\frac{-75}{50} = -1.5$. The negative value indicates the measurement is below the mean."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a $z$-score is 0, what can you conclude about the original data value $x$?",
        "options": ["It is equal to the mean", "It is equal to the standard deviation", "The data value is 0", "The data set has no variance"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A $z$-score of 0 means the value is zero standard deviations away from the mean, making it exactly equal to the mean."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using a standard normal table, what is the approximate area under the curve to the left of $z = 1.0$?",
        "options": ["0.8413", "0.1587", "0.5000", "0.3413"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The area to the left of $z = 0$ is 0.5. The area between $z = 0$ and $z = 1$ is approximately 0.3413. $0.5 + 0.3413 = 0.8413$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student scores in the $97.5^{th}$ percentile on a standardized test. Which $z$-score most likely corresponds to this percentile?",
        "options": ["2.0", "1.0", "3.0", "1.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a normal distribution, 95% of data is within $\\pm 2$ standard deviations. This leaves 2.5% in the upper tail. Therefore, the area to the left of $z = 2$ is $95\\% + 2.5\\% = 97.5\\%$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the probability that a random variable $Z$ from a standard normal distribution falls between $z = -1$ and $z = 1$?",
        "options": ["0.6826", "0.9544", "0.3413", "0.5000"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Empirical Rule, approximately 68.26% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean ($z = \\pm 1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A researcher records a measurement with a $z$-score of $2.4$. In a normal distribution, is this value considered unusual?",
        "options": ["Yes, because the absolute $z$-score is greater than 2", "No, because the $z$-score is positive", "No, because 2.4 is a common value", "Yes, because all $z$-scores are unusual"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In statistics, values with a $z$-score greater than 2 or less than -2 are generally considered unusual or potential outliers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the area under the standard normal curve to the right of $z = 0$?",
        "options": ["0.5", "1.0", "0.68", "0.0"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the normal distribution is perfectly symmetric, exactly 50% (0.5) of the area lies to the right of the mean."
