      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the common difference ($d$) for the sequence: $7, 11, 15, 19, ...$?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "-4",
          "7",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$11 - 7 = 4$ and $15 - 11 = 4$. The difference is a constant $+4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$a_n = 10(n-3)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first term $a_1$ is 10 and the common difference $d$ is $-3$. Plugging into $a_1 + (n-1)d$ gives $10 + (n-1)(-3)$."

          "You want to find a term based on the previous term",

          "The sequence is decreasing"

          "No, it is a linear sequence"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$4-2=2$, but $8-4=4$. Since the difference is not constant, it is not arithmetic (it's actually geometric)."

        "answer": "A",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$4 + 6n - 6 = 6n - 2$. Arithmetic sequences always result in linear functions."

        "question": "In the explicit formula, why is it $(n - 1)$ instead of just $n$?",
        "options": [
          "Because we don't add the common difference to the first term to get the first term",
          "Because sequences start at index 0",
