        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To determine the popularity of a new \\$5 meal deal, a fast-food manager surveys the first 20 customers who enter the restaurant. Why is this sample biased?",
        "options": [
          "It is a convenience sample and not representative of all customers",
          "The sample size is too large",

          "The question is a leading question"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convenience sampling is biased because it only includes people who are easy to reach, failing to represent the entire population's diversity."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stratified sampling divides the population into groups (strata) based on a characteristic (grade level) and then samples from each group."

          "Undercoverage bias",
          "Non-response bias",
          "Response bias"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Voluntary response samples are biased because people with strong (usually negative) opinions are the most likely to participate."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would most likely reduce bias in a study?",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pollster calls 500 households, but only 50 people answer the phone and complete the survey. What type of bias is most prevalent here?",

          "Sampling error"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non-response bias occurs when a significant portion of the sampled population cannot be reached or refuses to participate."
