    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To rotate a triangle $180^{\\circ}$ about the origin, which matrix should you multiply its vertex matrix by?",
        "options": [
          "\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}",
          "\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}",
          "\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}",
          "\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A $180^{\\circ}$ rotation negates both coordinates $(x, y) \\to (-x, -y)$, which is achieved by this diagonal matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to translate a square 3 units right and 2 units down, which operation is typically used?",

          "Matrix Addition",
          "Matrix Multiplication",
          "Scalar Division",
          "Finding the Determinant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Translations are shifts in position $(x+h, y+k)$, which are performed by adding a displacement matrix to the vertex matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of multiplying a point matrix by \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}?",
        "options": [
          "The shape is shrunk to half its original size (dilation).",
          "The shape is enlarged to double its original size.",
          "The shape is rotated $50^{\\circ}$.",
          "The shape is reflected over the line $y = 0.5x$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the scalar values on the diagonal are $0.5$, both coordinates are reduced by half, resulting in a reduction dilation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vertex matrix for a rectangle has dimensions $2 \\times 4$. If you multiply it by a $2 \\times 2$ transformation matrix, what are the dimensions of the resulting matrix?",
        "options": [
          "$2 \\times 4$",
          "$4 \\times 2$",
          "$2 \\times 2$",
          "$4 \\times 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying a $(2 \\times 2)$ by a $(2 \\times 4)$ follows the dimension rule $(m \\times n) \\cdot (n \\times p) = m \\times p$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which matrix reflects a point across the line $y = x$?",
        "options": [
          "\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}",
          "\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}",
          "\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}",
          "\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reflecting across $y = x$ swaps the values of $x$ and $y$. Row 1 becomes $(0x + 1y)$ and Row 2 becomes $(1x + 0y)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the determinant of a transformation matrix is negative, what does this tell you about the shape?",
        "options": [
          "The orientation of the shape has been reversed (reflected).",
          "The shape has been enlarged.",
          "The shape has been moved to the third quadrant.",
          "The shape has vanished."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative determinant indicates that the orientation (or 'handedness') of the shape has flipped, a hallmark of reflection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you represent a translation of 5 units right and 3 units down for a triangle with 3 vertices?",
        "options": [
          "Add a $2 \\times 3$ matrix where every column is \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix}.",
          "Multiply the vertex matrix by 5 and -3.",
          "Add 5 to the first vertex and -3 to the last vertex.",
          "It cannot be done with matrices."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To shift the entire shape, you must add the same displacement vector to every vertex (column) of the shape's matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What transformation does \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} perform?",
        "options": [
          "Identity transformation (no change).",
          "Rotation by $90^{\\circ}$.",
          "Reflection across the origin.",
          "Vertical stretch by 1."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the identity matrix $I$. Multiplying by $I$ leaves the vertex matrix exactly as it was."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you multiply a shape's vertex matrix by \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, across which axis is it reflected?",
        "options": [
          "The y-axis.",
          "The x-axis.",
          "The line $y = x$.",
          "The origin."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $x$-coordinate is negated while the $y$-coordinate stays the same, which flips the point horizontally over the $y$-axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To perform a $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise rotation, you use \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}. What happens to the point $(2, 5)$?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes $(5, -2)$.",
          "It becomes $(-5, 2)$.",
          "It becomes $(2, -5)$.",
          "It becomes $(-2, 5)$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Calculation: Row 1 $(0 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 5) = 5$. Row 2 $(-1 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 5) = -2$."
