      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person saves $100 in January and increases the amount they save by $20 each month. How much do they save in December (the 12th month)?",

          "$320",
          "$340",
          "$240",
          "$300"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is an arithmetic sequence: $a_{12} = 100 + (12-1)(20) = 100 + 220 = 320$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "4 years is 48 months. $50 \\cdot 48 = 2400$. This is a simple arithmetic series sum."

          "Sequence Term",
          "Infinite Series",
          "Common Difference"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A series is the sum of terms. Since the loan eventually ends, it is a finite series."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is dropped from 20ft and bounces 75% of its height. How high is the 4th bounce?",

          "8.44 ft",
          "15 ft",
          "4.75 ft"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The bounces are $a_1=20(0.75), a_2=20(0.75)^2...$ The 4th bounce is $20(0.75)^4 = 20(0.3164) \\approx 6.33$."

          "1 + interest rate",
          "interest rate",
          "1 - interest rate",
          "1 / interest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To grow a value by a rate, you must keep the original (1) and add the growth (r)."

          "The number of seats in a stadium where each row has 2 more than the last"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Medicine decays by a percentage (ratio) and doses are added (series). The others are linear/arithmetic."
