    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the center and radius of the circle given by $(x + 3)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 36$?",
        "options": [
          "Center: (-3, 5), Radius: 6",
          "Center: (3, -5), Radius: 6",
          "Center: (-3, 5), Radius: 36",
          "Center: (3, -5), Radius: 36"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The center $(h, k)$ comes from the opposite signs inside the parentheses, and the radius is the square root of the constant on the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the circle with a center at the origin and a diameter of 10?",
        "options": [
          "x^2 + y^2 = 25",

          "(x-5)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 25"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the diameter is 10, the radius $r$ is 5. Therefore, $r^2 = 25$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To convert $x^2 + y^2 + 4x - 6y - 12 = 0$ into standard form, what is the first logical step?",
        "options": [
          "Group the x terms and y terms, and move the constant to the other side.",
          "Divide the entire equation by 2.",
          "Square the entire equation.",
          "Set x and y to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Grouping $(x^2 + 4x) + (y^2 - 6y) = 12$ prepares the equation for completing the square."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the process of completing the square for $x^2 + 10x$, what value must be added?",

          "5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You take half of the coefficient (10/2 = 5) and square it ($5^2 = 25$)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard form of $x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 2y + 8 = 0$?",

          "(x - 4)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 9",
          "(x + 4)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 9",

          "(x - 8)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Complete the square: $(x^2-8x+16) + (y^2+2y+1) = -8 + 16 + 1$. This simplifies to $(x-4)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if the 'radius squared' ($r^2$) side of a circle's equation is zero after completing the square?",
        "options": [
          "The 'circle' is actually just a single point (the center).",
          "The circle is infinitely large.",
          "The circle becomes a straight line.",
          "The graph is a parabola."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A circle with a radius of 0 is called a 'degenerate circle' and consists only of the point at $(h, k)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the radius squared ($r^2$) is negative, what does that imply about the graph?",
        "options": [
          "There is no real graph (no points satisfy the equation).",
          "The circle is in the complex plane.",
          "The circle opens inward.",
          "The graph is a hyperbola."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the sum of two squared real numbers cannot be negative, no real points $(x, y)$ exist for the circle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the center of a circle if its general equation is $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "(-D/2, -E/2)",
          "(D/2, E/2)",
          "(-D, -E)",
          "(D, E)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Completing the square always results in $h = -D/2$ and $k = -E/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the equation of a circle tangent to the x-axis with center (2, 3)?",
        "options": [
          "(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 9",
          "(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 4",
          "(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 2",
          "(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If it is tangent to the x-axis, the radius must be the distance from the center to the x-axis, which is the y-coordinate (3). $3^2 = 9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A circle is a conic section formed when a plane intersects a cone in what way?",

          "Perpendicular to the axis of the cone.",
          "Parallel to the side of the cone.",
          "At a steep angle through both halves of the cone.",
          "Parallel to the axis of the cone."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the plane is perfectly 'flat' (perpendicular to the axis), the resulting intersection is a circle."
