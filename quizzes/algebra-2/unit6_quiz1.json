    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the exponential model $y = a(b)^x$, what condition makes the function represent exponential **decay**?",
        "options": [
          "$0 < b < 1$",
          "$b > 1$",
          "$a < 0$",
          "$b = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the base $b$ is a fraction between 0 and 1, the output decreases as $x$ increases, which is the definition of decay."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population of 500 bacteria triples every hour. Which equation models the population $P$ after $t$ hours?",
        "options": [
          "$P = 500(3)^t$",
          "$P = 3(500)^t$",
          "$P = 500(1.03)^t$",
          "$P = 500t^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "500 is the initial amount ($a$), and tripling means the growth factor ($b$) is 3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a town's population decreases by 4% each year, what is the 'decay factor' ($1 - r$) used in the model?",
        "options": [
          "0.96",
          "0.04",
          "1.04",
          "-0.04"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The decay factor is $1$ minus the rate in decimal form: $1 - 0.04 = 0.96$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the initial value (y-intercept) of the function $f(x) = 12(0.85)^x$?",
        "options": [
          "12",
          "0.85",
          "10.2",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The initial value occurs when $x = 0$. Since $0.85^0 = 1$, the value is $12(1) = 12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A new car costs $30,000$ and depreciates by 15% per year. What is its value after 3 years?",
        "options": [
          "$18,423.75",
          "$13,500.00",
          "$45,626.25",
          "$25,500.00$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formula is $30,000(1 - 0.15)^3$. Calculation: $30,000(0.85)^3 = 18,423.75$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following functions represents exponential growth?",
        "options": [
          "$f(x) = 4(1.02)^x$",
          "$f(x) = 100(0.99)^x$",
          "$f(x) = 0.5(1)^x$",
          "$f(x) = 2x + 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Growth occurs when the base $b$ is greater than 1. In this case, $1.02 > 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An investment of $1,000$ grows at a rate of 7% per year. What is the growth factor?",
        "options": [
          "1.07",
          "0.07",
          "0.93",
          "7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The growth factor is $1 + r$. Here, $1 + 0.07 = 1.07$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the formula $A = P(1+r)^t$, what does the '$P$' represent?",
        "options": [
          "The principal or initial amount",
          "The percentage rate",
          "The period of time",
          "The final amount"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "P stands for Principal, which is the starting balance or initial value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of $y = 2(4)^x$ when $x = 2$?",

          "32",
          "16",
          "64",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plug in $x=2$: $y = 2(4^2) = 2(16) = 32$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an exponential function passes through $(0, 5)$ and $(1, 15)$, what is the growth factor $b$?",

          "5",
          "10",
          "15"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The y-intercept ($a$) is 5. Using $(1, 15)$: $15 = 5(b)^1$. Dividing by 5 gives $b = 3$."
