    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation represents inverse variation between $x$ and $y$?",
        "options": [
          "$y = \\frac{k}{x}$",
          "$y = kx$",
          "$y = k + x$",
          "$xy = k + 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In inverse variation, the product of the two variables is constant, or $y$ is equal to $k$ divided by $x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $y$ varies directly as $x$, and $y = 12$ when $x = 3$, what is the constant of variation $k$?",

          "0.25",
          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $y = kx$, substitute the values: $12 = k(3)$. Dividing by 3 gives $k = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The variable $z$ varies jointly with $x$ and $y$. Which equation models this relationship?",
        "options": [
          "$z = kxy$",
          "$z = \\frac{kx}{y}$",
          "$z = k(x + y)$",
          "$z = \\frac{k}{xy}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Joint variation involves a product of two or more variables and a constant."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $y$ varies inversely as $x$, and $y = 10$ when $x = 2$, find $y$ when $x = 5$.",

          "25",
          "20",
          "50"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find $k$: $10 = k/2 \\Rightarrow k = 20$. Then use $k$ to find $y$: $y = 20/5 = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that force ($F$) varies jointly as the masses ($m_1, m_2$) and inversely as the square of the distance ($r^2$). This is an example of:",

          "Combined Variation",
          "Direct Variation",
          "Inverse Variation",
          "Simple Variation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combined variation involves both direct (or joint) and inverse relationships within the same formula."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $w$ varies inversely as the square of $t$, and $w = 3$ when $t = 2$, what is $k$?",

          "6",
          "1.5",
          "36"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$w = k/t^2 \\Rightarrow 3 = k/2^2 \\Rightarrow 3 = k/4 \\Rightarrow k = 12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the direct variation equation $y = kx$, if $x$ is doubled, what happens to $y$?",

          "It doubles",
          "It is halved",
          "It stays the same",
          "It quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since they are directly proportional, any factor applied to $x$ is also applied to $y$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the inverse variation equation $y = k/x$, if $x$ is tripled, what happens to $y$?",

          "It triples",
          "It is divided by 9",
          "It stays the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In inverse variation, $y$ changes by the reciprocal of the factor applied to $x$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Write the equation for: $A$ varies jointly as $b$ and $h$ and inversely as $g$.",

          "$A = k(b + h) / g$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Joint factors ($b$ and $h$) go in the numerator with $k$, and the inverse factor ($g$) goes in the denominator."

          "Be a horizontal line",
          "Be a curve",
          "Have a negative slope"
        ],
