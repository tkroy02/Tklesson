    "topic": "Introduction to optimizing a linear objective function",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Objective Function' in linear programming?",
        "options": [
          "To define the value that needs to be maximized or minimized.",
          "To provide the boundaries for the feasible region.",
          "To determine if a line should be solid or dashed.",
          "To eliminate variables through substitution."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The objective function represents the goal of the problem, such as calculating total profit or total cost based on the variables $x$ and $y$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Vertex Principle, where is the optimal solution of a linear programming problem located?",
        "options": [
          "At one of the vertices of the feasible region.",
          "At the origin $(0, 0)$ always.",
          "Directly in the center of the shaded region.",
          "On the y-intercept of the objective function."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a maximum or minimum value exists for a linear programming problem, it must occur at a corner point (vertex) of the feasible region."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the objective function $P = 5x + 2y$, which vertex provides the maximum profit: $A(0, 5)$, $B(3, 4)$, or $C(6, 0)$?",
        "options": [
          "Vertex $C(6, 0)$",
          "Vertex $B(3, 4)$",
          "Vertex $A(0, 5)$",
          "All provide the same profit."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Calculating $P$ at each point: $A: 5(0)+2(5)=10$; $B: 5(3)+2(4)=23$; $C: 5(6)+2(0)=30$. Vertex $C$ gives the highest value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In linear programming, what are the inequalities that limit the possible values of the variables called?",
        "options": [
          "Constraints",
          "Vertices",
          "Ratios",
          "Boundary Functionals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constraints are the system of inequalities that define the limits of the feasible region, such as labor hours or material availability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the feasible region is 'unbounded' (extends infinitely in one direction), what is true about the objective function?",
        "options": [
          "It may not have a maximum value.",
          "It cannot have a minimum value.",
          "It has no vertices.",
          "The objective function must be nonlinear."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an unbounded region (like $x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0$), a maximization function might increase infinitely, meaning no maximum value exists."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common 'non-negativity' constraint in real-world linear programming?",
        "options": [
          "$x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$",
          "$x + y \\le 100$",
          "$y = mx + b$",
          "$x < y$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In real-world applications (like manufacturing), you cannot produce a negative number of items, so $x$ and $y$ are restricted to the first quadrant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the coordinates of a vertex where two boundary lines intersect, which method should you use?",

          "Solving a system of linear equations.",
          "The Quadratic Formula.",
          "The Distance Formula.",
          "Calculating the slope of the objective function."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertex is the intersection point of two lines. You find it by solving the two boundary equations as a system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Minimize $C = 3x + y$ given the vertices $(0, 8), (2, 3),$ and $(5, 0)$.",
        "options": [
          "The minimum is 8 at $(0, 8)$ and $(2, 3)$.",
          "The minimum is 9 at $(2, 3)$.",
          "The minimum is 15 at $(5, 0)$.",
          "The minimum is 8 at $(0, 8)$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$C(0, 8) = 3(0)+8=8$. $C(2, 3) = 3(2)+3=9$. $C(5, 0) = 3(5)+0=15$. The minimum is 8."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two adjacent vertices of a feasible region both yield the same maximum value for the objective function, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "All points on the line segment between those two vertices are also maximums.",
          "The problem has no solution.",
          "There is only one solution at the midpoint.",
          "The feasible region must be a circle."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is known as having multiple optimal solutions. If the objective function line is parallel to a boundary line, the entire edge provides the maximum value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in the graphical method of linear programming?",
        "options": [
          "Graph the constraints to find the feasible region.",
          "Plug the origin into the objective function.",
          "Differentiate the objective function.",
          "Pick an arbitrary maximum value."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must first establish the search area (the feasible region) by graphing the constraints before you can test the vertices."
