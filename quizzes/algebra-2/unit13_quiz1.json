    "subtitle": "13.1: Systems of Linear Equations in Three Variables",
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Solving 3x3 systems using elimination or substitution",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving a $3 \\times 3$ system, what is the primary goal of the first step?",
        "options": [
          "Eliminate the same variable from two different pairs of equations.",
          "Solve one equation for all three variables simultaneously.",
          "Multiply all three equations together.",
          "Substitute a 3D coordinate into a 2D equation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To solve a $3 \\times 3$ system, you must first reduce it to a $2 \\times 2$ system by eliminating one specific variable across two pairs of equations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system of three equations in three variables has no solution, how is this represented geometrically?",
        "options": [
          "The three planes do not all intersect at a single common point.",
          "The three planes intersect to form a single line.",
          "All three planes are identical.",
          "The planes are perpendicular to the x-axis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a solution to exist, there must be a point common to all three planes. If they are parallel or intersect in a way that no single point is shared by all three, there is no solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system: $x + y + z = 6$, $2x - y + z = 3$, $x + 2y - z = 2$. What is the value of $x$?",
        "options": [
          "1",
          "2",
          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding eq1 and eq3 gives $2x + 3y = 8$. Subtracting eq2 from eq1 gives $-x + 2y = 3$. Solving the $2 \\times 2$ system yields $x = 1, y = 2, z = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of a dependent system (infinitely many solutions) when using elimination?",
        "options": [
          "A true statement like $0 = 0$.",
          "A false statement like $0 = 5$.",
          "A single numerical value for $z$ only.",
          "The variables $x$ and $y$ become equal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the equations are multiples of each other or represent the same plane/line of intersection, the variables will drop out to leave a true identity like $0 = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the system: $3x + 2y - z = 10$, $x - y + z = 4$, $2x + y + 2z = 10$. Which variable is easiest to eliminate first?",
        "options": [
          "$z$",
          "$x$",
          "$y$",
          "None, they are all equally difficult."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The variable $z$ has coefficients of $-1, 1,$ and $2$, making it easy to eliminate by adding the first two equations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system: $x + y = 5$, $y + z = 7$, $x + z = 6$. What is the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$?",
        "options": [
          "$(2, 3, 4)$",
          "$(1, 4, 3)$",
          "$(3, 2, 5)$",
          "$(4, 1, 6)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By substitution or adding all three equations together ($2x + 2y + 2z = 18 \\implies x + y + z = 9$), we can easily find $x=2, y=3, z=4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method is generally preferred for a $3 \\times 3$ system when one equation is already missing a variable?",
        "options": [
          "Substitution",
          "Elimination",
          "Graphing",
          "Cramer's Rule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If one equation only has two variables (e.g., $x + y = 5$), you can easily solve for one variable and substitute it into the other two equations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If after eliminating $z$, you get $x + y = 4$ and $2x + 2y = 10$, how many solutions does the system have?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "Infinite",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The second equation simplifies to $x + y = 5$. Since $x + y$ cannot be both 4 and 5, the system is inconsistent and has no solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a solution of $(0, 0, 0)$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The system is consistent and independent, intersecting at the origin.",
          "The system is inconsistent.",
          "The system has infinitely many solutions.",
          "The planes are all parallel to the origin."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(0, 0, 0)$ is a valid single point in space. It means the three planes intersect exactly at the origin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a linear equation in three variables?",
        "options": [
          "$x + 2y - 5z = 10$",
          "$xy + z = 5$",
          "$x^2 + y + z = 3$",
          "$x + 1/y + z = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A linear equation must have variables only to the first power and no products of variables ($xy$)."
