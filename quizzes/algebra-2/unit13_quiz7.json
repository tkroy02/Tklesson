    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in solving the equation $2|x - 3| + 5 = 11$?",
        "options": [
          "Subtract 5 from both sides, then divide by 2.",
          "Distribute the 2 into the absolute value bars.",
          "Split the equation into $x - 3 = 11$ and $x - 3 = -11$.",
          "Subtract 2 from both sides."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must isolate the absolute value expression entirely before you can split it into two separate cases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $|2x + 5| = 13$.",
        "options": [
          "$4, -9$",
          "$4, 9$",
          "$-4, 9$",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Case 1: $2x + 5 = 13 \\implies 2x = 8 \\implies x = 4$. Case 2: $2x + 5 = -13 \\implies 2x = -18 \\implies x = -9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many solutions does the equation $|x + 4| = -2$ have?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "2",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute value represents distance, which cannot be negative. Therefore, an absolute value expression can never equal $-2$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $|x - 7| = 0$.",

          "0",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When an absolute value equals zero, there is only one case to solve: $x - 7 = 0$, leading to $x = 7$."

          "1",
          "-1",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Case 1: $3x - 1 = 2x + 6 \\implies x = 7$. Case 2: $3x - 1 = -(2x + 6) \\implies 5x = -5 \\implies x = -1$. Both satisfy the original equation."

          "The y-intercept."

          "$0, -4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide by 3 to get $|x + 2| = 4$. Case 1: $x + 2 = 4 \\implies x = 2$. Case 2: $x + 2 = -4 \\implies x = -6$."
      },

          "$15, -5$",
          "$5, -5$",
          "15"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Case 1: $2x - 10 = x + 5 \\implies x = 15$. Case 2: $2x - 10 = -(x + 5) \\implies 3x = 5 \\implies x = 5/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When checking for extraneous solutions in $|x + 5| = 2x - 1$, why might a value be rejected?",
        "options": [
          "It makes the non-absolute side of the equation negative.",
          "It is a fraction.",
          "It is larger than 10.",
          "It is a negative number."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An absolute value cannot equal a negative number. If a solved $x$ results in $2x - 1$ being negative, that solution is extraneous."

          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolate: $-|x - 1| = -2 \\implies |x - 1| = 2$. Cases: $x - 1 = 2 \\implies x = 3$; $x - 1 = -2 \\implies x = -1$."
