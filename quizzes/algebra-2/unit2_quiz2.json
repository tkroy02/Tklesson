      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To convert $y = x^2 + 12x + 5$ into vertex form, what constant must be added and subtracted to complete the square for the $x$ terms?",
        "options": [
          "$36$",
          "$144$",
          "$6$",
          "$12$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "$y = (x - 5)^2 + 5$",

          "$y = (x - 10)^2 + 5$"

        "explanation": "$h = -(x^2 - 10x)$. Half of $-10$ is $-5$, squared is $25$. Inside: $-(x^2 - 10x + 25)$. This subtracts $25$, so we add $25$ outside."
