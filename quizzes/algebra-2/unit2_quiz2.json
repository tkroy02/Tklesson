        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Take half of -6 (-3) and square it (9). $y = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 11 - 9 \\Rightarrow y = (x - 3)^2 + 2$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x^2 + 8x = -12 \\Rightarrow x^2 + 8x + 16 = -12 + 16 \\Rightarrow (x+4)^2 = 4$. So $x+4 = \\pm 2$. $x = -2$ or $x = -6$."
