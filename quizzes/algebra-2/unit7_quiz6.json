      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 is how many times more intense in wave amplitude than an earthquake of magnitude 5.0?",
        "options": [
          "100",
          "2",
          "20",
          "1,000"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Richter scale is base 10. A difference of 2 ($7 - 5 = 2$) means the intensity difference is $10^2 = 100$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The pH of a liquid is defined by $pH = -\\log[H^+]$. If a solution has a hydrogen ion concentration of $10^{-4}$, what is its pH?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "-4",
          "10",
          "14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$pH = -\\log(10^{-4})$. Using log properties, this simplifies to $-(-4) = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the intensity of a sound doubles, how does its decibel level change? (Given $L = 10 \\cdot \\log(I/I_0)$)",
        "options": [
          "It increases by approximately 3 decibels",
          "It doubles in decibels",
          "It increases by 10 decibels",
          "It stays the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$10 \\cdot \\log(2) \\approx 10 \\cdot 0.301 = 3.01$. So, doubling intensity adds about 3 dB."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following pH values represents the most acidic solution?",
        "options": [
          "pH 2",
          "pH 7",
          "pH 10",
          "pH 13"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lower pH values represent higher concentrations of hydrogen ions, making the solution more acidic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On the Richter scale, what does a magnitude increase of 1 represent in terms of energy release? (Note: Energy release is approximately $32$ times per magnitude step).",
        "options": [
          "About 32 times more energy",
          "Exactly 10 times more energy",
          "Double the energy",
          "100 times more energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While wave amplitude increases by 10x per step, the energy released increases by a factor of about 32 per whole number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance has a pH of 8. Is this substance acidic, basic, or neutral?",
        "options": [
          "Basic",
          "Acidic",
          "Neutral",
          "Exponential"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A pH of 7 is neutral. Values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic (alkaline)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a sound is 100 times more intense than the threshold of hearing ($I_0$), what is its decibel level?",
        "options": [
          "20 dB",
          "100 dB",
          "10 dB",
          "2 dB"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$L = 10 \\cdot \\log(100/1) = 10 \\cdot 2 = 20$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the hydrogen ion concentration $[H^+]$ of a solution with a pH of 3?",
        "options": [
          "$10^{-3}$",
          "$3$",
          "$0.3$",
          "$10^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $3 = -\\log[H^+]$, then $-3 = \\log[H^+]$. Converting to exponential form: $10^{-3} = [H^+]$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Logarithmic scales are primarily used when the range of data is:",
        "options": [
          "Very large (covers many orders of magnitude)",
          "Very small (all values are between 0 and 1)",
          "Strictly linear",
          "Always negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Logs compress large ranges into smaller, manageable scales (like 1 to 10)."

          "3",
          "30",
          "10,000"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
