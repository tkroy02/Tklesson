    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of compound inequality is used to solve $|x| < 5$?",
        "options": [
          "An 'AND' statement: $-5 < x < 5$",
          "An 'OR' statement: $x < -5$ or $x > 5$",
          "A single inequality: $x < 5$",
          "No solution is possible"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 'less than' absolute value inequality represents values whose distance from zero is small, creating a 'sandwich' or 'AND' interval."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of compound inequality is used to solve $|x| > 5$?",
        "options": [
          "An 'OR' statement: $x < -5$ or $x > 5$",
          "An 'AND' statement: $-5 < x < 5$",
          "A single inequality: $x > 5$",
          "The set of all real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 'greater than' absolute value inequality represents values far from zero in either the positive or negative direction, requiring an 'OR' statement."
      },

          "$-2 \\le x \\le 5$",
          "$x \\le 5$",
          "$x \\ge -2$ or $x \\le 5$",
          "$x \\le -2$ or $x \\ge 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$-7 \\le 2x - 3 \\le 7$. Adding 3 gives $-4 \\le 2x \\le 10$. Dividing by 2 gives $-2 \\le x \\le 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $|x + 4| > 2$.",

          "$x > -2$ or $x < -6$",
          "$-6 < x < -2$",
          "$x > 2$ or $x < -2$",
          "$x < 6$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Case 1: $x + 4 > 2 \\implies x > -2$. Case 2: $x + 4 < -2 \\implies x < -6$. This is an 'OR' statement."

          "All real numbers",
          "$3 < x < 7$",
          "$x < 3$ or $x > 7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute value represents distance, which is always 0 or positive. Distance can never be less than a negative number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the solution to $|x + 2| \\ge 0$?",

          "No solution",
          "$x \\ge -2$",
          "$x = -2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since absolute value always produces a non-negative result, the distance will always be greater than or equal to 0 for any real number $x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$x \\le 3$",
          "$x \\ge 3$ or $x \\le -1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolate: $3|x - 1| \\le 6 \\implies |x - 1| \\le 2$. Thus $-2 \\le x - 1 \\le 2$. Adding 1 gives $-1 \\le x \\le 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the solution to $|x + 3| \\ge 4$ represented on a number line?",
        "options": [
          "Two rays pointing in opposite directions starting from $-7$ and $1$.",
          "A solid line segment connecting $-7$ and $1$.",
          "A single point at $1$.",
          "A dashed line segment between $-4$ and $4$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x + 3 \\ge 4 \\implies x \\ge 1$. $x + 3 \\le -4 \\implies x \\le -7$. This creates two separate rays on the number line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $|4 - x| < 3$.",

          "$x < 1$ or $x > 7$",
          "$-1 < x < 7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$-3 < 4 - x < 3$. Subtract 4: $-7 < -x < -1$. Multiply by $-1$ (and flip signs): $7 > x > 1$ or $1 < x < 7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the inequality $|ax + b| > c$ (where $c > 0$), what happens to the solution set if $a$ is negative?",
        "options": [
          "The inequality signs flip when you divide by $a$.",
          "The solution becomes 'No Solution'.",
          "The solution becomes 'All Real Numbers'.",
          "The absolute value becomes negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like linear inequalities, dividing or multiplying by a negative number during the solving process requires reversing the inequality symbols."
