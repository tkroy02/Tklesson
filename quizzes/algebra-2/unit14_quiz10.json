      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If matrix $S$ represents stock in January and matrix $F$ represents stock in February, which operation shows the change in inventory?",
        "options": [
          "$F - S$",
          "$F + S$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To find the new price after a 10% discount, you multiply every element by $0.90$ (which is $100\\% - 10\\%$)."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix addition combines corresponding elements, totaling the resources needed across both sets of data."
      },

        "question": "Why is matrix multiplication used in 'Leontief Input-Output' models in economics?",
        "options": [
          "To show how different industries depend on each other for supplies.",
          "To calculate the interest rate of a single bank account.",
          "To find the square root of the national debt.",
          "To predict the outcome of a flip of a coin."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These models use matrices to track how the output of one industry (like steel) becomes the input for another (like car manufacturing)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2 \\times 3$ matrix represents nutritional info (Calories, Fat, Protein) for 2 types of meals. What does the element $a_{21}$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "Calories in the second type of meal.",
          "Fat in the first type of meal.",
          "Protein in the second type of meal.",
          "Calories in the first type of meal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Index $a_{21}$ refers to the second row (Meal 2) and the first column (Calories)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A clothing brand wants to triple its production at all 5 of its factories. If $M$ is the current production matrix, what is the new matrix?",

          "$M/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Scaling production is a scalar multiplication operation where every element is multiplied by 3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which matrix operation would be best for calculating the total weight of an order containing different quantities of 5 different products?",

          "Scalar multiplication by the number of products."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplication yields the sum of products, which is exactly what is needed to find the total weight."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a network matrix representing flights between 4 cities, what does a '0' at position $a_{13}$ likely mean?",
        "options": [
          "There is no direct flight from City 1 to City 3.",
          "City 1 and City 3 are the same city.",
          "The flight from City 1 to City 3 is free.",
          "The plane is empty."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In adjacency matrices, a 0 typically represents the absence of a connection or path between two points."
