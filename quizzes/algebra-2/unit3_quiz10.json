        "options": [
          "$3, \\pm 2i$",
          "$3, \\pm 2$",
          "$-3, \\pm 2i$",
          "$3, 4, -12$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factoring by grouping: $x^2(x - 3) + 4(x - 3) = 0 \\Rightarrow (x^2 + 4)(x - 3) = 0$. The roots are $3$ and $\\pm 2i$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To solve $x^3 - x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0$, you find that $x = -1$ is a root. What is the resulting quadratic after synthetic division?",
        "options": [
          "$x^2 - 2x - 3$",
          "$x^2 + 2x + 3$",
          "$x^2 - 5x - 3$",
          "$x^2 - x - 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using synthetic division with $-1$ on coefficients $(1, -1, -5, -3)$ yields $(1, -2, -3)$ with a remainder of $0$."

        "question": "What are all the roots of $x^3 - x^2 - 5x - 3 = 0$ based on the previous quadratic result $(x^2 - 2x - 3)$?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The quadratic factors into $(x - 3)(x + 1)$. Combined with the original root $x = -1$, the roots are $3$ and $-1$ with multiplicity 2."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The critical points are $-4, 1, 2$. Testing intervals: $x=0$ (between $-4$ and $1$) gives $(-2)(4)(-1) = 8$, which is $>0$. Testing $x=1.5$ gives $(-)(+)(+) = -$. Testing $x=3$ gives $(+)(+)(+) = +$. Intervals are $(-4, 1) \\cup (2, \\infty)$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor as a difference of squares: $(x^2 - 4)(x^2 + 4) = 0$. This further factors into $(x-2)(x+2)$ and gives imaginary roots $\\pm 2i$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Critical points are $0$ (multiplicity 2) and $5$. Test $x=6 (+)$, $x=1 (-)$, $x=-1 (-)$. Since $x^2$ is always $\\ge 0$, the sign only changes at $x=5$. The function is $\\le 0$ for all $x \\le 5$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An inequality $P(x) < 0$ asks where the y-values are negative, which corresponds to the graph being below the x-axis."
