    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When graphing the system $y > 2x + 1$ and $y \\le -x + 4$, which description of the boundary lines is correct?",
        "options": [
          "The first line is dashed, and the second line is solid.",
          "Both lines are dashed.",
          "Both lines are solid.",
          "The first line is solid, and the second line is dashed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strict inequalities ($>$) use dashed lines because points on the line are not solutions. Inclusive inequalities ($\\le$) use solid lines."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'feasible region' in a system of linear inequalities?",
        "options": [
          "The overlapping area where all inequalities in the system are true simultaneously.",
          "The point where the boundary lines intersect.",
          "The area outside of the graphed lines.",
          "The set of points that satisfy only the first inequality."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The feasible region represents the intersection of all half-planes defined by the inequalities in the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the test point $(0, 0)$, determine which side to shade for the inequality $3x - 4y \\le 12$.",
        "options": [
          "The side containing the origin $(0, 0)$.",
          "The side not containing the origin.",
          "Neither side; the line must be dashed.",
          "Only the x-axis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$3(0) - 4(0) = 0$. Since $0 \\le 12$ is a true statement, the region containing the origin is part of the solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system of inequalities includes $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, in which quadrant will the feasible region be located?",
        "options": [
          "Quadrant I",
          "Quadrant II",
          "Quadrant III",
          "Quadrant IV"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x \\ge 0$ (right of the y-axis) and $y \\ge 0$ (above the x-axis) restricts the solution to the upper-right section of the coordinate plane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is the point $(2, 2)$ a solution to the system: $y < x + 1$ and $y > -x + 2$?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, it satisfies both inequalities.",
          "No, it only satisfies the first one.",
          "No, it only satisfies the second one.",
          "No, it satisfies neither."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the first: $2 < 2 + 1$ ($2 < 3$) is true. For the second: $2 > -2 + 2$ ($2 > 0$) is true."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the inequality sign when you solve $2x - 3y < 6$ for $y$?",
        "options": [
          "The sign flips to 'greater than' ($>$) because you divide by $-3$.",
          "The sign stays 'less than' ($<$) because the constant is positive.",
          "The sign changes to 'less than or equal to' ($\\le$).",
          "The sign disappears."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing or multiplying an inequality by a negative number requires reversing the direction of the inequality symbol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system of inequalities has boundary lines that are parallel. If the shaded regions face away from each other, how many solutions exist?",
        "options": [
          "No solution",
          "One solution",
          "Infinite solutions",
          "Two solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the shaded half-planes never overlap, there are no coordinates that satisfy both inequalities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a graph of $y \\ge |x|$, what shape does the feasible region take?",
        "options": [
          "The region inside or 'above' a V-shape.",
          "A straight line shading downwards.",
          "A circular region around the origin.",
          "A square in the first quadrant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The boundary is the V-shaped absolute value function, and $y \\ge$ indicates shading the area above the vertex."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When is a corner point (vertex) included as a solution in a system of inequalities?",
        "options": [
          "Only if all boundary lines meeting at that corner are solid.",
          "If at least one boundary line meeting there is solid.",
          "Always, regardless of the line type.",
          "Never; solutions are only in the shaded area."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A corner point is only a solution if it satisfies every inequality. If one line is dashed, the points on that line are excluded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for the overlapping region: $x < 3$ and $x > 5$.",
        "options": [
          "No solution",
          "All numbers between 3 and 5",
          "$x = 4$",
          "All real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A number cannot be simultaneously less than 3 and greater than 5; the intersection is an empty set."
