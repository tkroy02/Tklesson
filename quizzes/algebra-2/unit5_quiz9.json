    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What must be true for $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to be verified as inverse functions?",
        "options": [
          "$f(g(x)) = x$ and $g(f(x)) = x$",
          "$f(x) \\cdot g(x) = 1$",
          "$f(x) + g(x) = 0$",
          "$f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inverses must satisfy the composition identity $f(g(x)) = x$ and $g(f(x)) = x$."

          "$x - 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$f(g(x)) = 3(\frac{x + 4}{3}) - 4 = (x + 4) - 4 = x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(g(x)) = x$, is that enough to prove $f$ and $g$ are inverses?",
        "options": [
          "No, you must also show that $g(f(x)) = x$",
          "Yes, one direction is sufficient",
          "No, you must also show they have the same slope",
          "No, you must show $f(x) = g(x)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To formally verify inverses, the identity must hold for both $f \circ g$ and $g \circ f$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Verify if $f(x) = x^3 + 1$ and $g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x - 1}$ are inverses by finding $g(f(x))$.",

          "The functions are NOT inverses",
          "The functions are inverses",
          "The functions are opposites",
          "The functions are perpendicular"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The composition must result in exactly $x$. Any other result, even $-x$, means they are not inverses."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$f(f(x)) = \frac{1}{1/x} = x$. This means $f(x) = 1/x$ is its own inverse."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Verify $f(x) = 2x + 10$ and $g(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 5$. What is $f(g(x))$?",

          "$x - 5$",
          "$x + 5$",
          "$2x - 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$f(g(x)) = 2(\frac{1}{2}x - 5) + 10 = (x - 10) + 10 = x$."
      },

        "question": "Given $f(x) = \sqrt{x-2}$. If $g(x) = x^2 + 2$, for what domain is $g(f(x)) = x$?",

          "$x \ge 2$",
          "All real numbers",
          "$x \ge 0$",
          "$x \le 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $f(x) = \sqrt{x-2}$, the domain is restricted to $x \ge 2$. Composition only works where the inner function is defined."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$f(x)$",
          "$g(x)$",

          "The one with the higher degree"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In composition, you work from the inside out. $f(x)$ is the inner function and is applied first."
