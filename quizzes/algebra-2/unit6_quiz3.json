    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the horizontal asymptote of the parent function $f(x) = 2^x$?",
        "options": [
          "y = 0",
          "x = 0",
          "y = 1",
          "None"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The graph approaches the x-axis but never touches it, meaning the horizontal asymptote is y = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the transformation $f(x) = 3^x + 5$ affect the horizontal asymptote?",
        "options": [
          "It moves to y = 5",
          "It moves to y = -5",
          "It stays at y = 0",
          "It moves to x = 5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertical shift $k$ moves the horizontal asymptote to the line y = k."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the domain of any basic exponential function $f(x) = b^x$?",
        "options": [
          "All real numbers",
          "x > 0",
          "x >= 0",
          "y > 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You can plug any real number into an exponent, so the domain is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which function represents $f(x) = e^x$ shifted 3 units to the left?",
        "options": [
          "f(x) = e^(x + 3)",
          "f(x) = e^(x - 3)",
          "f(x) = e^x + 3",
          "f(x) = 3e^x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal shifts occur in the exponent; adding 3 shifts the graph left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the range of $f(x) = 2^x - 3$?",

          "y > -3",
          "y > 0",
          "All real numbers",
          "y < -3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The graph is shifted down 3 units, so all y-values must be greater than the new asymptote at y = -3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following points is the y-intercept of $f(x) = 5(2)^x$?",
        "options": [
          "(0, 5)",
          "(0, 1)",
          "(0, 2)",
          "(0, 10)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When x = 0, $f(0) = 5(2^0) = 5(1) = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the graph of $y = b^x$ if $b$ is between 0 and 1?",
        "options": [
          "The graph falls from left to right",
          "The graph rises from left to right",
          "The graph becomes a straight line",
          "The graph reflects over the y-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $0 < b < 1$, the function represents exponential decay, which decreases as x increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A negative sign in front of the function, as in $f(x) = -2^x$, reflects the graph over which axis?",
        "options": [
          "x-axis",
          "y-axis",
          "Line y = x",
          "Origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Negating the entire output reflects the graph vertically across the x-axis."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the horizontal asymptote of $f(x) = 4(0.5)^{x-2} + 1$?",

          "y = 0.5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The '+1' at the end of the function dictates the horizontal asymptote."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the function $f(x) = a \\cdot b^x$, if $a > 1$, it causes a:",

          "Horizontal shift",
          "Vertical shift"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A coefficient greater than 1 multiplies the y-values, stretching the graph away from the x-axis."
