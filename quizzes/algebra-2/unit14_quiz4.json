        "question": "Given the system $2x + 3y = 5$ and $x - 2y = 4$, what is the coefficient matrix $A$?",
        "options": [
          "\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficient matrix $A$ is formed by taking the coefficients of the variables $x$ and $y$ in order from each equation."

        "question": "In the matrix equation $AX = B$, what does the matrix $X$ usually represent?",

          "1",
          "-1",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel lines mean the system has no solution (or is dependent). In either case, the coefficient matrix will be singular, meaning its determinant is 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When setting up $AX = B$, how should the equations be organized?",
        "options": [
          "Variables must be in the same order in every equation, with constants on the right.",
          "Constants must be on the left with the variables.",
          "The equations can be in any order or format.",
          "Only one variable can be on the left side."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard form ($ax + by = c$) is required to ensure the coefficients align correctly within the matrix $A$."

        "question": "If $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix}$, what is the solution for $X$?",

          "\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "It allows for solving systems with hundreds of variables efficiently using algorithms.",
          "It is the only way to solve nonlinear equations.",
