      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of a polynomial with integer coefficients must be in the form $\\frac{p}{q}$. What does $p$ represent?",

          "A factor of the constant term",
          "A factor of the leading coefficient",
          "The leading coefficient itself",
          "The degree of the polynomial"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the ratio $\\frac{p}{q}$, $p$ must be a factor of the constant term (the term without a variable)."
      },

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$1/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factors of $4$ ($p$) are $\\pm 1, 2, 4$. Factors of $3$ ($q$) are $\\pm 1, 3$. The ratio $4/3$ is a possible candidate."

          "They must be fractions",
          "They must be imaginary",
          "There are no rational roots"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $q=1$, then $\\frac{p}{q}$ simplifies to $p$. Since $p$ is an integer factor of the constant term, the roots must be integers."

          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. The theorem only provides a list of *possible* rational roots. A polynomial might have only irrational or imaginary roots."

        "question": "After listing the possible rational roots, how do you verify which ones are actually zeros of the function?",

          "Check the end behavior"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You test each candidate. If $f(k) = 0$ or the remainder of synthetic division is $0$, then $k$ is an actual root."

          "The degree is 3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For $3$ to be a candidate, it must be a factor of the constant term ($10$) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient ($5$). $3$ does not divide $10$ evenly."
