        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Logarithmic functions are undefined for $x \\le 0$ (in parent form), creating a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$."

          "Square Root"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Notice the $x$ values are powers of 10 while the $y$ values are the exponents ($10^0, 10^1, 10^2$). This is $\\log_{10}(x)$."
