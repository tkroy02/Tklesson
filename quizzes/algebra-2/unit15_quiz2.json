      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the constant sum definition of an ellipse?",
        "options": [
          "The sum of the distances from any point on the curve to the two foci is constant.",
          "The difference of the distances from any point to the foci is constant.",
          "The distance from any point to a single focus is constant.",
          "The product of the distances to the foci is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, for any point $(x, y)$ on an ellipse, $d_1 + d_2 = 2a$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the standard form of an ellipse, which variable represents the distance from the center to the vertices of the major axis?",
        "options": [
          "a",
          "b",
          "c",
          "h"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The variable $a$ is the semi-major axis length, always the largest of the three values ($a > b$ and $a > c$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the center of the ellipse $\\frac{(x - 4)^2}{25} + \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{9} = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "(4, -2)",
          "(-4, 2)",
          "(25, 9)",
          "(5, 3)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The center $(h, k)$ is derived from the values subtracted from $x$ and $y$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the equation $\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{100} = 1$, which direction is the major axis?",
        "options": [
          "Vertical (along the y-axis)",
          "Horizontal (along the x-axis)",
          "Diagonal",
          "The ellipse is actually a circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The larger denominator (100) is under the $y^2$ term, meaning the ellipse is taller than it is wide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the equation $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, find the distance to the foci for an ellipse where $a=5$ and $b=3$.",

          "4",
          "2",
          "16",
          "5.8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$c^2 = 25 - 9 = 16$. Taking the square root gives $c = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the total length of the major axis for the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{49} + \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "14",
          "7",
          "12",
          "49"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a^2 = 49$, so $a = 7$. The full length of the major axis is $2a$, which is 14."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an ellipse has vertices at $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ and foci at $(0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$, what is $b^2$?",

          "36",
          "64",
          "100",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a = 10$ and $c = 8$. Using $b^2 = a^2 - c^2$, we get $b^2 = 100 - 64 = 36$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the shape of an ellipse as the foci move closer to the center ($c$ approaches 0)?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes more circular.",
          "It becomes more elongated (flatter).",
          "It turns into a parabola.",
          "It disappears."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the foci meet at the center, $a = b$, and the equation becomes that of a circle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'eccentricity' ($e = c/a$) of an ellipse measures what?",
        "options": [
          "How 'un-circular' or stretched the ellipse is.",
          "The area of the ellipse.",
          "The distance between the directrices.",
          "The slope of the major axis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Eccentricity values range from 0 to 1. Values closer to 0 are nearly circular; values closer to 1 are very elongated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the co-vertices of $\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{4} = 1$.",
        "options": [
          "(0, 2) and (0, -2)",
          "(4, 0) and (-4, 0)",
          "(0, 4) and (0, -4)",
          "(2, 0) and (-2, 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The smaller denominator is 4, so $b^2 = 4$ and $b = 2$. Since 4 is under $y^2$, the co-vertices are on the y-axis at $(0, \\pm 2)$."
