    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the notation $P(B|A)$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The probability of B occurring given that A has occurred",
          "The probability of A and B both occurring",
          "The probability of A occurring given that B has occurred",
          "The probability of B divided by the probability of A"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertical bar | is read as 'given'. The event following the bar is the condition that has already happened."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you roll a standard die and are told the result is an even number, what is the probability that you rolled a 6?",
        "options": [
          "1/3",
          "1/6",
          "1/2",
          "2/3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'given' set is even numbers: {2, 4, 6}. There are 3 outcomes. Only one of those is a 6. So, $1/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given $P(A \\cap B) = 0.2$ and $P(B) = 0.5$, calculate $P(A|B)$.",
        "options": [
          "0.4",
          "0.7",
          "0.1",
          "2.5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P(A|B) = P(A \\cap B) / P(B) = 0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A card is drawn from a 52-card deck. Given the card is a Spade, what is the probability it is an Ace?",
        "options": [
          "1/13",
          "1/52",
          "1/4",
          "4/13"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are 13 Spades (the new sample space). Only 1 of them is an Ace. $1/13$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a class of 30 students, 10 play soccer, 12 play basketball, and 4 play both. Given a student plays basketball, what is the probability they also play soccer?",
        "options": [
          "1/3",
          "1/4",
          "4/30",
          "1/5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'given' is the 12 basketball players. 4 of those also play soccer. $4/12 = 1/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does conditional probability affect the sample space of an experiment?",
        "options": [
          "It restricts the sample space to only the outcomes where the 'given' event occurs",
          "It doubles the sample space",
          "It makes the sample space infinite",
          "It has no effect on the sample space"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By knowing an event has occurred, we ignore all outcomes that were part of the original sample space but aren't part of the given event."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $P(A|B) = P(A)$, what can be said about events A and B?",
        "options": [
          "They are independent",
          "They are mutually exclusive",
          "They are dependent",
          "A is a subset of B"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the probability of A doesn't change even when we know B happened, the events have no influence on each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two coins are flipped. Given that at least one is Heads, what is the probability that both are Heads?",

          "1/3",
          "1/4",
          "1/2",
          "3/4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Original space: {HH, HT, TH, TT}. Given 'at least one H', the space is {HH, HT, TH}. Only {HH} fits the goal. $1/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given $P(A) = 0.6, P(B) = 0.3,$ and $P(B|A) = 0.4$. Find $P(A \\cap B)$.",

          "0.7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rearrange the formula: $P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) = 0.4 \\cdot 0.6 = 0.24$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. For example, the probability of being a teenager given you are a human is small, but the probability of being a human given you are a teenager is 1."
