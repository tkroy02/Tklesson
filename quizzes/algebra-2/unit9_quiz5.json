    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $P(A) = 0.5$, $P(B) = 0.4$, and $P(A \\cap B) = 0.2$, are the events independent?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, because $0.5 \\cdot 0.4 = 0.2$",
          "No, because $0.5 + 0.4$ is not $0.2$",
          "Yes, because they are mutually exclusive",
          "No, because $0.2$ is less than $0.5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Events are independent if $P(A) \\cdot P(B) = P(A \\cap B)$. Since $0.5 \\cdot 0.4 = 0.2$, the condition is met."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which real-world scenario describes **dependent** events?",
        "options": [
          "Drawing a card, keeping it, and then drawing a second card",
          "Flipping a coin and then rolling a die",
          "Rolling a 6 and then rolling another 6 on the same die",
          "Drawing a marble, putting it back, and drawing again"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Not replacing the card changes the total number of cards (the sample space) for the second draw, making the events dependent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $P(A \\mid B) = 0.7$ and $P(A) = 0.7$, what can you conclude?",
        "options": [
          "A and B are independent",
          "A and B are dependent",
          "A and B are mutually exclusive",
          "B must be a subset of A"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the probability of A remains the same regardless of whether B occurred, the events are independent."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a survey, $60\\%$ of people like coffee ($C$) and $20\\%$ like tea ($T$). If liking coffee and tea are independent, what is $P(C \\cap T)$?",
        "options": [
          "$0.12$",
          "$0.80$",
          "$0.40$",
          "$0.08$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For independent events, $P(C \\cap T) = P(C) \\cdot P(T) = 0.60 \\cdot 0.20 = 0.12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. If they are mutually exclusive, $P(A \\mid B) = 0$. Since $P(A) > 0$, knowing B happened changes the probability of A to zero, meaning they influence each other."
      },
      {

          "Intersection = $0.22$; Independent",
          "Intersection = $0.10$; Dependent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\Rightarrow 0.72 = 0.3 + 0.6 - X \\Rightarrow X = 0.18$. Since $0.3 \\cdot 0.6 = 0.18$, they are independent."

          "Conditional"

        "answer": "A",

          "Independent",
          "Certain",
          "Inclusive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, an intersection of zero means the events cannot occur together (mutually exclusive)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula would you use to find $P(B \\mid A)$ if you only knew $P(A)$, $P(B)$, and that they are independent?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the core definition of independence: the 'given' information $A$ doesn't change the probability of $B$."
