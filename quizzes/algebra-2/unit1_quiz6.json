      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of the terms in the expression $12x^4 - 18x^3 + 6x^2$?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The largest number that divides 12, 18, and 6 is 6. The smallest power of $x$ common to all terms is $x^2$. Thus, the GCF is $6x^2$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The side length is the square root of the area. $x^2 - 10x + 25 = (x - 5)^2$, so one side is $(x - 5)$. The cost is \\$8(x - 5)$."
