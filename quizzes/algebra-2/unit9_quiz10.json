        "question": "A game costs 5 dollars to play. You have a 10% chance of winning 40 dollars and a 90% chance of winning 0 dollars. What is the expected value (Net Gain)?",
        "options": [
          "-1.00 dollar",
          "4.00 dollars",
          "0.00 dollars",
          "-5.00 dollars"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expected winnings = (40 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.90) = 4 dollars. Since it cost 5 dollars to play, the net expected value is 4 - 5 = -1.00 dollar."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 'fair game' is defined as one where the expected profit is zero for all participants."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "E = (5000 * 0.60) + (-2000 * 0.40) = 3000 - 800 = 2,200 dollars."

          "True"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. For example, the expected value of a die roll is 3.5, even though you can never actually roll a 3.5."
