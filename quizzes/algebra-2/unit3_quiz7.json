    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you determine the possible number of **positive** real zeros for a polynomial $f(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "Count the number of sign changes in the coefficients of $f(x)$",
          "Count the number of sign changes in the coefficients of $f(-x)$",
          "Look at the constant term only",
          "Divide the degree by 2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Descartes' Rule of Signs states that the number of positive real zeros is either equal to the number of sign changes in $f(x)$ or less than that by an even whole number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given $f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 4$, how many sign changes occur?",

          "3",
          "2",
          "1",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The signs are $(+)$, $(-)$, $(+)$, $(-)$. There is a change from $+$ to $-$ (1), $-$ to $+$ (2), and $+$ to $-$ (3)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the same function $f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 4$, what are the possible numbers of positive real zeros?",
        "options": [
          "3 or 1",
          "3 only",
          "2 or 0",
          "1 only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With 3 sign changes, there are either 3 or $3-2=1$ positive real zeros."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you find the number of possible **negative** real zeros?",
        "options": [
          "Count the sign changes in $f(-x)$",
          "Count the sign changes in $f(x)$",
          "Count the number of even exponents",
          "Subtract the positive zeros from the degree"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To find the number of negative real zeros, you substitute $-x$ for $x$ and count the sign changes in the resulting polynomial."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = x^4 + 3x^2 + 7$, how many positive real zeros are possible?",

          "0",
          "2",
          "4",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are no sign changes in $f(x)$ (all terms are positive), so there are 0 possible positive real zeros."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x - 1$, what is $f(-x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$-x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$",
          "$x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$",
          "$-x^3 + x^2 - x - 1$",
          "$-x^3 - x^2 - x - 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$f(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x)^2 - (-x) - 1 = -x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on $f(-x) = -x^3 - x^2 + x - 1$, how many negative real zeros are possible?",

          "1",
          "2",
          "0",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The signs of $f(-x)$ are $(-)$, $(-)$, $(+)$, $(-)$. There are 2 sign changes, so there are either 2 or 0 negative real zeros."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a degree 5 polynomial has 4 sign changes in $f(x)$ and 1 sign change in $f(-x)$, what is the minimum number of imaginary roots it must have?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "2",
          "4",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Possible real roots: (4 positive + 1 negative = 5 total real) OR (2 pos + 1 neg = 3 total real) OR (0 pos + 1 neg = 1 total real). In the case of 5 real roots, there are 0 imaginary. Thus, the minimum is 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does it mean if the lower bound of the real zeros is $-5$?",
        "options": [
          "No real zero is less than $-5$",
          "$-5$ is definitely a root",
          "All roots are negative",
          "The graph crosses the x-axis at $-5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 'bound' is a limit; a lower bound means that no real zeros exist to the left of that value on the number line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Descartes' Rule of Signs tells you the exact number of roots.",

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. It only provides the *possible* number of roots based on sign changes."
