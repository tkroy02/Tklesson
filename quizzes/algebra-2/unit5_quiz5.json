      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step to solve the equation $\\sqrt{x - 3} + 5 = 9$?",
        "options": [
          "Subtract 5 from both sides",
          "Square both sides",
          "Add 3 to both sides",
          "Square the 5 and the 9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must isolate the radical before squaring both sides to avoid creating a complex binomial on the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\sqrt{2x + 1} = 5$.",
        "options": [
          "12",
          "24",
          "13",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $2x + 1 = 25$. Subtract 1: $2x = 24$. Divide by 2: $x = 12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\sqrt[3]{x - 4} = -2$.",
        "options": [
          "-4",
          "12",
          "No solution",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cube both sides: $x - 4 = (-2)^3 \\Rightarrow x - 4 = -8$. Add 4: $x = -4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must you check for extraneous solutions when solving square root equations?",
        "options": [
          "Squaring both sides can turn a negative value into a positive one, creating a 'fake' solution",
          "Radicals can never equal zero",
          "The power property only works for cube roots",
          "To make sure the answer is a whole number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $(-5)^2$ and $5^2$ both equal 25, the process of squaring can create a solution that doesn't satisfy the original 'principal' (positive) square root."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

          "3",
          "-2",
          "3 and -2",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $x + 6 = x^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 - x - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow (x-3)(x+2)=0$. Checking $x=3$: $\\sqrt{9}=3$ (True). Checking $x=-2$: $\\sqrt{4}=-2$ (False). Only 3 is a solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "4",
          "8",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "No real solution",
          "$x = 11$",
          "$x = 21$",
          "$x = -9$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A principal square root cannot equal a negative number. If you squared both sides, you'd get $x+5=16 \\Rightarrow x=11$, but $\\sqrt{11+5}$ is positive 4, not -4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "5",
          "15",
          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is $\\sqrt{x-1} = 4$. Square both sides: $x - 1 = 16$. Add 1: $x = 17$."

          "-2",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $2x + 3 = x + 5$. Subtract $x$: $x + 3 = 5$. Subtract 3: $x = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you have the equation $\\sqrt{x} = x - 2$, what kind of equation do you solve after squaring both sides?",
        "options": [
          "Quadratic",
          "Linear",
          "Cubic",
          "Absolute Value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Squaring the right side $(x-2)^2$ results in $x^2 - 4x + 4$, which is a quadratic equation."
