    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in simplifying a rational expression like $\\frac{x^2 - 9}{x^2 + 5x + 6}$?",
        "options": [
          "Factor the numerator and the denominator completely",
          "Cancel the $x^2$ terms",
          "Subtract the constants",
          "Divide the numerator by the denominator using long division"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You cannot cancel terms that are being added or subtracted. You must convert them into factors (multiplication) first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify the expression: $\\frac{12x^3}{4x^5}$.",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{3}{x^2}$",
          "$3x^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{3x^2}$",
          "$8x^{-2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide the coefficients ($12/4 = 3$) and subtract the exponents ($3 - 5 = -2$), which places $x^2$ in the denominator."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify: $\\frac{x^2 - 16}{x - 4}$.",
        "options": [
          "$x + 4$",
          "$x - 4$",
          "$x + 16$",
          "$x - 8$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor the numerator as a difference of squares: $(x-4)(x+4)$. The $(x-4)$ factors cancel out, leaving $x+4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which value of $x$ is an excluded value for the expression $\\frac{5}{x - 7}$?",
        "options": [
          "$x = 7$",
          "$x = -7$",
          "$x = 0$",
          "$x = 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A rational expression is undefined when the denominator is zero. Setting $x - 7 = 0$ gives $x = 7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify: $\\frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x^2 - 25}$.",

          "$\\frac{x + 5}{x - 5}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor both: $\\frac{(x+2)(x+5)}{(x-5)(x+5)}$. The $(x+5)$ terms cancel, leaving $\\frac{x+2}{x-5}$."
      },

          "$1$",
          "$0$",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factoring out a $-1$ from the numerator gives $-(x - 3)$. Thus, $\\frac{-(x - 3)}{x - 3} = -1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$x = -3, 2$",
          "$x = -1$",
          "$x = 3, 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor the denominator: $(x-3)(x+2)$. The expression is undefined when $x-3=0$ or $x+2=0$."

          "$\\frac{2x}{4}$",
          "$\\frac{x^2}{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor out the GCF: $\\frac{2x(x+3)}{4(x+3)}$. The $(x+3)$ cancels and $2/4$ reduces to $1/2$, leaving $x/2$."

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. Even if a factor is canceled, the original expression is still undefined at that value (this creates a 'hole' in the graph)."
