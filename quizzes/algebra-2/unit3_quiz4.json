    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the remainder when $f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2$ is divided by $x - 2$?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$2$",
          "$-2$",
          "$4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the Remainder Theorem, evaluate $f(2)$: $(2)^3 - 4(2)^2 + 5(2) - 2 = 8 - 16 + 10 - 2 = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To divide $x^4 - 5x^2 + 3$ by $x + 3$ using synthetic division, what is the correct setup for the top row of coefficients?",
        "options": [
          "$1, 0, -5, 0, 3$",
          "$1, -5, 3$",
          "$1, 0, -5, 3$",
          "$1, 1, -5, 1, 3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must include a $0$ placeholder for every missing power of $x$. The powers are $x^4, x^3, x^2, x^1, x^0$, so coefficients are $1, 0, -5, 0, 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are dividing a polynomial by $x + 4$ using synthetic division, what number do you place in the 'box' (the divisor value)?",

          "$1$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The theorem states that $f(k)$ is exactly the remainder when dividing by $(x - k)$. Here, $k = -1$, so the remainder is $5$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

          "$x - 5$",
          "$x + 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $-2$ with coefficients $1, 7, 10$: Bring down $1$; $-2(1)+7 = 5$; $-2(5)+10 = 0$. The result is $1x + 5$."

        "options": [
          "$(x - k)$ is a factor of $f(x)$",
          "$f(k)$ is a negative number",
          "The degree of $f(x)$ is even",
          "$(x - k)$ is not a factor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the Factor Theorem: if the remainder is $0$, then the divisor is a factor and $k$ is a root."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Use synthetic division to find the remainder of $(2x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 8) \\div (x - 3)$.",

        "explanation": "Using $3$ with $2, -5, 1, -8$: Bring down $2$; $3(2)-5=1$; $3(1)+1=4$; $3(4)-8=4$. The remainder is $4$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The result of a synthetic division is $| \\, 2 \\quad 4 \\quad 0 \\, |$. If the original polynomial was a quadratic ($x^2$), what is the resulting quotient?",

          "$2x + 4$ with remainder $0$",
          "$6x$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The quotient degree is always one less than the dividend. A quadratic divided by a linear results in a linear expression ($x^1$). The last number ($0$) is the remainder."
