    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric series: $2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + ...$?",
        "options": [
          "728",
          "364",
          "486",
          "1,456"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_1 = 2$, $r = 3$, $n = 6$. $S_6 = \\frac{2(1 - 3^6)}{1 - 3} = \\frac{2(1 - 729)}{-2} = \\frac{2(-728)}{-2} = 728$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the sum of the first 5 terms of a series where $a_1 = 10$ and $r = 0.5$.",
        "options": [
          "19.375",
          "15.000",
          "20.000",
          "18.750"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$S_5 = \\frac{10(1 - 0.5^5)}{1 - 0.5} = \\frac{10(1 - 0.03125)}{0.5} = 20(0.96875) = 19.375$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $r = 1$, why can't we use the standard geometric series formula?",
        "options": [
          "It would result in division by zero",
          "The sum would be infinite",
          "The ratio must be a fraction",
          "The terms would all be zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The denominator $(1 - r)$ would become $(1 - 1) = 0$, which is undefined. If $r=1$, the series is just $a_1 + a_1 + ...$, which is $n \\cdot a_1$."
      },

          "-12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$S_4 = \\frac{4(1 - (-2)^4)}{1 - (-2)} = \\frac{4(1 - 16)}{3} = \\frac{4(-15)}{3} = 4(-5) = -20$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the sum of a geometric series if $n$ increases and $r > 1$?",
        "options": [
          "The sum grows larger at an increasing rate",
          "The sum approaches a constant value",
          "The sum decreases toward zero",
          "The sum stays the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $r > 1$, each new term is larger than the last, causing the total sum to explode toward infinity."
      },

        "explanation": "$a_1 = 1$, $r = 4$, $n = 5$. $S_5 = \\frac{1(1 - 4^5)}{1 - 4} = \\frac{-1023}{-3} = 341$."

          "r",
          "Sn"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $n$ is in the exponent, you would eventually need to use logarithms to solve for it if $S_n$, $a_1$, and $r$ were given."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A series starts with 100, and each subsequent term is $10\\%$ larger than the previous. What is $r$?",

          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An increase of $10\\%$ means you multiply the previous term by $(1 + 0.10) = 1.10$."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. If the first term is negative or if $r$ is negative, the partial sums can definitely be negative."
