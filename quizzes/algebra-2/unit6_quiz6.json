      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To solve $5^x = 125$, what is the best common base to use?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "25",
          "125",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $125$ is a power of $5$ ($5^3$), using base $5$ allows you to set the exponents equal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $3^{x+1} = 27$.",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "3",
          "4",
          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$3^{x+1} = 3^3$. Therefore, $x + 1 = 3$, which means $x = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{16}$ using a base of 2?",
        "options": [
          "$2^{-4}$",
          "$2^4$",
          "$2^{-3}$",
          "$2^{1/4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$16 = 2^4$. Because it is in the denominator, the exponent becomes negative: $2^{-4}$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $4^x = 2^{x+3}$.",

          "1",
          "2",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rewrite $4$ as $2^2$: $(2^2)^x = 2^{x+3} \\Rightarrow 2^{2x} = 2^{x+3}$. So, $2x = x + 3$, meaning $x = 3$."
      },

        "options": [
          "$x = y$",
          "$x + y = b$",
          "$x \\cdot y = 1$",
          "$x = b/y$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the Property of Equality for Exponential Functions."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$10^{3x} = 10^3$. Therefore, $3x = 3$, so $x = 1$."

          "$3^{x-2} = 3^x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$9 = 3^2$. So $(3^2)^{x-1} = 3^{2(x-1)} = 3^{2x-2}$."

        "answer": "A",
