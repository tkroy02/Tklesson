    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, how many complex roots does the polynomial $f(x) = 4x^5 - 3x^2 + 1$ have?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "2",
          "4",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ complex roots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a polynomial has roots at $x = 2$ (multiplicity 2) and $x = -i$, what other root must it have according to the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem?",
        "options": [
          "$x = i$",
          "$x = -2$",
          "$x = 0$",
          "$x = 1 - i$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a polynomial with real coefficients has a complex root $a + bi$, then its conjugate $a - bi$ must also be a root."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A polynomial of degree 4 has real roots at $x = 3$ and $x = 5$. What is the maximum number of imaginary roots it could have?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "4",
          "0",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the total number of roots must be 4 and we already have 2 real roots, the remaining 2 could be imaginary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can a polynomial of degree 3 have exactly two imaginary roots and one real root?",
        "options": [
          "Yes",
          "No"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Yes. Imaginary roots always come in pairs (conjugates), and $2 + 1 = 3$, which matches the degree."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT possible for a polynomial of degree 3 with real coefficients?",

          "Three imaginary roots",
          "Three real roots",
          "One real root and two imaginary roots",
          "Three real roots, where one has a multiplicity of 2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Imaginary roots must occur in pairs. You cannot have an odd number (3) of imaginary roots if the coefficients are real."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = (x - 4)^3(x + 1)^2$, what is the degree of the polynomial?",

          "5",
          "3",
          "2",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The degree is the sum of the multiplicities of the factors: $3 + 2 = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the total number of roots for $f(x) = (x^2 + 9)(x - 1)^2$.",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "3",
          "2",
          "5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The factor $(x^2 + 9)$ provides 2 roots ($ \pm 3i$) and $(x - 1)^2$ provides 2 roots (a repeated root at 1). Total is 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a polynomial of degree 6 has roots $x = 2i$ and $x = 1 - i$, what is the minimum number of roots we can identify using the Conjugate Root Theorem?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "2",
          "6",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $2i$ is a root, then $-2i$ is a root. If $1 - i$ is a root, then $1 + i$ is a root. This gives us 4 known roots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A polynomial graph crosses the x-axis 3 times and 'bounces' off the x-axis 1 time. What is the minimum possible degree of this polynomial?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "4",
          "3",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each crossing represents a multiplicity of at least 1 (total 3), and each bounce represents a multiplicity of at least 2. $3 + 2 = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra was first proved by which famous mathematician?",
        "options": [
          "Carl Friedrich Gauss",
          "Isaac Newton",
          "Euclid",
          "Pythagoras"
