      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a point $(x, y)$ is represented by the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$, what is the result of multiplying it by the transformation matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$?",
        "options": [
          "The point is dilated (scaled) by a factor of 2.",
          "The point is translated 2 units right.",
          "The point is rotated $90^{\\circ}$.",
          "The point is reflected across the x-axis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying both coordinates by 2 increases the distance from the origin by that factor, resulting in a dilation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which matrix represents a reflection across the x-axis?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A reflection across the x-axis keeps $x$ the same but negates $y$, which is achieved by a $-1$ in the $a_{22}$ position."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This matrix transforms $(x, y)$ into $(-y, x)$, which is the algebraic rule for a $90^{\\circ}$ CCW rotation."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a triangle has vertices at $(1, 1), (3, 1),$ and $(1, 4)$, what are the dimensions of its vertex matrix?",

          "$2 \\times 3$",
          "$3 \\times 2$",
          "$3 \\times 3$",
          "$1 \\times 6$"

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reflecting across the y-axis requires negating the x-coordinate while leaving the y-coordinate alone."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Shear' transformation matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & k \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ affects a shape in which way?",
        "options": [
          "It slants the shape horizontally.",
          "It rotates the shape.",
          "It enlarges the shape uniformly.",
          "It moves the shape to a different quadrant."

        "question": "If you apply the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}$ to a square with an area of 4, what is the new area?",

          "2",
          "0.5",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The linear scale factor is $0.5$. The area scale factor is $(0.5)^2 = 0.25$. Thus, $4 \\times 0.25 = 1$."
