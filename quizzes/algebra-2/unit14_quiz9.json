    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary first step in using matrices to encode a text message?",
        "options": [
          "Assigning a number to each letter of the alphabet.",
          "Calculating the determinant of the message.",
          "Inverting the alphabet matrix.",
          "Multiplying the message by its own transpose."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because matrices operate on numerical data, letters must be mapped to numbers (e.g., $A=1, B=2, \\dots$) before they can be organized into a matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $E$ is the encoding matrix and $M$ is the message matrix, how is the encrypted ciphertext $C$ calculated?",
        "options": [
          "$C = EM$",
          "$C = E + M$",
          "$C = M/E$",
          "$C = E^{-1}M$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Encryption is achieved by multiplying the encoding matrix by the message matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To decode an encrypted message $C$, what must the receiver multiply the ciphertext by?",
        "options": [
          "The inverse of the encoding matrix ($E^{-1}$).",
          "The original encoding matrix ($E$).",
          "The identity matrix ($I$).",
          "The determinant of $E$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying the ciphertext by the inverse matrix 'undoes' the encryption: $E^{-1}(EM) = IM = M$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What characteristic must an encoding matrix possess to be functional for decryption?",
        "options": [
          "It must be a square matrix with a non-zero determinant.",
          "It must be a row matrix.",
          "It must contain only prime numbers.",
          "Its determinant must be equal to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To decode, an inverse matrix must exist. Only square matrices with a non-zero determinant have inverses."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a message is 'CAB' and the mapping is $A=1, B=2, C=3$, what is the message matrix $M$ as a $3 \\times 1$ column?",

          "\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}",
          "\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}",

          "\\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\end{bmatrix}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The characters $C, A,$ and $B$ are placed in order into the rows of a column matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is a singular matrix (determinant = 0) avoided in cryptography?",
        "options": [
          "The message cannot be decoded because the matrix has no inverse.",
          "The message becomes too large to transmit.",
          "It would result in a complex number output.",
          "It only works for short messages."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without an inverse, there is no mathematical way to 'reverse' the multiplication and retrieve the original message numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In matrix cryptography, what is often used to fill empty spaces if a message is shorter than the matrix requirements?",
        "options": [
          "A 'null' value or zero (representing a space).",
          "The number 1 (representing the letter A).",
          "Random prime numbers.",
          "The determinant of the previous block."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard padding uses zeros or spaces to ensure the message matrix has the correct dimensions for multiplication."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the encoding matrix is the Identity Matrix ($I$), what happens to the plaintext message?",
        "options": [
          "The message remains the same and is not effectively encrypted.",
          "The message is completely scrambled.",
          "The message is converted to all zeros.",
          "The message is reversed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by the Identity matrix preserves the original values, leaving the message in its plaintext numerical form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary advantage of using a $3 \\times 3$ encoding matrix over a $2 \\times 2$ matrix?",
        "options": [
          "It provides a higher level of security by encoding letters in larger blocks.",
          "It is faster to calculate manually.",
          "It does not require an inverse for decoding.",
          "It can only be used for the first three letters of a word."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Larger matrices increase the complexity of the relationships between encoded characters, making the code harder to break without the key."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $E = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $M = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$, what is the encrypted ciphertext $C$?",
        "options": [
