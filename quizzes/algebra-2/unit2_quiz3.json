      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the discriminant of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$36$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The discriminant is $D = b^2 - 4ac$. Here, $(-6)^2 - 4(1)(9) = 36 - 36 = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the discriminant of a quadratic equation is negative ($D < 0$), what is the nature of the roots?",
        "options": [
          "Two unique real roots",
          "One repeated real root",
          "Two complex (imaginary) roots",
          "No solutions exist at all"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A negative discriminant means the square root in the quadratic formula results in an imaginary number, yielding two complex roots."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify the expression: $\\sqrt{-49}$.",

          "$-4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For one real root, $D = 0$. $4^2 - 4(1)(c) = 0 \\Rightarrow 16 - 4c = 0 \\Rightarrow c = 4$."

        "question": "Identify the real and imaginary parts of the complex number $5 - 3i$.",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A business finds that their profit model has a discriminant of $144$. What does this tell them about their 'break-even' points (roots)?",

          "They have two distinct real break-even points",
          "They will never break even",
          "They have exactly one break-even point",
          "Their profit is imaginary"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A positive discriminant ($144 > 0$) indicates two distinct real solutions."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Check the discriminant: $(-4)^2 - 4(2)(10) = 16 - 80 = -64$. Since $D < 0$, there are no real solutions."
