    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Quadratic Formula is derived by applying which algebraic method to the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "Completing the Square",
          "Factoring by Grouping",
          "Synthetic Division",
          "Linear Substitution"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ is found by completing the square for the general equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the first step of deriving the quadratic formula from $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, why do we divide by $a$?",
        "options": [
          "To make the leading coefficient $1$",
          "To eliminate the constant $c$",
          "To isolate the $x$ variable",
          "To find the discriminant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Completing the square requires the coefficient of $x^2$ to be 1. Dividing by $a$ transforms $ax^2$ into $x^2$."

          "$(\\frac{b}{a})^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We take half the coefficient of $x$ (which is $\\frac{b}{2a}$) and square it to get $(\\frac{b}{2a})^2$ or $\\frac{b^2}{4a^2}$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 52}}{2} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{48}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{48} = 4\\sqrt{3}$, it simplifies to $5 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To add $-\\frac{c}{a}$ and $\\frac{b^2}{4a^2}$, you must multiply $-\\frac{c}{a}$ by $\\frac{4a}{4a}$, resulting in $\\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}$."

        "question": "A projectile's height is $h = -16t^2 + v_0t + h_0$. To find when it hits the ground ($h=0$), we use the quadratic formula. If the discriminant is $1200$, what is the result?",
