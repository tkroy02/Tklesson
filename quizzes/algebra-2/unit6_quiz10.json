    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The notation $\\ln(x)$ is equivalent to which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "$\\log_e(x)$",
          "$\\log_{10}(x)$",
          "$\\log_2(x)$",
          "$e^x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'natural logarithm' ($\ln$) is specifically defined as a logarithm with base $e$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of $\\ln(e)$?",
        "options": [
          "1",
          "0",
          "e",
          "2.718"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\ln$ is $\\log_e$, we are asking: $e$ to what power is $e$? The answer is $1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate $\\ln(1)$.",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "e",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like all logarithms, the log of $1$ is always $0$ because any base raised to the $0$ power is $1$ ($e^0 = 1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify the expression: $\\ln(e^{4x})$.",
        "options": [
          "$4x$",
          "$e$",
          "$4$",
          "$\\ln(4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $\\ln$ and $e$ are inverses, they cancel each other out, leaving just the exponent $4x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify: $e^{\\ln(7)}$.",

          "$e^7$",
          "$\\ln(7)$",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base $e$ raised to the natural log of $x$ is simply $x$. Here, $x=7$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Expand $\\ln(e^2 x)$ using log properties.",

          "$2 + \\ln(x)$",
          "$2 \\cdot \\ln(x)$",
          "$e^2 + \\ln(x)$",
          "$\\ln(2) + \\ln(x)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Product property: $\\ln(e^2) + \\ln(x)$. Since $\\ln(e^2) = 2$, it simplifies to $2 + \\ln(x)$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\ln(x) = 3$.",

          "$x = e^3$",
          "$x = 3^e$",
          "$x = 10^3$",
          "$x = \\ln(3)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convert to exponential form: the base is $e$, the exponent is $3$, so $x = e^3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the vertical asymptote of $f(x) = \\ln(x + 5)$?",
        "options": [
          "x = -5",
          "x = 5",
          "x = 0",
          "y = -5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The argument must be greater than $0$. Setting $x+5=0$ gives the vertical asymptote at $x=-5$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Expand $\\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{e}\\right)$.",

          "$\\ln(x) - e$",
          "$\\frac{\\ln x}{e}$",
          "$\\ln(x) + 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Quotient property: $\\ln(x) - \\ln(e)$. Since $\\ln(e) = 1$, the result is $\\ln(x) - 1$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Inverses swap domain and range. The range of $e^x$ is $y > 0$, so the domain of $\\ln(x)$ is $x > 0$."
