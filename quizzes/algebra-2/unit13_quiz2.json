    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the maximum number of intersection points possible for a system consisting of a circle and a line?",

          "2",
          "1",
          "4",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A line can pass through a circle (2 points), be tangent to it (1 point), or miss it entirely (0 points)."

          "$(0, 0)$ and $(4, 16)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Setting the equations equal: $x^2 = 2x \\implies x^2 - 2x = 0 \\implies x(x - 2) = 0$. $x = 0$ gives $y = 0$; $x = 2$ gives $y = 4$."

          "The graphs do not intersect.",
          "The graphs are tangent to each other.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two parabolas (e.g., $y = x^2$ and $y = -x^2 + 2$) can intersect at most at two points."

          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x = 1/x \\implies x^2 = 1 \\implies x = \\pm 1$. Substituting back gives $y = 1$ and $y = -1$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangency, by definition, means the line touches the curve at exactly one point."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding the equations gives $2x^2 = 18 \\implies x^2 = 9 \\implies x = \\pm 3$. Substituting $x^2=9$ into the first equation gives $9 + y^2 = 10 \\implies y^2 = 1 \\implies y = \\pm 1$."
