          "(0, -1)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $\\pi$ radians (180°), the point is on the far left of the unit circle, which corresponds to $x = -1$ and $y = 0$."

        "question": "If a point on the unit circle has the coordinates $(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$, what is the angle $\\theta$ in the first quadrant?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $\\pi/2$, the x-coordinate is $0$. Since $\\tan(\\theta) = y/x$, we would be dividing by zero, making the tangent undefined."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the Pythagorean identity $\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1$: $(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + y^2 = 1 \\implies 3/4 + y^2 = 1 \\implies y^2 = 1/4$. In Quadrant II, sine (y) is positive, so $y = 1/2$."
