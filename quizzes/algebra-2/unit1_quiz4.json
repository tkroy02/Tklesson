    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system using substitution: $y = 3x - 4$ and $2x + y = 6$.",
        "options": [
          "$(2, 2)$",
          "$(2, 10)$",
          "$(1, -1)$",
          "$(0, -4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitute $3x - 4$ for $y$ in the second equation: $2x + (3x - 4) = 6 \\Rightarrow 5x - 4 = 6 \\Rightarrow 5x = 10 \\Rightarrow x = 2$. Then $y = 3(2) - 4 = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system using elimination: $3x + 2y = 10$ and $3x - 2y = 2$.",

          "$(0, 5)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Add the equations to eliminate $y$: $6x = 12 \\Rightarrow x = 2$. Substitute $x = 2$ into the first equation: $3(2) + 2y = 10 \\Rightarrow 6 + 2y = 10 \\Rightarrow 2y = 4 \\Rightarrow y = 2$."

          "Two solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide the second equation by -2: $-2x + y = 5 \\Rightarrow y = 2x + 5$. Since the equations are identical, they represent the same line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$(0, 0)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Check $(0, 2)$: $2 > 0 + 1$ (True) and $2 \\le -0 + 4$ (True). It satisfies both."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Tickets to a show cost \\$5 for students and \\$10 for adults. If 100 tickets were sold for a total of \\$800, which system models this?",
        "options": [
          "$s + a = 100$ and $5s + 10a = 800$",

          "$15(s + a) = 800$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first equation represents the total count of tickets ($s+a=100$) and the second represents the total cost ($5s+10a=800$)."

          "Points that are not solutions"

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The lines have the same slope ($\\frac{1}{2}$) but different y-intercepts (3 and -4), meaning they are parallel and never intersect."
