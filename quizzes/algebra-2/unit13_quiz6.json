      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A company makes chairs ($x$) and tables ($y$). They profit $25 per chair and $50 per table. Which equation represents the objective function for profit ($P$)?",
        "options": [
          "$P = 25x + 50y$",
          "$P = 50x + 25y$",
          "$x + y \\le 75$",
          "$25x + 50y \\le P$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The objective function is defined by the profit values associated with each variable. Here, $25x$ represents chair profit and $50y$ represents table profit."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A baker has 100 cups of flour. Each loaf of bread ($x$) uses 2 cups and each cake ($y$) uses 4 cups. Which inequality represents this constraint?",

          "$2x + 4y \\le 100$",
          "$4x + 2y \\le 100$",
          "$x + y \\le 100$",
          "$2x + 4y \\ge 100$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total flour used ($2x + 4y$) cannot exceed the available supply (100 cups)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a diet problem, a patient must receive at least 12 units of Vitamin A. Food X has 2 units and Food Y has 3 units. Which inequality represents this requirement?",

          "$x + y \\ge 12$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the requirement is a 'minimum,' the total amount must be greater than or equal to 12."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When modeling a business problem, why are $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$ almost always included as constraints?",
        "options": [
          "Because you cannot produce or sell a negative number of items.",
          "Because the objective function must be positive.",
          "Because the vertices must be in the first quadrant.",
          "To make the feasible region unbounded."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are 'non-negativity' constraints that reflect the physical reality of production and inventory."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A factory has a maximum of 40 labor hours available. Making a widget takes 2 hours and a gadget takes 5 hours. If widgets are $x$ and gadgets are $y$, what is the labor constraint?",
        "options": [
          "$2x + 5y \\le 40$",
          "$5x + 2y \\le 40$",
          "$2x + 5y \\ge 40$",
          "$x + y \\le 40$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total time spent ($2x + 5y$) is limited by the maximum available hours (40)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the vertices of a feasible region are $(0, 0), (0, 10), (8, 0),$ and $(5, 6)$, which point would maximize $P = 10x + 12y$?",
        "options": [
          "$(5, 6)$",
          "$(0, 10)$",
          "$(8, 0)$",
          "$(0, 0)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Testing vertices: $P(0, 10) = 120$; $P(8, 0) = 80$; $P(5, 6) = 50 + 72 = 122$. The point $(5, 6)$ yields the highest value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an optimization problem, what does the 'Feasible Region' represent?",
        "options": [
          "All possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy every constraint.",
          "The specific point where the highest profit is made.",
          "The set of points that violate at least one constraint.",
          "The line representing the objective function."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The feasible region is the 'playground' where all rules (constraints) are followed simultaneously."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A shipping container has a weight limit of 500 lbs. Item A weighs 10 lbs and Item B weighs 25 lbs. If at least 5 of Item A must be shipped, what are the constraints?",
        "options": [
          "$10x + 25y \\le 500$ and $x \\ge 5$",
          "$25x + 10y \\le 500$ and $y \\ge 5$",

          "$x + y \\le 500$ and $x = 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The weight constraint is $10x + 25y \\le 500$, and the quantity requirement for Item A is $x \\ge 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an objective function for cost is $C = 2x + 10y$ and the vertices are $(2, 10), (5, 4),$ and $(10, 2)$, what is the minimum cost?",
        "options": [
          "50",
          "104",
          "40",
          "24"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$C(2, 10) = 104$; $C(5, 4) = 50$; $C(10, 2) = 40$. The minimum cost is 40 at the point $(10, 2)$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result if the objective function line is perfectly parallel to one of the constraint lines forming the boundary of the feasible region?",
        "options": [
          "There are infinitely many optimal solutions along that boundary segment.",
          "There is no optimal solution.",
          "The optimal solution must be the origin.",
          "The feasible region is invalid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
