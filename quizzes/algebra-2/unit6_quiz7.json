        "options": [
          "$\\log_5(125) = 3$",
          "$\\log_3(125) = 5$",

          "$\\log_5(3) = 125$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base of the exponent (5) remains the base of the log. The exponent (3) is the result of the log."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $2^4 = 16$, the value of the logarithm is 4."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$0.01$ is $1/100$, which is $10^{-2}$. Therefore, the log is -2."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\sqrt{4} = 2$, and a square root is an exponent of $1/2$ (or 0.5), $\\log_4(2) = 0.5$."
