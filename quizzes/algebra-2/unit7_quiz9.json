      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Newton's Law of Cooling formula, $T(t) = T_s + (T_0 - T_s)e^{-kt}$, what does $T_s$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The surrounding (ambient) temperature",
          "The initial temperature of the object",
          "The time it takes to cool",
          "The final temperature of the object"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The object's temperature will approach the surrounding temperature ($T_s$) over time, acting as a horizontal asymptote."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hot bowl of soup at $180^{\\circ}F$ is placed in a room that is $70^{\\circ}F$. What is the value of $(T_0 - T_s)$?",
        "options": [
          "110",
          "250",
          "70",
          "180"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$T_0 = 180$ and $T_s = 70$. The difference is $180 - 70 = 110$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the temperature of an object as $t$ approaches infinity in this model?",
        "options": [
          "The temperature approaches $T_s$",
          "The temperature approaches zero",
          "The temperature approaches $T_0$",
          "The temperature becomes negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $t$ grows, the term $e^{-kt}$ approaches 0, leaving only $T_s$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is *colder* than its surroundings ($T_0 < T_s$), what does Newton's Law of Cooling predict?",
        "options": [
          "The object will warm up to match the room temperature",
          "The object will stay at its initial temperature",
          "The object will continue to get colder",
          "The formula is no longer valid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The law works for both heating and cooling; the object's temperature always moves toward the surrounding temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To solve for the cooling constant $k$ when given all other variables, which mathematical operation is required?",

          "Natural Logarithm (\\ln)",
          "Square Root",
          "Addition",
          "Multiplication"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $k$ is in the exponent of $e$, you must use a natural log to isolate and solve for it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor would likely increase the value of the cooling constant $k$?",
        "options": [
          "Placing the object in front of a fan",
          "Insulating the object with a lid",
          "Moving the object to a warmer room",
          "Using a larger container"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A larger $k$ value means faster cooling. A fan increases the rate of heat transfer, thus increasing $k$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $T(t)$ if $T_s = 20, T_0 = 100, k = 0.1,$ and $t = 10$. (Round to the nearest whole number).",

          "20",
          "100",
          "80"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$T(10) = 20 + (100-20)e^{-0.1(10)} = 20 + 80e^{-1} \\approx 20 + 29.4 = 49.4$."
      },

          "Horizontal Asymptote",
          "Vertical Asymptote",
          "Y-intercept",
          "Point of inflection"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The graph levels off at the surrounding temperature, making $y = T_s$ a horizontal asymptote."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are solving for $t$, which step must you take after subtracting $T_s$ from both sides?",
        "options": [
          "Divide by $(T_0 - T_s)$",
          "Take the natural log immediately",
          "Multiply by $k$",
          "Divide by $e$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must isolate the exponential term ($e^{-kt}$) before taking the natural log."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the exponent in $e^{-kt}$ negative for a cooling object?",
        "options": [
          "To show that the temperature is decreasing over time",
          "Because temperature cannot be positive",
          "Because $T_s$ is always smaller than $T_0$",
          "It is a mathematical convention with no meaning"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative exponent indicates decay, which represents the temperature drop toward the ambient level."
