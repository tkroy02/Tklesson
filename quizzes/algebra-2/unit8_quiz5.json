    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under what condition does an infinite geometric series converge?",
        "options": [
          "$|r| < 1$",
          "$r > 1$",
          "$r = 1$",
          "$|r| > 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A series only converges if the common ratio is between -1 and 1, meaning the terms eventually shrink to zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the sum of the infinite geometric series: $1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ...$",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1.5",

          "1.875"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_1 = 1$ and $r = 0.5$. $S = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Does the series $5 + 10 + 20 + 40 + ...$ have a finite sum?",
        "options": [
          "No, it diverges because $r = 2$",
          "Yes, the sum is 100",
          "Yes, the sum is -5",
          "No, it diverges because $a_1 = 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $r = 2$, which is greater than 1, the terms keep growing and the sum will be infinite."

          "16",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_1 = 12$ and $r = 1/3$. $S = \\frac{12}{1 - 1/3} = \\frac{12}{2/3} = 12 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 18$."

          "12",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$S = \\frac{10}{1 - (-0.2)} = \\frac{10}{1.2} = \\frac{100}{12} = \\frac{25}{3} \\approx 8.33$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the formula $S = \\frac{a_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$ as $n$ approaches infinity if $|r| < 1$?",
        "options": [
          "The $r^n$ term approaches 0",
          "The $r^n$ term approaches 1",
          "The denominator becomes 0",
          "The sum becomes negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As you raise a fraction (like $0.5$) to a massive power, it vanishes toward 0, leaving just the infinite sum formula."

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. Here $r = -1$. Because $|r|$ is not strictly **less** than 1, the sum oscillates and does not settle on a single value."

        "type": "mcq",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_1 = 0.9, r = 0.1$. $S = \\frac{0.9}{1 - 0.1} = \\frac{0.9}{0.9} = 1$. This is the mathematical proof that $0.999... = 1$."

          "50 feet",
          "16.6 feet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total distance = Initial drop + $2 \\cdot$ (infinite sum of bounces). Drop = 10. Bounces: $a_1 = 6, r = 0.6$. Sum $= 6 / (1-0.6) = 15$. Total $= 10 + 2(15) = 40$."

        "explanation": "$20 = \\frac{a_1}{1 - 0.75} \\Rightarrow 20 = \\frac{a_1}{0.25} \\Rightarrow a_1 = 20 \\cdot 0.25 = 5$."
