      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In parametric equations, what is the third variable (usually t) called?",
        "options": [
          "The parameter",
          "The coordinate",
          "The discriminant",
          "The directrix"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The variable t is the parameter that determines the values of both x and y."

          "The area under the curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because x and y depend on t, the graph has a specific order of points, showing the 'path' as t increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $x = t + 1$ and $y = 2t$, what is the location of the point when $t = 3$?",

          "(4, 6)",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which set of parametric equations represents a horizontal line at $y = 5$?",
        "options": [
          "x = t, y = 5",
          "x = 5, y = t",

          "x = 5, y = 5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In this set, $x$ changes as $t$ moves, but $y$ remains constant at 5."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the shape of the graph defined by $x = 3\\cos(t)$ and $y = 3\\sin(t)$?",

          "A straight line",
          "A hyperbola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the identity $\\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$, we get $(x/3)^2 + (y/3)^2 = 1$, which is $x^2 + y^2 = 9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a parametric curve has $x = t^2$, what can we say about the graph's domain in the $xy$-plane?",
        "options": [
          "The graph will only exist where $x \\ge 0$.",
          "The graph will only exist where $x \\le 0$.",
          "The graph is a full circle.",
          "The domain is all real numbers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $t^2$ is always non-negative for real values of $t$, the $x$-coordinates will never be negative."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To sketch a parametric curve by hand, what is the most common method?",

          "Creating a table of values for $t$, then calculating $x$ and $y$.",
          "Finding the derivative immediately.",

          "Using the quadratic formula on $x$ and $y$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A table allows you to plot points in order, which also helps identify the orientation of the curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the starting point of the curve $x = e^t$, $y = t + 2$ for the interval $0 \\le t \\le 1$?",

          "(1, 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $t = 0$: $x = e^0 = 1$ and $y = 0 + 2 = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "25",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $5 = 2t - 1$, so $2t = 6$ and $t = 3$. Then $y = 3^2 = 9$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key advantage of parametric equations in physics?",
        "options": [
          "They can model the horizontal and vertical position of a projectile separately over time.",
          "They eliminate the need for trigonometric functions.",
          "They only work for objects moving in circles.",
          "They prevent the use of negative numbers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parametrics are essential for motion because gravity affects vertical position ($y$) but not horizontal velocity ($x$)."
