    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step to solve $\\log_3(x) = 4$?",
        "options": [
          "Rewrite in exponential form: $3^4 = x$",
          "Divide both sides by 3",
          "Multiply both sides by 3",
          "Take the log of both sides"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Converting to exponential form is the standard way to isolate the variable trapped in a logarithm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\ln(x) = 2$.",
        "options": [
          "$x = e^2$",
          "$x = 2^e$",
          "$x = 10^2$",
          "$x = \\ln(2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base of $\\ln$ is $e$. Rewriting $\\ln(x) = 2$ gives $e^2 = x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\log_2(x) + \\log_2(3) = \\log_2(12)$.",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "9",
          "36",
          "15"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condense the left side: $\\log_2(3x) = \\log_2(12)$. Set the arguments equal: $3x = 12$, so $x = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must you check for 'extraneous solutions' when solving logarithmic equations?",
        "options": [
          "The domain of a logarithm is restricted to positive numbers",
          "Logarithms can only have integer solutions",
          "The base of a logarithm can be negative",
          "Exponential functions have vertical asymptotes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a solved value of $x$ results in taking the log of zero or a negative number, it is undefined and must be excluded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\log(x-1) = 1$.",

          "10",
          "2",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Base 10: $10^1 = x - 1$. Therefore, $10 = x - 1$, which means $x = 11$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $2\\ln(x) = \\ln(16)$.",

          "4",
          "8",
          "32",
          "256"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Move the 2 to the exponent: $\\ln(x^2) = \\ln(16)$. So $x^2 = 16$. While $x$ could be $\\pm 4$, we must discard $-4$ because $\\ln(-4)$ is undefined."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the solution to $\\log_4(x+2) + \\log_4(x-2) = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "$x \\approx 2.83$ (specifically $\\sqrt{8}$)",
          "x = 4",
          "x = 2",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condense: $\\log_4(x^2 - 4) = 1$. Rewrite: $4^1 = x^2 - 4$. Solve: $8 = x^2$, so $x = \\sqrt{8}$ (positive only for domain)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\log_x(25) = 2$.",

          "5",
          "12.5",
          "625",
          "-5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rewrite: $x^2 = 25$. Since the base of a log must be positive, $x = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\ln(2x - 3) = \\ln(11)$.",

          "7",
          "4",
          "14",
          "11"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set arguments equal: $2x - 3 = 11 \\Rightarrow 2x = 14 \\Rightarrow x = 7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you solve an equation and get $x = -2$, and the original equation contains $\\log(x + 5)$, is $-2$ extraneous?",
        "options": [
          "No, because $-2 + 5 = 3$, which is positive",
          "Yes, because $x$ is negative",
          "Yes, because logs cannot have negative solutions",
          "No, because -2 is a real number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The solution itself can be negative as long as it doesn't make the *argument* of the log negative."
