    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the common ratio ($r$) for the sequence: $3, 6, 12, 24, ...$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "3",
          "6",
          "0.5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide any term by the previous one: $6 / 3 = 2$ or $12 / 6 = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the explicit formula for the sequence: $5, 15, 45, 135, ...$?",
        "options": [
          "$a_n = 5(3)^{n-1}$",
          "$a_n = 5 + (n-1)3$",
          "$a_n = 3(5)^{n-1}$",
          "$a_n = 5(3)^n$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first term $a_1 = 5$ and the common ratio $r = 3$. Plugging into $a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$ gives $5(3)^{n-1}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the 6th term ($a_6$) of the sequence where $a_1 = 2$ and $r = 5$.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_6 = 2(5)^{6-1} = 2(5)^5 = 2(3125) = 6250$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a geometric sequence if the common ratio $r$ is between 0 and 1?",
        "options": [
          "The terms decrease toward zero",
          "The terms grow toward infinity",
          "The terms alternate between positive and negative",
          "The sequence becomes arithmetic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by a fraction between 0 and 1 (like 0.5) makes each subsequent term smaller."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the recursive rule $a_1 = 20$ and $a_n = a_{n-1} \\cdot 0.5$, find $a_3$.",

          "5",
          "10",
          "2.5",
          "15"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_2 = 20 \\cdot 0.5 = 10$. $a_3 = 10 \\cdot 0.5 = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a sequence alternates signs ($10, -20, 40, -80, ...$), what can you conclude about $r$?",
        "options": [
          "$r$ is negative",
          "$r$ is a fraction",
          "$r$ is zero",
          "It is not a geometric sequence"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by a negative common ratio causes the sign to flip with every term."
      },

        "question": "Find the common ratio if $a_1 = 4$ and $a_3 = 36$.",

          "3",
          "9",
          "4",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^2 \\Rightarrow 36 = 4 \\cdot r^2 \\Rightarrow 9 = r^2 \\Rightarrow r = 3$ (assuming positive)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is the sequence $100, 50, 25, 12.5, ...$ geometric?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, $r = 0.5$",
          "No, it is arithmetic",
          "Yes, $r = 2$",
          "No, there is no common ratio"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each term is exactly half of the previous term, so $r = 0.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 10th term of $1, 2, 4, 8, ...$?",

          "1,024",
          "256",
          "20"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_{10} = 1(2)^{10-1} = 2^9 = 512$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the explicit formula $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$, why is the exponent $n-1$?",
        "options": [
          "The first term has not been multiplied by $r$ yet",
          "To account for the common difference",
          "Because $r^0 = 0$",
          "It is a placeholder for summation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first term corresponds to $n=1$. Since $r^{1-1} = r^0 = 1$, the formula correctly yields $a_1$ for the first term."
