    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system of two linear equations is called 'inconsistent' if it has:",
        "options": [
          "Exactly one solution",
          "Exactly two solutions",
          "No solution",
          "Infinitely many solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inconsistent systems occur when the lines are parallel (same slope, different y-intercepts), meaning they never intersect and have no common solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method is most efficient to solve the system: $y = 3x - 5$ and $2x + 4y = 12$?",
        "options": [
          "Elimination",
          "Substitution",
          "Cross-multiplication",
          "Synthetic division"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because the first equation is already isolated for $y$, substitution allows you to immediately plug the expression $(3x - 5)$ into the second equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system of equations results in the statement $0 = 0$ during the elimination process, what does this indicate?",
        "options": [
          "The solution is the origin $(0, 0)$",
          "The system is inconsistent",
          "The lines are perpendicular",
          "The lines are coincidental (Infinite solutions)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A true statement like $0 = 0$ indicates that the two equations describe the exact same line, meaning every point on the line is a solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system using elimination: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 4$. What is the value of $x$?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "7",
          "14",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Adding the equations eliminates $y$: $(x + x) + (y - y) = 10 + 4$, which simplifies to $2x = 14$, so $x = 7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a system of linear inequalities, the 'solution set' is represented by:",
        "options": [
          "The intersection point of the two boundary lines",
          "The shaded area where the individual solutions overlap",
          "The area between the x-axis and the y-axis",
          "The region outside both shaded areas"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For an $(x, y)$ pair to satisfy a system, it must be a solution to every inequality in that system, which visually is the overlapping shaded region."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which system of equations has no solution?",
        "options": [
          "{$y = 2x + 5, y = 2x - 3$}",
          "{$y = 2x + 5, y = -2x + 5$}",
          "{$y = x + 4, y = 2x + 8$}",
          "{$x + y = 5, x - y = 5$}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel lines have the same slope (2) but different y-intercepts (5 and -3). These lines will never meet."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving by elimination, if you want to eliminate $y$ in the system {$3x + 2y = 10, 5x - y = 4$}, what is the best first step?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply the first equation by 5",
          "Multiply the second equation by 2",
          "Subtract the second equation from the first",
          "Divide the first equation by 3"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Multiplying the second equation by 2 gives $-2y$, which can then be added to the $+2y$ in the first equation to eliminate the variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system of equations that has at least one solution is classified as:",
        "options": [
          "Independent",
          "Inconsistent",
          "Consistent",
          "Linear"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A 'consistent' system is any system that has at least one solution (either exactly one or infinitely many)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system of inequalities is {$y > 2, y < -1$}, what does the solution graph look like?",
        "options": [
          "A strip of shading between -1 and 2",
          "Two separate shaded regions with no overlap (No Solution)",
          "A shaded cross shape",
          "All real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A $y$ value cannot be simultaneously greater than 2 and less than -1. Since the shaded regions never overlap, the system has no solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system: {$y = 2x, x + y = 9$}. What is the coordinates of the solution?",
        "options": [
          "$(3, 6)$",
          "$(6, 3)$",
          "$(4.5, 4.5)$",
          "$(0, 0)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using substitution: $x + (2x) = 9 \\rightarrow 3x = 9 \\rightarrow x = 3$. Then $y = 2(3) = 6$. The solution is $(3, 6)$."
