    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct graph for the inequality $y \\le -2x + 5$?",
        "options": [
          "A solid line with shading below",
          "A dashed line with shading below",
          "A solid line with shading above",
          "A dashed line with shading above"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The symbol $\\le$ indicates a solid line (including the boundary) and shading below the line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the y-intercept of the line $3x - 4y = 12$?",
        "options": [
          "$(0, 3)$",
          "$(0, -3)$",

          "$(0, -4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To find the y-intercept, set $x = 0$: $-4y = 12 \\Rightarrow y = -3$. The point is $(0, -3)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the image below, identify the linear equation.",

          "$y = -2x + 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The line crosses the y-axis at 2 and rises 1 unit for every 2 units it moves right ($m = \\frac{1}{2}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell phone plan costs a flat fee of \\$20 plus \\$0.10 per text. Which equation models the total monthly cost $C$ for $t$ texts?",
        "options": [
          "$C = 20t + 0.10$",
          "$C = 0.10t + 20$",
          "$C = 20.10t$",
          "$C = 0.10t - 20$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The flat fee of \\$20 is the constant (y-intercept), and \\$0.10 is the rate (slope)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which inequality represents the region above the dashed line $y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 1$?",
        "options": [
          "$y > \\frac{2}{3}x - 1$",
          "$y \\ge \\frac{2}{3}x - 1$",
          "$y < \\frac{2}{3}x - 1$",
          "$y \\le \\frac{2}{3}x - 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dashed line uses $>$ or $<$ symbols. Shading 'above' corresponds to $>$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the slope of a horizontal line such as $y = 4$?",

          "Undefined",
          "1",
          "0",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Horizontal lines have no vertical change (rise), so the slope is 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following points is a solution to the inequality $2x + y < 5$?",

          "$(2, 2)$",
          "$(3, -1)$",
          "$(1, 1)$",
          "$(0, 6)$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Substitute $(1, 1)$: $2(1) + 1 = 3$. Since $3 < 5$, the point is a solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equation of a vertical line passing through $(-3, 5)$?",

          "$y = 5$",
          "$x = 5$",
          "$x = -3$",
          "$y = -3$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Vertical lines are always in the form $x = a$, where $a$ is the x-coordinate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Convert the equation $y - 3 = 4(x + 1)$ into slope-intercept form for graphing.",

          "$y = 4x - 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y - 3 = 4x + 4$. Adding 3 to both sides gives $y = 4x + 7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rental car costs \\$50 per day plus \\$0.20 per mile. If the daily budget is at most \\$100, which inequality represents the miles $m$ you can drive?",
        "options": [
          "$50 + 0.20m \\le 100$",
          "$50 + 0.20m < 100$",

          "$50 + 0.20m \\ge 100$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total cost is $50 + 0.20m$. 'At most' means less than or equal to $\\le$."
