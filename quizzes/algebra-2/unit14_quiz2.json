    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If matrix $A$ is $2 \\times 3$ and matrix $B$ is $3 \\times 4$, what are the dimensions of the product $AB$?",
        "options": [
          "$2 \\times 4$",
          "$3 \\times 3$",
          "$2 \\times 3$",
          "The product is undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The inner dimensions ($3$) match, so the product is defined. The outer dimensions ($2$ and $4$) determine the size of the resulting matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following matrix multiplications is undefined?",
        "options": [
          "A $3 \\times 2$ matrix multiplied by a $3 \\times 2$ matrix.",
          "A $1 \\times 4$ matrix multiplied by a $4 \\times 1$ matrix.",
          "A $2 \\times 2$ matrix multiplied by a $2 \\times 5$ matrix.",
          "A $5 \\times 3$ matrix multiplied by a $3 \\times 3$ matrix."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a $3 \\times 2$ and a $3 \\times 2$, the inner dimensions ($2$ and $3$) do not match. You cannot multiply them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is matrix multiplication commutative? (Does $AB = BA$?)",
        "options": [
          "No, order generally matters in matrix multiplication.",
          "Yes, it follows the same rules as real number multiplication.",
          "Only if both matrices are $1 \\times 1$.",
          "Yes, but only for square matrices."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix multiplication is non-commutative. Even if both $AB$ and $BA$ are defined, they rarely result in the same matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the first element (Row 1, Column 1) of $AB$ if $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 \\end{bmatrix}$.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply Row 1 of $A$ by Column 1 of $B$: $(1 \\times 5) + (2 \\times 7) = 5 + 14 = 19$."

          "$2$",
          "$1$"

          "A matrix of all ones"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Identity matrix acts like the number $1$ in scalar multiplication; $AI = IA = A$."

          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a $1 \\times 2$ times a $2 \\times 1$, resulting in a $1 \\times 1$. $(2 \\times 3) + (0 \\times 4) = 6$."
      },
      {

          "Every element in both matrices."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The position $(i, j)$ in the product is the dot product of Row $i$ from the first matrix and Column $j$ from the second."

        "question": "What happens to the dimensions of the result if you multiply an $n \\times n$ matrix by another $n \\times n$ matrix?",
        "options": [
          "The dimensions remain $n \\times n$.",
          "The dimensions become $n^2 \\times n^2$.",

          "The dimensions become $2n \\times 2n$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying two square matrices of the same size always results in another square matrix of that same size."
