    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a normal distribution, what percentage of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean $(\\mu \\pm 1\\sigma)$?",
        "options": ["68%", "95%", "34%", "99.7%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Empirical Rule, approximately 68% of the data in a normal distribution lies within one standard deviation of the mean."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The weights of newborn babies at a hospital are normally distributed with a mean of $7.5$ pounds and a standard deviation of $0.5$ pounds. What range of weights contains 95% of the newborns?",
        "options": ["6.5 to 8.5 pounds", "7.0 to 8.0 pounds", "6.0 to 9.0 pounds", "7.5 to 8.5 pounds"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "95% of the data falls within $2$ standard deviations. Range: $7.5 \\pm 2(0.5) = 7.5 \\pm 1.0$, which is $6.5$ to $8.5$ pounds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A set of data points has a mean of 150 and a standard deviation of 20. If the distribution is normal, what is the probability that a value is greater than 190?",
        "options": ["2.5%", "5%", "16%", "0.15%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "190 is exactly $2$ standard deviations above the mean ($150 + 2 \\times 20$). Since 95% is within $2$ deviations, 5% is outside. Because the curve is symmetric, half of that (2.5%) is in the upper tail."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a normal distribution has a mean of $50$ and $99.7\\%$ of the data is between $20$ and $80$, what is the standard deviation ($\\sigma$)?",
        "options": ["10", "5", "15", "30"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 99.7% marker represents $3$ standard deviations. The distance from the mean ($50$) to the edge ($80$) is $30$. Therefore, $3\\sigma = 30$, so $\\sigma = 10$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which property is NOT a characteristic of a normal distribution?",
        "options": ["The distribution is skewed to the right", "The mean, median, and mode are equal", "The total area under the curve is 1", "The curve is bell-shaped and symmetric"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A normal distribution is perfectly symmetric, not skewed. Skewed distributions are not 'normal'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, what percentage of the data lies between $\\mu$ and $\\mu + 1\\sigma$?",
        "options": ["34%", "68%", "13.5%", "50%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since 68% lies within $1\\sigma$ of the mean on both sides, and the curve is symmetric, exactly half of that (34%) lies between the mean and one standard deviation above it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A test score distribution is normal with $\\mu = 75$ and $\\sigma = 10$. Approximately what percentage of scores fall between $65$ and $85$?",
        "options": ["68%", "95%", "34%", "81.5%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The range $65$ to $85$ is $\\mu - 1\\sigma$ to $\\mu + 1\\sigma$. By the Empirical Rule, this accounts for 68% of the data."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A set of measurements has $\\mu = 1,200$ and $\\sigma = 100$. What percentage of the data falls between $1,100$ and $1,400$?",
        "options": ["81.5%", "97.35%", "83.85%", "95%"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "1,100 is $-1\\sigma$ (34% from mean) and 1,400 is $+3\\sigma$ (49.85% from mean). $34\\% + 49.85\\% = 83.85\\%$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A machine fills containers with a mean of $20$ oz and a standard deviation of $0.05$ oz. If the distribution is normal, what percentage of containers have less than $19.95$ oz?",
        "options": ["16%", "32%", "2.5%", "50%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$19.95$ oz is exactly one standard deviation below the mean. Since 68% is within $\\pm 1\\sigma$, 32% is outside. Half of that (16%) is in the lower tail."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: In any normal distribution, the area to the left of the mean is always $0.5$.",
        "options": ["True", "False"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Symmetry dictates that exactly 50% of the total area (which is 1) lies on each side of the mean."
