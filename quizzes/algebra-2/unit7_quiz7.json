    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of model is best for a population that doubles every 10 years?",
        "options": [
          "Exponential Growth",
          "Logarithmic Growth",
          "Linear Growth",
          "Exponential Decay"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Doubling indicates a constant ratio (multiplication), which is the hallmark of exponential growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student finds that their test scores improve quickly at first but increase much more slowly as they approach a perfect score. Which model fits this 'diminishing returns' pattern?",
        "options": [
          "Logarithmic",
          "Exponential",
          "Linear",
          "Quadratic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Logarithmic functions grow quickly near the vertical asymptote but level off significantly as x increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the exponential model $y = 500(0.85)^t$, what does the $0.85$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The decay factor",
          "The growth rate",
          "The initial amount",
          "The asymptote"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the base $b$ is less than 1, it is a decay factor. The decay rate would be $15\\%$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following equations represents a logarithmic model?",
        "options": [
          "$y = 2 + 3\\ln(x)$",
          "$y = 2(3)^x$",
          "$y = 3x + 2$",
          "$y = 2x^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Logarithmic models contain the variable inside a log or $\\ln$ function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the $y$-intercept of the model $y = 12(1.05)^x$?",
        "options": [
          "12",
          "1.05",
          "0",
          "None"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plugging in $x=0$ gives $y = 12(1.05)^0 = 12(1) = 12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a bank account grows by $3\\%$ annually, what is the 'b' value in the exponential model $y = a \\cdot b^x$?",
        "options": [
          "1.03",
          "0.03",
          "3",
          "0.97"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Growth is calculated as $1 + r$. So, $1 + 0.03 = 1.03$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Logarithmic models often have a vertical asymptote at $x=0$. What does this imply for real-world 'time' data?",
        "options": [
          "The model is typically only valid for $x > 0$",
          "The model starts at infinity",
          "The model is always negative",
          "The model has no $y$-values"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since you cannot take the log of 0, these models are usually used for time periods after an initial starting point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A radioactive substance loses half its mass every year. This is modeled by:",
        "options": [
          "Exponential Decay",
          "Logarithmic Growth",
          "Linear Decay",
          "Exponential Growth"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Losing a consistent percentage (half, or $50\\%$) over time is exponential decay."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the model $y = a + b\\ln(x)$, if $b$ is negative, the graph is:",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing",
          "Increasing",
          "A straight line",
          "A parabola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative coefficient in front of the log reflects the graph, making it decrease as $x$ increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which model would be most appropriate for the sound level (in decibels) as you move away from a speaker?",
        "options": [
          "Logarithmic",
          "Linear",
          "Exponential Growth",
          "Constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, so changes in sound levels are modeled using logarithms."
