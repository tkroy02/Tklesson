    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the vertical asymptote of the parent function $f(x) = \\log(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "x = 0",
          "y = 0",
          "x = 1",
          "None"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The graph of a logarithm approaches the y-axis but never touches it, meaning the vertical asymptote is x = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the domain of $f(x) = \\log_2(x - 4)$?",
        "options": [
          "x > 4",
          "x > 0",
          "x > -4",
          "All real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The argument of the log must be positive: $x - 4 > 0$, which simplifies to $x > 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the transformation $f(x) = \\log(x) + 3$ affect the graph's asymptote?",
        "options": [
          "It does not change the asymptote",
          "It moves the asymptote to x = 3",
          "It moves the asymptote to y = 3",
          "It moves the asymptote to x = -3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical shifts do not change the vertical asymptote of a logarithm; only horizontal shifts affect it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following functions has a vertical asymptote at $x = -2$?",
        "options": [
          "$f(x) = \\log(x + 2)$",
          "$f(x) = \\log(x - 2)$",
          "$f(x) = \\log(x) + 2$",
          "$f(x) = \\log(x) - 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A horizontal shift of 2 units to the left ($x + 2$) moves the asymptote from $x = 0$ to $x = -2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the x-intercept of the parent function $f(x) = \\log_b(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "(1, 0)",
          "(0, 1)",
          "(b, 0)",
          "There is no x-intercept"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $b^0 = 1$, the log of 1 is always 0, regardless of the base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the range of $f(x) = \\log(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "All real numbers",
          "y > 0",
          "y < 0",
          "x > 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the domain of a log is restricted, the output (range) covers all real numbers from negative infinity to positive infinity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = \\log_b(x)$ and $b > 1$, the graph is:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing from left to right",
          "Decreasing from left to right",
          "A horizontal line",
          "A vertical line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the base is greater than 1, the logarithmic function is an increasing function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Describe the transformation of $g(x) = -\\log(x)$.",
        "options": [
          "Reflection across the x-axis",
          "Reflection across the y-axis",
          "Vertical shift down",
          "Horizontal stretch"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative sign in front of the function negates the y-values, reflecting the graph vertically over the x-axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the vertical asymptote for $f(x) = \\log(2x - 6)$?",
        "options": [
          "x = 3",
          "x = 6",
          "x = 0",
          "x = -3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set the argument to zero and solve: $2x - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2x = 6 \\Rightarrow x = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The graph of $y = \\log_b(x)$ is the reflection of $y = b^x$ across which line?",
        "options": [
          "y = x",
          "y = 0",
          "x = 0",
          "y = -x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inverses are always symmetric reflections across the diagonal line $y = x$."
