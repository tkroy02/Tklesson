      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a polynomial has zeros at $x = 2$ and $x = -5$, what are its linear factors?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factors are always in the form $(x - k)$. For $k=2$, it's $(x-2)$. For $k=-5$, it's $(x - (-5)) = (x+5)$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The root $x=1$ is one root. The root $x=i$ must have a conjugate pair $x=-i$. Total roots = 3, so minimum degree is 3."
