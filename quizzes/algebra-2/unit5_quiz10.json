        "question": "The speed $v$ (in m/s) of a car before braking can be estimated by $v = \sqrt{20d}$, where $d$ is the skid mark length. If a car leaves a 45-meter skid mark, what was its speed?",
        "options": [
          "30 m/s",
          "900 m/s",
          "15 m/s",
          "45 m/s"
        ],

        "question": "The sharpest possible curve a car can take at speed $v$ is given by $r = \\frac{v^2}{15f}$. If we want to find the speed for a given radius, the formula becomes $v = \\sqrt{15fr}$. If $f=0.6$ and $r=100$, what is $v$?",

        "options": [
          "Physical quantities like time and distance are generally non-negative",
          "Negative numbers cannot be squared",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In most real-world contexts, a 'negative' distance or 'negative' time is physically impossible, making those solutions extraneous."
