      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which transformation is applied to $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ to obtain $g(x) = \\sqrt{x} - 4$?",
        "options": [
          "Vertical shift down 4 units",
          "Horizontal shift right 4 units",
          "Horizontal shift left 4 units",
          "Vertical shift up 4 units"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A constant subtracted outside the radical affects the y-coordinates, shifting the graph down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the graph of $g(x) = \\sqrt{x + 5}$ differ from the parent function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$?",

          "It is shifted 5 units down"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the form $\\sqrt{x - h}$, a $+5$ means $h = -5$, which shifts the graph in the negative direction (left)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The function $g(x) = -\\sqrt{x}$ represents a reflection of the parent function across which axis?",

          "The line $y = x$",
          "The origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative sign outside the function negates the output ($y$), flipping the graph vertically over the x-axis."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equation of the function $f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ after it has been vertically stretched by a factor of 3 and shifted up 2 units?",
        "options": [
          "$g(x) = 3\\sqrt[3]{x} + 2$",
          "$g(x) = \\sqrt[3]{3x} + 2$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The stretch factor multiplies the radical, and the vertical shift is added outside the radical."

          "$g(x) = -\\sqrt{-x}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Negating $x$ inside the radical reflects the graph horizontally across the y-axis."

        "question": "Describe the transformations for the function $g(x) = \\sqrt{x - 1} + 7$.",

          "Shift left 1 and up 7",
          "Shift right 1 and down 7",
          "Shift left 1 and down 7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $-1$ inside shifts the graph right, and the $+7$ outside shifts it up."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is vertically compressed by a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$, what is the new equation?",

          "$g(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{x}$",
          "$g(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}x}$",
          "$g(x) = 2\\sqrt{x}$",
          "$g(x) = \\sqrt{x} - \\frac{1}{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical compression is achieved by multiplying the function output by a fraction between 0 and 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the domain of $g(x) = \\sqrt{x - 3}$ compare to the parent function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$?",
        "options": [
          "The domain starts at $x = 3$ instead of $x = 0$",
          "The domain is the same",
          "The domain starts at $x = -3$",
          "The domain is all real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The horizontal shift 3 units to the right moves the starting point of the domain from $x \\ge 0$ to $x \\ge 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the function $g(x) = 4\\sqrt[3]{x + 1} - 5$, what is the horizontal shift?",

          "1 unit right",
          "5 units down",
          "4 units up"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal shifts are found inside the radical. $+1$ translates to a shift of 1 unit in the negative (left) direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the graph of $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ if it is transformed to $g(x) = -\\sqrt{x - 2} + 3$?",

          "Reflected over x-axis, shifted left 2, up 3",
          "Vertical stretch by 2, shifted right 2, up 3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The negative outside reflects over the x-axis, the $-2$ inside shifts right 2, and the $+3$ outside shifts up 3."

        "90": "Excellent! You have a great eye for function transformations.",
        "70": "Good job. Remember: 'Inside' the radical affects $x$ (backwards), and 'Outside' affects $y$ (straightforward).",
        "50": "Keep practicing. Focus on the difference between a vertical stretch and a horizontal shift.",
        "0": "Try to visualize the graph moving. $+h$ inside the radical moves it left, and $+k$ outside moves it up."
