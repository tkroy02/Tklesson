    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the boundary line for the inequality $2x - 3y < 6$?",
        "options": [
          "A solid line with a positive slope",
          "A dashed line with a positive slope",
          "A dashed line with a negative slope",
          "A solid line with a negative slope"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The strict inequality '<' requires a dashed line. Solving for $y$ gives $y > \\frac{2}{3}x - 2$. Since the coefficient of $x$ is positive, the slope is positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the $y$-intercept of the line represented by the equation $4x + 5y = 20$?",
        "options": [
          "$(5, 0)$",
          "$(0, 4)$",
          "$(0, 5)$",
          "$(4, 0)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To find the $y$-intercept, set $x = 0$. This results in $5y = 20$, so $y = 4$. The coordinate is $(0, 4)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A line has an undefined slope and passes through the point $(-7, 2)$. What is its equation?",
        "options": [
          "$y = 2$",
          "$x = -7$",
          "$y = -7x + 2$",
          "$x = 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Vertical lines have undefined slopes and are written in the form $x = c$. Since the line passes through $(-7, 2)$, the equation is $x = -7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which inequality represents the region 'all points below the line $y = \\frac{1}{2}x - 3$, including the line itself'?",
        "options": [
          "$y < \\frac{1}{2}x - 3$",
          "$y \\le \\frac{1}{2}x - 3$",
          "$y \\ge \\frac{1}{2}x - 3$",
          "$x \\le \\frac{1}{2}y - 3$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Below' indicates 'less than', and 'including the line' adds the 'equal to' component, resulting in $\\le$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the slope of a line perpendicular to $y = -\\frac{4}{5}x + 10$?",
        "options": [
          "$-\\frac{4}{5}$",
          "$\\frac{4}{5}$",
          "$\\frac{5}{4}$",
          "$-\\frac{5}{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals. The negative reciprocal of $-\\frac{4}{5}$ is $+\\frac{5}{4}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the graph of the inequality $x > -4$, which direction is the shading applied?",
        "options": [
          "Upward",
          "Downward",
          "To the left",
          "To the right"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For $x$-only inequalities, 'greater than' means shading all values to the right of the vertical boundary line on the coordinate plane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which form of a linear equation is best for identifying the slope and a specific non-intercept point: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$?",
        "options": [
          "Standard Form",
          "Slope-Intercept Form",
          "Point-Slope Form",
          "Intercept Form"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Point-Slope form is designed specifically to use the slope ($m$) and a given point $(x_1, y_1)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a line passes through $(2, 5)$ and $(2, 10)$, what can be said about its graph?",
        "options": [
          "It is a horizontal line",
          "It is a vertical line",
          "It has a positive slope",
          "It passes through the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because the $x$-coordinate is the same for two different $y$-values, the line is perfectly vertical ($x = 2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the graph of $y = 5$?",
        "options": [
          "A line with a slope of 5 passing through the origin",
          "A vertical line at $x = 5$",
          "A horizontal line with a y-intercept of 5",
          "A diagonal line crossing the x-axis at 5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Equations in the form $y = c$ are horizontal lines with a slope of 0. For this equation, every point has a $y$-value of 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When graphing $y \\ge -x + 4$, which side of the boundary line should be shaded?",
        "options": [
          "The side containing the origin $(0,0)$",
          "The side not containing the origin $(0,0)$",
          "Only the boundary line itself",
          "The region to the left of the y-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Testing $(0,0)$ in the inequality gives $0 \\ge 4$, which is false. Therefore, you shade the side that does NOT contain the origin."
