      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the denominator ($D$) in Cramer’s Rule represent?",
        "options": [
          "The determinant of the coefficient matrix.",
          "The determinant of the variable matrix.",
          "The sum of all constants in the system.",
          "The inverse of the constant matrix."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In Cramer's Rule, $D$ is the determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficients of the variables."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a $2 \\times 2$ system, how do you create the matrix for $D_x$?",
        "options": [
          "Replace the first column (x-coefficients) with the constant terms.",
          "Replace the second column (y-coefficients) with the constant terms.",

          "Multiply the first column by the constants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To find the determinant associated with $x$, you substitute the constant column from the system into the $x$ position."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $D = 0$ when attempting to use Cramer’s Rule, what can you conclude about the system?",
        "options": [
          "The system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions.",
          "The system has exactly one solution at the origin.",
          "The system is linear but the variables are negative.",
          "Cramer's Rule will still work if you use absolute values."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A determinant of zero means the coefficient matrix is singular, indicating parallel or coincident lines."

        "explanation": "$D_x = \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} 7 & -1 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = (7 \\times 1) - (-1 \\times 3) = 10$. Then $x = D_x/D = 10/5 = 2$."

          "The third column.",
          "The first column.",
          "The second column.",
          "All three columns."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The column corresponding to the variable you are solving for is the one replaced by the constants."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might a mathematician choose Cramer's Rule over Matrix Inversion ($X = A^{-1}B$)?",
        "options": [
          "It allows you to solve for just one variable without finding the full inverse.",
          "It works even if the determinant is zero.",
          "It is the only method that works for $3 \\times 3$ systems.",
          "It does not involve any subtraction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cramer's Rule is efficient if you only need the value of $x$ or $y$ specifically, as calculating a full inverse can be more labor-intensive."
      },

          "5",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$D_y = \\text{det}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 2 & 8 \\end{bmatrix} = (1 \\times 8) - (5 \\times 2) = 8 - 10 = -2$."
