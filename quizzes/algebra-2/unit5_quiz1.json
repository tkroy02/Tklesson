        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An exponent of $1/2$ is the same as a square root."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Convert the radical expression $\\sqrt[3]{a^5}$ into exponential form.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The index (3) becomes the denominator and the power (5) becomes the numerator."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate $27^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ without a calculator.",

          "$-y \\sqrt{y}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$1.5 = 3/2$. The negative exponent moves it to the denominator. So, $1/y^{3/2} = 1/\\sqrt{y^3}$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 5th root of $-32$ is $-2$ because $(-2)^5 = -32$. Odd roots of negative numbers are real."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 4th root of $16$ is $2$. For the variable, $x^{8/4} = x^2$. Combined, we get $2x^2$."

          "$x^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the Power of a Power rule, multiply the exponents: $(2/3) \\times (3/2) = 1$. The result is $x^1$ or $x$."

          "False"
        ],

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$16^{1/4} = 2$. The negative exponent makes it the reciprocal: $1/2$."
