      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a substance has a half-life of 10 years, how much of a 100g sample remains after 20 years?",
        "options": [
          "25g",
          "50g",
          "12.5g",
          "0g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "20 years is exactly two half-lives. After 10 years, 50g remains; after another 10 years, 25g remains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct setup to find the remaining amount $A$ of a substance with half-life $h$ after time $t$?",
        "options": [
          "$A = A_0(0.5)^{t/h}$",
          "$A = A_0(2)^{t/h}$",
          "$A = A_0(0.5)^{th}$",
          "$A = A_0(h)^{t/0.5}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base must be $0.5$ (for half) and the exponent represents the number of half-life cycles completed ($t/h$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. An artifact has $25\\%$ of its original Carbon-14. How old is it?",
        "options": [
          "11,460 years",
          "5,730 years",
          "17,190 years",
          "2,865 years"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$25\\%$ remains after two half-lives. $5730 \\cdot 2 = 11460$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the continuous decay rate $r$ for a half-life of $20$ days, which equation would you solve?",
        "options": [
          "$e^{20r} = 0.5$",
          "$e^{0.5r} = 20$",
          "$20e^{r} = 0.5$",
          "$0.5e^{20r} = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the amount becomes half ($0.5$) when $t = 20$, the equation is $Pe^{20r} = 0.5P$, which simplifies to $e^{20r} = 0.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the rate of decay as the half-life of a substance increases?",
        "options": [
          "The substance decays more slowly",
          "The substance decays more quickly",
          "The decay rate stays the same",
          "The substance becomes stable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A longer half-life means it takes more time for the material to disappear, meaning a slower decay rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sample of Iodine-131 decays from 80g to 10g in 24 days. What is its half-life?",
        "options": [
          "8 days",
          "6 days",
          "12 days",
          "3 days"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sample was cut in half three times ($80 \\rightarrow 40 \\rightarrow 20 \\rightarrow 10$). $24 / 3 = 8$ days per half-life."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $t$: $100(0.5)^{t/5} = 10$.",

          "16.61",
          "3.32",
          "25.00",
          "10.00"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(0.5)^{t/5} = 0.1$. Take the log of both sides: $(t/5)\\log(0.5) = \\log(0.1)$. $t = 5 \\cdot [\\log(0.1)/\\log(0.5)] \\approx 16.61$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the continuous model $A = Pe^{rt}$, the value of $r$ for a decay problem must be:",

          "Negative",
          "Positive",
          "Greater than 1",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For decay, the exponent must be negative so that the value decreases over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you have 1/8 of a sample left, how many half-lives have passed?",

          "3",
          "2",
          "4",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(1/2)^3 = 1/8$. Thus, 3 half-lives have passed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is used to model the 'un-decaying' part of the substance?",
        "options": [
          "The amount remaining ($A$)",
          "The amount lost",
          "The half-life",
          "The initial amount"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exponential decay formulas calculate the amount that is still present (remaining) at time $t$."
