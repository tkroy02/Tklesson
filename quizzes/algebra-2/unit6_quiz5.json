      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An exponential regression produces the model $y = 105(1.23)^x$. What is the growth rate of this data?",
        "options": [
          "23%",
          "123%",
          "5%",
          "1.23%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base $b$ is $1.23$. Since $b = 1 + r$, we have $1.23 = 1 + 0.23$, which is $23\\%$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a set of data points $(x, y)$ shows a constant **ratio** between consecutive $y$-values, which model is most appropriate?",
        "options": [
          "Exponential",
          "Linear",
          "Quadratic",
          "Absolute Value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Linear models have a constant difference, but exponential models have a constant ratio (multiplier)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A calculator shows an $r$-value of $-0.98$ for an exponential regression. What does this indicate?",
        "options": [
          "A very strong fit for exponential decay",
          "A very weak fit for exponential growth",
          "A very strong fit for exponential growth",
          "The model is invalid because $r$ is negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The negative sign indicates decay, and $0.98$ is very close to $1$, indicating a very strong correlation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the regression model $y = 450(0.88)^x$, what was the approximate initial value of the data set?",
        "options": [
          "450",
          "0.88",
          "396",
          "12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The value of $a$ in $y=ab^x$ represents the $y$-intercept or initial value (when $x=0$)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scatter plots would best be modeled by an exponential regression?",
        "options": [
          "A curve that starts flat and rises increasingly fast",
          "A straight line with a positive slope",
          "A U-shaped curve",
          "Points scattered randomly with no pattern"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exponential growth starts slowly and increases at an increasing rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You use regression to find $y = 20(1.5)^x$ to model a colony of insects. How many insects are predicted for $x = 4$?",
        "options": [
          "101",
          "120",
          "80",
          "160"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y = 20(1.5)^4 = 20(5.0625) = 101.25$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $x$ represents 'years since 2010', what $x$-value should be plugged into a regression model to predict a value for the year 2025?",
        "options": [
          "15",
          "2025",
          "25",
          "10"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$2025 - 2010 = 15$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When performing regression, if the base $b$ is found to be exactly $1$, the model is:",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal line",
          "A vertical line",
          "Exponential growth",
          "Exponential decay"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $b=1$, then $1^x$ is always $1$, making $y=a$, which is a horizontal line."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which tool is commonly used to find an exponential regression equation from a table of data?",

          "Graphing calculator (ExpReg)",
          "Protractor",
          "Compass",
          "Ruler"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'ExpReg' function on a graphing calculator or statistical software is used to find the best-fit exponential equation."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the $y$-values in the model $y = 5(2)^x$ for every $1$-unit increase in $x$?",
        "options": [
          "They double",
          "They increase by 2",
          "They increase by 5",
          "They stay the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base $b=2$ is the multiplier. Increasing $x$ by 1 means multiplying the previous $y$ by 2."
