    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the midline of the function $y = 2\\sin(x) + 5$?",
        "options": [
          "y = 5",
          "y = 2",
          "y = 0",
          "y = -5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertical shift $k$ determines the midline. Since $k = 5$, the midline is $y = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the phase shift of the function $y = \\sin(2x - \\pi)$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\pi/2$ to the right",
          "$\\pi$ to the right",
          "$\\pi$ to the left",
          "$\\pi/2$ to the left"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To find the phase shift, factor out the coefficient of $x$: $y = \\sin(2(x - \\pi/2))$. The phase shift is $\\pi/2$ to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a sine wave is shifted up by 3 units, which parameter in $y = a\\sin(b(x-h)) + k$ is modified?",
        "options": [
          "k",
          "a",
          "b",
          "h"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertical shift represents a change in the $k$ value, moving the entire wave (the midline) up by the specified number of units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the amplitude of the function $y = -3\\cos(2x) - 1$?",

          "3",
          "-3",
          "2",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amplitude is the absolute value of the lead coefficient $a$. Since $a = -3$, the amplitude is $|-3| = 3$."
      },

          "$4\\pi$",
          "$\\pi/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period is calculated as $2\\pi / b$. Here $b = 4$, so the period is $2\\pi / 4 = \\pi/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the maximum value of the function $y = 4\\sin(x) + 2$?",

          "6",
          "4",
          "2",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The maximum value is the midline plus the amplitude: $2 + 4 = 6$."

        "question": "What is the phase shift of the function $y = \\cos(x - \\frac{\\pi}{4})$?",

          "No phase shift"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the form $(x - h)$, a positive $h$ value represents a shift to the right. Here, $h = \\pi/4$."
      },

          "$2\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period is $2\\pi$ divided by the $b$ value: $2\\pi / (\\pi/3) = 2\\pi \\times (3/\\pi) = 6$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the function $y = \\sin(x)$ is compressed horizontally to $y = \\sin(2x)$, what is the new period?",
