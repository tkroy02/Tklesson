    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student pays \\$12 for a workbook that asks for the midline of the function $y = 2\\sin(x) + 5$. What is the midline?",
        "options": [
          "y = 5",
          "y = 2",
          "y = 0",
          "y = -5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertical shift $k$ determines the midline. Since $k = 5$, the midline is $y = 5$. The price of the book (\\$12) does not affect the graph's geometry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A specialized graphing ruler costs \\$8 and is used to measure the phase shift of $y = \\sin(2x - \\pi)$. What is the phase shift?",
        "options": [
          "$\\pi/2$ to the right",
          "$\\pi$ to the right",
          "$\\pi$ to the left",
          "$\\pi/2$ to the left"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must factor out the $b$ value: $y = \\sin(2(x - \\pi/2))$. The phase shift $h$ is $\\pi/2$ to the right. The cost of the ruler (\\$8) is just a fixed value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a sine wave represents a stock price that is shifted up by \\$3, which parameter in $y = a\\sin(b(x-h)) + k$ is modified?",
        "options": [
          "k",
          "a",
          "b",
          "h"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertical shift of \\$3 represents a change in the $k$ value, moving the entire wave (the midline) up by 3 units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A premium math app costs \\$15 per year. It calculates the amplitude of $y = -3\\cos(2x) - 1$. What value does it find?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "-3",
          "2",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amplitude is the absolute value of $a$. $|-3| = 3$. The yearly cost of \\$15 is an unrelated constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A set of trigonometry posters costs \\$25. One poster shows that the period of $y = \\sin(4x)$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\pi/2$",
          "$2\\pi$",
          "$4\\pi$",
          "$\\pi/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period is $2\\pi / b$. Here $b = 4$, so $2\\pi / 4 = \\pi/2$. The poster price of \\$25 remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A digital textbook costs \\$50 and describes a transformation where the maximum value of $y = 4\\sin(x) + 2$ is calculated. What is that maximum?",

          "6",
          "4",
          "2",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maximum value $= \\text{Midline} + \\text{Amplitude} = 2 + 4 = 6$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An online tutor charges \\$40 per hour to explain that the function $y = \\cos(x - \\frac{\\pi}{4})$ has which phase shift?",
        "options": [
          "$\\pi/4$ to the right",
          "$\\pi/4$ to the left",
          "$\\pi$ to the right",
          "No phase shift"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the form $(x - h)$, $h = \\pi/4$ results in a shift to the right."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student spends \\$5 on a snack before finding the period of $y = 5\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}x)$. What is the period?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period $= 2\\pi / (\\pi/3) = 6$. The \\$5 snack is a sunk cost!"

        "options": [
          "0.5",
          "10",

          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
