    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does it mean if two events are 'mutually exclusive'?",
        "options": [
          "They cannot occur at the same time",
          "One event's outcome affects the other",
          "They always occur together",
          "The sum of their probabilities is greater than 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mutually exclusive means the intersection is empty; there is no overlap between the events."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a standard die, what is the probability of rolling a 2 OR a 5?",
        "options": [
          "1/3",
          "1/6",
          "2/5",
          "1/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are mutually exclusive. $1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6$, which simplifies to $1/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a deck of 52 cards, what is $P(\\text{Heart or King})$?",
        "options": [
          "16/52",
          "17/52",
          "13/52",
          "4/52"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are 13 Hearts and 4 Kings, but one card is the King of Hearts. $13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $P(A) = 0.4$, $P(B) = 0.5$, and the events are mutually exclusive, what is $P(A \\cup B)$?",
        "options": [
          "0.9",
          "0.1",
          "0.2",
          "1.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since they are mutually exclusive, simply add them: $0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $P(A) = 0.3$, $P(B) = 0.6$, and $P(A \\cap B) = 0.1$, what is $P(A \\cup B)$?",
        "options": [
          "0.8",
          "0.9",
          "0.7",
          "0.2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) = 0.3 + 0.6 - 0.1 = 0.8$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do we subtract $P(A \\cap B)$ in the general addition rule?",
        "options": [
          "To avoid double-counting the outcomes in the overlap",
          "Because the probability would be greater than 1 otherwise",
          "To account for the complement",
          "Because the events are independent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Outcomes in the intersection are included in both $P(A)$ and $P(B)$, so they must be subtracted once to get an accurate total."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spinner has 8 equal sections numbered 1-8. What is the probability of spinning a number greater than 5 OR an even number?",

          "5/8",
          "7/8",
          "3/8",
          "1/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Greater than 5: {6, 7, 8}. Even: {2, 4, 6, 8}. Overlap: {6, 8}. $3/8 + 4/8 - 2/8 = 5/8$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Events A and B are such that $P(A) = 0.5$ and $P(A \\cup B) = 0.8$. If A and B are mutually exclusive, what is $P(B)$?",

          "0.5",
          "0.8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$0.8 = 0.5 + P(B) \\Rightarrow P(B) = 0.3$."
      },

          "2/9",
          "1/6",
          "1/12",
          "8/36"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sums of 7: (1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1) = 6 ways. Sums of 11: (5,6),(6,5) = 2 ways. Total = $8/36 = 2/9$."

          "A given B"
        ],
