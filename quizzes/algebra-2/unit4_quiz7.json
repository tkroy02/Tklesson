    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most common first step to solve a rational equation like $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{x}$?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply every term by the LCD ($2x$) to clear the fractions",
          "Cross-multiply the first two terms",
          "Subtract $1/x$ from $5/x$ and ignore the $1/2$",
          "Square both sides of the equation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by the Least Common Denominator (LCD) eliminates all denominators, leaving a simpler linear or quadratic equation to solve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{6}{x} = 3$.",
        "options": [
          "$2$",
          "$18$",
          "$0.5$",
          "$-2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by $x$ gives $6 = 3x$. Dividing by 3 gives $x = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an 'extraneous solution' in the context of rational equations?",
        "options": [
          "A solution that is mathematically derived but makes an original denominator zero",
          "A solution that is a negative number",
          "A solution that is an imaginary number",
          "A solution that is a fraction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since division by zero is undefined, any solution that results in a zero denominator in the original equation must be rejected."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{x}{x-2} = \\frac{2}{x-2} + 2$.",

          "No solution (solution is extraneous)",
          "$x = 2$",
          "$x = 0$",
          "$x = 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply by $(x-2)$: $x = 2 + 2(x-2) \\Rightarrow x = 2 + 2x - 4 \\Rightarrow x = 2x - 2 \\Rightarrow x = 2$. However, $x=2$ makes the original denominators zero, so it is extraneous. No solution exists."

          "$1$",
          "$3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cross-multiply: $4(x-1) = 2(x+3) \\Rightarrow 4x - 4 = 2x + 6 \\Rightarrow 2x = 10 \\Rightarrow x = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x-3} = \\frac{3}{x^2-3x}$, what is the LCD used to clear the fractions?",

          "$x(x-3)$",
          "$x^2 - 3x^2$",
          "$x + (x-3)$",
          "$3x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $x^2 - 3x$ factors into $x(x-3)$, that product is the LCD."
      },

        "question": "Solve: $1 - \\frac{2}{x} = \\frac{15}{x^2}$.",

          "$5$ and $-3$",
          "$-5$ and $3$",
          "$5$ only",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply by $x^2$: $x^2 - 2x = 15 \\Rightarrow x^2 - 2x - 15 = 0 \\Rightarrow (x-5)(x+3) = 0$. Solutions are $5$ and $-3$."

          "$x=0$",
          "$x=1$",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $1/0$ is undefined, $x=0$ is extraneous. If that was your only solution, there is no solution."

          "$5$",
          "$6$",
          "$7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since denominators are equal, $x+1 = 6$, so $x=5$. But $x=5$ makes the denominator zero. Therefore, there is no solution."

          "$1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$3$ subtracted from both sides: $2/x = 4$. Multiply by $x$: $2 = 4x$. Divide by 4: $x = 0.5$."
