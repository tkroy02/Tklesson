    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the probability of rolling a 5 on a standard 6-sided die?",
        "options": [
          "1/6",
          "1/2",
          "5/6",
          "1/5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There is one '5' on the die out of six possible total outcomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the probability of an event occurring is 0.35, what is the probability of the event NOT occurring (the complement)?",
        "options": [
          "0.65",
          "0.35",
          "1.35",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sum of the probability of an event and its complement is always 1. $1 - 0.35 = 0.65$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bag contains 3 red marbles, 2 blue marbles, and 5 green marbles. What is the probability of picking a blue marble?",
        "options": [
          "1/5",
          "2/8",
          "1/2",
          "2/3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total marbles = $3 + 2 + 5 = 10$. Probability of blue = $2/10 = 1/5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following values could NOT represent a probability?",
        "options": [
          "1.2",
          "0",
          "1",
          "1/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Probabilities must be between 0 and 1 inclusive. 1.2 is impossible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the sample space for flipping two coins?",
        "options": [
          "{HH, HT, TH, TT}",
          "{H, T}",
          "{HH, TT}",
          "{HH, HT, TT}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each coin has two sides, so $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ total combinations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An event that is 'Certain' has a probability of:",
        "options": [
          "1",
          "0",
          "0.5",
          "100"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A probability of 1 (or 100%) means the event is guaranteed to happen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing a Heart?",
        "options": [
          "1/4",
          "1/13",
          "1/52",
          "1/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are 13 Hearts in a deck of 52. $13/52 = 1/4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the probability of rolling an even number on a standard die?",

          "1/2",
          "1/3",
          "1/6",
          "2/3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. That is 3 outcomes out of 6, which simplifies to 1/2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you roll a die 60 times, how many times would you 'expect' to roll a 3?",
        "options": [
          "10",
          "1",
          "6",
          "20"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expected value = $P(E) \\cdot \\text{trials} = (1/6) \\cdot 60 = 10$."

          "Probability Distribution",
          "Population"
