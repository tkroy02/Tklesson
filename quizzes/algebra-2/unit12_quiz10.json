      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile's range is given by $R = \\frac{v^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}$. If $v^2/g = 100$, at what smallest positive angle $\\theta$ (in degrees) will the range be 50?",
        "options": [
          "15°",
          "30°",
          "45°",
          "7.5°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $50 = 100 \\sin(2\\theta)$, which simplifies to $\\sin(2\\theta) = 0.5$. Thus $2\\theta = 30°$, leading to $\\theta = 15°$."

          "6",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $4 = 4 \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t) + 6$. Subtract 6 and divide by 4 to get $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t) = -0.5$. The earliest solution is $\\frac{\\pi}{6}t = 2\\pi/3$, so $t = 4$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$15 = 30 \\sin(120\\pi t) \\implies \\sin(120\\pi t) = 0.5$. The first solution is $120\\pi t = \\pi/6$. Dividing by $120\\pi$ gives $t = 1/720$."

        "explanation": "$700 = 500 + 200 \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t) \\implies 200 = 200 \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t) \\implies \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t) = 1$. This occurs when $\\frac{\\pi}{6}t = \\pi/2$, so $t = 3$."
