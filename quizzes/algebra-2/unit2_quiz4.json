        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $D = b^2 - 4ac$: $(-8)^2 - 4(1)(16) = 64 - 64 = 0$."

          "Two complex (imaginary) roots"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $25$ is positive and a perfect square, the roots are real, distinct, and rational."

        "question": "Which of the following discriminants indicates that an equation has two complex (imaginary) solutions?",

        "explanation": "When $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, the quadratic formula simplifies to a single value, representing one repeated root."

          "$\\pm 3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $D = 0$: $k^2 - 4(1)(9) = 0 \\Rightarrow k^2 = 36 \\Rightarrow k = \\pm 6$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$17$ is positive but not a perfect square, so the roots are real and irrational."

          "The object never reaches the ground",
          "The object hits the ground twice",
          "The object hits the ground once",
          "The object is moving at an imaginary speed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $D < 0$, there are no real roots ($x$-intercepts), meaning the height never reaches zero."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The cost of production is $C = x^2 - 4x + 10$. If we want to find where cost is \\$ $0$, the discriminant tells us there are how many real solutions?",
