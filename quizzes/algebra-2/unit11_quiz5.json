    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the period of the parent function $y = \\sin(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$2\\pi$",
          "$\\pi$",
          "$\\pi/2$",
          "$4\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A full cycle of the sine function occurs once every $2\\pi$ radians (or 360 degrees)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the amplitude of the function $y = 3\\cos(x)$?",

          "$2\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient $a$ in $y = a\\cos(x)$. Here, it is 3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following points is the y-intercept of the parent cosine function $y = \\cos(x)$?",

          "(0, 0)",
          "(1, 0)",
          "(0, -1)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\cos(0) = 1$, the graph of the parent cosine function begins at its maximum point on the y-axis."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A graphing app costs $\\$5$ and shows that the range of the parent sine function is:",
  "options": [
    "$[-1, 1]$",
    "$(0, 1)$",
    "$[-2\\pi, 2\\pi]$",
    "All real numbers"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The parent sine function $y = \\sin(x)$ oscillates between a minimum value of $-1$ and a maximum value of $1$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amplitude is always a positive distance. $|-4| = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the period of a sinusoidal function is $\\pi$, how many full cycles are completed between $0$ and $2\\pi$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "0.5",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If one cycle takes $\\pi$, then two cycles will fit into a $2\\pi$ interval."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At which of the following values does the parent sine function $y = \\sin(x)$ cross the x-axis?",
        "options": [
          "$\\pi$",
          "$\\pi/2$",
          "$\\pi/4$",
          "$\\pi/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sine is zero at $0, \\pi, 2\\pi$, etc. Therefore, it crosses the x-axis at $\\pi$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student pays \\$15 for a textbook that defines the 'midline' of a trig graph. What is the midline of the parent function $y = \\cos(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "y = 0",
          "y = 1",
          "x = 0",
          "y = -1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The midline is the horizontal axis around which the graph oscillates. For the parent function, this is the x-axis ($y = 0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the maximum value of the function $y = 5\\sin(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "1",
          "10",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The maximum value is the midline (0) plus the amplitude (5)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which function has the same graph as $y = \\sin(x)$ but shifted $\\pi/2$ units to the left?",

          "$y = \\cos(x)$",
          "$y = -\\sin(x)$",
          "$y = -\\cos(x)$",
          "$y = \\tan(x)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sine and Cosine are 'co-functions.' Shifting the sine graph left by 90 degrees ($\\pi/2$) aligns it perfectly with the cosine graph."
