      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When verifying an identity, which of the following is a 'legal' first step?",
        "options": [
          "Working on only one side of the equation to simplify it.",
          "Adding the same term to both sides of the equation.",
          "Cross-multiplying the two sides of the equation.",
          "Squaring both sides of the equation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Verifying is different from solving. You must treat each side independently to show they are equivalent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To simplify $\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} + \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}$, what is the most logical next step?",
        "options": [
          "Find a common denominator of $\\sin x \\cos x$.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Finding a common denominator results in $(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x) / (\\sin x \\cos x)$, which simplifies to $1 / (\\sin x \\cos x)$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distribute: $\\cos x \\sec x - \\cos^2 x$. Since $\\cos x \\sec x = 1$, the expression becomes $1 - \\cos^2 x$, which is $\\sin^2 x$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by the conjugate ($1 + \\sin x$) creates $1 - \\sin^2 x$ in the denominator, which can be simplified to $\\cos^2 x$."
