      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the probability of flipping a coin and getting Heads, AND THEN rolling a 6 on a die?",
        "options": [
          "$1/12$",
          "$1/8$",
          "$2/3$",
          "$1/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P(H) = 1/2$ and $P(6) = 1/6$. Since they are independent, multiply: $1/2 \\cdot 1/6 = 1/12$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P(\\text{1st Red}) = 5/10$. After keeping it, 4 reds and 9 total remain. $P(\\text{2nd Red}) = 4/9$. $5/10 \\cdot 4/9 = 20/90 = 2/9$."
