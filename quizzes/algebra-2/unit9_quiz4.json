    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula is used to calculate the probability of two independent events $A$ and $B$ both occurring?",
        "options": [
          "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)$",
          "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) + P(B)$",
          "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)$",
          "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) / P(B)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For independent events, the occurrence of one does not affect the other, so we simply multiply their individual probabilities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bag contains 5 red marbles and 3 blue marbles. You pick two marbles without replacement. What is the probability that both are red?",

          "5/14",
          "25/64",
          "5/8",
          "15/56"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First draw: $5/8$. Second draw: $4/7$. Multiplication: $(5/8) \\cdot (4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14$."
      },

          "1/6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are independent events. $P(\text{Tails}) = 1/2$ and $P(4) = 1/6$. $(1/2) \\cdot (1/6) = 1/12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What defines 'dependent events' in probability?",
        "options": [
          "The outcome of the first event affects the probability of the second event",
          "The outcomes of both events are always the same",
          "The events cannot happen at the same time",
          "The probability of the second event is always zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Events are dependent if the 'given' condition of the first event changes the sample space or odds for the second."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With replacement, events are independent. $(4/52) \\cdot (4/52) = (1/13) \\cdot (1/13) = 1/169$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "1/3",
          "4/36"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is without replacement. $(2/6) \\cdot (1/5) = 2/30 = 1/15$."

          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
