    "topic": "Independent and Dependent Events",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What is the probability of flipping a coin and getting Heads AND rolling a 6 on a die?",
  "options": [
    "$1/12$",
    "$1/8$",
    "$2/3$",
    "$1/2$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The events are independent. $P(H) = 1/2$ and $P(6) = 1/6$. Multiply: $1/2 \\cdot 1/6 = 1/12$."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A bag contains 5 red and 5 blue marbles. You pick one marble and keep it (no replacement), then pick a second. What is the probability of Red AND then Red?",
  "options": [
    "$2/9$",
    "$1/4$",
    "$1/2$",
    "$1/5$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "$P(\\text{1st Red}) = 5/10$. After removal, $P(\\text{2nd Red}) = 4/9$. Multiply: $5/10 \\cdot 4/9 = 2/9$."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If $P(A) = 0.3$ and $P(B|A) = 0.8$, what is $P(A \\cap B)$?",
  "options": [
    "$0.24$",
    "$1.1$",
    "$0.5$",
    "$0.375$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Use the multiplication rule: $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A) = 0.3 \\cdot 0.8 = 0.24$."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "You flip a fair coin 3 times. What is the probability of getting Heads all three times?",
  "options": [
    "$1/8$",
    "$1/3$",
    "$1/6$",
    "$1/2$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Each flip is independent: $1/2 \\cdot 1/2 \\cdot 1/2 = 1/8$."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "From a 52-card deck, two cards are drawn without replacement. What is the probability both are Aces?",
  "options": [
    "$1/221$",
    "$1/169$",
    "$1/26$",
    "$4/52$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "$P(1st\\ Ace) = 4/52$, $P(2nd\\ Ace) = 3/51$. Multiply: $(4/52)(3/51) = 1/221$."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If two cards are drawn WITH replacement, what is the probability both are Aces?",
  "options": [
    "$1/169$",
    "$1/221$",
    "$2/13$",
    "$1/13$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "With replacement, probabilities reset: $(4/52)^2 = (1/13)^2 = 1/169$."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The multiplication rule is used to find the probability of the ______ of two events.",
  "options": [
    "Intersection (AND)",
    "Union (OR)",
    "Complement (NOT)",
    "Difference"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The multiplication rule finds $P(A \\cap B)$, meaning both events occur."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A forecast says there is a 60% chance of rain and a 20% chance of a power outage if it rains. What is the probability it rains AND the power goes out?",
  "options": [
    "$12\\%$",
    "$80\\%$",
    "$40\\%$",
    "$30\\%$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Multiply: $0.60 \\cdot 0.20 = 0.12 = 12\\%$."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If events A and B are independent, then $P(B|A)$ is equal to:",
  "options": [
    "$P(B)$",
    "$P(A)$",
    "$P(A) + P(B)$",
    "$0$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Independence means one event does not affect the other."
},
{
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What is the probability of rolling two dice and getting snake eyes (double 1)?",
  "options": [
    "$1/36$",
    "$1/6$",
    "$1/12$",
    "$2/36$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Each die has a $1/6$ chance of rolling a 1. Multiply: $1/6 \\cdot 1/6 = 1/36$."
