    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general multiplication rule for probability?",
        "options": [
          "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)$",
          "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) + P(B)$",
          "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)$",
          "$P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The general rule accounts for both independent and dependent events. For independent events, it simplifies to $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two events are independent if:",
        "options": [
          "The occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other",
          "They cannot occur at the same time",
          "Their probabilities add up to 1",
          "They have the same probability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Events A and B are independent if $P(A|B) = P(A)$ or equivalently $P(B|A) = P(B)$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are independent events. $P(\\text{Heads}) = 1/2$, $P(4) = 1/6$. Multiply: $(1/2) \\cdot (1/6) = 1/12$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dependent events. $P(\\text{Red first}) = 3/5$. Then $P(\\text{Blue second}|\\text{Red first}) = 2/4 = 1/2$. Multiply: $(3/5) \\cdot (1/2) = 3/10$."

          "0.35"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For independent events, multiply: $0.3 \\times 0.5 = 0.15$."

          "9/25"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With replacement makes them independent. $P(\\text{Red}) = 3/5$, $P(\\text{Blue}) = 2/5$. Multiply: $(3/5) \\cdot (2/5) = 6/25$."

          "Flipping a coin twice",
          "Rolling two dice",
          "Spinning two different spinners"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without replacement changes the composition of the deck for the second draw, affecting the probability."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time, so their intersection has probability 0."
