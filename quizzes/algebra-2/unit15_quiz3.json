    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the constant difference definition of a hyperbola?",
        "options": [
          "The absolute difference of the distances from any point on the curve to the two foci is constant.",
          "The sum of the distances from any point on the curve to the two foci is constant.",
          "The distance to a single focus is always zero.",
          "The product of the distances to the foci is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For any point on a hyperbola, $|d_1 - d_2| = 2a$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $\\frac{x^2}{9} - \\frac{y^2}{16} = 1$, which way do the branches open?",
        "options": [
          "Left and Right",
          "Up and Down",
          "Only to the Right",
          "In a circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the $x^2$ term is positive, the transverse axis is horizontal, so it opens left and right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the center of the hyperbola $\\frac{(y - 5)^2}{4} - \\frac{(x + 3)^2}{25} = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "(-3, 5)",
          "(5, -3)",
          "(3, -5)",
          "(-5, 3)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Careful with the order! $h$ is always with $x$ and $k$ is always with $y$. $h = -3, k = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$, find the distance to the foci if $a^2 = 9$ and $b^2 = 16$.",

          "5",
          "7",
          "25",
          "2.6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$c^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$, so $c = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the equations of the asymptotes for $x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1$ (centered at the origin)?",
        "options": [
          "y = \\pm (b/a)x",
          "y = \\pm (a/b)x",
          "y = x",
          "y = \\pm abx"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a horizontal hyperbola, the slope of the asymptotes is Rise/Run, which is $b/a$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the length of the 'Transverse Axis' for the hyperbola $\\frac{y^2}{64} - \\frac{x^2}{36} = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "16",
          "8",
          "12",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The positive term has $a^2 = 64$, so $a = 8$. The transverse axis length is $2a = 16$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these features distinguishes a hyperbola's equation from an ellipse's equation?",
        "options": [
          "The terms are subtracted rather than added.",
          "The denominators must be equal.",
          "It uses a focus and a directrix.",
          "It is not a conic section."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An ellipse uses addition ($+$); a hyperbola uses subtraction ($-$). This 'minus' is what creates the two separate branches."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a hyperbola opens Up and Down, which term in the standard form must be positive?",
        "options": [
          "The y term",
          "The x term",
          "The constant term",
          "Both x and y"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The direction of opening follows the variable in the positive fraction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the vertices of $\\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{9} = 1$.",

          "(\\pm 2, 0)",
          "(0, \\pm 3)",
          "(\\pm 4, 0)",
          "(0, \\pm 9)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $x^2$ term is positive, so vertices are on the x-axis. $a^2 = 4$, so $a = 2$. Vertices are at $(\\pm 2, 0)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the eccentricity of a hyperbola?",

          "e > 1",
          "e = 1",
          "0 < e < 1",
          "e = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For hyperbolas, $c$ is always greater than $a$, so the ratio $e = c/a$ is always greater than 1."
