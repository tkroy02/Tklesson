      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, what does the value $r$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The distance from the origin (the pole).",
          "The angle in radians.",
          "The x-coordinate.",
          "The slope of the line."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The variable $r$ is the radius, or the distance from the center point to the coordinate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct formula to convert a polar radius to a rectangular x-coordinate?",
        "options": [
          "x = r \\cos \\theta",
          "x = r \\sin \\theta",
          "x = r^2",
          "x = \\tan \\theta"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using right-triangle trigonometry, the adjacent side (x) is found using the cosine of the angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the rectangular equivalent of the polar point $(5, \\pi)$?",
        "options": [
          "(-5, 0)",
          "(5, 0)",
          "(0, 5)",
          "(0, -5)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $\\pi$ (180 degrees), the point is on the negative x-axis. $x = 5 \\cos(\\pi) = -5$, $y = 5 \\sin(\\pi) = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the rectangular form of the polar equation $r = 4$?",
        "options": [
          "x^2 + y^2 = 16",
          "x^2 + y^2 = 4",
          "x = 4",
          "y = 4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$, and $r = 4$, then $x^2 + y^2 = 4^2$, which is 16."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many different polar coordinates can represent the same physical point in the plane?",
        "options": [
          "Infinitely many",
          "Only one",
          "Exactly two",
          "Four"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because you can add $2\\pi$ (full rotations) to the angle or use a negative radius, the same point has unlimited representations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Convert the rectangular point $(1, 1)$ to polar coordinates.",
        "options": [
          "(\\sqrt{2}, 45^{\\circ})",
          "(1, 45^{\\circ})",
          "(2, 90^{\\circ})",
          "(\\sqrt{2}, 90^{\\circ})"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$r = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$. $\\tan \\theta = 1/1$, so $\\theta = 45^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the polar equation $\\theta = \\pi/4$ look like when graphed?",
        "options": [
          "A straight line through the origin.",
          "A circle with radius 4.",
          "A vertical line at x = 4.",
          "A spiral."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the angle is fixed but the radius can be anything, it creates a line passing through the pole at that specific angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To convert the equation $r = 2 \\sec \\theta$ to rectangular form, which step is most helpful?",
        "options": [
          "Rewrite as r = 2/\\cos \\theta and multiply both sides by \\cos \\theta.",
          "Square both sides.",
          "Replace r with x + y.",
          "Divide by \\pi."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$r \\cos \\theta = 2$ simplifies directly to the rectangular equation $x = 2$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which shape is described by the polar equation $r = 3 \\sin \\theta$?",

          "A circle",
          "A line",
          "A square",
          "A parabola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by $r$ gives $r^2 = 3r \\sin \\theta$, which is $x^2 + y^2 = 3y$. This is a circle shifted off the origin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a radius $r$ is negative, how do you plot the point?",
        "options": [
          "Plot the angle $\\theta$, then move $r$ units in the opposite direction.",
          "Plot the point in the negative x-direction only.",
          "The point cannot be plotted; it is imaginary.",
          "Rotate the paper 180 degrees."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative radius means you move 'backwards' through the origin from the terminal side of the angle."
