    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the vertical position equation $y = -16t^2 + (v_0 \\sin \\theta)t + h_0$, what does the value -16 represent?",
        "options": [
          "Half the acceleration due to gravity in feet per second squared.",
          "The initial horizontal velocity.",
          "The height of the projectile at t = 1.",
          "The angle of the launch."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity is approximately $32 \\text{ ft/s}^2$. The formula uses $\\frac{1}{2}g$, which is $16$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which parametric equation determines how far a projectile travels horizontally?",
        "options": [
          "x = (v_0 \\cos \\theta)t",
          "x = (v_0 \\sin \\theta)t",
          "x = -16t^2 + h_0",
          "x = v_0 t^2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal distance is the horizontal component of velocity ($v_0 \\cos \\theta$) multiplied by time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is launched from the ground ($h_0 = 0$). How can you find the time the ball hits the ground using the parametric equations?",
        "options": [
          "Set the vertical equation y = 0 and solve for t.",
          "Set the horizontal equation x = 0 and solve for t.",
          "Set t = 0.",
          "Multiply x and y together."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the ball hits the ground, its height (y) is zero. Solving for t in the y-equation tells you the duration of the flight."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a projectile is launched horizontally (angle $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$), what is the vertical component of the initial velocity ($v_0 \\sin \\theta$)?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "v_0",
          "1",
          "-16"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\sin(0^{\\circ}) = 0$, there is no initial upward or downward velocity; the object starts falling from rest vertically."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the shape of the path (trajectory) of any projectile modeled by these equations?",

          "Hyperbola",
          "Straight line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By eliminating the parameter t, you get a quadratic equation in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, which is a parabola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of $100 \\text{ ft/s}$ at an angle of $30^{\\circ}$. What is the horizontal equation?",
        "options": [
          "x = 100 \\cos(30^{\\circ})t",
          "x = 100 \\sin(30^{\\circ})t",
          "x = 30 \\cos(100)t",
          "x = -16t^2 + 100t"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the initial velocity ($v_0$) affect the projectile's path?",
        "options": [
          "It increases both the maximum height and the horizontal distance.",
          "It only increases the horizontal distance.",
          "It only increases the maximum height.",
          "It makes the flight time shorter."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A higher $v_0$ increases both the $x$ and $y$ components of motion, leading to a higher and further flight."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what point in the flight is the vertical velocity of the projectile equal to zero?",
        "options": [
          "At the maximum height (peak).",
          "At the moment of launch.",
          "When it hits the ground.",
          "It is never zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the very top of the arc, the projectile stops moving up and is about to start moving down; its vertical speed is momentarily zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to find the horizontal distance the ball traveled when it hit the ground, what is the correct two-step process?",
        "options": [
          "Solve for t when y = 0, then plug that t into the x equation.",
          "Solve for t when x = 0, then plug that t into the y equation.",
          "Set x = y and solve for t.",
          "Divide the y equation by the x equation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'time of flight' is found via the height (y), and then that time is used to see how far it moved horizontally (x)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the vertical equation, what does $h_0$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The initial height from which the object is launched.",
          "The horizontal distance to the target.",
          "The time it takes to reach the peak.",
          "The force of air resistance."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $t = 0$, $y$ simplifies to $h_0$, which is the starting altitude of the projectile."
