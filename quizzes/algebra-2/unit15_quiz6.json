          "The Bxy term",
          "The Ax^2 term",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on a discriminant of -3, what type of conic is $x^2 + xy + y^2 - 4 = 0$?",

          "Ellipse",
          "Parabola",
          "Hyperbola",
          "Two intersecting lines"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative discriminant ($B^2 - 4AC < 0$) indicates an elliptical shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the discriminant for the equation $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + 5x = 0$?",

          "20"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A=1, B=-4, C=4. Discriminant: $(-4)^2 - 4(1)(4) = 16 - 16 = 0$."

          "Parabola",
          "Circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Discriminant: $6^2 - 4(2)(1) = 36 - 8 = 28$. Since $28 > 0$, it is a hyperbola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula is used to find the angle of rotation $\\theta$ needed to eliminate the $xy$ term?",
        "options": [
          "\\cot(2\\theta) = (A - C) / B",
          "\\tan(\\theta) = B / (A + C)",
          "\\sin(2\\theta) = B^2 - 4AC",
          "\\cos(\\theta) = A / C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The standard cotangent formula allows mathematicians to solve for the specific angle that aligns the conic with the x and y axes."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $A = C$ in a rotated conic equation, what is the value of $\\cot(2\\theta)$?",

          "0",
          "1",
          "Undefined",
          "B"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $A = C$, the numerator $(A - C)$ is 0. $\\cot(2\\theta) = 0$ means $2\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$, so $\\theta = 45^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A circle can have a $Bxy$ term with $B \\neq 0$.",

          "False",
          "True",
          "Only if it is a very large circle",
          "Only if the center is at the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because a circle looks the same from every angle, rotating it does not change its equation to include an $xy$ term. If $B \\neq 0$, the shape is an ellipse, not a circle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When $B^2 - 4AC = 0$ in a rotated equation, the shape is a:",

          "Ellipse",
          "Circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like in the non-rotated versions, a zero discriminant signifies a parabola."

        "question": "The process of removing the $Bxy$ term involves which mathematical technique?",

          "Rotation of Axes",
          "Translation of the Origin",
          "Completing the Square",
          "Matrix Inversion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rotation of Axes uses trigonometric substitutions to transform the coordinate system so that the new 'x' and 'y' are parallel to the conic's axes."
