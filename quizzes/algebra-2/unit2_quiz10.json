    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in solving the quadratic inequality $x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0$ algebraically?",
        "options": [
          "Find the roots of the related equation $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$",
          "Plug in $x = 0$ to see if it works",
          "Divide the entire inequality by $x$",
          "Change the 'greater than' sign to 'less than'"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To solve an inequality, you must first find the 'critical values' by solving the corresponding quadratic equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the inequality $x^2 - 9 \\le 0$.",
        "options": [
          "$-3 \\le x \\le 3$",
          "$x \\le -3$ or $x \\ge 3$",
          "$x \\le 9$",
          "$-9 \\le x \\le 9$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The roots are $x = \\pm 3$. Testing the interval between them (like $x=0$) gives $0-9 \\le 0$, which is true. Thus, the solution is the interval between the roots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the inequality $x^2 + 4x - 5 > 0$, the critical values are $x = -5$ and $x = 1$. Which test point would determine the behavior of the interval between the roots?",
        "options": [
          "$x = 0$",
          "$x = -6$",
          "$x = 2$",
          "$x = 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any value between $-5$ and $1$ can be used as a test point; $0$ is the most convenient choice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $x^2 - 6x + 8 > 0$.",
        "options": [
          "$x < 2$ or $x > 4$",
          "$2 < x < 4$",
          "$x \\le 2$ or $x \\ge 4$",
          "$x > 8$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Roots are $x=2$ and $x=4$. Testing $x=3$ (between) gives $9-18+8 = -1$, which is NOT $>0$. Therefore, we choose the outer intervals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a quadratic inequality $ax^2 + bx + c < 0$ has a positive leading coefficient ($a > 0$) and two real roots, where will the solutions generally lie?",
        "options": [
          "Between the two roots",
          "Outside the two roots",
          "Only at the roots",
          "There are no solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An upward-opening parabola is below the x-axis (negative) between its two intercepts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $(x - 1)(x + 7) \\le 0$.",
        "options": [
          "$-7 \\le x \\le 1$",
          "$x \\le -7$ or $x \\ge 1$",
          "$x \\le 1$",
          "$-1 \\le x \\le 7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Roots are $1$ and $-7$. Testing $x=0$ gives $(-1)(7) = -7$, which is $\\le 0$. This confirms the interval between the roots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the solution to $x^2 + 1 < 0$?",
        "options": [
          "No real solution",
          "All real numbers",
          "$x < \\pm i$",
          "$x < -1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $x^2$ is always at least $0$, $x^2 + 1$ is always at least $1$. It can never be less than $0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $x^2 - 4x \\ge 0$.",
        "options": [
          "$x \\le 0$ or $x \\ge 4$",
          "$0 \\le x \\le 4$",
          "$x \\ge 4$",
          "$x \\le 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor to $x(x-4) \\ge 0$. Roots are $0$ and $4$. Testing $x=1$ gives $1-4 = -3$, which is NOT $\\ge 0$. So, we take the outer intervals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A business profit model is $P = -x^2 + 10x - 16$. For what values of $x$ is the company making a profit ($P > 0$)?",
        "options": [
          "$2 < x < 8$",
          "$x < 2$ or $x > 8$",
          "$x = 2, 8$",
          "$x < 10$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Roots are $2$ and $8$. Since $a$ is negative, the parabola opens downward and is positive (above the x-axis) between the roots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving $x^2 + 2x + 1 > 0$, notice the expression is $(x+1)^2$. What is the solution?",
        "options": [
          "All real numbers except $x = -1$",
          "All real numbers",
          "$x > -1$",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A square is always $\\ge 0$. It is only equal to $0$ at $x = -1$. Since the inequality is strictly 'greater than', we must exclude the root itself."
