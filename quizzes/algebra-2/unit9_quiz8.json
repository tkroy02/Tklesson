      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A club has 10 members. If a President, Vice President, and Secretary are chosen at random, what is the probability that Sarah, Mike, and Jen are chosen for these specific roles in that exact order?",
        "options": [
          "$1/720$",

          "$1/1,000$",
          "$3/10$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since roles are specific, order matters (Permutation). Total outcomes: $P(10, 3) = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720$. Only 1 specific arrangement fits the criteria, so the probability is $1/720$."
      },

          "$3/10$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a combination (order doesn't matter). Total ways to pick 3: $C(10, 3) = 120$. Ways to pick 3 red: $C(6, 3) = 20$. Probability: $20/120 = 1/6$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Order doesn't matter. Total ways: $C(8, 2) = (8 \\times 7) / 2 = 28$. There is only 1 way to pick the specific pair of shortest books. Probability: $1/28$."
