    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Classifying conics using coefficients A and C",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the conic section: $3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6x + 4y - 10 = 0$",
        "options": [
          "Circle",
          "Ellipse",
          "Hyperbola",
          "Parabola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ are exactly the same (both are 3), the shape is a circle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the conic section: $y^2 - 4x + 2y + 5 = 0$",
        "options": [
          "Parabola",
          "Circle",
          "Ellipse",
          "Hyperbola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only the $y$ term is squared; there is no $x^2$ term. This is the hallmark of a parabola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the conic section: $4x^2 - 9y^2 + 32x - 18y + 37 = 0$",
        "options": [
          "Hyperbola",
          "Ellipse",
          "Circle",
          "Parabola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficients $4$ and $-9$ have opposite signs. This subtraction relationship defines a hyperbola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the conic section: $2x^2 + 5y^2 + 8x - 20y + 1 = 0$",
        "options": [
          "Ellipse",
          "Circle",
          "Hyperbola",
          "Parabola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficients $2$ and $5$ are different but both positive. This 'uneven' stretching creates an ellipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the discriminant ($B^2 - 4AC$) of a general equation is negative, and $B=0$, what are the possibilities for the conic?",
        "options": [
          "Circle or Ellipse",
          "Parabola only",
          "Hyperbola only",
          "A straight line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative discriminant indicates an ellipse-like shape. If $A=C$ it's a circle; otherwise, it's an ellipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of the discriminant $B^2 - 4AC$ for a parabola?",
        "options": [
          "Exactly 0",
          "Greater than 0",
          "Less than 0",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For parabolas, the discriminant is always zero because one of the squared coefficients is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which conic is represented by $x^2 + y^2 = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "A point (Degenerate Circle)",
          "A tiny circle",
          "A parabola",
          "An empty set"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a degenerate case. The only point that satisfies $0^2 + 0^2 = 0$ is the origin $(0,0)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the conic: $x^2 - y^2 = 0$",
        "options": [
          "Two intersecting lines (Degenerate Hyperbola)",
          "A circle",
          "A parabola",
          "An ellipse"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factoring gives $(x-y)(x+y)=0$, which represents the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $Ax^2 + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, what happens if $A$ and $C$ are both negative?",
        "options": [
          "It is an ellipse (or circle) if $F$ allows for real points.",
          "It is automatically a hyperbola because of the negative signs.",
          "It is a parabola opening downward.",
          "It is not a valid mathematical equation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $A$ and $C$ have the same sign (even if both are negative), it's an ellipse. You could multiply the whole equation by $-1$ to make them both positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the conic: $16x^2 + 16y^2 + 96x - 64y + 1 = 0$",
        "options": [
          "Circle",
          "Ellipse",
          "Hyperbola",
          "Parabola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both $x^2$ and $y^2$ share the coefficient $16$. Therefore, it is a circle."
