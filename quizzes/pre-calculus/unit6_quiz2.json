    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary goal of the first step in solving a 3x3 system?",
        "options": [
          "Eliminate one variable to create a 2x2 system.",
          "Solve for x immediately.",
          "Multiply all three equations together.",
          "Graph the three planes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By eliminating the same variable from two different pairs of equations, you reduce the complexity from three variables down to two."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Geometrically, what does a single linear equation in a 3x3 system represent?",
        "options": [
          "A plane",
          "A line",
          "A point",
          "A sphere"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In three-dimensional space, the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ satisfying a linear equation forms a flat surface called a plane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are solving a 3x3 system and end up with the statement $0 = 0$, what does this mean?",
        "options": [
          "The system has infinite solutions.",
          "The system has no solution.",
          "The solution is $(0, 0, 0)$.",
          "One of the variables must be zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An identity like $0 = 0$ indicates that the equations are dependent, meaning the planes intersect along a line or are the same plane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you eliminate $z$ from Equations 1 and 2, which variable must you eliminate from Equations 2 and 3?",
        "options": [
          "z",
          "x",
          "y",
          "Any of them"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must eliminate the same variable from both pairs to ensure your resulting 2x2 system contains the same two variables."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the simple system: \n$x = 2$\n$x + y = 5$\n$x + y + z = 10$",
        "options": [
          "$(2, 3, 5)$",
          "$(2, 5, 10)$",
          "$(2, 7, 1)$",
          "$(2, 3, 10)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitute $x=2$ into Eq 2: $2+y=5 \\implies y=3$. Substitute both into Eq 3: $2+3+z=10 \\implies z=5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of three planes being parallel to one another?",
        "options": [
          "No solution",
          "One solution",
          "Infinite solutions",
          "Three solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the planes are parallel and distinct, they never intersect, so there is no point that satisfies all three equations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the system: \n$x - y + z = 4$\n$x + 3y - z = 10$\nWhat is the easiest variable to eliminate first?",

          "z",
          "x",
          "y",
          "None are easy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $z$ and $-z$ have coefficients of $1$ and $-1$, simply adding the equations will eliminate $z$ immediately."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A 3x3 system can have exactly two solutions.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like 2x2 systems, linear systems can have zero, one, or infinitely many solutions, but never a finite number greater than one."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many coordinates are in the solution to a 3x3 system?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The solution is an ordered triple representing a single point in 3D space."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'back-substitution'?",
        "options": [
          "Plugging known values into earlier equations to find remaining variables.",
          "Replacing $x$ with $y$.",
          "Checking the answer by plugging it into a calculator.",
          "Subtracting the bottom equation from the top."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once you find one variable, you 'work backward' through your simplified equations to find the others."
