    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Finding points of intersection",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might algebra fail to find all intersection points of two polar curves?",
        "options": [
          "Points have multiple names in polar coordinates.",
          "Polar equations cannot be solved algebraically.",
          "The curves are too complex for calculators.",
          "The pole is not a real point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because a point like (0,0) or (1, 0) can be represented by different (r, θ) pairs, the equations might not equal each other at the same coordinate name."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the intersection points of r = 2 and r = 4 sin θ.",
        "options": [
          "30° and 150°",
          "45° and 135°",
          "60° and 120°",
          "0° and 180°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set 2 = 4 sin θ. Then sin θ = 1/2. This occurs at θ = 30° and θ = 150°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you check if the pole is an intersection point?",
        "options": [
          "Set r = 0 for both equations and see if there is a solution for θ.",
          "Check if both equations have the same a-value.",
          "Set θ = 0 and solve for r.",
          "The pole is always an intersection point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If both curves pass through the center (r = 0), they intersect at the pole, even if they reach it at different angles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what values of θ do r = cos θ and r = sin θ intersect (other than the pole)?",
        "options": [
          "π/4 and 5π/4",
          "π/2 and π",
          "0 and π/2",
          "π/3 and 2π/3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set cos θ = sin θ. Dividing by cos θ gives 1 = tan θ. This occurs at π/4 and 5π/4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many times does the circle r = 2 intersect the cardioid r = 2 + 2 cos θ?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set 2 = 2 + 2 cos θ. Then 0 = 2 cos θ, so cos θ = 0. This happens at 90° and 270°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving r = 1 + cos θ and r = 1 - cos θ, what is a likely intersection point?",
        "options": [
          "The Pole (0, θ)",
          "(1, 0)",
          "(2, π)",
          "There are no intersections"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Setting them equal: 1 + cos θ = 1 - cos θ → 2 cos θ = 0 → θ = π/2. At π/2, r = 1. However, both curves also pass through the pole (r=0) at different angles (π and 0)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Using a graphing calculator is a valid step in finding polar intersections.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Visual confirmation is essential in polar coordinates to ensure you haven't missed 'hidden' points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the intersection: r = 3 and r = 3 cos θ.",
        "options": [
          "(3, 0)",
          "(3, π/2)",
          "(0, 0)",
          "No intersection"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "3 = 3 cos θ means cos θ = 1, so θ = 0. The point is (3, 0)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The intersection of r = sin θ and r = cos θ forms how many distinct points on the graph?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "4",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "They intersect at the pole and at the point (√2/2, π/4)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If r = f(θ) and r = -f(θ + π), what can you say about the two graphs?",
        "options": [
          "They are the same graph.",
          "They never intersect.",
          "They only intersect at the pole.",
          "They are perpendicular."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because (-r, θ + π) is the same point as (r, θ), these two equations represent the exact same set of points."
