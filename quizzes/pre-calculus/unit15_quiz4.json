    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the notation $\\lim_{x \\to 5^+} f(x)$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The limit as $x$ approaches $5$ from the right.",
          "The limit as $x$ approaches $5$ from the left.",
          "The value of the function at $x = 5$.",
          "The limit as $x$ approaches positive infinity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The plus sign ($+$) indicates approaching from the positive side, which is the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A piecewise function is defined as $f(x) = x + 1$ for $x < 2$ and $f(x) = 5$ for $x \\ge 2$. Find $\\lim_{x \\to 2^-} f(x)$.",
        "options": [

          "$2$",
          "DNE"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The left-hand limit uses the part of the function where $x < 2$. Substitute $2$ into $x + 1$: $2 + 1 = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the same function ($f(x) = x + 1$ for $x < 2$ and $f(x) = 5$ for $x \\ge 2$), find $\\lim_{x \\to 2^+} f(x)$.",

          "$2$",
          "DNE"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The right-hand limit uses the part where $x > 2$. Since $f(x) = 5$ there, the limit is $5$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on the previous two questions, what is the value of $\\lim_{x \\to 2} f(x)$?",

          "$3$",
          "$5$",
          "$4$"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the left-hand limit ($3$) and the right-hand limit ($5$) are not equal, the general limit does not exist."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) = 10$ and $\\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) = 10$, what is $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$?",

          "$0$",
          "DNE"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the one-sided limits agree, the general limit exists and is equal to that same value."

          "Constant functions"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Step functions (like the greatest integer function) have jumps where the limit from the left differs from the limit from the right."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A function can have a right-hand limit even if it has a vertical asymptote.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. While we often say the limit is $\\infty$ (DNE), we can still describe the behavior from one side (e.g., $f(x) \\to \\infty$)."

          "DNE"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For $x < 0$, $|x| = -x$. So $\\frac{-x}{x} = -1$."

          "No",
          "Only if the point is defined elsewhere",
          "Only for polynomials"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Yes. At a hole, both sides lead to the same $y$-value, which is why the limit exists there."
