    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the matrix equation $AX = B$, what does the matrix $X$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "A column matrix containing the variables (x, y, etc.).",
          "The identity matrix.",
          "The constants on the right side of the equations.",
          "The coefficients of the variables."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "X is the 'solution vector' or 'variable matrix' that we are trying to solve for."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To solve $AX = B$ for $X$, which operation is correct?",
        "options": [
          "$X = A^{-1}B$",
          "$X = BA^{-1}$",
          "$X = B/A$",
          "$X = AB^{-1}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $A$ is on the left of $X$, we must multiply by $A^{-1}$ on the left side of both sides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the determinant of the coefficient matrix $A$ is 0, what can you conclude about using the inverse matrix method?",
        "options": [
          "The method cannot be used because $A^{-1}$ does not exist.",
          "The solution is $X = 0$.",
          "There are exactly two solutions.",
          "The method will still work if you use a calculator."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $|A| = 0$, the matrix is singular (non-invertible), meaning the system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a system of 3 equations with 3 variables, what are the dimensions of matrix $A$?",

          "$3 \\times 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix A contains the coefficients of the 3 variables across 3 equations, forming a square $3 \\times 3$ matrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The equation $X = A^{-1}B$ and $X = BA^{-1}$ will always give the same result.",

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix multiplication is not commutative. Only $A^{-1}B$ is the correct algebraic solution for $AX=B$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the constant matrix $B$ for the system: \n$2x + 3y = 5$\n$x - y = 4$",

          "$\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix B consists of the constants from the right-hand side of the equations."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $A^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, what is the solution $X$?",

          "$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(1)(5) + (2)(0) = 5$ for the top row; $(3)(5) + (4)(0) = 15$ for the bottom row."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the inverse matrix method often used in computer science or economics?",
        "options": [
          "It allows you to solve for different constant matrices (B) quickly once $A^{-1}$ is known.",
          "It is the only way to solve systems.",
          "It doesn't require any multiplication.",
          "It only works for very small matrices."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the coefficients (A) stay the same but the outputs (B) change, you only have to calculate $A^{-1}$ once and then perform simple multiplication."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $AX = B$ has a unique solution, what must be true about matrix $A$?",
        "options": [
          "It must be invertible (determinant $\\neq$ 0).",
          "It must be a zero matrix.",
          "It must have more rows than columns.",
          "It must be a $1 \\times 1$ matrix."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A unique solution exists if and only if $A$ is non-singular."
