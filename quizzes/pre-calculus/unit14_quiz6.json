    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in a proof by mathematical induction called?",

          "The Base Case",
          "The Inductive Step",
          "The Conclusion",
          "The Hypothesis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base case (usually $n = 1$) verifies that the statement holds at the very beginning."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the inductive step, what do we assume to be true?",
        "options": [
          "The statement is true for $n = k$.",
          "The statement is true for all $n$.",
          "The statement is true for $n = k + 1$.",
          "The statement is false for $n = k$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We assume the statement holds for $k$ to see if that logically forces it to hold for $k + 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the goal of the inductive step?",
        "options": [
          "To prove $P(k) \\rightarrow P(k + 1)$",
          "To prove $P(1)$ is true",
          "To prove $P(k)$ is true",
          "To show the statement is false"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Induction aims to show that if any 'domino' falls, the next one ($k + 1$) must also fall."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you prove a statement is true for $n = 1$ and $n = k \\rightarrow n = k + 1$, for which values of $n$ is it true?",
        "options": [
          "All positive integers $n \\ge 1$",
          "Only for $n = 1$ and $n = 2$",
          "Only for even integers",
          "Only for prime numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Induction creates a chain reaction that covers every positive integer starting from the base case."

          "$1 = 1$",
          "$1 = 3$",
          "$0 = 0$",
          "$1 = 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For $n = 1$, the left side is $1$ and the right side is $\\frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "A rolling snowball",
          "A balance scale",
          "A compass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dominoes represent how one true statement 'knocks down' or proves the next one in line."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can induction be used to prove inequalities?",

          "Yes",
          "No"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Yes, induction is frequently used to prove inequalities like $2^n > n$ for all $n \\ge 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the base case is $n = 5$, what range of integers does the proof cover?",
        "options": [
          "$n \\ge 5$",
          "All positive integers",
          "Only $n = 5$",
          "$n \\le 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The proof starts at the base case and moves upward. If it starts at $5$, it covers all integers from $5$ onward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if the base case is false?",
        "options": [
          "The entire proof fails.",
          "The inductive step can still prove it.",
          "It is only true for large $n$.",
          "The statement is still partially true."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the first domino doesn't fall, the chain reaction never starts. The statement is not proven."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Despite the name 'induction', it is a rigorous deductive method because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises."
