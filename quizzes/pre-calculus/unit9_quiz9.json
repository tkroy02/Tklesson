    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which identity would be most helpful to verify $\\frac{\\sin(2x)}{\\sin x} = 2\\cos x$?",

          "Double-Angle for Cosine",
          "Pythagorean Identity",
          "Sum-to-Product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replacing $\\sin(2x)$ with $2\\sin x \\cos x$ allows the $\\sin x$ terms to cancel, leaving $2\\cos x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are trying to verify an identity that involves $\\sin(x+y)$ and $\\sin(x-y)$, which toolkit should you use?",

          "sec x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $\\cos(2x) = 2\\cos^2 x - 1$, the numerator becomes $1 + 2\\cos^2 x - 1 = 2\\cos^2 x$. Dividing by $2\\cos x$ leaves $\\cos x$."

          "It's already in simplest form."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It factors into $(\\sin^2 x - \\cos^2 x)(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x)$. Since the second part is 1, it simplifies instantly to $\\sin^2 x - \\cos^2 x$ (which is $-\\cos(2x)$)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The identity $\\sin^2 x = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2x)}{2}$ can be used to prove that $2\\sin^2 x + \\cos(2x) = 1$.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rearranging the power-reducing formula gives $2\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos(2x)$. Adding $\\cos(2x)$ to both sides yields 1."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "One of the specific 'radical-free' versions of the tangent half-angle identity is $\\sin x / (1 + \\cos x)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rewriting results in $(\\cos^2 x / \\sin x) + \\sin x$. Finding a common denominator gives $(\\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x) / \\sin x$, which is $1 / \\sin x$ or $\\csc x$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When verifying $\\tan x \\sin x + \\cos x = \\sec x$, the common denominator for $\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x} + \\cos x$ is:",
