    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the notation $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = 2$ mean for the graph of $f$?",
        "options": [
          "There is a horizontal asymptote at $y = 2$.",
          "There is a vertical asymptote at $x = 2$.",
          "The y-intercept is $2$.",
          "The graph crosses the x-axis at $2$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A limit at infinity that equals a constant defines a horizontal asymptote."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{4x^2 - 1}{2x^2 + 5}$.",

          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For large $x$, the function behaves like $4x^2 / 2x^2$, which simplifies to 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = 0$, the function is:",
        "options": [
          "Bottom-heavy (degree of denominator > degree of numerator).",
          "Balanced (degrees are equal).",
          "Top-heavy (degree of numerator > degree of denominator).",
          "A constant function $f(x) = 0$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the denominator grows faster than the numerator, the fraction approaches zero as $x$ increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the limit of $f(x) = \\frac{x^3 + 2}{x^2 - 5}$ as $x \\to \\infty$?",

          "0",
          "1",
          "None"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the numerator has a higher degree, the values will continue to grow without bound."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which notation describes the graph of $f(x) = 1/x$ as it approaches the y-axis from the right?",

          "$\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $x$ gets closer to 0 from the positive side (like $0.1, 0.01$), the value of $1/x$ gets larger and larger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$, the function likely has:",

          "An oblique asymptote or no horizontal asymptote.",
          "A horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$.",
          "A horizontal asymptote at $y = 1$.",
          "A hole at the origin."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the limits are infinite, the function does not level off at a horizontal line."

        "question": "To find the limit as $x \\to \\infty$ of $\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, you can divide every term by:",
        "options": [
          "The highest power of $x$ found in the denominator.",
          "The constant term.",
          "The leading coefficient.",
          "The numerator."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a standard algebraic technique to evaluate limits at infinity; it turns terms into $1/x$ forms which go to zero."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: If $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L$, then $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ must also equal $L$ for a rational function.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For rational functions (unlike exponential functions), the horizontal asymptote is the same in both directions."

          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The degree of the denominator is higher, so the limit is 0."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A limit of the form $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = \\infty$ indicates the presence of a:",
