      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the goal of partial fraction decomposition?",
        "options": [
          "To break a complex rational expression into a sum of simpler fractions.",
          "To find the horizontal asymptote of a function.",
          "To multiply two rational expressions together.",
          "To find the x-intercepts of a polynomial."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It decomposes one large fraction into its constituent 'partial' fractions."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct setup for $\\frac{7x - 1}{(x - 3)(x + 2)}$?",

          "$\\frac{Ax + B}{(x - 3)(x + 2)}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the factors are distinct and linear, each gets a simple constant ($A$ or $B$) as a numerator."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After multiplying $\\frac{1}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \\frac{A}{x-1} + \\frac{B}{x+1}$ by the LCD, what is the resulting basic equation?",
        "options": [
          "$1 = A(x + 1) + B(x - 1)$",
          "$1 = A(x - 1) + B(x + 1)$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The denominator of each partial fraction cancels out its counterpart in the LCD, leaving the 'other' factor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $5x + 3 = A(x - 2) + B(x + 1)$, what $x$-value should you plug in to solve for $B$?",

          "$0$",
          "$3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Setting $x = 2$ makes the $A$ term zero ($2 - 2 = 0$), leaving only the $B$ term to solve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What $x$-value would you use to find $A$ in that same equation: $5x + 3 = A(x - 2) + B(x + 1)$?",

          "$-1$",
          "$2$",
          "$0$",
          "$-3/5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Setting $x = -1$ eliminates the $B$ term because $(-1 + 1 = 0)$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: You must always check if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator before starting decomposition.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the numerator is a higher degree (top-heavy), you must perform long division first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the denominator is $(x + 4)^2$, how many partial fractions will you have in the setup?",
        "options": [
          "2: one with $(x + 4)$ and one with $(x + 4)^2$",
          "1: just $(x + 4)^2$",
          "2: both with $(x + 4)$",
          "None"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Repeated factors require a fraction for every power of that factor from 1 up to the exponent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $A$ and $B$: $\\frac{1}{x(x+1)} = \\frac{A}{x} + \\frac{B}{x+1}$.",

          "$A = 0, B = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$1 = A(x+1) + Bx$. If $x=0$, $1=A(1) \\implies A=1$. If $x=-1$, $1=B(-1) \\implies B=-1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the alternative to picking $x$-values, where you set terms with $x$ equal to each other and constant terms equal to each other."
