      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a polynomial has a degree of 4, what is the maximum number of turning points it can have?",

          "3",
          "4",
          "5",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n - 1$ turning points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which feature of the graph is determined by the multiplicity of a zero?",
        "options": [
          "Whether the graph crosses or touches the x-axis at that point.",
          "The direction of the end behavior.",
          "The number of y-intercepts.",
          "The location of the vertical asymptotes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even multiplicity results in a 'touch,' while odd multiplicity results in a 'cross.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you find the y-intercept of a polynomial graph?",
        "options": [
          "Evaluate $f(0)$.",
          "Find the zeros of the function.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The y-intercept always occurs where $x = 0$."

        "question": "What is the end behavior of $f(x) = -2x^4 + x^3 - 5$?",
        "options": [
          "Falls to the left and falls to the right.",
          "Rises to the left and rises to the right.",
          "Falls to the left and rises to the right.",
          "Rises to the left and falls to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even degree and negative leading coefficient mean both ends go down toward $-\\infty$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given $f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)^2$, where does the graph 'touch and turn'?",
        "options": [
          "At $x = -3$",
          "At $x = 2$",
          "At $x = 3$",
          "At the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The zero at $x = -3$ has a multiplicity of 2 (even), which causes the 'touch and turn' behavior."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a polynomial graph crosses the x-axis at $x = 1$ and $x = 5$, and touches at $x = 3$, what is the minimum possible degree?",

          "4",
          "3",
          "2",
          "5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crossing requires at least multiplicity 1 (twice) and touching requires at least multiplicity 2. $1 + 1 + 2 = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It has *at most* $n - 1$. For example, $f(x) = x^3$ has zero turning points."

          "Remain entirely above or entirely below the x-axis.",
          "Have at least one x-intercept.",

          "Pass through the origin."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because polynomials are continuous, they cannot jump across the axis without passing through another zero."
