      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the radius of the Unit Circle?",

          "1",
          "π",
          "0",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'Unit' in Unit Circle refers to a radius of exactly one unit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On the unit circle, which coordinate represents $\\cos \\theta$?",
        "options": [
          "The x-coordinate",
          "The y-coordinate",
          "The slope",
          "The radius"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition on the unit circle, $x = \\cos \\theta$ and $y = \\sin \\theta$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of $\\sin(90^\\circ)$ or $\\sin(\\pi/2)$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $90^\\circ$, the point on the unit circle is $(0, 1)$. The sine is the y-value, which is 1."

          "Quadrant II",
          "Quadrant IV"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In Q3, both x and y coordinates are negative, meaning tangent is the only positive primary function (ASTC)."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $45^\\circ$ angle is the midpoint of the quadrant where $x=y$."

          "x² + y²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent is $\\sin/\\cos$, which corresponds to $y/x$ on the unit circle."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these angles has a cosine of $-1$?",

          "90° (π/2)",
          "270° (3π/2)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The point at $180^\\circ$ is $(-1, 0)$. Since cosine is the x-value, it is $-1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At $60^\\circ$ ($\\pi/3$), which value is larger?",
        "options": [
          "Sine",
          "Cosine",
          "They are equal",
          "Tangent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $60^\\circ$, the coordinates are $(1/2, \\sqrt{3}/2)$. Since $\\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866$, sine is larger than cosine ($0.5$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: $\\tan(90^\\circ)$ is undefined.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $90^\\circ$, $x=0$. Since tangent is $y/x$, you would be dividing by zero, which is undefined."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$300^\\circ$ is in Q4. Its reference angle is $60^\\circ$. In Q4, cosine is positive, and $\\cos(60^\\circ) = 1/2$."
