      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\sin(2x) = \\cos x$ on $[0, 2\\pi)$.",
        "options": [
          "π/2, 3π/2, π/6, 5π/6",

          "0, π, π/6, 5π/6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expand $\\sin(2x)$ to $2\\sin x \\cos x$. Factor: $\\cos x(2\\sin x - 1) = 0$. Solutions are where $\\cos x = 0$ or $\\sin x = 1/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which identity is most efficient to solve $\\cos(2x) + 3\\sin x - 2 = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "1 - 2sin² x",
          "2cos² x - 1",
          "cos² x - sin² x",
          "2sin x cos x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the other term is $3\\sin x$, using the sine-only version of the double-angle formula creates a quadratic equation in sine."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Replace $2\\cos^2 x$ with $2(1 - \\sin^2 x)$. Simplifies to $2\\sin^2 x - \\sin x - 1 = 0$. Factors: $(2\\sin x + 1)(\\sin x - 1) = 0$. Solutions are $\\sin x = -1/2$ and $\\sin x = 1$."

          "π/12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\tan(x/2) = 1/\\sqrt{3}$. This means $x/2 = \\pi/6$. Multiplying by 2 gives $x = \\pi/3$."

          "0, π"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Squaring both sides gives $1 + \\sin(2x) = 1$, so $\\sin(2x) = 0$. Potential solutions are $0, \\pi/2, \\pi, 3\\pi/2$. Checking them in the original equation, only 0 and $3\\pi/2$ work."

          "3π/4 + 2kπ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sin^2 x = 1/2$, so $\\sin x = \\pm\\sqrt{2}/2$. This hits all $\\pi/4$ reference angles. Since they are separated by 90 degrees, we can write $\\pi/4 + k\\pi/2$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replace $\\tan^2 x$ with $\\sec^2 x - 1$. Equation becomes $\\sec^2 x + \\sec x - 2 = 0$. Factors: $(\\sec x + 2)(\\sec x - 1) = 0$. $\\sec x = -2$ (at $2\\pi/3, 4\\pi/3$) and $\\sec x = 1$ (at 0)."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Multiplying by 2 gives $\\sin(2x) = 2$. Since the maximum value of sine is 1, this is impossible."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many solutions are there for $\\sin(3x) = 0.5$ on $[0, 2\\pi)$?",

          "6",
          "3",
          "2",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A standard cycle of sine hits 0.5 twice. Since $\\sin(3x)$ completes 3 cycles in the interval, there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ solutions."

          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\cos x / \\sin x = \\cos x$. Either $\\cos x = 0$ (solutions $\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2$) or $1/\\sin x = 1$ (solution $\\pi/2$). The only unique solutions are $\\pi/2$ and $3\\pi/2$."
