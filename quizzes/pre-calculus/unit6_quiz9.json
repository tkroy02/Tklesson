        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When using Cramer's Rule, what does it mean if the determinant of the coefficient matrix ($|A|$) is zero?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since Cramer's Rule requires dividing by $|A|$, a zero determinant makes the calculation undefined."

          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Determinants only exist for square matrices, so Cramer's Rule only applies to systems with an equal number of equations and variables."
