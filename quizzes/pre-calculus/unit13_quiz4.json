    "subtitle": "13.4: Polar Coordinate System",
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Plotting and interpreting polar coordinates",
    "duration": 10,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the polar point $(r, \\theta)$, what does $r$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The distance from the origin (pole)",
          "The angle of rotation",
          "The $x$-coordinate",
          "The slope of the line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$r$ is the radial distance from the center point (the pole)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a point with a negative radius, such as $(-3, 45^{\\circ})$?",
        "options": [
          "Move $3$ units in the direction of $225^{\\circ}$",
          "Move $3$ units in the direction of $45^{\\circ}$",
          "Move $3$ units in the direction of $-45^{\\circ}$",
          "The point does not exist"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative $r$ means you move in the opposite direction of the angle. $45^{\\circ} + 180^{\\circ} = 225^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A single point in the plane can be represented by infinitely many polar coordinates.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Because of coterminal angles and negative radii, you can name the same spot many different ways (e.g., $(1, 0^{\\circ})$ is the same as $(1, 360^{\\circ})$ or $(-1, 180^{\\circ})$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the pole located in the rectangular coordinate system?",

          "$(0, 0)$",
          "$(1, 0)$",
          "$(0, 1)$",
          "At infinity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'pole' is just the polar name for the origin."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which angle is equivalent to a rotation of $-60^{\\circ}$?",

          "$300^{\\circ}$",
          "$60^{\\circ}$",
          "$120^{\\circ}$",
          "$240^{\\circ}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Negative angles rotate clockwise. $-60^{\\circ} + 360^{\\circ} = 300^{\\circ}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The polar axis corresponds to which part of the Cartesian plane?",

          "The positive $x$-axis",
          "The positive $y$-axis",

          "The negative $x$-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The polar axis is the starting line ($0^{\\circ}$) for all rotations."

        "question": "Which point is the same as $(2, \\pi/3)$?",

          "$(-2, 4\\pi/3)$",
          "$(2, 2\\pi/3)$",
          "$(-2, \\pi/3)$",
          "$(2, -\\pi/3)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\pi/3$ is $60^{\\circ}$. $4\\pi/3$ is $240^{\\circ}$. A negative radius at $240^{\\circ}$ points back across the pole to $60^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\theta$ is measured in radians, how many radians is a full circle?",

          "$2\\pi$",
          "$\\pi$",
          "$360$",
          "$\\pi/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A full rotation is $360^{\\circ}$ or $2\\pi$ radians."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the radius of the point $(0, 120^{\\circ})$?",

          "$0$",
          "$120$",
          "$1$",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the radius is $0$, the point is at the pole, regardless of the angle."

        "question": "In which quadrant does the point $(3, 200^{\\circ})$ lie?",

          "Quadrant I",
          "Quadrant II",
          "Quadrant IV"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$180^{\\circ} < 200^{\\circ} < 270^{\\circ}$, which is the third quadrant."
