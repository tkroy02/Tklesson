      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus essentially state?",
        "options": [
          "Differentiation and integration are inverse processes.",
          "All functions are continuous.",
          "The limit of a function is always equal to its value.",
          "The area under any curve is a square."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The FTC bridges the gap between the derivative (slope) and the integral (area), showing they are mathematical opposites."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit and subtract the value at the lower limit."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = 2x$, which of the following is an antiderivative $F(x)$?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$, making $x^2$ the antiderivative."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The derivative of $kx$ is $k$, so $kx$ (plus a constant $C$) is the antiderivative."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of the FTC, what is an 'antiderivative'?",

          "A function whose derivative is the original function.",
          "The negative of a derivative.",
          "The reciprocal of a derivative.",
          "The limit of a derivative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Antidifferentiation is the process of 'going backward' from the derivative to the original function."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "$1$",
          "$9$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$F(2) - F(1) = 2^3 - 1^3 = 8 - 1 = 7$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the constant $C$ usually ignored when evaluating a **definite** integral?",
        "options": [
          "It cancels out during the subtraction $(F(b)+C) - (F(a)+C)$.",
          "It is always zero.",
          "It only applies to derivatives.",
          "It makes the area infinite."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $C - C = 0$, the constant of integration does not affect the final value of a definite integral."

        "question": "Which mathematician(s) are independently credited with the development of Calculus and the FTC?",
