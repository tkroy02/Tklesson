    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an SSA scenario with acute angle A, if the opposite side $a$ is less than the height $h$, how many triangles can be formed?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "2",
          "Infinitely many"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $a < h$, the side is too short to reach the opposite side of the triangle, so no triangle is possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given side $a = 10$, side $b = 15$, and $A = 30^{\\circ}$, calculate the height $h$.",
        "options": [
          "7.5",
          "5",
          "12.9",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$h = b \\sin A = 15 \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 15(0.5) = 7.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the values from the previous question ($a=10, b=15, A=30^{\\circ}$), how many triangles exist?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "0",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $h (7.5) < a (10) < b (15)$, the side $a$ can swing to two different points on the base, creating two distinct triangles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you find that angle $B_{1} = 40^{\\circ}$ in a two-triangle SSA case, what is the value of the second potential angle $B_{2}$?",
        "options": [
          "140°",
          "50°",
          "130°",
          "220°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The second angle in the ambiguous case is the supplement of the first ($180^{\\circ} - 40^{\\circ} = 140^{\\circ}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If angle A is obtuse ($A > 90^{\\circ}$) and side $a \\le b$, how many triangles can be formed?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "2",
          "1 or 2 depending on the height"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the given angle is obtuse, the opposite side $a$ must be the longest side. If $a \\le b$, the triangle cannot close."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The SSA case can result in a single right triangle if $a = b \\sin A$.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the opposite side equals the height, it is exactly the distance required to form a $90^{\\circ}$ angle with the base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the case where $a > b$, regardless of whether angle A is acute or obtuse, how many triangles exist?",

          "1",
          "2",
          "0",
          "It depends on the height"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the side opposite the given angle is longer than the adjacent side, only one triangle can be formed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the calculator only give one angle when you use $\\arcsin$ to find B?",
        "options": [
          "The range of arcsin is restricted to [-90°, 90°].",
          "The calculator assumes the triangle is right-angled.",
          "Obtuse angles don't have sines.",
          "It's a programming error in most calculators."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inverse functions only return one value. You must use your knowledge of the unit circle to find the supplementary obtuse angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for the first angle $B$ if $a = 6, b = 10,$ and $A = 20^{\\circ}$. (Round to nearest degree)",

          "70°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sin B = (10 \\sin 20^{\\circ}) / 6 \\approx 0.57$. $\\arcsin(0.57) \\approx 34.75^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the previous question ($B_{1} \\approx 35^{\\circ}$), does a second triangle exist?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, because 180 - 35 = 145, and 145 + 20 < 180.",
          "No, because 145 + 20 is too close to 180.",
          "Yes, because 35 is less than 90.",
          "No, because the height is greater than 6."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A second triangle exists if the given angle A plus the supplement $B_{2}$ is still less than $180^{\\circ}$."
