      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\cos x < 0$ on the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$.",
        "options": [
          "(π/2, 3π/2)",
          "(0, π)",
          "(π, 2π)",
          "[π/2, 3π/2]"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cosine is negative in Quadrants II and III. These quadrants span from π/2 to 3π/2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On $[0, 2\\pi)$, where is $\\sin x \\ge 0$?",
        "options": [
          "[0, π]",
          "(0, π)",
          "[π, 2π]",
          "[0, 2π]"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sine is positive or zero in Quadrants I and II. Because the inequality is 'greater than or equal to', we use brackets to include 0 and π."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\tan x > 0$ on the interval $[0, \\pi)$.",
        "options": [
          "(0, π/2)",
          "(0, π)",
          "[0, π/2)",
          "(π/2, π)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent is positive in Q1. At π/2, tangent is undefined, so the interval must stop there with a parenthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the solution for $2\\cos x - 1 > 0$ on $[0, 2\\pi)$.",
        "options": [
          "[0, π/3) ∪ (5π/3, 2π)",
          "(π/3, 5π/3)",
          "(0, π/6) ∪ (11π/6, 2π)",
          "(π/6, 11π/6)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolating gives $\\cos x > 1/2$. Cosine is greater than 1/2 in the 'right side' of the circle, which is the start of the rotation and the very end."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is $\\sin x < -1$?",

          "No solution",
          "3π/2",
          "(π, 2π)",
          "All real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The range of sine is [-1, 1]. It can be equal to -1, but it can never be strictly less than -1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The inequality $\\sin^2 x \\ge 0$ is true for all real numbers $x$.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any real number squared is non-negative. Since sine outputs real numbers, its square is always $\\ge 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\cos x \\le -\\sqrt{2}/2$ on $[0, 2\\pi)$.",

          "[0, 3π/4]",
          "[5π/4, 2π)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cosine is less than or equal to $-\\sqrt{2}/2$ in the 'deep' part of Quadrants II and III. We use brackets for 'or equal to'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving $\\tan x < 1$ on $[0, \\pi/2)$, the solution is:",
        "options": [
          "[0, π/4)",
          "(0, π/4)",
          "(π/4, π/2)",
          "[0, π/2)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent starts at 0 and increases. It reaches 1 at π/4, so it is less than 1 from 0 up until π/4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do vertical asymptotes affect trigonometric inequalities?",
        "options": [
          "They act as boundaries where the interval must be 'open' (parentheses).",
          "They have no effect on inequalities.",
          "They are always included in the solution set.",
          "They turn the inequality into an equation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the function is undefined at an asymptote, you cannot include that x-value in a solution, even if the inequality is $\\le$ or $\\ge$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $|\\sin x| \\le 1$.",

          "No solution",
          "[-π/2, π/2]",
          "[0, π]"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The absolute value of sine is always between 0 and 1, so it will always be less than or equal to 1."
