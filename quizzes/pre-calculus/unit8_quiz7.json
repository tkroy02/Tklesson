    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which function serves as the 'ghost' or helper graph for $y = \\csc x$?",
        "options": [
          "y = sin x",
          "y = cos x",
          "y = tan x",
          "y = sec x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since cosecant is $1/\\sin x$, we use the sine wave to determine its critical points and asymptotes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where do the vertical asymptotes of $y = \\sec x$ occur?",
        "options": [
          "Where cos x = 0",
          "Where sin x = 0",
          "Where tan x = 1",
          "At every multiple of π"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Secant is undefined whenever its denominator, cosine, is zero ($x = \\pi/2, 3\\pi/2$, etc.)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the period of $y = \\sec(4x)$?",

          "π/2",
          "π",
          "2π",
          "8π"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period = $2\\pi / b = 2\\pi / 4 = \\pi / 2$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the range of the parent function $y = \\csc x$?",

          "(-∞, -1] ∪ [1, ∞)",
          "[-1, 1]",
          "(-∞, ∞)",
          "[0, ∞)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cosecant values are always greater than or equal to 1 or less than or equal to -1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does the graph of $y = \\csc x$ have a local minimum?",

          "Where sin x has a local maximum",
          "Where sin x has a local minimum",
          "Where sin x = 0",
          "At the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'bottom' of the upward-opening U-shape in cosecant occurs at the 'top' of the sine wave."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $y = 3 \\sec x$, what is the lowest positive y-value on the graph?",

          "3",
          "1",
          "0",
          "1/3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The helper cosine graph has a max of 3. The secant U-shape starts there and goes up, making 3 the minimum for that branch."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The graph of $y = \\sec x$ has x-intercepts.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the range is $(-\\infty, -1] \\cup [1, \\infty)$, the graph never crosses the x-axis ($y=0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many vertical asymptotes does $y = \\csc x$ have on the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "2",
          "1",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sine is zero at $0$, $\\pi$, and $2\\pi$. Cosecant has asymptotes at all three locations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these functions is symmetric about the y-axis (Even)?",

          "Secant",
          "Cosecant",
          "Both",
          "Neither"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since Cosine is even, its reciprocal Secant is also even."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you shift the 'ghost' sine wave, what happens to the cosecant graph?",
        "options": [
          "The asymptotes and U-shapes shift exactly the same way.",
          "Only the U-shapes shift.",
          "Nothing happens.",
          "The period changes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reciprocal function is 'tethered' to its partner; any transformation applied to the sine wave applies to the cosecant graph."
