      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $3^{x+1} = 27$.",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "3",
          "9",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$3^{x+1} = 3^3$. Setting exponents equal: $x + 1 = 3$, so $x = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step to solve $5^{x} = 12$?",
        "options": [
          "Take the logarithm of both sides.",
          "Divide by 5.",
          "Square both sides.",
          "Multiply by 12."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since 12 cannot be written as a power of 5, logs are needed to bring the $x$ down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $e^x = 7$.",
        "options": [
          "$\\ln(7)$",
          "$\\log(7)$",
          "$7^e$",
          "$e^7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Taking the natural log of both sides gives $\\ln(e^x) = \\ln(7)$, which simplifies to $x = \\ln(7)$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

          "1",
          "0",
          "4",
          "-1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any base to the power of 0 is 1, so $x - 1 = 0$, meaning $x = 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would you solve $2^x = 3^{x+1}$?",
        "options": [
          "Take the $\\ln$ of both sides and use the Power Property.",
          "Divide by $x$.",
          "The equation has no solution.",
          "Subtract $x$ from the exponent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When bases differ on both sides, logs are the only way to isolate $x$ from both exponents."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $10^{2x} = 1000$.",
        "options": [
          "1.5",
          "3",
          "1",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$10^{2x} = 10^3 \\implies 2x = 3 \\implies x = 1.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which property allows you to move $x$ in the equation $\\ln(5^x) = \\ln(10)$?",

          "Power Property",
          "Product Property",
          "Quotient Property",
          "Change of Base"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Power Property states $\\log(M^P) = P \\log(M)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $2^{3x} = 16$.",

          "4/3",
          "2",
          "3/4",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$2^{3x} = 2^4 \\implies 3x = 4 \\implies x = 4/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: To solve $2e^{x} = 10$, you should take the natural log before dividing by 2.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must isolate the exponential term ($e^x = 5$) first to avoid a messy $\\ln(2e^x)$ expression."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the solution to $e^{2x} - 5e^x + 6 = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "$x = \\ln(2), \\ln(3)$",
          "$x = 2, 3$",
          "$x = e^2, e^3$",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is 'quadratic in form.' Let $u = e^x$, then $u^2 - 5u + 6 = 0 \\implies (u-2)(u-3)=0$. So $e^x=2$ and $e^x=3$."
