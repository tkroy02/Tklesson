    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step when dividing $2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1$ by $x - 2$?",
        "options": [
          "Divide $2x^3$ by $x$.",
          "Divide $2x^3$ by $-2$.",
          "Subtract $-2$ from $2x^3$.",
          "Multiply $x$ by $-2$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In long division, you always divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are dividing $x^4 - 2x + 5$ by $x + 3$, which terms should you add as placeholders?",
        "options": [
          "$0x^3$ and $0x^2$",
          "$0x^4$ and $0x^3$",
          "$0x$ and $0$",
          "No placeholders are needed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must account for every power of $x$ from the highest degree down to the constant. Here, $x^3$ and $x^2$ are missing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When performing the 'Subtraction' step in polynomial long division, what is a common mistake to avoid?",
        "options": [
          "Forgetting to distribute the negative sign to all terms being subtracted.",
          "Adding the terms instead of dividing.",
          "Multiplying the remainder by the divisor.",
          "Using placeholders."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When you subtract a binomial like $(2x^2 - 4x)$, you must change the signs of both terms to $-2x^2 + 4x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Divide $(x^2 + 7x + 10)$ by $(x + 2)$. What is the quotient?",

          "$x + 5$",
          "$x - 5$",
          "$x + 10$",
          "$x + 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x^2 / x = x$. Multiplying $(x+2)$ by $x$ gives $x^2 + 2x$. Subtracting that from $x^2 + 7x$ leaves $5x$. $5x / x = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the degree of the quotient if a 5th-degree polynomial is divided by a 2nd-degree polynomial?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "7",
          "2.5",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The degrees are subtracted: $5 - 2 = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the remainder of a division is $3$ and the divisor is $x - 1$, how is the remainder part of the answer written?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{3}{x - 1}$",
          "$3(x - 1)$",
          "$-3$",
          "$\\frac{x - 1}{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The remainder is always expressed as a fraction over the original divisor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When does the long division process stop?",
        "options": [
          "When the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor.",
          "When the remainder is zero.",
          "When you run out of x terms.",
          "When the quotient becomes a constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once the remaining expression has a lower power than what you are dividing by, it is officially the remainder."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Divide $2x^2 + 3x - 1$ by $x$. What is the result?",

          "$2x + 3 - \\frac{1}{x}$",
          "$2x + 3$",
          "$2x^2 + 3$",
          "$5x - 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide each term individually: $2x^2/x = 2x$, $3x/x = 3$, and $-1/x$ remains as the fractional part."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Polynomial long division can only be used if the divisor is a linear expression $(x - c)$.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike synthetic division, long division can be used with any degree of divisor (e.g., dividing by $x^2 + 1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $(x - c)$ is a factor of $P(x)$, what will the remainder of the long division be?",

          "0",
          "$c$",
          "$P(c)$",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, a factor divides the polynomial perfectly with no remainder."
