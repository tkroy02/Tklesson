    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the magnitude of the vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\langle 3, -4 \\rangle$?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "7",
          "25",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\|v\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a vector starts at $P(1, 2)$ and ends at $Q(4, 6)$, what is its component form?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Component form is $(x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1)$. So, $\\langle 4-1, 6-2 \\rangle = \\langle 3, 4 \\rangle$."
      },

          "Standard vector"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A unit vector has a length of exactly 1 unit and is used primarily to indicate direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expression $\\mathbf{v} = 2\\mathbf{i} - 5\\mathbf{j}$, what does the $\\mathbf{j}$ represent?",

          "The vertical unit vector ⟨0, 1⟩",
          "The horizontal unit vector ⟨1, 0⟩",

          "The direction angle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\mathbf{i}$ is the unit vector for the x-axis, and $\\mathbf{j}$ is the unit vector for the y-axis."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\tan \\theta = 1/1 = 1$. $\\arctan(1) = 45°$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction, even if they start at different points.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vectors are defined by displacement, not fixed location. As long as the 'arrow' is the same length and points the same way, the vectors are equal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you calculate the horizontal component $v_1$ if you know the magnitude $\\|v\\|$ and angle $\\theta$?",

          "v₁ = ‖v‖ / cos θ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like in the unit circle ($x = r \\cos \\theta$), the horizontal component uses the cosine of the angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Zero Vector' $\\langle 0, 0 \\rangle$ has which of the following properties?",

          "It has no specific direction.",
          "Its magnitude is 1.",
          "It is represented by the letter i.",
          "It is perpendicular to all other vectors."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The zero vector has a magnitude of 0 and, because it has no length, its direction is undefined."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the component form of a vector with magnitude 10 and direction $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$?",

          "Divide the vector by its magnitude.",
          "Multiply the vector by its magnitude.",
          "Subtract 1 from each component.",
          "Square each component."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing a vector by its own length 'scales' it down to a length of 1 while keeping the direction identical."
