      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convert to exponential form: $3^4 = x$, so $x = 81$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step to solve $\\log_{2}(x) + \\log_{2}(x - 2) = 3$?",
        "options": [
          "Condense the left side to $\\log_{2}(x(x-2))$.",
          "Subtract $\\log_{2}(x)$ from both sides.",
          "Exponentiate both sides immediately.",
          "Set $x + x - 2 = 3$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must have a single log term before you can convert to exponential form."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\ln(x) = 0$.",

        "options": [
          "No, it is extraneous.",
          "Yes, it is a valid solution.",
          "Only if the base is negative.",
          "Only if you use natural logs."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plugging $-5$ into $\\log(x + 2)$ gives $\\log(-3)$, which is undefined."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To solve $\\ln(x) = 5$, you should 'exponentiate' both sides using which base?",

          "10",
          "5",
          "x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base of 'ln' is $e$. Raising both sides as powers of $e$ ($e^{\\ln x} = e^5$) clears the log."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x^2 = 16 \\implies x = \\pm 4$. Since the original argument was $x^2$, both 4 and -4 result in $\\ln(16)$, so both are valid."
