          "$|r| < 1$",
          "$|r| > 1$",
          "$r = 1$",
          "$r = -1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the terms to approach zero fast enough for the sum to be finite, the common ratio must be between $-1$ and $1$."
      },

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With $a_1 = 1$ and $r = 0.5$, the formula $S = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5}$ gives $1 / 0.5 = 2$."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The common ratio $r = 2$ is greater than $1$, meaning the terms grow larger indefinitely."

        "answer": "A",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The series has $a_1 = 0.7$ and $r = 0.1$, so $S = 0.7 / (1 - 0.1) = 0.7 / 0.9 = 7/9$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solving $24 = a_1 / (1 - 1/4)$ gives $24 = a_1 / (3/4)$, so $a_1 = 24 \\times (3/4) = 18$."

          "$100 + 1 + 0.01 + \\dots$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The common ratio $r = 1.5$ is greater than $1$, which causes the series to diverge."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total distance = $20$ (initial drop) + $2 \\times (15 / (1 - 0.75)) = 20 + 2(60) = 140$ feet."

          "Yes, as long as $|r| < 1$.",
          "No, $r$ must be positive.",

          "Only if the sum is zero."
        ],
