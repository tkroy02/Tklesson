      {

        "question": "How do you find the x-intercepts of a function $f(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "Set $f(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$.",
          "Evaluate $f(0)$.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The x-intercepts occur where the output (y-value) is zero."

          "$(7, 0)$",
          "$(0, -5)$",
          "$(0, 2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaluate $f(0)$: $2(0)^2 - 5(0) + 7 = 7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(-x) = f(x)$, the function's graph is symmetric with respect to the:",
        "options": [
          "y-axis",

          "Origin symmetry",
          "y-axis symmetry",
          "x-axis symmetry",
          "No symmetry"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$f(-x) = (-x)^3 = -x^3$, which is $-f(x)$. This confirms origin symmetry."

          "$f(x) \\to -\\infty$ for both."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since any real number squared is positive, the parabola goes up on both the left and right sides."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the zeros of $f(x) = x^2 - 9$.",

          "$3$ only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $x^2 - 9 = 0$. $x^2 = 9$, so $x = \\pm 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A function has origin symmetry. If the point $(2, 5)$ is on the graph, what other point must be on the graph?",
        "options": [
          "$(-2, -5)$",
          "$(-2, 5)$",
          "$(2, -5)$",
          "$(5, 2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Origin symmetry negates both $x$ and $y$ values."

          "Falls on both sides."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The leading term $-x^3$ dominates. As $x$ gets large, $-x^3$ becomes very negative (falls right). As $x$ gets very negative, $-(-x)^3$ becomes positive (rises left)."

        "question": "Can a function have more than one y-intercept?",
        "options": [
          "No, it would fail the Vertical Line Test.",
          "Yes, if it is a circle.",
          "Yes, if it is an even function.",
          "Only if the intercept is at the origin."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a graph has two y-intercepts, a vertical line (the y-axis) would hit it twice, meaning it is not a function."
