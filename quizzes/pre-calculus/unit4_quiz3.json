    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the horizontal asymptote of $f(x) = \\frac{3x^2 - 5}{x^2 + 2}$?",

          "$y = 3$",

          "$y = -5/2$",
          "None"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the degrees are equal ($n=2, d=2$), the asymptote is the ratio of leading coefficients: $3/1 = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the horizontal asymptote for $g(x) = \\frac{x + 10}{x^2 - 4}$.",

          "None"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The degree of the denominator (2) is greater than the degree of the numerator (1), so the asymptote is the x-axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When does a rational function have an oblique (slant) asymptote?",
        "options": [
          "When the degree of the numerator is exactly one higher than the denominator.",
          "When the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal.",
          "When the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator.",
          "When the constant term is zero."

          "$y = x - 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using synthetic or long division: $(x^2 + 0x + 1) \\div (x - 1)$ gives a quotient of $x + 1$ with a remainder of 2."

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A rational function's end behavior is determined by one or the other (or neither), never both."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the horizontal asymptote of $h(x) = \\frac{5x^3 + 2x}{2x^3 - 1}$.",

          "No horizontal asymptote"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Degrees are equal ($3$), so we take the ratio of the leading coefficients: $5/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Does $f(x) = \\frac{x^4}{x^2 + 1}$ have a horizontal or oblique asymptote?",
        "options": [
          "No, because the numerator degree is two higher than the denominator.",
          "Yes, it has a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$.",
          "Yes, it has an oblique asymptote.",
          "Yes, it has a horizontal asymptote at $y = 1$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $n > d + 1$, the function has neither a horizontal nor an oblique asymptote."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes only describe behavior as $x$ gets very large. The graph can cross them in the middle section."

          "$n > d$",
          "$a = 0$"
        ],
