      {

        "options": [
          "$28$",
          "$22$",
          "$8$",
          "$32$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $x - 3 = 25$. Add 3: $x = 28$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $|2x + 1| = 7$",
        "options": [
          "$3, -4$",
          "$3, 4$",
          "$-3, 4$",
          "$3$ only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set up two equations: $2x + 1 = 7$ (gives $x=3$) and $2x + 1 = -7$ (gives $x=-4$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{10}{x} = \\frac{4}{x-3}$",

          "$5$",
          "$-5$",
          "$2$",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cross-multiply: $10(x-3) = 4x$. $10x - 30 = 4x$. $6x = 30$, so $x = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the extraneous solution for $\\sqrt{x + 2} = -3$?",

          "$7$",
          "No real solution exists",
          "$-11$",
          "$-5$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A principal square root cannot equal a negative number. While squaring gives $x+2=9 \\rightarrow x=7$, plugging 7 back in gives $\\sqrt{9}=3$, which does not equal $-3$."

          "$3$",
          "$-3, -7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute value represents distance and can never be negative. Therefore, this equation has no solution."

          "$1$",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply by LCD $x(x-2)$: $x^2 + (x-2) = 2x$. $x^2 - x - 2 = 0$. Factors: $(x-2)(x+1)=0$. $x=2$ is excluded by the denominator, so $x=-1$ is the only solution."

          "Square both sides of the equation.",
          "Add 1 to both sides.",
          "Divide by 2."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To undo a cube root, you must raise both sides to the third power (cube them)."

          "$3, -2$",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $x^2 = x + 6$. $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$. $(x-3)(x+2)=0$. $x=3$ works, but $x=-2$ is extraneous because $-2 \\neq \\sqrt{4}$."

          "$\\pm 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The denominator $x^2 - 9$ cannot be zero, so $x$ cannot be $3$ or $-3$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolate the absolute value: $2|x| = 6$, so $|x| = 3$. This means $x = 3$ or $x = -3$."
