          "To provide a formula for the slope of $f(x)$ at any point.",

          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a linear function $y = mx + b$, the slope is constant. Thus, the derivative is $m = 5$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x)$ has a sharp 'corner' or 'cusp' at $x = a$, is the function differentiable at $a$?",

          "No",
          "Yes",
          "Only if the function is positive",
          "Only if it is an absolute value function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At a sharp corner, the slope from the left and the slope from the right don't match, so the derivative does not exist."

          "No"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
