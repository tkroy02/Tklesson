    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Kepler's First Law, where is the Sun located in a planet's orbit?",
        "options": [
          "At one of the foci",
          "At the center of the ellipse",
          "On the minor axis",
          "At one of the vertices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The other focus is empty space."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a whispering gallery, if a person stands at one focus, where should the listener stand to hear them?",
        "options": [
          "At the other focus",
          "At the center of the room",
          "Against the far wall",
          "At a vertex"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any sound emitted from one focus reflects off the elliptical surface and passes through the second focus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lithotripter is 20 cm long and 16 cm wide. To break a kidney stone, where must the stone be placed relative to the center?",
        "options": [
          "At the focus (c = 6 cm)",
          "At the vertex (a = 10 cm)",
          "At the center (0, 0)",
          "At the minor axis endpoint (b = 8 cm)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "c² = a² - b². Using half-lengths: c² = 10² - 8² = 100 - 64 = 36. So, c = 6 cm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'eccentricity' of Earth's orbit is 0.0167. This means Earth's orbit is:",
        "options": [
          "Very nearly circular",
          "Extremely elongated",
          "A perfect circle",
          "Parabolic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An eccentricity close to 0 indicates the foci are very close to the center, making the ellipse look like a circle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Halley's Comet has a highly eccentric orbit (e ≈ 0.967). What does this imply about its distance from the Sun?",
        "options": [
          "It varies significantly throughout its orbit.",
          "It stays at a constant distance.",
          "It never gets close to the Sun.",
          "It moves in a straight line."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High eccentricity means the ellipse is very long/flat. The comet gets very close to the focus (Sun) at one end and very far away at the other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are designing an elliptical pool table, where should the pockets be placed so that a ball hit through one focus always goes into the other?",
        "options": [
          "At the foci",
          "In the corners",
          "In the middle of the long sides",
          "At the vertices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reflective property ensures any path through one focus reflects into the other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The total distance from one focus to any point on the ellipse and then to the other focus is always $2a$.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the core definition of an ellipse: $d_1 + d_2 = \text{constant}$. That constant is the length of the major axis ($2a$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An elliptical arch spans 100 feet and is 40 feet high. What is the value of 'a' for this arch?",
        "options": [
          "50",
          "100",
          "40",
          "80"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The span is the major axis ($2a = 100$), so $a = 50$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the lithotripsy example, why is it critical that the stone be at the focus?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure the reflected energy waves converge at that specific point.",
          "To keep the stone from moving.",
          "To make the procedure faster.",
          "Because the focus is the center of the device."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy waves reflecting off the elliptical walls only converge at the foci."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a planet's orbit has an eccentricity of 0, the orbit is:",
        "options": [
          "A circle",
          "A line",
          "A parabola",
          "Impossible"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $e = 0$, $c = 0$. This means the two foci are at the same point (the center), which defines a circle."
