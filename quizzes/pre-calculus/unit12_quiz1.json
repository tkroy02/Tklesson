    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the geometric definition of a parabola?",
        "options": [
          "The set of points equidistant from a focus and a directrix.",
          "The set of points where the sum of distances to two foci is constant.",
          "The set of points where the difference of distances to two foci is constant.",
          "A set of points at a constant distance from a center point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A parabola is defined by equal distances to a single point (focus) and a single line (directrix)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $(y - 2)^2 = 8(x + 1)$, in which direction does the parabola open?",
        "options": [
          "Right",
          "Left",
          "Up",
          "Down"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the y-term is squared and $4p$ (8) is positive, the parabola opens horizontally to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given $(x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)$, what is the coordinate of the vertex?",
        "options": [
          "(h, k)",
          "(k, h)",
          "(-h, -k)",
          "(p, 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertex is always $(h, k)$, representing the horizontal and vertical shifts from the origin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $4p = -12$ for a vertical parabola, what is the value of $p$ and which way does it open?",
        "options": [
          "p = -3, opens down",
          "p = -3, opens left",
          "p = 3, opens up",
          "p = 12, opens down"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing -12 by 4 gives $p = -3$. For a vertical parabola (x²), a negative $p$ means it opens downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The distance from the vertex to the focus is exactly the same as the distance from:",
        "options": [
          "The vertex to the directrix.",
          "The focus to the directrix.",
          "The vertex to the origin.",
          "The focus to the vertex."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, the vertex is the midpoint between the focus and the directrix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the focal chord (latus rectum) length for the parabola $(x - 3)^2 = 20(y + 4)$?",
        "options": [
          "20",
          "5",
          "10",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The length of the latus rectum is the absolute value of $4p$, which is the coefficient in front of the non-squared term."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the focus of $x^2 = 12y$.",
        "options": [
          "(0, 3)",
          "(3, 0)",
          "(0, -3)",
          "(0, 12)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertex is (0,0). $4p = 12$, so $p = 3$. Since it opens up, the focus is at (0, 0+3)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equation of the directrix for $y^2 = -4x$?",
        "options": [
          "x = 1",
          "x = -1",
          "y = 1",
          "y = -1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$4p = -4$, so $p = -1$. The parabola opens left from (0,0). The directrix is $p$ units in the opposite direction: $x = 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a parabola has a horizontal axis of symmetry, which variable is squared in its standard equation?",
        "options": [
          "y",
          "x",
          "p",
          "Both x and y"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal parabolas (opening left/right) have the form $(y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The focus is always located 'inside' the curve of the parabola.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. The parabola bends around the focus, while the directrix stays on the outside."
