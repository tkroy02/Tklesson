    "subtitle": "15.1: Concept of Limit",
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Introduction to limits and existence",
    "duration": 10,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the notation $\\lim_{x \\to 3} f(x) = 5$ mean?",
        "options": [
          "As $x$ gets closer to $3$, $f(x)$ gets closer to $5$.",
          "The value of the function at $3$ is exactly $5$.",
          "The function is undefined at $x = 3$.",
          "The slope of the function at $3$ is $5$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A limit describes the value a function approaches as $x$ nears a point, regardless of the actual value at that point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ to exist, what must be true?",
        "options": [
          "The left-hand and right-hand limits must be equal.",
          "The function must be defined at $c$.",
          "The function must be a straight line.",
          "The value of $f(c)$ must be $0$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A limit only exists if the function approaches the same height from both directions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A function can have a limit at $x = c$ even if $f(c)$ is undefined.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. For example, a function with a 'hole' at $x = c$ still has a limit as long as the path leads to that hole from both sides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x)$ approaches $4$ from the left and $7$ from the right as $x \\to 2$, what is $\\lim_{x \\to 2} f(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "Does not exist (DNE)",
          "$4$",
          "$7$",
          "$5.5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the left and right limits are different, the overall limit does not exist."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = 5$ for all $x$, what is $\\lim_{x \\to 10} f(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$5$",
          "$10$",
          "$0$",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a constant function, the limit is always the value of the constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these scenarios would cause a limit NOT to exist?",
        "options": [
          "The function oscillates wildly between values.",
          "The function has a small hole at that point.",
          "The function is a horizontal line.",
          "The function value is very large."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wild oscillation (like $\\sin(1/x)$ near $0$) prevents the function from settling on a single value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between $f(c)$ and $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$f(c)$ is the actual value; the limit is the expected value nearby.",
          "The limit is always larger than $f(c)$.",
          "There is no difference.",
          "$f(c)$ is only for integers; limits are for decimals."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The function value is the 'is,' while the limit is the 'approaches.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the limit notation, what does the arrow $\\to$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "Approaches",
          "Equals",
          "Is greater than",
          "Divided by"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The arrow indicates the direction of the movement of the $x$ variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\lim_{x \\to 1} f(x) = 4$ and $f(1) = 6$, what is the limit?",
        "options": [
          "$4$",
          "$6$",
          "$5$",
          "DNE"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The limit is $4$. The fact that $f(1) = 6$ (a removable discontinuity/dot) does not change the limit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is the limit interested in what happens 'at' the point or 'near' the point?",
        "options": [
          "Near",
          "At",
          "Neither",
          "Exactly $1$ unit away"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Limits are exclusively concerned with the behavior as you get infinitely close, not the point itself."
