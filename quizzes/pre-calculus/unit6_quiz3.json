    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many solutions can a system consisting of a line and a circle have?",
        "options": [
          "0, 1, or 2",
          "Exactly 1",
          "Infinite only",
          "Exactly 2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A line can miss a circle, be tangent to it (1 point), or pass through it (2 points)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system: $y = x^2$ and $y = x$.",

          "$(0, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$",
          "$(1, 1)$ only",
          "$(0, 0)$ only",
          "$(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitute $x$ for $y$: $x = x^2 \\implies x^2 - x = 0 \\implies x(x-1) = 0$. So $x=0$ and $x=1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method is generally preferred when one equation is $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ and the other is $y = x + 1$?",
        "options": [
          "Substitution",
          "Elimination",
          "Addition",
          "Cramer's Rule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You can easily replace $y$ in the circle equation with $(x + 1)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you solve a nonlinear system and get $x^2 = -4$, what does this indicate about the intersection?",
        "options": [
          "There is no real intersection point at that stage.",
          "The solution is $x = 2$.",
          "The graphs are tangent.",
          "The solution is $x = -2$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since a squared real number cannot be negative, there are no real solutions for that branch of the algebra."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system: $x^2 + y^2 = 10$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 8$.",
        "options": [
          "$(\\pm 3, \\pm 1)$",
          "$(3, 1)$ only",
          "$(\\pm 9, \\pm 1)$",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using elimination: add equations to get $2x^2 = 18 \\implies x^2 = 9 \\implies x = \\pm 3$. Then $9 + y^2 = 10 \\implies y^2 = 1 \\implies y = \\pm 1$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system of two parabolas that both open upward can have at most how many intersections?",

          "1",
          "4",
          "Infinite"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two distinct parabolas with the same orientation can intersect at most twice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When substituting $y = x - 3$ into $x^2 + y^2 = 9$, what is the resulting equation in terms of $x$?",
        "options": [
          "$2x^2 - 6x = 0$",
          "$x^2 + x^2 - 9 = 9$",
          "$x^2 + x - 3 = 9$",
          "$2x^2 + 9 = 9$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x^2 + (x-3)^2 = 9 \\implies x^2 + x^2 - 6x + 9 = 9 \\implies 2x^2 - 6x = 0$."

          "Circle",
          "Parabola",
          "Line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y = 4/x$ is a rational function, which is a type of hyperbola."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A nonlinear system can have exactly 3 solutions.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important to check solutions in the original equations for nonlinear systems?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure the points satisfy both the linear and nonlinear constraints.",
          "Because squaring terms always creates extraneous solutions.",
          "To find the y-intercept.",
          "Because nonlinear equations have no domain."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Checking ensures your algebraic results actually correspond to physical intersection points on both graphs."
