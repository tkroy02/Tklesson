          "Cosecant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because cos(θ) = cos(-θ), equations using only cosine are symmetric over the polar axis."
      },

          "The x-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replacing r with -r reflects the point through the origin (the pole)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The graph of r = 4 sin(3θ) is symmetric with respect to which line?",
        "options": [
          "θ = π/2 (y-axis)",
          "Polar Axis (x-axis)",
          "The line y = x",
          "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sine functions are typically symmetric with respect to the vertical line θ = π/2."

          "1/θ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Negating the angle reflects the point across the horizontal polar axis."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. A circle centered at the pole (r = 5) or a lemniscate (r² = cos 2θ) has all three symmetries."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a rose curve has an even number of petals, it is always symmetric about:",

          "The Pole",
          "Only the x-axis",
          "Only the y-axis",
          "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even-petaled roses have petals that appear in opposite pairs through the center, making them symmetric about the pole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When testing for symmetry over the line θ = π/2, why do we use (π - θ)?",
        "options": [
          "It is the trigonometric identity for reflecting across the y-axis.",
          "Because π is 180 degrees.",
          "It's easier to calculate than -r.",
          "It only works for sine functions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The point (r, π - θ) is the reflection of (r, θ) over the vertical axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lemniscate r² = 4 sin(2θ) is symmetric with respect to:",

          "All of these"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replacing r with -r keeps the equation identical because (-r)² = r², which is the test for pole symmetry."
      },

        "question": "Which of these is NOT a standard polar symmetry test?",
