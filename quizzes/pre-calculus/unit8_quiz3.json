    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the vertical shift of the function $y = 2 \\sin(x) - 5$?",
        "options": [
          "5 units down",
          "5 units up",
          "2 units up",
          "2 units down"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The constant $k = -5$ at the end of the equation moves the midline down 5 units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the phase shift of $y = \\cos(x - \\pi/4)$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the form $(x - h)$, a positive $h$ value (like $\\pi/4$) indicates a shift to the right."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor out the 2: $y = 3 \\sin(2(x - \\pi/2))$. The phase shift is $c/b$, which is $\\pi/2$."

          "Right",
          "Up",
          "Down"
