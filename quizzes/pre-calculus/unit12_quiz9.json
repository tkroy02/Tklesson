    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the maximum number of intersection points for a circle and a parabola?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "2",
          "1",
          "Unlimited"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because a parabola can curve into a circle and out again twice, it can have up to 4 intersection points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system: $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ and $y = 3$.",
        "options": [
          "(4, 3) and (-4, 3)",
          "(3, 4) and (3, -4)",
          "(5, 3) and (-5, 3)",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitute y = 3 into the first equation: x² + 3² = 25 → x² + 9 = 25 → x² = 16 → x = ±4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method is usually most efficient for the system: $x^2 + y^2 = 10$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 8$?",
        "options": [
          "Elimination",
          "Substitution",
          "Graphing",
          "Guess and Check"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since both equations have x² and y² terms, adding them will immediately eliminate the y² variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many solutions exist for the system: $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 9$?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "2",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are concentric circles (same center) with different radii (1 and 3). They will never touch or intersect."

          "(1, 1) only",
          "(-1, 1) and (1, 1)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set the equations equal: x² = x → x² - x = 0 → x(x - 1) = 0. So x = 0 (y=0) and x = 1 (y=1)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system of equations results in $x^2 = -4$, what can you conclude about the intersection points?",
        "options": [
          "There are no real solutions (no intersection).",
          "There is one intersection at x = -2.",
          "The conics are tangent.",
          "The solution is imaginary, so they intersect in the complex plane only."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In coordinate geometry, we only graph real numbers. A negative result for a squared term means the curves do not physically cross."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A line is tangent to a circle. How many solutions does the system have?",

          "1",
          "2",
          "0",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, a tangent line touches the curve at exactly one point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve by elimination: $2x^2 + y^2 = 17$ and $x^2 - y^2 = -5$.",

          "(2, 3) and (-2, -3)",
          "(4, 1) and (-4, -1)",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Add equations: 3x² = 12 → x² = 4 → x = ±2. Plug x=2 into the second: 4 - y² = -5 → y² = 9 → y = ±3."
      },
      {

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. If the parabola is located between the branches of the hyperbola without touching them, there is no intersection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you solve a system and get the same point twice (a double root), it usually indicates:",
        "options": [
          "Tangency (the curves touch but don't cross).",
          "An error in calculation.",
          "A vertical asymptote.",
          "That the curves are identical."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A double root in a system of equations typically means the two geometric shapes are tangent at that point."
