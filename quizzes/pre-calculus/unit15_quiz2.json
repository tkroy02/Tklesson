    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Numerical and graphical estimation of limits",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a graph, there is a hole at $(2, 5)$. What is $\\lim_{x \\to 2} f(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$5$",
          "$2$",
          "DNE",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The limit is the $y$-value the graph approaches. Even if there is a hole, the graph 'aims' for the height of $5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Looking at a table for $x \\to 0$, $f(-0.01) = 2.98$ and $f(0.01) = 3.02$. What is a reasonable estimate for the limit?",
        "options": [
          "$3$",
          "$0$",
          "$2.98$",
          "DNE"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both values are very close to $3$, suggesting the function is converging to $3$ from both sides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A graph has a 'jump' at $x = 4$. From the left, it's at height $2$; from the right, it's at height $6$. What is the limit at $x = 4$?",
        "options": [
          "DNE",
          "$2$",
          "$6$",
          "$4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the left-hand limit ($2$) and right-hand limit ($6$) are not equal, the overall limit does not exist."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When using a table to find $\\lim_{x \\to 5} f(x)$, which $x$-value is most appropriate to check for the 'left side'?",
        "options": [
          "$4.999$",
          "$5.001$",
          "$-5$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$4.999$ is immediately to the left of $5$ on the number line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a table shows $f(x)$ values of $10, 100, 1000, 10000$ as $x$ approaches $c$, what can we conclude?",
        "options": [
          "The limit does not exist (it is approaching infinity).",
          "The limit is $0$.",
          "The limit is $10000$.",
          "The limit is $c$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Limits must approach a specific finite real number. If the values grow without bound, the limit does not exist."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vertical asymptote at $x = 1$ means that $\\lim_{x \\to 1} f(x)$:",
        "options": [
          "Does not exist",
          "Is $1$",
          "Is $0$",
          "Is the $y$-intercept"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At a vertical asymptote, the function typically shoots to $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, so it does not settle on a finite value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find $\\lim_{x \\to -2} f(x)$ from the right, which value should you use in a table?",
        "options": [
          "$-1.999$",
          "$-2.001$",
          "$2.001$",
          "$-3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On a number line, values to the right of $-2$ are larger, such as $-1.999$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: If $f(3) = 10$, then the $\\lim_{x \\to 3} f(x)$ must be $10$.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. The function could have a jump or a hole with a displaced point at $x = 3$. The limit depends on the surrounding behavior."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the limit of a function at a point where the graph is a smooth, continuous curve?",
        "options": [
          "The $y$-value of the point",
          "Zero",
          "DNE",
          "The $x$-value of the point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a function is continuous, the limit is simply the function's value at that point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If your calculator table shows 'ERROR' for $f(2)$, does that mean the limit as $x \\to 2$ doesn't exist?",
        "options": [
          "No, the limit could still exist.",
          "Yes, the limit cannot exist if the function is undefined.",
          "Only if the error happens for $x = 2.001$ as well.",
          "Yes, errors always indicate DNE."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'ERROR' just means $f(2)$ is undefined (like a hole). The limit is determined by the values $f(1.999)$ and $f(2.001)$."
