    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Matrix A is $2 \\times 3$ and Matrix B is $3 \\times 4$, what are the dimensions of the product $AB$?",
        "options": [
          "$2 \\times 4$",
          "$3 \\times 3$",
          "$2 \\times 3$",
          "The matrices cannot be multiplied."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The inner dimensions (3) match, so the outer dimensions ($2$ and $4$) determine the size of the result."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements is generally TRUE for matrix multiplication?",
        "options": [
          "$AB \\neq BA$",
          "$AB = BA$",
          "Matrices must be the same size to multiply.",
          "You multiply corresponding elements."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix multiplication is non-commutative. The order in which you multiply significantly changes the result or can even make the multiplication impossible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the element in Row 1, Column 1 of the product $AB$, what do you multiply?",
        "options": [
          "Row 1 of A and Column 1 of B.",
          "Column 1 of A and Row 1 of B.",
          "Row 1 of A and Row 1 of B.",
          "Element $a_{11}$ and $b_{11}$ only."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The entry at $c_{ij}$ is the dot product of the $i$-th row of the first matrix and the $j$-th column of the second."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can you multiply a $3 \\times 1$ matrix (column vector) by a $1 \\times 3$ matrix (row vector)?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, the result is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix.",
          "Yes, the result is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix.",
          "No, the dimensions don't match.",
          "Only if all elements are the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The inner dimensions match (1=1). The resulting matrix takes the outer dimensions, $3 \\times 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $A(BC) = (AB)C$, which property of matrix multiplication is being demonstrated?",
        "options": [
          "Associative Property",
          "Commutative Property",
          "Distributive Property",
          "Identity Property"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Associative Property holds for matrix multiplication, meaning the grouping of the matrices doesn't matter as long as the order ($A, B, C$) stays the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if you multiply a matrix $A$ by an Identity Matrix $I$ of the correct size?",

          "The matrix remains $A$.",
          "The matrix becomes all ones.",
          "The matrix becomes all zeros.",
          "The rows and columns are swapped."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Identity Matrix acts like the number 1 in regular multiplication; $AI = A$ and $IA = A$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the product $AB$, if $A$ has 5 columns, how many rows must $B$ have?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "Any number",
          "1",
          "The same as the number of rows in A"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the multiplication to be defined, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for the first entry of $AB$ if $A = [1, 2]$ and $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}$.",

          "11",
          "3",
          "7",
          "14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(1 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 4) = 3 + 8 = 11$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: If $AB = 0$ (the zero matrix), then either $A$ or $B$ must be the zero matrix.",

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike real numbers, it is possible to multiply two non-zero matrices and get a zero matrix as a result."

        "question": "The Distributive Property $A(B + C) = AB + AC$ is valid for matrices.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrix multiplication distributes over matrix addition, provided the dimensions are compatible for both operations."
