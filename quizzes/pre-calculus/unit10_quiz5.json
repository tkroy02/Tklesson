      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the best first step to solve $2\\cos^2 x + \\sin x - 1 = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "Replace cos² x with 1 - sin² x.",
          "Replace sin x with √(1 - cos² x).",
          "Divide by cos x.",
          "Square the entire equation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the Pythagorean identity allows the equation to be written entirely in terms of sine, which can then be solved as a quadratic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\sin(2x) - \\cos x = 0$ on the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$.",
        "options": [
          "π/2, 3π/2, π/6, 5π/6",

          "0, π, π/6, 5π/6",
          "π/2, 3π/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replace $\\sin(2x)$ with $2\\sin x \\cos x$. Factor: $\\cos x(2\\sin x - 1) = 0$. This yields $\\cos x = 0$ and $\\sin x = 1/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which identity would you use to solve $\\cos(2x) + \\cos x = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "2cos² x - 1",
          "1 - 2sin² x",
          "cos² x - sin² x",
          "2sin x cos x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the other term is $\\cos x$, using the version of the double-angle formula that only contains cosine creates a solvable quadratic in cosine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you square both sides of an equation to solve it, what must you do at the very end?",
        "options": [
          "Check for extraneous solutions in the original equation.",
          "Multiply the answer by 2.",
          "Take the square root of the answers.",
          "Nothing; the answers are always correct."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Squaring can create 'false' solutions (like turning -2 = 2 into 4 = 4). You must verify all results in the original, non-squared equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\sec^2 x - 2\\tan x = 4$ on $[0, \\pi)$.",

          "π/4",
          "π/3",
          "2π/3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replace $\\sec^2 x$ with $1 + \\tan^2 x$. The equation becomes $\\tan^2 x - 2\\tan x - 3 = 0$. Factors: $(\\tan x - 3)(\\tan x + 1) = 0$. Only $\\tan x = -1$ gives a standard value in the interval."

        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. The identity is $\\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 1$. The difference $\\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x$ is actually $\\cos(2x)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To solve $\\sin x + \\cos x = 1$, a common technique is to move one term and square both sides. What does $(\\sin x + \\cos x)^2$ equal?",

          "1 + sin(2x)",
          "sin² x + cos² x",

          "sin(2x)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expanding gives $\\sin^2 x + 2\\sin x \\cos x + \\cos^2 x$. Since $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$ and $2\\sin x \\cos x = \\sin(2x)$, it simplifies to $1 + \\sin(2x)$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replace $2\\sin^2 x$ with $2(1 - \\cos^2 x)$. Simplifies to $2\\cos^2 x - 3\\cos x + 1 = 0$. Factors: $(2\\cos x - 1)(\\cos x - 1) = 0$."

          "Writing both as sin x and cos x.",
          "Pythagorean identity for tan² x.",
          "Double-angle for tangent.",
          "Half-angle for sine."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Converting to sine and cosine and finding a common denominator usually simplifies mixed reciprocal equations."
