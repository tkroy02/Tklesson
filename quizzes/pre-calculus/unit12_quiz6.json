        "question": "In the LORAN navigation system, a ship's position is determined by finding the intersection of two:",
        "options": [
          "Hyperbolas",
          "Parabolas",
          "Ellipses",
          "Circles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "LORAN relies on the constant difference in time of arrival of radio signals, which is the definition of a hyperbola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are nuclear cooling towers shaped like hyperboloids?",
        "options": [
          "The shape is structurally efficient and promotes natural convection.",
          "It helps reflect radiation back to the center.",
          "It is the only shape that can withstand high temperatures.",
          "It is purely for aesthetic reasons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hyperbolic curve allows for a wide base and top with a narrow waist, creating a strong structure and efficient upward airflow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a supersonic jet passes overhead, the 'boom' is heard by people located along what geometric curve on the ground?",
        "options": [
          "A hyperbola",
          "A parabola",
          "A straight line",
          "An ellipse"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The shockwave cone intersects the ground (a plane) to form a hyperbolic section."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a hyperbolic mirror system (like a Cassegrain telescope), light reflecting off a hyperbola is directed toward:",
        "options": [
          "One of the foci",
          "The vertex",
          "The directrix",
          "The center"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hyperbolic mirrors utilize the property that light aimed at one focus reflects toward the other focus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two stations are located at the foci of a hyperbola, and a ship is at a point on the hyperbola, what remains constant as the ship moves along that curve?",
        "options": [
          "The difference of the distances to the stations.",
          "The sum of the distances to the stations.",
          "The distance to the midpoint of the stations.",
          "The angle between the stations."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, any point on a hyperbola maintains a constant difference in distance to the two foci."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hyperboloid of one sheet (like a cooling tower) can be built using only straight beams. This property is known as being a:",
        "options": [
          "Ruled surface",
          "Flat surface",
          "Conic surface",
          "Rotational surface"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hyperboloids are 'doubly ruled' surfaces, meaning through every point on the surface, there are two straight lines that lie entirely on the surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: In a hyperbolic navigation system, the two radio stations act as the vertices of the hyperbola.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. The stations act as the **foci** of the hyperbola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object moves in a hyperbolic orbit around a star, what does this tell you about its energy?",
        "options": [
          "It has enough energy to escape the star's gravity and never return.",
          "It is trapped in a permanent orbit.",
          "It will eventually crash into the star.",
          "It is moving slower than the escape velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hyperbolic orbits are 'unbound.' Unlike elliptical orbits, the object passes the star once and continues out into space forever."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between the LORAN system and modern GPS?",
        "options": [
          "LORAN uses time differences (hyperbolas), while GPS uses absolute time/distance (circles/spheres).",
          "LORAN is more accurate than GPS.",
          "GPS only works on land.",
          "LORAN uses satellites while GPS uses ground stations."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GPS calculates your distance from multiple satellites to find where spheres intersect; LORAN used the difference between signals to place you on a hyperbolic line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comets that only visit the solar system once usually have an eccentricity (e):",

          "Greater than 1",
          "Equal to 0",
          "Between 0 and 1",
          "Equal to 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For hyperbolas, e > 1. These comets have so much speed that they follow a hyperbolic path and leave the solar system forever."
