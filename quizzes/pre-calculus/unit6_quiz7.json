      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes an Identity Matrix?",
        "options": [
          "A square matrix with 1s on the main diagonal and 0s elsewhere.",
          "A matrix consisting entirely of 1s.",
          "A matrix that, when added to A, results in A.",
          "A matrix with more rows than columns."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Identity matrix acts as the '1' of matrix multiplication."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of $A \\cdot A^{-1}$?",
        "options": [
          "The Identity Matrix (I)",
          "The Zero Matrix (0)",
          "The original matrix (A)",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, multiplying a matrix by its inverse results in the multiplicative identity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A matrix that does NOT have an inverse is called:",
        "options": [
          "Singular",
          "Invertible",
          "Square",
          "Identity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Singular matrices have a determinant of zero and cannot be inverted."

          "All positive numbers",
          "Diagonal",
          "A column vector"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only square matrices can have inverses because the relationship $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$ requires compatible dimensions in both directions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the $2 \\times 2$ inverse formula, what is the term $(ad - bc)$ called?",

          "The Scalar",
          "The Identity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The determinant determines if an inverse exists; if it is zero, you'd be dividing by zero, which is undefined."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the inverse of the Identity matrix $I$?",

          "-I",
          "0",
          "It doesn't have one"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $I \\cdot I = I$, the identity matrix is its own inverse."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When finding the inverse of $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$, what happens to the elements $a$ and $d$?",
        "options": [
          "They swap positions.",
          "They stay put but change signs.",
          "They both become 1.",
          "They are multiplied by -1."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the $2 \\times 2$ shortcut, you swap the main diagonal elements ($a$ and $d$) and negate the off-diagonal elements ($b$ and $c$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: If $AB = I$, then $B$ is the inverse of $A$.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],

          "Both",
          "Neither"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For matrix A, $(1)(4) - (2)(2) = 4 - 4 = 0$. Since the determinant is 0, it is singular."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "True.",
