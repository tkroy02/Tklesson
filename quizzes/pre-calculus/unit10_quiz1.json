      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\sin x = 1$ on the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$.",
        "options": [
          "$\\pi/2$",
          "$3\\pi/2$",
          "$0$",
          "$\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On the unit circle, the $y$-coordinate (sine) is $1$ only at $90^{\\circ}$, which is $\\pi/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general solution for $\\tan x = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "$x = \\pi/4 + n\\pi$",
          "$x = \\pi/4 + 2n\\pi$",
          "$x = 3\\pi/4 + n\\pi$",
          "$x = \\pi/2 + n\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent has a period of $\\pi$, so we add $n\\pi$ to the first solution, $\\pi/4$, to capture all possible answers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $2\\cos x + 1 = 0$ on $[0, 2\\pi)$.",

          "$\\pi/6, 11\\pi/6$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolating gives $\\cos x = -1/2$. Cosine is $-1/2$ in Quadrants II and III at $120^{\\circ}$ and $240^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "No solution",
          "$1$",
          "$2$",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The range of sine is $[-1, 1]$. It can never equal $2$, so the equation is impossible."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\sqrt{3}\\tan x - 1 = 0$ on $[0, 2\\pi)$.",

          "$\\pi/3, 2\\pi/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolating gives $\\tan x = 1/\\sqrt{3}$, which rationalizes to $\\sqrt{3}/3$. This occurs at $\\pi/6$ and its QIII partner $7\\pi/6$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving $\\cos x = 0$, what are the solutions on $[0, 2\\pi)$?",

          "$\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2$",
          "$0, \\pi$",

          "$0, 2\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cosine is the $x$-coordinate, which is $0$ at the top and bottom of the unit circle."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Correct. You must isolate the trig function before looking for angles on the unit circle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which quadrant(s) contain the solutions for $\\sin x = -1/2$?",

          "III and IV",
          "I and II",
          "II and III",
          "I and IV"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sine is negative in the bottom two quadrants (III and IV)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\sec x = 2$ on $[0, 2\\pi)$.",

          "$\\pi/4, 7\\pi/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $\\sec x = 2$, then $\\cos x = 1/2$. This occurs at $60^{\\circ}$ ($\\pi/3$) and $300^{\\circ}$ ($5\\pi/3$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the interval is not restricted, why do we add $+ 2n\\pi$ to solutions for sine?",
        "options": [
          "Because sine is periodic with a period of $2\\pi$.",
          "Because there are always two solutions.",
          "To account for negative angles only.",
          "It is a required mathematical formality with no meaning."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the wave repeats every $2\\pi$, adding multiples of $2\\pi$ accounts for every 'peak' or 'valley' on the infinite graph."
