    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the function $f(x) = \\frac{(x - 3)(x + 1)}{(x - 3)(x + 5)}$, what occurs at $x = 3$?",
        "options": [
          "A hole",
          "A vertical asymptote",
          "An x-intercept",
          "A horizontal asymptote"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the factor $(x - 3)$ is in both the numerator and denominator, it cancels out, creating a removable discontinuity (hole)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the same function $f(x) = \\frac{(x - 3)(x + 1)}{(x - 3)(x + 5)}$, what occurs at $x = -5$?",
        "options": [
          "A vertical asymptote",
          "A hole",
          "A y-intercept",
          "The function is continuous there"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After canceling common factors, $x + 5$ remains in the denominator. Setting it to zero gives the vertical asymptote $x = -5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the domain of $f(x) = \\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 4}$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\{x \\mid x \\neq 2, -2\\}$",
          "$\\{x \\mid x \\neq 2\\}$",
          "$\\{x \\mid x \\neq 4\\}$",
          "All real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The domain is determined *before* canceling. Since $x^2 - 4 = (x-2)(x+2)$, both $2$ and $-2$ must be excluded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A graph can cross a vertical asymptote.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertical asymptote represents a value where the function is undefined; the graph can never exist at that $x$-value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the vertical asymptote(s) of $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 - x - 6}$.",
        "options": [
          "$x = 3, x = -2$",
          "$x = -3, x = 2$",
          "$x = 3$",
          "$x = 6$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor the denominator: $(x - 3)(x + 2)$. Neither factor cancels with the numerator, so both create vertical asymptotes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the $y$-coordinate of a hole in $f(x) = \\frac{x - 1}{x^2 - 1}$, you should plug $x = 1$ into:",
        "options": [
          "The simplified function $\\frac{1}{x + 1}$",
          "The original function",
          "The numerator only",
          "The denominator only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plugging into the original gives $0/0$. Plugging into the simplified version gives the limit ($1/2$), which is the location of the hole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the denominator of a rational function has no real zeros, the graph has:",
        "options": [
          "No vertical asymptotes and no holes",
          "One large hole",
          "Infinitely many asymptotes",
          "A hole at the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Discontinuities in rational functions only occur where the denominator equals zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many holes does $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 5x + 6}{x - 2}$ have?",
        "options": [
          "1",
          "2",
          "0",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor the numerator: $(x - 2)(x - 3)$. The $(x - 2)$ cancels, creating exactly one hole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equation of the vertical asymptote for $f(x) = \\frac{7}{x}$?",

          "$x = 0$",
          "$y = 0$",
          "$x = 7$",
          "None"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The denominator is zero when $x = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a factor $(x + 2)^2$ is in the denominator and $(x + 2)$ is in the numerator, what occurs at $x = -2$?",
        "options": [
          "A vertical asymptote",
          "A hole",
          "An x-intercept",
          "Both a hole and an asymptote"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only one $(x + 2)$ cancels. Since one $(x + 2)$ remains in the denominator, it is a vertical asymptote."
