          "A circle centered at the pole with radius 5",
          "A circle centered at (5, 0) with radius 5",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When r is constant, every point is exactly that distance from the pole, forming a circle."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "r = 3 / sin θ, which means r sin θ = 3. Since y = r sin θ, the equation is y = 3."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since a/b = 10/2 = 5, and 5 ≥ 2, the graph is convex (it looks like a slightly flattened circle)."
