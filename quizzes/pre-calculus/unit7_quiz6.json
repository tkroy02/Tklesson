    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a right triangle, what is the ratio for the tangent of an angle?",
        "options": [
          "Opposite / Adjacent",
          "Opposite / Hypotenuse",
          "Adjacent / Hypotenuse",
          "Hypotenuse / Opposite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent is the 'TOA' in SOH-CAH-TOA, representing Opposite over Adjacent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\sin \\theta = 3/5$ in a right triangle, what is the length of the adjacent side if the hypotenuse is 5?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "3",
          "5",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the Pythagorean theorem $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$: $3^2 + b^2 = 5^2 \\implies 9 + b^2 = 25 \\implies b^2 = 16 \\implies b = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which side of a right triangle is always the longest?",
        "options": [
          "Hypotenuse",
          "Opposite",
          "Adjacent",
          "The vertical side"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hypotenuse is opposite the $90^\\circ$ angle, which is the largest angle in the triangle, making it the longest side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of $\\cos(30^\\circ)$ in a special 30-60-90 triangle?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{3}/2$",
          "1/2",
          "$\\sqrt{2}/2$",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in ratio $1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2$. Cosine of $30^\\circ$ is Adjacent/Hypotenuse, which is $\\sqrt{3}/2$."

          "20°",
          "90°",
          "160°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sine and Cosine are cofunctions, so $\\sin \\theta = \\cos(90^\\circ - \\theta)$. $90^\\circ - 20^\\circ = 70^\\circ$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Height",
          "Horizontal",
          "Half"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'H' consistently refers to the hypotenuse, the side opposite the right angle."

          "12/5",
          "13/5",
          "5/13"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\tan \\theta = \\sin \\theta / \\cos \\theta = (5/13) / (12/13) = 5/12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle can be greater than 1.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. If the opposite side is longer than the adjacent side (as in a $60^\\circ$ angle), the tangent will be greater than 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ladder leans against a wall. The ladder is the hypotenuse. Which trig function relates the ladder's length to the height it reaches on the wall?",

          "Sine",
          "Cosine",
          "Tangent",
          "Cotangent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The height on the wall is the side 'Opposite' the angle at the ground. $\\sin \\theta = \\text{Opposite}/\\text{Hypotenuse}$."

          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an isosceles right triangle, the legs are 1 and the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$. $1/\\sqrt{2}$ rationalizes to $\\sqrt{2}/2$."
