      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes an even function?",
        "options": [
          "$f(-x) = f(x)$",
          "$f(-x) = -f(x)$",
          "$f(x) = -f(x)$",
          "$f(x) = f(-y)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even functions yield the same output when the input is negated, mirroring across the y-axis."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A function has origin symmetry. This function is classified as:",

          "Neither",
          "Both"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Every exponent is even (4, 2, and 0 for the constant term). $f(-x) = (-x)^4 - 3(-x)^2 + 5 = x^4 - 3x^2 + 5$."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$g(-x) = (-x)^3 - (-x) = -x^3 + x = -(x^3 - x)$, which is $-g(x)$."

          "Linear"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because it contains both an even exponent (2) and an odd exponent (1), it will not satisfy the conditions for even or odd symmetry."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which parent function is an odd function?",

          "$f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$"
        ],

          "$-2$",
          "$0$",
          "$-5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For odd functions, $g(-x) = -g(x)$. So $-(-2) = 2$."

          "Neither"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $0 = -0$, it satisfies both $f(-x) = f(x)$ and $f(-x) = -f(x)$."
