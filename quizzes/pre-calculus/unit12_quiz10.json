    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which term in the general equation $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ causes a conic to be rotated?",
        "options": [
          "Bxy",
          "Dx",
          "Ey",
          "F"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'xy' term (the cross-product term) indicates that the axes of the conic are not parallel to the x and y axes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the discriminant $B^2 - 4AC$, identify the conic: $x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 - 6x = 0$.",
        "options": [
          "Parabola",
          "Ellipse",
          "Hyperbola",
          "Circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A=1, B=4, C=4. Discriminant = 4² - 4(1)(4) = 16 - 16 = 0. A discriminant of 0 indicates a parabola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the discriminant $B^2 - 4AC$, identify the conic: $2x^2 - 3xy + 4y^2 + 7 = 0$.",
        "options": [
          "Ellipse",
          "Hyperbola",
          "Parabola",
          "Circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A=2, B=-3, C=4. Discriminant = (-3)² - 4(2)(4) = 9 - 32 = -23. Since -23 < 0, it is an ellipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the discriminant for the conic $x^2 + 6xy + y^2 - 4 = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "32",
          "0",
          "-32",
          "36"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A=1, B=6, C=1. B² - 4AC = 6² - 4(1)(1) = 36 - 4 = 32."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on the discriminant of 32 from the previous question, what type of conic is it?",
        "options": [
          "Hyperbola",
          "Ellipse",
          "Parabola",
          "Circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the discriminant (32) is greater than 0, the conic is a hyperbola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To eliminate the $xy$ term, we solve for $\\theta$ using which formula?",
        "options": [
          "cot(2θ) = (A - C) / B",
          "tan(θ) = B / (A - C)",
          "sin(2θ) = B² - 4AC",
          "cos(θ) = A + C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This trigonometric identity allows us to find the specific angle of rotation that aligns the conic with the standard coordinate axes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $A = C$ in a rotated conic equation, what is the angle of rotation $\\theta$?",
        "options": [
          "45°",
          "90°",
          "0°",
          "30°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If A = C, then cot(2θ) = 0. This means 2θ = 90°, so θ = 45°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A circle can have a $Bxy$ term that results in a rotated appearance.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. A circle looks the same regardless of rotation; therefore, it never has an 'xy' term ($B$ is always 0 for a circle)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of rotated conics, the 'invariant' $A + C$ means:",
        "options": [
          "The sum of A and C remains the same even after rotation.",
          "The value of A must always equal C.",
          "The conic cannot be rotated.",
          "The angle of rotation is always constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Certain values, like $A + C$ and the discriminant, do not change when you rotate the coordinate system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the discriminant is negative and $B=0$, but $A \\neq C$, the shape is a/an:",
        "options": [
          "Non-rotated ellipse",
          "Rotated ellipse",
          "Circle",
          "Hyperbola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since B=0, there is no rotation. A negative discriminant with A ≠ C confirms it is a standard ellipse."
