          "2\\cos^2 \\theta - 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cosine version uses a plus sign with $\\cos(2\\theta)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of power-reducing formulas?",
        "options": [
          "To rewrite a squared trig function as a first-degree trig function.",
          "To find the square root of a trig function.",
          "To double the angle of a sine function.",
          "To solve for the amplitude of a graph."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "They 'reduce' the exponent from 2 to 1, which simplifies many algebraic and calculus-based tasks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you reduce the power of $\\sin^2(3x)$, what will be the angle inside the resulting cosine function?",

          "9x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formula doubles the angle: $2 \\cdot (3x) = 6x$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Rewrite $\\sin^2 \\theta$ using the power-reducing formula.",

          "(1 - \\cos(2\\theta)) / 2",
          "(1 + \\cos(2\\theta)) / 2",
          "1 - \\cos^2 \\theta",
          "2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sine power-reducing formula uses the minus sign: $(1 - \\cos(2\\theta)) / 2$."
      },

        "question": "The formula for $\\tan^2 \\theta$ is the ratio of which two other power-reducing formulas?",

          "2\\tan \\theta / (1 - \\tan² \\theta)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\tan^2 \\theta = \\sin^2 \\theta / \\cos^2 \\theta$, dividing their power-reducing formulas gives $(1 - \\cos 2\\theta) / (1 + \\cos 2\\theta)$."
      },
      {

        "question": "Simplify the expression: $2 \\cos^2(x) - 1$ using power reduction logic.",

          "1",
          "\\cos^2 x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If you plug the power-reducing formula for $\\cos^2 x$ into $2(\\dots) - 1$, the 2s cancel and you are left with $1 + \\cos(2x) - 1 = \\cos(2x)$."
      },

          "Tangent",
          "Secant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both formulas use $\\cos(2\\theta)$ in the numerator; they only differ by the sign (+ or -)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta$ is a power-reducing formula.",

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. That is a Pythagorean identity. While it changes the function, it doesn't reduce the power (exponent)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you apply power-reducing formulas to $\\sin^4 x$, what will be the highest power of $x$ in the first step?",

          "\\cos(2x)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To reduce $\\sin^4 x$, you treat it as $(\\sin^2 x)^2$ and apply the formula to the inside first."

          "\\sqrt{2}/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the reduced form of $\\cos^2(\\pi/4)$. Since $\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2$, squaring it gives $2/4 = 1/2$."
