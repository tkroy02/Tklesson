    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the definition of a rational function?",
        "options": [
          "The ratio of two polynomial functions.",
          "Any function with a square root.",
          "A function that always results in a fraction.",
          "A polynomial with a negative leading coefficient."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A rational function is expressed as $f(x) = P(x)/Q(x)$ where both are polynomials."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the domain of $f(x) = \\frac{x + 5}{x - 2}$?",
        "options": [
          "$(-\\infty, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty)$",
          "$(-\\infty, -5) \\cup (-5, \\infty)$",
          "All real numbers",
          "$(2, \\infty)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The denominator $x - 2$ equals zero when $x = 2$, so $2$ must be excluded from the domain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 + 1}$, what is the domain?",
        "options": [
          "All real numbers",
          "$(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (-1, \\infty)$",
          "$\\{x \\mid x \\neq 1, -1\\}$",
          "$(0, \\infty)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x^2 + 1 = 0$ has no real solutions ($x^2 = -1$), so the denominator is never zero for any real $x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The x-intercepts of a rational function are found by setting the numerator to zero.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A fraction equals zero only when its numerator is zero (provided that value doesn't also make the denominator zero)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is NOT a rational function?",

          "$f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 4}{3}$",
          "$f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$",
          "$f(x) = \\frac{2x + 1}{x^2 - 9}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The numerator $\\sqrt{x}$ is not a polynomial (the exponent is $1/2$), so this is a radical/algebraic function, not purely rational."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the domain of $g(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2 - 9}$?",

          "$\\{x \\mid x \\neq 0\\}$",
          "$\\{x \\mid x \\neq 3\\}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factoring the denominator $(x-3)(x+3)$ shows that both $3$ and $-3$ make the function undefined."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The notation $\\{x \\mid x \\neq c\\}$ is called:",

          "Interval notation",
          "Standard notation",
          "Constraint notation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This notation 'builds' the set by describing the properties the elements must satisfy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the y-intercept of $f(x) = \\frac{x - 4}{x + 2}$?",

          "$-2$",
          "$-4$",
          "$2$",
          "$4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $x = 0$: $f(0) = (0 - 4) / (0 + 2) = -4 / 2 = -2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a value $c$ makes both the numerator and denominator of a rational function zero, what usually occurs at $x = c$?",
        "options": [
          "A hole (removable discontinuity)",
          "A vertical asymptote",
          "An x-intercept",
          "A turning point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a factor cancels out, it creates a hole rather than an asymptotic 'explosion' to infinity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can the domain of a rational function be all real numbers?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, if the denominator is never zero.",
          "No, rational functions always have asymptotes.",
          "Yes, but only if the function is a constant.",
          "No, because $x$ cannot be in the denominator."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the polynomial in the denominator has no real roots (like $x^2 + 4$), the domain is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$."
