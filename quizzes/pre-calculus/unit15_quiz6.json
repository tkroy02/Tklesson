        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While a secant line shows change over an interval, the tangent line shows exactly how fast a function is changing at one specific moment."

          "Tangent line",
          "X-axis",
          "Vertical asymptote",
          "Origin"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the fundamental concept of the derivative: the limit of the secant is the tangent."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the limit definition of slope, what does the variable $h$ usually represent?",
        "options": [
          "The horizontal distance between two points",
          "The height of the function",
          "The slope itself",
          "The y-intercept"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$, $h$ is the 'run' or the change in $x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't we just use the slope formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ to find the tangent slope at a single point $(x, y)$?",

          "It would result in $0/0$ (undefined).",

          "Calculators aren't fast enough."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $x_1 = x_2$, the denominator is $0$. We need limits to handle this indeterminate form."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the slope of the tangent line is positive at a point, what is the function doing?",

          "Increasing",
          "Decreasing",
          "Staying constant",
          "Crossing the x-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A positive slope means the 'rise' is positive as you move right, indicating the function is going up."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a straight line $f(x) = 2x + 3$, what is the slope of the tangent line at $x = 5$?",

          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since a line has a constant slope, the tangent slope at any point is the same as the slope of the line itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the slope of the tangent line at the peak (maximum) of a smooth hill on a graph?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$1$",
          "Infinity",
          "It depends on the height"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the very top of a curve, the tangent line is perfectly horizontal, meaning its slope is $0$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Differential Calculus focuses on derivatives, which are the slopes of tangent lines."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. For example, on a parabola, the slope changes constantly as you move along the curve."
