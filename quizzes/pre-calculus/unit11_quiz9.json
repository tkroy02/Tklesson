      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you multiply $z_1 = 2(\\cos 30^{\\circ} + i \\sin 30^{\\circ})$ and $z_2 = 5(\\cos 40^{\\circ} + i \\sin 40^{\\circ})$, what is the new modulus?",

          "2.5",
          "100"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To multiply complex numbers in trig form, multiply the moduli: 2 * 5 = 10."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the same $z_1$ and $z_2$ from above, what is the argument of the product $z_1z_2$?",

          "70°",
          "10°",
          "1200°",
          "35°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To multiply complex numbers in trig form, add the angles: 30° + 40° = 70°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Divide $z_1 = 12(\\cos 150^{\\circ} + i \\sin 150^{\\circ})$ by $z_2 = 3(\\cos 50^{\\circ} + i \\sin 50^{\\circ})$.",
        "options": [

          "9(cos 100° + i sin 100°)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide the moduli (12 / 3 = 4) and subtract the angles (150° - 50° = 100°)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the result of a division gives an angle of $-20^{\\circ}$, what is the standard positive argument?",

          "200°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Angles are coterminal. Adding 360° to -20° gives the positive equivalent of 340°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: To multiply $z$ by itself ($z^2$), you square the modulus and double the angle.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Based on the multiplication rule: r * r = r² and θ + θ = 2θ."

          "r²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "r / r = 1. This matches the logic that any number divided by itself is 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the angle if you divide $z$ by its conjugate $\\bar{z}$? (Note: Conjugate angle is $-\\theta$)",

          "You get 2θ.",
          "You get 0.",
          "The angle is halved.",
          "The angle becomes negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "θ - (-θ) = 2θ. The resulting angle is twice the original."

          "6 cis π/4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "3 * 2 = 6. π/4 + π/2 = π/4 + 2π/4 = 3π/4."

          "Finding the square root."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing $a+bi$ by $c+di$ requires multiplying the top and bottom by the conjugate of the denominator; the trig form bypasses this tedious step."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $z_1$ has $r=1$, what is the modulus of $z_1 z_2$?",

          "r₂ + 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1 * r₂ = r₂. Multiplying by a complex number with a modulus of 1 only changes the direction (angle), not the length."
