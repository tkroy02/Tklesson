      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the distance between the points $(1, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$?",
        "options": [
          "$5$",
          "$7$",
          "$\\sqrt{7}$",
          "$25$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$d = \\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the midpoint of the segment with endpoints $(-3, 8)$ and $(5, 4)$.",
        "options": [
          "$(1, 6)$",
          "$(2, 12)$",
          "$(4, 2)$",
          "$(1, 4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Midpoint $= ((-3+5)/2, (8+4)/2) = (2/2, 12/2) = (1, 6)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the center and radius of the circle $(x + 2)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 36$?",
        "options": [
          "Center: $(-2, 5)$, Radius: $6$",
          "Center: $(2, -5)$, Radius: $6$",
          "Center: $(-2, 5)$, Radius: $36$",
          "Center: $(2, -5)$, Radius: $36$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formula $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ uses subtractions, so the signs of the center coordinates are opposite of what appears in the parentheses. $r = \\sqrt{36} = 6$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A graph that is symmetric with respect to the y-axis remains unchanged when:",

          "$x$ is replaced with $-x$",
          "$y$ is replaced with $-y$",
          "Both $x$ and $y$ are replaced with $-x$ and $-y$",
          "$x$ and $y$ are swapped"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reflection across the y-axis flips the $x$-values; if the graph looks the same, it has y-axis symmetry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of $\\sqrt{7}$?",

          "$(x-7)^2 + (y-7)^2 = 7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard form at the origin is $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. $(\\sqrt{7})^2 = 7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the distance between $(0, 0)$ and $(-5, 12)$.",

          "$13$",
          "$17$",
          "$\\sqrt{119}$",
          "$7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sqrt{(-5-0)^2 + (12-0)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169} = 13$."

          "$(-a, b)$",
          "$(a, -b)$",
          "$(b, a)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Origin symmetry is a 180-degree rotation, which negates both coordinates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ is symmetric to which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "All of the above",
          "The x-axis",
          "The y-axis",
          "The origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since both $x$ and $y$ are squared, changing their signs doesn't change the equation, meaning it has all three types of symmetry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equation of a circle with center $(3, 0)$ and radius $2$?",

          "$(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4$",
          "$(x + 3)^2 + y^2 = 4$",
          "$x^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 2$",
          "$(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plug $h=3, k=0, r=2$ into the standard form: $(x-3)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 2^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $(2, 5)$ is the midpoint of a segment and one endpoint is $(0, 0)$, what is the other endpoint?",

          "$(4, 10)$",
          "$(1, 2.5)$",
          "$(4, 5)$",
          "$(2, 10)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To get from $(0,0)$ to the midpoint $(2,5)$, you add 2 to $x$ and 5 to $y$. Repeat that step to reach the other end: $(2+2, 5+5) = (4,10)$."
