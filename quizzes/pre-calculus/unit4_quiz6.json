      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in solving $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{x}$?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply every term by the LCD, $2x$.",
          "Subtract $1/2$ from $5/x$.",
          "Cross multiply the first two terms.",
          "Find the square root of $x$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by $2x$ eliminates all fractions in one step: $2 + x = 10$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an 'extraneous solution' in the context of rational equations?",
        "options": [
          "A solution that makes the original denominator zero.",
          "A solution that is a negative number.",
          "A solution that involves an imaginary number.",
          "A solution that is a fraction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Extraneous solutions are algebraically correct results that are invalid because they fall outside the function's domain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{x}{x - 3} = \\frac{3}{x - 3} + 2$.",
        "options": [
          "No solution",
          "$3$",
          "$0$",
          "$-3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by $(x-3)$ gives $x = 3 + 2(x-3) \\implies x = 3 + 2x - 6 \\implies x = 3$. However, $x=3$ makes the original denominator zero, so it is extraneous. No valid solution remains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the LCD for the equation $\\frac{1}{x + 1} + \\frac{2}{x} = 5$?",
        "options": [
          "$x(x + 1)$",
          "$x + 1$",
          "$2x$",
          "$x^2 + x + 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The LCD must contain all unique factors present in the denominators."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are solving $\\frac{2}{x - 4} = \\frac{x}{x - 4}$, what is the value of $x$?",
        "options": [
          "No solution",
          "$2$",
          "$4$",
          "$-4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by $(x-4)$ gives $2 = x$. Since $x=2$ does not make the original denominator zero, it is a valid solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When can you use 'cross-multiplication' to solve a rational equation?",
        "options": [
          "When the equation is a single proportion (one fraction equals one fraction).",
          "Always, for any rational equation.",
          "Only if the denominators are constants.",
          "Only if there are no x-terms in the numerator."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cross-multiplication is a shortcut for multiplying by the LCD specifically when $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}$."

        "type": "mcq",

          "20",
          "2",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply by $x$: $10 = 2x$. Divide by $2$: $x = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which value must be excluded from the domain of $\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2 - x - 6} = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "$3$ and $-2$",
          "$1$ and $-1$",
          "$0$",
          "$6$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The denominator factors into $(x-3)(x+2)$, so $x=3$ and $x=-2$ are excluded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you multiply an equation by $(x - 5)$ and find $x = 5$, what should you do?",
        "options": [
          "Reject the solution as extraneous.",
          "Accept it as the only solution.",
          "Square the solution.",
          "Change the sign to $-5$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the factor you used to clear the denominator becomes zero at your result, that result is invalid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Multiplying by the LCD always results in a linear equation.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the LCD contains $x$ and the numerator contains $x$, you will often end up with a quadratic or higher-degree polynomial equation."
