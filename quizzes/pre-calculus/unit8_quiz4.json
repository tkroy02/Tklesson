      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the five critical points of a trig graph, you should divide the period into how many equal intervals?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "5",
          "2",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing the period into 4 intervals gives you the 5 boundary points (start, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, end) needed for a full cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the parent function $y = \\cos x$, what is the critical point located at $x = \\pi$?",
        "options": [
          "Minimum (\\pi, -1)",
          "Maximum (\\pi, 1)",

          "Y-intercept"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At half a period ($\pi$), the cosine graph reaches its lowest point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the period of a function is $8$, what is the 'step' or distance between each critical x-value?",

          "2",
          "4",
          "8",
          "1"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does a **sine** graph without a vertical shift always begin its cycle at the phase shift?",
        "options": [
          "On the midline (y = 0)",
          "At the maximum",
          "At the minimum",
          "At y = 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parent sine function starts at (0,0); transformations shift this 'midline start' to $(h, k)$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does a **positive cosine** graph begin its cycle at the phase shift?",

          "At the maximum",
          "At the minimum",
          "On the midline",
          "At the origin"
"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parent cosine function starts at (0,1), which is its maximum value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $y = -2 \\cos x$, what is the first critical point (at $x=0$)?",
        "options": [
          "Minimum (0, -2)",
          "Maximum (0, 2)",
          "Midline (0, 0)",
          "Intercept (0, -1)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative 'a' value reflects the graph. Since cosine usually starts at a max, a reflected cosine starts at a min."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A function has a phase shift of $\\pi$ and a period of $2\\pi$. What is the $x$-value of the final point in the first cycle?",

          "3π",
          "2π",
          "π",
          "4π"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Start ($h$) + Period = $\\pi + 2\\pi = 3\\pi$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the $y$-values of the critical points if the amplitude is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "Max and min points move further from the midline.",
          "The midline points move up.",
          "The period gets shorter.",
          "The graph shifts right."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amplitude only affects vertical distance from the midline; midline crossings (zeros) stay put."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which critical points are affected by a vertical shift $k$?",

          "All of them.",
          "Only the max and min.",
          "Only the midline points.",
          "None of them."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertical shift moves the entire 'skeleton' of the graph up or down."
