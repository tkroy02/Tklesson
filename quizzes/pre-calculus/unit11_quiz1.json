    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Solving oblique triangles using proportions",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Law of Sines is best suited for which triangle configuration?",
        "options": [
          "ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)",
          "SSS (Side-Side-Side)",
          "SAS (Side-Angle-Side)",
          "Right Triangles only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ASA and AAS provide the necessary side-angle pairs to set up a Law of Sines proportion immediately."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In triangle ABC, if A = 40°, B = 60°, and side c = 10, what is the first step to find side a?",
        "options": [
          "Find angle C by calculating 180 - (40 + 60).",
          "Use the Pythagorean theorem.",
          "Set up the ratio 10/sin(40).",
          "Assume it is a right triangle."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To use the Law of Sines, you need a side and its opposite angle. Since you only have side c, you must first find angle C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for side b if B = 30°, A = 45°, and a = 12.",
        "options": [
          "12 * sin(30°) / sin(45°)",
          "12 * sin(45°) / sin(30°)",
          "12 / sin(75°)",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From a/sin A = b/sin B, we get 12/sin(45°) = b/sin(30°). Multiplying both sides by sin(30°) isolates b."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The Law of Sines can be written as sin A / a = sin B / b.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. You can invert the entire proportion as long as you do it to every term."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If angle A is 90°, what does the Law of Sines formula a/sin A = b/sin B simplify to?",
        "options": [
          "sin B = b / a",
          "a² = b² + c²",
          "tan B = b / a",
          "a = b"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since sin(90°) = 1, the formula becomes a/1 = b/sin B, which simplifies to sin B = b/a (the standard SOH-CAH-TOA definition)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary requirement to use the Law of Sines?",
        "options": [
          "Knowing at least one side and its opposite angle.",
          "Knowing all three sides.",
          "Knowing all three angles.",
          "The triangle must be obtuse."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without a complete side-angle 'pair', you cannot set up a proportion with only one unknown."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In triangle ABC, side a = 5, A = 30°, and B = 150°. Is this triangle possible?",
        "options": [
          "No, because the angles sum to 180° without the third angle.",
          "Yes, it is an obtuse triangle.",
          "Yes, but only if c is very small.",
          "No, because sin(150°) is negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sum of the angles in a triangle must be exactly 180°. If A + B = 180°, there is no room for angle C, so the triangle cannot exist."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate side c if C = 100°, A = 30°, and a = 10. (Round to nearest tenth)",
        "options": [
          "19.7",
          "5.1",
          "10.2",
          "15.4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "c = (10 * sin 100°) / sin 30° ≈ (10 * 0.9848) / 0.5 = 19.696."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is NOT a case where Law of Sines is the primary tool?",
        "options": [
          "SSS",
          "AAS",
          "ASA",
          "SSA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "SSS (Side-Side-Side) provides no angles, making it impossible to use the Law of Sines proportions. Law of Cosines is used for SSS."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it often better to solve for the smallest angle first in the Law of Sines?",
        "options": [
          "Small angles are never obtuse, avoiding the ambiguous case.",
          "Small angles have larger sines.",
          "It makes the cross-multiplication easier.",
          "It's just a convention; it doesn't actually matter."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Calculators only return acute angles for arcsin. Since a triangle can have at most one obtuse angle, it must be the largest one. Solving for small angles first keeps things predictable."
