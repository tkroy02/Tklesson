      {

        "question": "What is the probability of rolling a $4$ on a standard $6$-sided die?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{6}$",
          "$\\frac{4}{6}$",

          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There is $1$ favorable outcome (the $4$) out of $6$ total possible outcomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the probability of rain is $0.3$, what is the probability that it will NOT rain?",

          "$0.7$",
          "$0.3$",
          "$1.3$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement is $1$. $1 - 0.3 = 0.7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bag contains $3$ red marbles and $7$ blue marbles. What is the probability of picking a red marble?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total marbles = $10$. Favorable (red) = $3$. Probability = $3/10$."

          "$\\frac{1}{8}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The events are independent. $P(H) \\times P(H) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$."

          "$P(A) + P(B)$",
          "$P(A) \\times P(B)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mutually exclusive means the events cannot happen at the same time, so the probability of both is zero."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You roll two dice. How many total outcomes are in the sample space?",

          "$6$",
          "$24$"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the counting principle: $6 \\times 6 = 36$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A card is drawn from a deck. What is the probability it is either a Heart or a Spade?",

          "$\\frac{2}{13}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are mutually exclusive. $\\frac{13}{52} + \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$\\frac{1}{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Favorable outcomes are $6, 7,$ and $8$. That is $3$ outcomes out of $8$."
