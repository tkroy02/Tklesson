    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which triangle configuration requires the Law of Cosines as the first step?",
        "options": [
          "SSS (Side-Side-Side)",
          "ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)",
          "AAS (Angle-Angle-Side)",
          "SSA (Side-Side-Angle)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "SSS provides no angles, meaning no side-angle pair exists to set up a Law of Sines proportion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If angle C is exactly 90°, what does the Law of Cosines $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$ simplify to?",
        "options": [
          "c² = a² + b²",
          "c = a + b",
          "c² = a² + b² - 2ab",
          "c² = a² + b² + 2ab"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\cos(90°) = 0$, the term $-2ab \\cos C$ becomes 0, leaving the Pythagorean Theorem."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an SSS case with sides $a=7, b=10, c=15$, which angle should you solve for first?",
        "options": [
          "Angle C (opposite side c)",
          "Angle A (opposite side a)",
          "Angle B (opposite side b)",
          "It doesn't matter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Always solve for the largest angle first (opposite the longest side) because $\\arccos$ can correctly identify if that angle is obtuse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for side $a$ if $b=5, c=8,$ and $A=60^{\\circ}$.",
        "options": [
          "7",
          "√129",
          "√39",
          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a^2 = 5^2 + 8^2 - 2(5)(8)\\cos(60°)$. $a^2 = 25 + 64 - 80(0.5) = 89 - 40 = 49$. Thus, $a = 7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct rearrangement to solve for $\\cos B$?",
        "options": [
          "cos B = (a² + c² - b²) / (2ac)",
          "cos B = (a² + b² - c²) / (2ab)",
          "cos B = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)",
          "cos B = (a² + c² + b²) / (2ac)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Starting from $b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \\cos B$, isolate the cosine term to get $(a^2 + c^2 - b^2) / 2ac$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\cos A$ results in a negative value (e.g., -0.5), what does this tell you about angle A?",
        "options": [
          "Angle A is obtuse (greater than 90°).",
          "The triangle is impossible.",
          "Angle A is negative.",
          "You made a calculation error; cosines are always positive in triangles."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the interval $[0, 180°]$, cosine is negative only in Quadrant II ($90° < A < 180°$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: After using Law of Cosines to find a missing side in an SAS triangle, you can use Law of Sines to find the remaining angles.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Once you have the third side, you have a side-angle pair, which makes Law of Sines the faster option for the rest of the triangle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for angle A if $a=5, b=5, c=5$ (an equilateral triangle).",

          "60°",
          "90°",
          "45°",
          "30°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\cos A = (5^2 + 5^2 - 5^2) / (2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5) = 25 / 50 = 0.5$. $\\arccos(0.5) = 60°$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $b^2 + c^2 < a^2$, what kind of triangle is it?",

          "Obtuse",
          "Acute",
          "Right",
          "Isosceles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the square of the longest side is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two, the angle opposite it must be greater than $90°$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is SSS the most common use for Law of Cosines in navigation?",
        "options": [
          "It's easy to measure distances between three points, but hard to measure the angles.",
          "It calculates the speed of the vessel.",
          "It only works for flat surfaces.",
          "It prevents the ship from sinking."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In mapping, we often have physical distances (sides) but need to calculate headings (angles) to travel correctly."
