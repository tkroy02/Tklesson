        "question": "A 20-foot ladder leans against a building, making a $60^\\circ$ angle with the ground. Which function finds the height the ladder reaches?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sin(60^\\circ)$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ladder is the hypotenuse (20) and the height is the opposite side. $\\sin \\theta = \\text{Opposite}/\\text{Hypotenuse}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the 'Angle of Depression' measured from?",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal line looking downward.",
          "A vertical line looking downward.",

          "The object itself to the origin."
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "100 feet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $45^\\circ$, the opposite and adjacent sides are equal ($\\tan(45^\\circ) = 1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The angle of elevation from Point A to Point B is equal to the angle of depression from Point B to Point A.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "They are alternate interior angles between two parallel horizontal lines, so they are always congruent."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A surveyor needs to find the width of a river. They measure a distance along the bank (adjacent) and an angle to a point on the opposite bank. Which function is best?",

          "Tangent",
          "Sine",

          "Cosecant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The width is the 'Opposite' side and the distance along the bank is 'Adjacent'. TOA uses Tangent."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a shadow is shorter than the object casting it, what can you say about the angle of elevation of the sun?",
        "options": [
          "It is greater than $45^\\circ$.",
          "It is less than $45^\\circ$.",

          "It is $90^\\circ$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\tan \\theta = \\text{Height}/\\text{Shadow}$. If Height > Shadow, $\\tan \\theta > 1$, which occurs when $\\theta > 45^\\circ$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A kite string is 100m long and makes a $30^\\circ$ angle with the horizontal. How high is the kite?",

          "50$\\sqrt{3}$ m",
          "100 m",
          "200 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Height = $100 \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = 100 \\times 0.5 = 50$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a right triangle application, what does the 'hypotenuse' typically represent?",
        "options": [
          "A direct line-of-sight distance.",
          "The height of a building.",
          "The distance along the ground.",
          "The horizontal beam."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hypotenuse usually represents a diagonal path, like a ladder, a string, or a direct line-of-sight."
