    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which constant relationship defines an ellipse?",
        "options": [
          "The sum of distances to two foci is constant.",
          "The difference of distances to two foci is constant.",
          "The distance to a focus equals the distance to a directrix.",
          "The product of distances to two foci is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An ellipse is defined by a constant sum of distances. If you pinned a string at two foci and traced it with a pencil, you would draw an ellipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $\\frac{x^2}{25} + \\frac{y^2}{16} = 1$, what is the value of 'a'?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "25",
          "4",
          "16"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an ellipse, 'a' is the square root of the larger denominator. Since 25 > 16, $a^2 = 25$, so $a = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the equation $\\frac{x^2}{9} + \\frac{y^2}{49} = 1$, which way is the major axis oriented?",
        "options": [
          "Vertically",
          "Horizontally",
          "Diagonally",
          "It is a circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The larger denominator (49) is under the y-term, meaning the ellipse is stretched more vertically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between a, b, and c in an ellipse?",
        "options": [
          "c² = a² - b²",
          "c² = a² + b²",
          "a² = b² - c²",
          "a + b = c"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an ellipse, 'a' is the longest distance (hypotenuse logic), so $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the length of the major axis for the ellipse $\\frac{(x-1)^2}{100} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{64} = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "20",
          "10",
          "16",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a^2 = 100$, so $a = 10$. The total length of the major axis is $2a$, which is 20."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the coordinates of the center for $\\frac{(x+3)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y-5)^2}{9} = 1$.",
        "options": [
          "(-3, 5)",
          "(3, -5)",
          "(4, 9)",
          "(2, 3)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The center is $(h, k)$ from the formula $(x-h)$ and $(y-k)$. So, $h = -3$ and $k = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'eccentricity' (e) of a circle?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "Infinity",
          "0.5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Eccentricity is $e = c/a$. In a circle, the foci are at the center, so $c = 0$, making $e = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $a=13$ and $b=5$, where are the foci located relative to the center?",
        "options": [
          "12 units away",
          "8 units away",
          "18 units away",
          "√194 units away"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$c^2 = 13^2 - 5^2 = 169 - 25 = 144$. Thus, $c = 12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The foci always lie on the major axis.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. The major axis is defined as the line containing the foci and the vertices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would produce an ellipse that is nearly circular?",
        "options": [
          "An eccentricity close to 0",
          "An eccentricity close to 1",
          "A very large 'a' value",
          "A very small 'b' value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Eccentricity measures how 'flat' an ellipse is. Close to 0 means the foci are almost at the same point (the center)."
