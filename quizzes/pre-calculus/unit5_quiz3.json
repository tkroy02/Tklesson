    "topic": "Switching between exponential and logarithmic forms",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the logarithmic form of $2^3 = 8$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\log_{2}(8) = 3$",
          "$\\log_{8}(2) = 3$",
          "$\\log_{3}(8) = 2$",
          "$\\log_{2}(3) = 8$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base of the exponent (2) becomes the base of the log; the exponent (3) is the result of the log."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate $\\log_{5}(25)$.",

          "125"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The question is: '5 raised to what power equals 25?' Since $5^2 = 25$, the answer is 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the domain of $f(x) = \\log_{b}(x)$?",

          "$(0, \\infty)$",
          "$(-\\infty, \\infty)$",
          "$[0, \\infty)$",
          "$(1, \\infty)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You cannot take the logarithm of zero or a negative number because a positive base raised to any power is always positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the vertical asymptote of $f(x) = \\log_{3}(x)$?",

          "$x = 0$",
          "$y = 0$",
          "$x = 3$",
          "$y = 3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $x$ approaches 0 from the right, the logarithm shoots down toward $-\\infty$."

          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any base raised to the 0 power equals 1, so $\\log_{b}(1) = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of $\\log_{2}(1/4)$?",

          "-2",
          "2",
          "-1/2",
          "1/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$2^{-2} = 1 / 2^2 = 1/4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = 10^x$, what is $f^{-1}(x)$?",

          "$\\frac{1}{10^x}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The inverse of an exponential function with base 10 is the common logarithm (base 10)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate $3^{\\log_{3}(7)}$.",

          "3",
          "21",
          "49"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since exponentials and logs are inverses, they 'undo' each other: $b^{\\log_{b}(x)} = x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which point must lie on the graph of $f(x) = \\log_{b}(x)$?",

          "$(0, 1)$",
          "$(0, 0)$",
          "$(b, 0)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $b^0 = 1$ is the point $(0, 1)$ for exponents, the inverse point $(1, 0)$ is always on the log graph."

          "7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convert to exponential form: $4^3 = x$, so $x = 64$."
