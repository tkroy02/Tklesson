    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When verifying an identity, which of the following is a 'golden rule'?",
        "options": [
          "Work on only one side of the equation.",
          "Add the same value to both sides.",
          "Cross-multiply immediately.",
          "Square both sides to remove radicals."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To verify an identity, you must transform one side until it matches the other side exactly, rather than treating it like a standard algebraic equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which identity would you use to simplify $\\sec^2 x - 1$?",
        "options": [
          "tan² x",
          "cos² x",
          "sin² x",
          "cot² x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Based on the Pythagorean Identity $1 + \\tan^2 x = \\sec^2 x$, subtracting 1 from both sides leaves $\\tan^2 x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify the expression: $(\\sin x)(\\cot x)$.",
        "options": [
          "cos x",
          "tan x",
          "1",
          "csc x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\cot x = \\cos x / \\sin x$, the $\\sin x$ terms cancel out, leaving $\\cos x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in simplifying $\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} + \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}$?",
        "options": [
          "Find a common denominator.",
          "Cancel the cosines.",
          "Multiply by sin x.",
          "Square the entire expression."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When adding fractions in trig, finding a common denominator (which would be $\\sin x \\cos x$) is almost always the best first move."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The expression $(1 - \\cos^2 x)(1 + \\cot^2 x)$ simplifies to:",

          "1",
          "sin² x",
          "cos² x",
          "tan² x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$1 - \\cos^2 x = \\sin^2 x$ and $1 + \\cot^2 x = \\csc^2 x$. Since $\\sin^2 x \\cdot \\csc^2 x = 1$, the expression equals 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can you rewrite $\\frac{1}{1 - \\sin x}$ to help verify an identity?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (1 + sin x).",
          "Change it to 1 + csc x.",
          "Square it.",
          "It cannot be simplified."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying by the conjugate creates a difference of squares ($1 - \\sin^2 x$) in the denominator, which can be turned into $\\cos^2 x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "tan² x",
          "sec² x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor out $\\cos^2 x$: $\\cos^2 x(1 + \\tan^2 x)$. Since $1 + \\tan^2 x = \\sec^2 x$, you get $\\cos^2 x \\cdot \\sec^2 x = 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: $\\sin(x + y) = \\sin x + \\sin y$.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Trig functions do not distribute over addition. This is a common error that we will address with Sum/Difference formulas later."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of factoring $\\sin^4 x - \\cos^4 x$?",

          "sin² x + cos² x",
          "(sin x - cos x)⁴",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It's a difference of squares: $(\\sin^2 x - \\cos^2 x)(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x)$. Since the second part is 1, it simplifies to $\\sin^2 x - \\cos^2 x$."
      },

          "sec x",
          "1 - sin x"
