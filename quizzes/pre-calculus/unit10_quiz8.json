      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The height of a tide is modeled by $h(t) = 4\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t) + 5$. To find when the tide is exactly 7 feet, what is the first algebraic step?",
        "options": [
          "Set h(t) to 7 and subtract 5.",
          "Multiply the entire equation by 6.",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A weight on a spring oscillates according to $d(t) = 10\\sin(2t)$. At what value of $t$ (in the first cycle) does the weight first reach 5 cm?",

        "options": [
          "The temperature rises in spring and falls in autumn.",
          "The sine function only has one solution per year.",
          "Because the model is quadratic.",
          "It is a calculation error; there is only one solution."

          "To find all solutions within a specific timeframe (like 24 hours).",
          "To determine the amplitude.",
          "To calculate the vertical shift.",
          "To find the y-intercept."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period tells you how often the cycle repeats, helping you find all relevant times a value occurs."

          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
