    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When sketching a rational function, what should you draw first as a 'guide' for the curves?",
        "options": [
          "The asymptotes",
          "The y-intercept",
          "The holes",
          "The turning points"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Asymptotes act as the boundaries that define the shape and regions of the graph."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a rational function has an x-intercept at $(3, 0)$ and a vertical asymptote at $x = 1$, can the graph exist between $x=1$ and $x=3$?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, the graph exists everywhere except at $x = 1$.",
          "No, the graph must stay on one side of the intercept.",
          "Only if there is a hole at $x = 2$.",
          "No, because the vertical asymptote blocks it."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The graph exists in all intervals of the domain. It will simply approach the asymptote at $x = 1$ and pass through the intercept at $x = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the graph as it approaches a hole?",
        "options": [
          "The graph is continuous except for a single missing point.",
          "The graph shoots off to infinity.",
          "The graph stops and restarts at a different y-value.",
          "The graph crosses the x-axis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A hole is a 'removable' discontinuity; the path of the graph is predictable, but that specific point is undefined."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To determine if the graph of $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-2}$ is above or below the x-axis for $x < 2$, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Test a value like $x = 0$.",
          "Look at the horizontal asymptote.",
          "Find the y-intercept.",
          "Check the degree of the numerator."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Testing a point in the interval (like $f(0) = -1/2$) tells you the graph is below the axis in that region."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many x-intercepts can a rational function have?",
        "options": [
          "Any number, depending on the degree of the numerator.",
          "Exactly one.",
          "At most two.",
          "None, they always have asymptotes instead."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The number of x-intercepts is determined by the number of real zeros in the numerator that are not also zeros of the denominator."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, what is the 'end behavior' on the graph?",
        "options": [
          "The graph flattens toward the x-axis ($y = 0$).",
          "The graph follows a diagonal line.",
          "The graph goes to infinity.",
          "The graph becomes a horizontal line at $y = 1$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This describes a bottom-heavy function where the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A rational function can have multiple y-intercepts.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A function can have at most one y-intercept, found by evaluating $f(0)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the graph of $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}$, what does the graph look like?",
        "options": [
          "A line with a hole at $x = 3$.",
          "A parabola with a hole at $x = 3$.",
          "A curve with a vertical asymptote at $x = 3$.",
          "A line with an x-intercept at $x = 3$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $(x^2 - 9) / (x - 3)$ simplifies to $(x + 3)$, the graph looks exactly like the line $y = x + 3$ but has a hole where the original denominator was zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a vertical asymptote has 'even multiplicity' (e.g., from a denominator factor like $(x-2)^2$), the graph will:",
        "options": [
          "Go in the same direction on both sides of the asymptote (both up or both down).",
          "Go in opposite directions on either side.",
          "Cross the asymptote.",
          "Have a hole instead."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Similar to zeros, the squared factor means the sign doesn't change when crossing the boundary $x=2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the best way to find if a graph crosses its horizontal asymptote?",
        "options": [
          "Set the function equal to the horizontal asymptote value and solve for $x$.",
          "It is impossible to cross a horizontal asymptote.",
          "Look at the leading coefficients.",
          "Check the vertical asymptotes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solving $f(x) = L$ (where $L$ is the asymptote value) will tell you exactly where the intersection occurs."
