    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The graph of $f^{-1}$ is a reflection of the graph of $f$ across which line?",
        "options": [
          "$y = x$",
          "The x-axis",
          "The y-axis",
          "$y = -x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since inverses swap x and y, the geometric result is a reflection over the diagonal line $y = x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the graph of $f$ is a line with a slope of $3$, what is the slope of the graph of $f^{-1}$?",
        "options": [
          "$1/3$",
          "$-3$",
          "$-1/3$",
          "$3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $f(x) = 3x$, then $f^{-1}(x) = x/3$. The slopes of inverse linear functions are reciprocals of each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A function $f$ passes through the point $(-2, 5)$. Where does the reflected point on $f^{-1}$ lie?",
        "options": [
          "$(5, -2)$",
          "$(2, -5)$",
          "$(-5, 2)$",
          "$(2, 5)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Every point $(x, y)$ on $f$ maps to $(y, x)$ on $f^{-1}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a function is its own inverse, its graph must be symmetric with respect to:",
        "options": [
          "The line $y = x$",
          "The origin",
          "The y-axis",
          "The x-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A function like $f(x) = 1/x$ is symmetric across $y = x$, meaning reflecting it doesn't change its shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ exists only in Quadrant I. In which quadrant does its inverse $f^{-1}(x) = x^2$ (restricted to $x \\ge 0$) exist?",
        "options": [
          "Quadrant I",
          "Quadrant II",
          "Quadrant III",
          "Quadrant IV"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Swapping positive $x$ and $y$ values still results in positive $x$ and $y$ values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x)$ has an x-intercept at $(4, 0)$, what intercept must $f^{-1}(x)$ have?",
        "options": [
          "A y-intercept at $(0, 4)$",
          "An x-intercept at $(-4, 0)$",
          "A y-intercept at $(0, -4)$",
          "An x-intercept at $(0, 4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The x-intercept of the original becomes the y-intercept of the inverse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following parent function graphs is NOT a reflection of itself across $y = x$?",
        "options": [
          "$f(x) = x^2$",
          "$f(x) = x$",
          "$f(x) = 1/x$",
          "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x^2$ is symmetric across the y-axis, not the line $y = x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When sketching the inverse of a graph, if the original curve is 'concave up,' the reflected curve will appear to be:",
        "options": [
          "Facing the y-axis (opening right/left)",
          "Concave down",
          "A straight line",
          "An S-shape"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reflecting a vertical 'U' shape across $y=x$ turns it into a sideways 'C' or 'U' shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f$ and $f^{-1}$ intersect at a point where $x = 5$, what is the $y$-value at that point?",
        "options": [
          "$5$",
          "$-5$",
          "$0$",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intersection points between a function and its inverse must lie on the line $y = x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To graph an inverse, you can rotate the original graph $90^{\\circ}$ and then reflect it. Which reflection is needed?",
        "options": [
          "Reflect across the y-axis",
          "Reflect across the x-axis",
          "Reflect across the origin",
          "No reflection is needed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a common visualization technique: rotating $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise and reflecting across the y-axis is equivalent to a reflection across $y=x$."
