      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given $f(x) = \\begin{cases} 2x + 1 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\ x^2 & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\end{cases}$, find $f(-3)$.",
        "options": [

          "$9$",
          "$-7$",
          "$7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $-3 < 0$, we use the first rule: $2(-3) + 1 = -6 + 1 = -5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the same function $f(x) = \\begin{cases} 2x + 1 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\ x^2 & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\end{cases}$, find $f(4)$.",
        "options": [

          "$9$",
          "$1$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $4 \\ge 0$, we use the second rule: $4^2 = 16$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a graph of a piecewise function, what does an open circle represent?",
        "options": [
          "The point is not included in the graph (strict inequality).",
          "The point is the origin.",
          "The function is undefined everywhere.",
          "The point is included in the graph."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An open circle indicates a boundary that is approached but not reached (associated with $<$ or $>$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate $g(2)$ for $g(x) = \\begin{cases} x - 5 & x \\le 2 \\\\ 10 & x > 2 \\end{cases}$",

          "$7$",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'equal to' part of the constraint is in the first rule ($x \\le 2$), so $2 - 5 = -3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which parent function can actually be written as a piecewise function: $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & x \\ge 0 \\\\ -x & x < 0 \\end{cases}$?",
        "options": [
          "Absolute Value: $|x|$",
          "Quadratic: $x^2$",
          "Reciprocal: $1/x$",
          "Identity: $x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The absolute value function is defined by its distance from zero, which is $x$ for positive numbers and the negation of $x$ for negative numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a piecewise function has a jump where one piece ends and another begins, the function is said to be:",

          "Discontinuous",
          "Continuous",
          "Linear",
          "Symmetric"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 'break' or 'jump' in the graph means you have to lift your pencil to draw it, indicating a discontinuity."

          "Undefined",
          "$1$",
          "$-1$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zero is not included in either the $x < 0$ or $x > 0$ domain, so the function is undefined at $x = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell phone plan costs $\\$30$ for up to $2$ GB and $\\$10$ for each extra GB. Which represents the cost $C$ for $x$ GB (where $x > 2$)?",
        "options": [
          "$30 + 10(x - 2)$",
          "$30 + 10x$",
          "$40x$",
          "$10x - 30$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base cost is $\\$30$, and you only pay the $\\$10$ rate for the amount over $2$ GB, which is $(x - 2)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When graphing the piece $y = 3$ for $x > 5$, you should draw:",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal ray starting with an open circle at $(5, 3)$.",
          "A vertical line at $x = 5$.",
          "A horizontal line through the origin.",
          "A point at $(5, 3)$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since it is a constant $y=3$ for all $x$ larger than 5, it is a ray extending to the right from an open boundary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can a piecewise function be even or odd?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, if its pieces and domains are symmetric.",
          "No, piecewise functions are always asymmetric.",
          "Only if all pieces are linear.",
          "Only if there is only one piece."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As long as the overall graph satisfies the symmetry tests, it doesn't matter that it's defined in pieces."
