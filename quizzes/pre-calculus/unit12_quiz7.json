      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the center of the circle given by $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 36$?",
        "options": [
          "(-4, 7)",
          "(4, -7)",
          "(-4, -7)",
          "(6, 6)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The center is (h, k) from (x-h)² + (y-k)². Here, h = -4 and k = 7."

          "5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "r² = 50, so r = √50 = √(25 * 2) = 5√2."

          "(4, 3)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The center is the midpoint of the diameter: ((0+6)/2, (0+8)/2) = (3, 4)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Convert $x^2 + y^2 - 10x = 0$ to standard form.",
