      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are using synthetic division to divide a polynomial by $(x + 4)$, what number goes in the 'box'?",
        "options": [
          "$-4$",
          "$4$",

          "$1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The divisor must be in the form $(x - c)$, so for $(x + 4)$, $c = -4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In synthetic division, what do you do with the first coefficient of the dividend?",
        "options": [
          "Bring it straight down to the bottom row.",
          "Multiply it by the value in the box.",

          "Divide it by $x$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The process always begins by dropping the leading coefficient unchanged to the bottom row."

          "5",
          "2"

          "$1, -3, 6$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Place 2 in the box. Coefficients: $1, -5, 6$. Drop 1. $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. Add: $-5 + 2 = -3$. $2 \\cdot -3 = -6$. Add: $6 + (-6) = 0$. Bottom row: $1, -3, 0$."

          "$1, 8, 0, 0$"

        "question": "True or False: Synthetic division can be used to divide $P(x)$ by $x^2 + 1$.",

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the bottom row of a synthetic division (dividing a cubic by $x-c$) is $2, 5, -1, 4$, what is the quotient?",
        "options": [
          "$2x^2 + 5x - 1 + \\frac{4}{x-c}$",
          "$2x^3 + 5x^2 - x + 4$",

          "$2, 5, -1, 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The numbers represent coefficients of a polynomial one degree lower (quadratic) plus the remainder over the divisor."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the remainder in synthetic division is $0$, what does this tell you about the number in the 'box'?",

          "It is a zero (root) of the polynomial.",
          "It is the y-intercept.",
          "It is a vertical asymptote.",
          "The division was done incorrectly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By the Factor Theorem, a remainder of zero means $P(c) = 0$, so $c$ is a root."
