          "1/2 * ab * sin C",
          "The Law of Sines"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since all three sides are known (SSS), Heron's Formula is the direct way to find the area without calculating an angle first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the area of a triangle where side a = 6, b = 10, and angle C = 30°.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area = 1/2 * a * b * sin C = 1/2 * 6 * 10 * sin(30°) = 30 * 0.5 = 15."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Heron's Formula, what does the variable 's' represent?",
        "options": [
          "The semi-perimeter (half of the perimeter).",
          "The total side length.",
          "The slope of the largest side.",
          "The area of the square root."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "s stands for semi-perimeter, calculated as (a + b + c) / 2."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the semi-perimeter 's' of a triangle is 12 and the sides are 6, 8, and 10, what is the expression for the area?",
        "options": [
          "√(12 * 6 * 4 * 2)",
          "√(12 * 18 * 20 * 22)",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), we get √(12(12-6)(12-8)(12-10)) = √(12 * 6 * 4 * 2)."

          "6",
          "12",
          "7.5",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a right triangle (3² + 4² = 5²), so Area = 1/2 * 3 * 4 = 6. Heron's Formula would also yield 6."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The formula Area = 1/2 * ab * sin C works even if angle C is obtuse.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. The sine of an obtuse angle is the same as the sine of its supplement, providing the correct height for the area calculation."

          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area = 1/2 * 4 * 4 * sin(60°) = 8 * (√3 / 2) = 4√3."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is Heron's Formula useful in land surveying?",
        "options": [
          "You can find the area of a plot of land just by measuring the boundary lengths.",
          "It calculates the elevation of the land.",
          "It accounts for the curvature of the earth.",
          "It determines the soil quality."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heron's Formula allows you to find the area of any triangular plot without needing to stand in the middle to measure a height or an internal angle."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If angle C = 90° in the formula Area = 1/2 * ab * sin C, what happens?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes the standard 1/2 * base * height.",
          "The area becomes 0.",
          "The formula fails.",
          "The area equals ab."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since sin(90°) = 1, the formula simplifies to 1/2 * ab, where a and b are the base and height (the legs of the right triangle)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double all the side lengths of a triangle, what happens to the area?",
        "options": [
          "The area quadruples (4x).",
          "The area doubles (2x).",
          "The area stays the same.",
          "The area triples (3x)."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In 2D geometry, scaling linear dimensions by k scales the area by k². Doubling the sides (k=2) makes the area 2² = 4 times larger."
