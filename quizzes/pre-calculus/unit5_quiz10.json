        "question": "Which of these scenarios is best modeled by a logistic function rather than an exponential growth function?",
        "options": [
          "A population of fish in a small pond with limited food.",
          "Money in a savings account with a fixed interest rate.",

          "The increase in distance traveled at a constant speed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Logistic models are used when there are environmental limits (carrying capacity) that prevent infinite growth."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Half-Life' of a substance is the time it takes for exactly half of the material to decay. If you have $100g$ of a substance with a half-life of 10 years, how much is left after 20 years?",

          "25g",
          "50g",
          "0g",
          "12.5g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After 10 years (one half-life), 50g remains. After another 10 years (two half-lives), half of that remains, which is 25g."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the logistic model $y = \\frac{c}{1 + ae^{-bx}}$, what happens to the term $ae^{-bx}$ as $x$ gets very large?",

          "It approaches c."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $e^{-bx}$ is a decay term, it goes to zero as $x$ increases, leaving the function as $c/1$."

          "False"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the core definition of exponential growth: the more you have, the faster you grow."
