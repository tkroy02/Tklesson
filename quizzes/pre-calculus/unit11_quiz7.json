      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plane is flying at 500 mph North, but a wind is blowing 50 mph East. What is the plane's actual groundspeed?",
        "options": [
          "√252,500 ≈ 502.5 mph",
          "550 mph",
          "450 mph",
          "500 mph"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The velocity is a right triangle with legs 500 and 50. Use the Pythagorean theorem: √(500² + 50²) = √(250,000 + 2,500)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a force $\\mathbf{F} = \\langle 10, 20 \\rangle$ moves an object along displacement $\\mathbf{d} = \\langle 5, 2 \\rangle$, how much work is done?",
        "options": [
          "90",
          "50",
          "40",
          "⟨50, 40⟩"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work is the dot product: (10 * 5) + (20 * 2) = 50 + 40 = 90."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two forces of 10 N and 15 N act on an object at an angle of 0° (same direction). What is the magnitude of the resultant force?",

          "25 N",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When vectors point in the exact same direction, their magnitudes simply add together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the work formula $W = \\|\\mathbf{F}\\| \\|\\mathbf{d}\\| \\cos \\theta$, what happens if the force is applied perpendicular to the direction of motion?",
        "options": [
          "Work is 0.",
          "Work is maximized.",
          "Work is negative.",
          "The object speeds up."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the angle is 90°, cos(90°) = 0, meaning no work is done (e.g., carrying a heavy box horizontally—the upward force doesn't contribute to the horizontal displacement)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A boat's motor pushes it at 20 knots at a bearing of 90° (East). A current pushes it at 5 knots at 270° (West). What is the resultant velocity?",
        "options": [
          "15 knots East",
          "25 knots East",
          "20 knots East",
          "15 knots West"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vectors are in opposite directions. 20 - 5 = 15 knots in the original direction (East)."

        "question": "True or False: The 'Resultant Vector' is simply the sum of all individual vector components acting on an object.",

          "False"
        ],

          "The unit vector ⟨1, 1⟩",
          "Gravity",
          "It depends on the mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium means all forces cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the magnitude of the resultant force if $\\mathbf{F_1} = 3\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mathbf{j}$ and $\\mathbf{F_2} = 5\\mathbf{i} + 4\\mathbf{j}$.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resultant = (3+5)i + (2+4)j = 8i + 6j. Magnitude = √(8² + 6²) = √(64 + 36) = √100 = 10."
