      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A company has fixed costs of $\\$2000$ and a production cost of $\\$15$ per unit. What is the average cost function $C(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$C(x) = \\frac{15x + 2000}{x}$",
          "$C(x) = 15x + 2000$",
          "$C(x) = \\frac{2000x + 15}{x}$",
          "$C(x) = \\frac{x}{15x + 2000}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average cost is the Total Cost ($15x + 2000$) divided by the number of units ($x$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the average cost function $C(x) = \\frac{15x + 2000}{x}$, what does the horizontal asymptote $y = 15$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The minimum possible average cost as production increases.",
          "The fixed cost of starting the business.",
          "The number of units needed to break even.",
          "The maximum profit the company can make."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $x \\to \\infty$, the fixed cost per unit becomes negligible, and the average cost approaches the cost to produce a single unit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A salt solution is mixed into a tank. The concentration is $C(t) = \\frac{10t}{2t + 5}$. What is the concentration after a very long time ($t \\to \\infty$)?",

          "2",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients: $10/2 = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Person A can paint a room in 4 hours and Person B can paint it in 6 hours, which rational equation models them working together?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{t}$",
          "$4 + 6 = t$",

          "$4 + 6 = \\frac{1}{t}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work rate problems add the portion of the job completed per hour: Rate A + Rate B = Total Rate."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the domain of most real-world rational functions restricted to $x > 0$?",
        "options": [
          "Time and physical quantities (like units produced) cannot be negative.",
          "The denominator is always positive.",
          "Rational functions only exist in the first quadrant.",
          "Horizontal asymptotes only work for positive numbers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Contextual constraints like 'number of items' or 'time' require $x$ to be non-negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a concentration model, what does a vertical asymptote at a negative $t$ value usually imply?",
        "options": [
          "The value is irrelevant because time cannot be negative.",
          "The concentration will explode at that time.",
          "The experiment must have started earlier.",
          "The salt is dissolving instantly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical asymptotes outside the realistic domain ($t < 0$) are ignored in practical applications."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a function $P(t) = \\frac{500t}{t + 1}$ models a population, what is the 'carrying capacity' (the limit of the population)?",
        "options": [
          "500",
          "1",
          "0",
          "Infinity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $t \\to \\infty$, $P(t) \\to 500/1$, which is 500."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hiker travels 10 miles at a rate of $r$. The time taken is $T(r) = 10/r$. As the hiker's speed approaches 0, what happens to the time?",
        "options": [
          "It approaches infinity.",
          "It approaches zero.",
          "It stays at 10.",
          "It becomes negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There is a vertical asymptote at $r = 0$. As speed decreases toward zero, the time required to finish increases without bound."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: In real-world average cost problems, the average cost usually decreases as more items are produced.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
