          "2",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'common log' is base 10 by convention."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$10^{-3} = 1/1000 = 0.001$. Therefore, $\\log_{10}(0.001) = -3$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like any other base, $e^0 = 1$, so the log is 0."
