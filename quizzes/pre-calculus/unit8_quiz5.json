      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A graph has a maximum at 10 and a minimum at 2. What is the value of $k$ (vertical shift)?",
        "options": [
          "6",
          "4",
          "8",
          "12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$k = (10 + 2) / 2 = 6$. The midline is exactly halfway between the peaks and valleys."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the same graph (Max 10, Min 2), what is the amplitude $|a|$?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "8",
          "6",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$|a| = 10 - 6 = 4$. The graph goes 4 units above and below the midline."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a graph completes one full cycle every $\\pi$ units, what is the value of $b$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1/2",
          "π",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$b = 2\\pi / \\text{Period} = 2\\pi / \\pi = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You observe a graph that starts its highest point at $x = \\pi/3$. If you are writing a **cosine** equation, what is $h$?",
        "options": [
          "π/3",
          "-π/3",
          "0",
          "π"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since cosine normally starts at its maximum at $x=0$, a maximum at $\\pi/3$ indicates a phase shift of $\\pi/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which trig function is usually easiest to use if the graph crosses the midline at $x=0$?",

          "Sine",
          "Cosine",
          "Tangent",
          "Secant"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parent sine function $y = \\sin x$ naturally starts at the midline at $x=0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a graph starts at its **minimum** value at $x=0$, what is the simplest way to write the equation?",
        "options": [
          "Use a negative cosine: $y = -a \\cos(bx)$",
          "Use a positive sine: $y = a \\sin(bx)$",
          "Use a positive cosine: $y = a \\cos(bx)$",
          "Use a negative sine: $y = -a \\sin(bx)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative cosine reflects the maximum to the minimum, making it start at the bottom at $x=0$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A period is found to be 10. What is the value of $b$?",

          "2π"

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Any sinusoid can be written as either sine or cosine by adjusting the phase shift $h$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you find that $k = 0$, $|a| = 2$, and $b = 4$, which equation matches a graph starting at $(0,0)$ and going up?",
        "options": [
          "y = 2 sin(4x)",
          "y = 4 sin(2x)",
          "y = 2 cos(4x)",
          "y = -2 sin(4x)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since it starts at the midline $(0,0)$, it's a sine function with $a=2$ and $b=4$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The midline is always given by the vertical shift $k$, which is $-3$ in this case."
