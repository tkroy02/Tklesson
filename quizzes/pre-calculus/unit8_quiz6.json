    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard period of the parent function $y = \\tan x$?",
        "options": [
          "π",
          "2π",
          "π/2",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent and Cotangent repeat every $\\pi$ units, unlike the other four trig functions which repeat every $2\\pi$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the first positive vertical asymptote for $y = \\tan x$?",
        "options": [
          "x = π/2",
          "x = π",

          "x = 2π"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent is $\\sin/\\cos$. Cosine is zero at $\\pi/2$, making tangent undefined there."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where are the vertical asymptotes for the parent function $y = \\cot x$?",
        "options": [
          "Multiples of π (0, π, 2π...)",
          "Odd multiples of π/2",
          "Only at x = 0",
          "There are no asymptotes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cotangent is $\\cos/\\sin$. It is undefined whenever $\\sin x = 0$, which occurs at $n\\pi$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

          "π/4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For tangent, Period = $\\pi / b$. So, $\\pi / 2$."

          "It forms a U-shape."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The tangent function is an increasing function within its domain intervals."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the x-intercept of the parent function $y = \\tan x$ within the interval $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$?",

          "There isn't one"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\tan(0) = 0$, so it passes through the origin."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the range of $y = \\tan x$?",

          "(-∞, ∞)",
          "[-1, 1]",
          "(0, ∞)",
          "All reals except 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because of the vertical asymptotes, the branches of the tangent graph extend infinitely up and down."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $y = 3 \\tan x$, what does the '3' represent?",
        "options": [
          "A vertical stretch",
          "The amplitude",
          "The period",
          "The horizontal shift"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While it stretches the graph vertically, we don't call it 'amplitude' because the function has no maximum or minimum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the function $y = \\cot(x)$, what is the value at $x = \\pi/2$?",

          "1",
          "-1",
          "Undefined"

        "answer": "A",

        "answer": "A",
