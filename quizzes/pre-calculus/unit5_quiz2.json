    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Approximately what is the value of the natural base $e$?",
        "options": [
          "2.718",
          "3.141",
          "1.618",
          "0.707"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$e$ is an irrational number approximately equal to 2.71828."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is $f(x) = e^x$ an example of growth or decay?",
        "options": [
          "Exponential Growth",
          "Exponential Decay",
          "Linear Growth",
          "Constant Function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $e > 1$, the function increases as $x$ increases."

        "question": "Which of the following describes the end behavior of $f(x) = e^{-x}$ as $x \\to \\infty$?",
        "options": [
          "$f(x) \\to 0$",
          "$f(x) \\to \\infty$",

          "$f(x) \\to -\\infty$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$e^{-x}$ is the same as $(1/e)^x$. Since $1/e < 1$, it is a decay function that approaches the horizontal asymptote $y=0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the y-intercept of $f(x) = e^{x-5}$?",

          "$(0, -5)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plug in $x=0$: $f(0) = e^{0-5} = e^{-5}$."

          "$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1 + 1/n)^n$",
          "$\\lim_{n \\to 0} (1 + n)^n$",

          "$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n!$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the number of compounding periods ($n$) goes to infinity, the growth factor approaches $e$."

          "$x = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $e^0 = 1$, we set the exponent to zero: $2x - 4 = 0$, so $x = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the domain of $f(x) = e^x$?",

        "options": [
          "$f(x)$ is steeper than $g(x)$ for $x > 0$.",
          "$g(x)$ is steeper than $f(x)$ for $x > 0$.",
          "They are identical.",
          "$f(x)$ is a decay function while $g(x)$ is growth."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $e \\approx 2.718$ is larger than 2, it grows faster than $2^x$."
