    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\tan x = 5$ and $x$ is in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, how many solutions exist?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "0",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since tangent is positive in Quadrants I and III and its range is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, there are two angles within one rotation that satisfy the equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the second solution for $\\cos x = 0.3$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, which operation is correct?",
        "options": [
          "2π - arccos(0.3)",
          "π - arccos(0.3)",
          "π + arccos(0.3)",
          "-arccos(0.3)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cosine is positive in Q1 and Q4. The calculator gives the Q1 angle; subtracting from $2\\pi$ gives the Q4 partner."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the reference angle for $\\sin x = -0.4$?",

          "2π - arcsin(0.4)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reference angle is always the absolute (positive) value of the inverse function to find the Q1 distance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $5\\sin x - 2 = 0$ for the primary angle in radians.",

          "arcsin(2.5)",
          "arccos(0.4)",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolating gives $\\sin x = 2/5 = 0.4$. The solution is $x = \\arcsin(0.4)$."

          "Tangent",
          "Sine",
          "Cosine",
          "None of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The range of tangent is all real numbers, so $\\arctan(y)$ is defined for any value of $y$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\cos x = -0.8$, the calculator gives $x \\approx 2.498$ rad. In which quadrant is this solution?",
        "options": [
          "Quadrant II",
          "Quadrant I",
          "Quadrant III",
          "Quadrant IV"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The range of $\\arccos$ is $[0, \\pi]$. Since $\\pi/2 \\approx 1.57$ and $\\pi \\approx 3.14$, a value of $2.498$ is in Q2."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

          "arctan(10/3)",
          "arctan(√3.33)",
          "Both A and C are correct"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$\\tan^2 x = 10/3$, so $\\tan x = \\sqrt{10/3}$. $10/3$ is approximately $3.33$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: If $\\sin x = 0.5$, $\\arcsin(0.5)$ is the only solution on $[0, 2\\pi)$.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. While $\\arcsin(0.5) = \\pi/6$ (Q1), there is another solution at $5\\pi/6$ (Q2)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you find the solution in Quadrant III for $\\tan x = 2$?",

          "2π - arctan(2)",
          "π - arctan(2)",
          "arctan(2) - π"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent repeats every $\\pi$ radians, so adding $\\pi$ to the Q1 solution moves it to Q3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What should you check if your calculator says 'Domain Error' when solving $\\cos x = 1.5$?",
        "options": [
          "Nothing; the equation has no solution.",
          "Check if the calculator is in Degrees.",
          "Check if you forgot the negative sign.",
          "Multiply the result by π."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The range of cosine is $[-1, 1]$. It is impossible for $\\cos x$ to equal $1.5$, so there is no solution."
