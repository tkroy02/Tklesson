    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, how many zeros does the function $f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6$ have?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "2",
          "0",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The number of zeros (counting multiplicity) is equal to the degree of the polynomial, which is 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $2 + 3i$ is a zero of a polynomial with real coefficients, what other value must be a zero?",
        "options": [
          "$2 - 3i$",
          "$-2 + 3i$",
          "$-2 - 3i$",
          "$3 + 2i$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Complex zeros of polynomials with real coefficients always occur in conjugate pairs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the function $f(x) = (x - 5)^2(x + 1)^3$, what happens at the x-intercept $x = 5$?",
        "options": [
          "The graph touches the x-axis and turns around.",
          "The graph crosses through the x-axis.",
          "The graph has a vertical asymptote.",
          "The graph has a hole."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The zero $x = 5$ has an even multiplicity (2), so the graph is tangent to the axis but does not cross it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a zero $r$ has multiplicity 3, how does the graph behave at $x = r$?",
        "options": [
          "It crosses the x-axis (often with a slight 'flattening' effect).",
          "It touches and turns back.",
          "It stops at that point.",
          "It jumps to a different y-value."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Odd multiplicity means the graph crosses the axis. Multiplicities higher than 1 cause the graph to look flatter as it crosses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many real zeros can a 5th-degree polynomial have?",
        "options": [
          "Any odd number from 1 to 5.",
          "Exactly 5.",
          "Exactly 1.",
          "Any even number from 0 to 4."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because complex roots come in pairs, a 5th-degree polynomial can have 0, 2, or 4 imaginary roots, leaving at least 1 and up to 5 real roots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the zeros of $f(x) = x(x^2 - 1)(x + 4)$.",
        "options": [
          "$0, 1, -1, -4$",
          "$1, -1, -4$",
          "$0, 1, 4$",
          "$0, -1, 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Setting each factor to zero: $x=0$, $x^2-1=0 \\implies x=\\pm 1$, and $x+4=0 \\implies x=-4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can a 4th-degree polynomial have exactly 3 imaginary zeros?",
        "options": [
          "No, imaginary zeros must come in pairs.",
          "Yes, if the leading coefficient is negative.",
          "Yes, if the constant term is zero.",
          "No, it must have at least 4."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Under the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem, imaginary roots always appear in pairs $(a \\pm bi)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the multiplicity of the zero $x = 0$ in the function $f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "3",
          "1",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor the expression: $f(x) = x^2(x - 4)$. The factor $x$ is squared, so its multiplicity is 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a polynomial $P(x)$ has degree $n$, what is the maximum number of x-intercepts it can have?",
        "options": [
          "$n$",
          "$n - 1$",
          "$2n$",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The number of real zeros (x-intercepts) cannot exceed the total number of zeros $n$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A polynomial of even degree must have at least one real zero.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A parabola like $x^2 + 1$ is an even-degree polynomial that never touches the x-axis, so it has no real zeros."
