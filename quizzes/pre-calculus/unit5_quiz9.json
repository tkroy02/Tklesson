    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula should you use if interest is compounded 'monthly'?",
        "options": [
          "$A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}$",
          "$A = Pe^{rt}$",
          "$I = Prt$",
          "$A = P(1+r)^t$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monthly compounding is periodic ($n=12$), so the periodic formula is required."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an investment is compounded 'continuously', which value do you use for $n$?",
        "options": [
          "None; you use the natural base $e$ instead.",
          "365",
          "Infinity",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Continuous compounding uses the $A = Pe^{rt}$ formula, where $e$ represents the limit of compounding infinitely often."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $1000 investment earns 5% interest. What value of $r$ should be used in the formula?",

          "0.05",
          "5",
          "0.5",
          "1.05"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Interest rates must always be converted from a percentage to a decimal (5% = 0.05)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If interest is compounded 'quarterly', what is the value of $n$?",

          "12",
          "2"

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How long does it take for money to double if it is compounded continuously at rate $r$? (The 'Rule of 70/72' approximation comes from this).",

          "$t = \\ln(2) / r$",
          "$t = 2 / r$",

          "$t = r / \\ln(2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $2P = Pe^{rt} \\implies 2 = e^{rt} \\implies \\ln(2) = rt \\implies t = \\ln(2)/r$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$600.00$ "
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$A = 500(1 + 0.04/1)^{(1)(2)} = 500(1.04)^2 = 500(1.0816) = 540.80$."

          "Daily",
          "Monthly",
          "Annual"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the total amount will be."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: In the formula $A = Pe^{rt}$, $t$ must be measured in years.",

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard interest rates are 'Annual Percentage Rates' (APR), so time must be in years to match."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to find out how much you need to invest *now* to have $10,000 in 5 years, you are solving for:",

          "P (Principal)",
          "A (Amount)",
          "r (Rate)",
          "n (Compounding periods)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The current investment is the Principal ($P$), while the future goal is the Amount ($A$)."

          "It approaches $Pe^{rt}$.",
          "It grows toward infinity.",
          "It stays the same as annual compounding.",
          "It starts to decrease."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the mathematical definition of $e$—the limit of periodic growth as intervals become infinitely small."
