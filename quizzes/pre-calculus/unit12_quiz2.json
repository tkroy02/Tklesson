    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where should the receiver be placed on a satellite dish to maximize signal strength?",
        "options": [
          "At the focus",
          "At the vertex",
          "On the directrix",
          "Anywhere on the surface"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reflective property of a parabola ensures all incoming parallel signals are concentrated at the focus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A parabolic searchlight has a bulb placed 6 inches from the vertex. If the vertex is at (0,0) and the light opens upward, what is the equation of the cross-section?",
        "options": [
          "x² = 24y",
          "y² = 24x",
          "x² = 6y",
          "x² = 12y"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distance from vertex to bulb (focus) is p = 6. Using x² = 4py, we get x² = 4(6)y = 24y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are telescope mirrors parabolic rather than spherical?",
        "options": [
          "Parabolic mirrors focus all parallel light rays to a single point.",
          "Spherical mirrors are too heavy.",
          "Parabolic mirrors are easier to clean.",
          "Parabolic mirrors increase the magnification of the eyepiece."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spherical mirrors suffer from 'spherical aberration' where light doesn't hit a single point; parabolas solve this by focusing everything perfectly at the focus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A parabolic arch has a width of 20 feet and a height of 10 feet. If the vertex is at (0, 10), what are the x-intercepts?",
        "options": [
          "(-10, 0) and (10, 0)",
          "(-20, 0) and (20, 0)",
          "(0, 0) and (20, 0)",
          "(-5, 0) and (5, 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the total width is 20, the arch extends 10 units to the left and 10 units to the right of the center axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a suspension bridge, the cable hangs in a parabola. If the towers are 400 feet apart and the cable touches the road at the center, what is the 'x' value at the right-hand tower if the center is (0,0)?",
        "options": [
          "200",
          "400",
          "100",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distance from the center to either tower is half the total span: 400 / 2 = 200."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A parabolic solar cooker is 4 feet wide and 1 foot deep. To find the focus, you would model this with which equation?",
        "options": [
          "x² = 4py",
          "y = x² + 4",
          "x² + y² = 1",
          "y² = 4px"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Placing the vertex at (0,0) and having it open upward allows you to use the point (2, 1) to solve for p."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Any ray emitted from the focus will reflect off the parabola and travel parallel to the axis of symmetry.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the principle behind flashlights and car headlights creating a focused beam."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If p = 0.25 in the equation of a parabolic mirror, how far from the vertex is the focus?",
        "options": [
          "0.25 units",
          "1 unit",
          "0.5 units",
          "4 units"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, p is the directed distance from the vertex to the focus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the path of a projectile (like a kicked football), the highest point of the path represents what part of the parabola?",
        "options": [
          "Vertex",
          "Focus",
          "Directrix",
          "Latus Rectum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertex is the maximum or minimum point of a vertical parabola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A whisper gallery is often shaped like a parabola or an ellipse. In a parabolic one, where should the listener stand to hear a person speaking from a great distance?",
        "options": [
          "At the focus",
          "Against the back wall",
          "Exactly in the center of the room",
          "At the vertex"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The listener at the focus will receive all the parallel sound waves reflected off the parabolic wall."
