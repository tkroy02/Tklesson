      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which substitution is best for solving $2\\sin^2 x + 3\\sin x + 1 = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "u = sin x",
          "u = sin² x",
          "u = 2sin x",
          "u = x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replacing the base trig function (sin x) turns the equation into a recognizable quadratic trinomial: 2u² + 3u + 1 = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\tan^2 x - 3 = 0$ on the interval $[0, \\pi)$.",

          "π/3, 4π/3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "tan² x = 3, so tan x = ±√3. In the interval [0, π), this occurs at π/3 (Q1) and 2π/3 (Q2)."
      },

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor out cos x: cos x(2cos x + 1) = 0. cos x = 0 at π/2, 3π/2. cos x = -1/2 at 2π/3, 4π/3."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "sin² x = 1, so sin x = ±1. This occurs at the top (π/2) and bottom (3π/2) of the unit circle."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a quadratic trig equation factors into $(\\sin x - 2)(\\sin x + 1) = 0$, what can you conclude about the factor $(\\sin x - 2)$?",
        "options": [
          "It yields no real solutions.",
          "It yields x = π/2.",
          "It yields x = 0.",
          "It yields x = arcsin(2)."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the range of sine is [-1, 1], sin x cannot equal 2. Only the second factor produces valid angles."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. If a trinomial in sin x doesn't factor, you can use the formula to find the value of sin x, then use inverse trig to find x."

          "π/6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "sin² x = 3/4, so sin x = ±√3/2. On [0, π], sin x is positive √3/2 at π/3 and 2π/3."
