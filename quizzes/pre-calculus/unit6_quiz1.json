    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the solution to a system of equations graphically?",
        "options": [
          "The point where the lines intersect.",
          "The y-intercept of the first line.",
          "The x-intercept of the second line.",
          "The area between the lines."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The solution must satisfy both equations simultaneously, which only happens at the intersection point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add two equations together and the result is $0 = 5$, how many solutions does the system have?",
        "options": [
          "No solution",
          "One solution",
          "Infinite solutions",
          "Zero is the solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A false statement like $0 = 5$ indicates the lines are parallel and will never intersect (Inconsistent system)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve the system: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 2$.",
        "options": [
          "$(6, 4)$",
          "$(5, 5)$",
          "$(8, 2)$",
          "$(4, 6)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using elimination: add the equations to get $2x = 12$, so $x = 6$. Substitute back: $6 + y = 10$, so $y = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method is usually easiest when one equation already has a variable isolated (e.g., $y = 2x + 1$)?",
        "options": [
          "Substitution",
          "Elimination",
          "Cramer's Rule",
          "Long Division"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitution is designed for cases where you can easily replace one variable with an equivalent expression."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system has infinite solutions, the lines are:",
        "options": [
          "Coincident (the same line)",
          "Parallel",
          "Perpendicular",
          "Vertical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If every point on one line is also on the other, the equations describe the same line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To eliminate $x$ in the system: \n$2x + 3y = 8$\n$x - 2y = 3$\nWhat should you multiply the second equation by?",
        "options": [
          "$-2$",
          "$2$",
          "$-3$",
          "$3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiplying the second equation by $-2$ gives $-2x + 4y = -6$, which cancels the $2x$ in the first equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve by substitution: $y = 3x$ and $x + y = 12$.",

          "$(3, 9)$",
          "$(4, 8)$",
          "$(2, 6)$",
          "$(9, 3)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x + (3x) = 12 \\implies 4x = 12 \\implies x = 3$. Then $y = 3(3) = 9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Consistent and Independent' system has how many solutions?",
        "options": [
          "Exactly one",
          "Zero",
          "Infinite",
          "Two"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Consistent means there is at least one solution; Independent means the lines are distinct."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a solution of $0 = 0$ represent when solving algebraically?",
        "options": [
          "Infinite solutions",
          "No solution",
          "The solution is $(0,0)$",
          "The variables are zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An identity (a statement that is always true) indicates the two equations are dependent and share all points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two lines have different slopes, how many solutions will the system have?",

          "1",
          "0",
          "Infinite",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lines with different slopes must eventually cross at exactly one point in a 2D plane."
