    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\sin x = 1/2$ on the interval $[\\pi, 2\\pi]$.",
        "options": [
          "No solution",
          "7π/6, 11π/6",
          "π/6, 5π/6",
          "π/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sine is only positive 1/2 in Quadrants I and II. The interval $[\\pi, 2\\pi]$ covers Quadrants III and IV, where sine is negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many solutions does $\\cos x = 1$ have on the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "0",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because of the brackets $[0, 2\\pi]$, both 0 and $2\\pi$ are included. $\\cos(0)=1$ and $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\tan x = 1$ on the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$.",

          "-3π/4, π/4",
          "π/4, 5π/4",
          "-π/4, 3π/4",
          "π/4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent is 1 at $\\pi/4$. Subtracting the period ($\\pi$) gives $\\pi/4 - \\pi = -3\\pi/4$. Both are within the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On the interval $(\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2)$, solve $\\cos x = -1$.",

          "π/2, 3π/2",

          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cosine is -1 at $\\pi$, which falls exactly in the middle of this interval."

          "-π/4, -3π/4",
          "5π/4, 7π/4",
          "-π/2",
          "-π/4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The standard solutions are $5\\pi/4$ and $7\\pi/4$. Subtracting $2\\pi$ from each gives $-3\\pi/4$ and $-\\pi/4$."
      },
      {

          "5π/6",
          "π/6",
          "7π/6",
          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\cos x = -\\sqrt{3}/2$. This occurs at $5\\pi/6$ (Q2) and $7\\pi/6$ (Q3). Only $5\\pi/6$ fits in the $[0, \\pi]$ range."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the interval is $(0, 2\\pi)$, why is $0$ not a solution for $\\cos x = 1$?",
        "options": [
          "The parenthesis ( ) means the value is not included.",
          "Because cos(0) is not 1.",
          "Because 0 is not a positive number.",
          "The solution must be in radians only."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parentheses indicate an open interval where the endpoint is excluded."
      },

          "0, π",

          "0, π/4, π/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$2x = 0, \\pi, 2\\pi$. Dividing by 2 gives $0, \\pi/2, \\pi$. All are included because of the brackets."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent is positive in Q3. The Q3 angle for $\\sqrt{3}$ is $\\pi + \\pi/3 = 4\\pi/3$."

          "False"
        ],
