      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What geometric relationship defines a hyperbola?",
        "options": [
          "The absolute difference of distances to two foci is constant.",
          "The sum of distances to two foci is constant.",
          "The distance to a focus is equal to the distance to a directrix.",
          "The ratio of distances to two foci is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hyperbolas are defined by a constant difference, whereas ellipses are defined by a constant sum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $\\frac{y^2}{9} - \\frac{x^2}{16} = 1$, which way does the hyperbola open?",
        "options": [
          "Up and Down",
          "Left and Right",
          "Diagonally",
          "It is a circle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The y-term is the positive term, so the transverse axis is vertical, and the hyperbola opens up and down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the Pythagorean relationship for the foci of a hyperbola?",
        "options": [
          "c² = a² + b²",
          "c² = a² - b²",
          "a² = b² + c²",
          "c = a + b"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a hyperbola, the foci are further from the center than the vertices, so c is the largest value: c² = a² + b²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the equations for the asymptotes of a horizontal hyperbola centered at (0,0)?",
        "options": [
          "y = ±(b/a)x",
          "y = ±(a/b)x",
          "y = x",
          "y = ±cx"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a horizontal hyperbola, the 'rise' is b and the 'run' is a, so the slopes are ±b/a."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given $\\frac{(x-2)^2}{25} - \\frac{(y+3)^2}{144} = 1$, find the value of c (distance to foci).",
        "options": [
          "13",
          "12",
          "5",
          "√119"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "c² = a² + b² = 25 + 144 = 169. Therefore, c = 13."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a hyperbola equation, how do you identify the value of $a^2$?",
        "options": [
          "It is always under the positive term.",
          "It is always the larger number.",
          "It is always the smaller number.",
          "It is always under the x-term."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In hyperbola standard form, $a^2$ is the denominator of the term with the plus sign (the lead term)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the vertices are at (0, -3) and (0, 3), and the foci are at (0, -5) and (0, 5), what is the value of $b^2$?",
        "options": [
          "16",
          "9",
          "25",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "a = 3 and c = 5. Since c² = a² + b², then 25 = 9 + b². So b² = 16."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the rectangle used to help sketch the asymptotes of a hyperbola?",

          "Central Rectangle",
          "Hyperbolic Box",
          "Transverse Square",
          "Focus Frame"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The central rectangle has dimensions 2a by 2b and its diagonals are the asymptotes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The branches of a hyperbola eventually become almost straight lines.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. As x and y get very large, the curve approaches the linear asymptotes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the eccentricity $e = c/a$ is very large, what happens to the hyperbola?",
        "options": [
          "The branches become very flat/wide.",
          "The branches become very narrow/pointy.",
          "The hyperbola becomes a circle.",
          "The hyperbola becomes a parabola."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A large eccentricity means c is much larger than a, causing the asymptotes to be very steep or flat, widening the opening."
