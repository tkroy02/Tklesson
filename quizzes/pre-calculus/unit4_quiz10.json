          "$A/x$"

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False! $(x^2 - 4)$ can be factored into $(x - 2)(x + 2)$. Only quadratics with no real roots (like $x^2 + 4$) are irreducible."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The degrees are equal (both are 2), so you must use long division first to get a constant plus a proper fraction."
