      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the vertical motion equation $y = -16t^2 + (v_0 \sin \theta)t + h_0$, what does the -16 represent?",
        "options": [
          "Half of the acceleration due to gravity (in ft/s²)",
          "The initial height",
          "The horizontal velocity",
          "The wind resistance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity is 32 ft/s². The formula uses 1/2 * g, so 1/2 * 32 = 16."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which part of the parametric system determines when the object hits the ground?",
        "options": [
          "The y-equation (setting y = 0)",
          "The x-equation (setting x = 0)",

          "The parameter t alone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The object hits the ground when its vertical position (height) is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is launched horizontally ($\theta = 0^{\circ}$), what happens to the horizontal velocity equation?",
        "options": [
          "x = v₀t",
          "x = 0",
          "x = -16t²",
          "x = sin(t)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since cos(0°) = 1, the equation x = (v₀ cos θ)t simplifies to x = v₀t."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is kicked from the ground ($h_0 = 0$) at 50 ft/s. What is the x-component of its velocity if the angle is 60°?",

          "25 ft/s",
          "50 ft/s",
          "43.3 ft/s",
          "16 ft/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal velocity is v₀ cos θ = 50 * cos(60°) = 50 * 0.5 = 25 ft/s."

        "type": "mcq",

          "Circle",
          "Hyperbola",
          "Ellipse"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By eliminating the parameter t, the resulting equation is a quadratic in terms of x, which is a parabola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The horizontal distance an object travels is often called the 'range'.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In projectile motion, range refers to the total horizontal distance (x) covered before hitting the ground."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to maximize the horizontal range of a projectile (ignoring air resistance), what is the ideal launch angle?",

          "45°",
          "90°",
          "30°",
          "60°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mathematically, sin(2θ) is maximized at 90°, so 2θ = 90° implies θ = 45°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the time of flight is 4 seconds and the horizontal velocity is 20 ft/s, what is the range?",
        "options": [
          "80 feet",
          "40 feet",
          "5 feet",
          "160 feet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "x = v_x * t = 20 * 4 = 80 feet."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the time of flight if you increase the initial height $h_0$?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Starting from a higher point gives the object more distance to fall, increasing the total time in the air."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do we use two equations (x and y) for one moving object?",
        "options": [
          "Gravity only affects vertical motion, not horizontal motion.",
          "It makes the math harder.",
          "To account for the rotation of the Earth.",
          "Because calculators can't handle single equations."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity acts downward, changing the vertical velocity, while the horizontal velocity remains constant (in an ideal vacuum)."
