    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the vertical motion equation $y = -16t^2 + (v_0 \\sin \\theta)t + h_0$, what does the $-16$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "Half of the acceleration due to gravity (in ft/s²)",
          "The initial height",
          "The horizontal velocity",
          "The wind resistance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity is $32$ ft/s². The formula uses $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot g$, so $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 32 = 16$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which part of the parametric system determines when the object hits the ground?",
        "options": [
          "The $y$-equation (setting $y = 0$)",
          "The $x$-equation (setting $x = 0$)",
          "The initial angle $\\theta$",
          "The parameter $t$ alone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The object hits the ground when its vertical position (height) is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is launched horizontally ($\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$), what happens to the horizontal velocity equation?",
        "options": [
          "$x = v_0 t$",
          "$x = 0$",
          "$x = -16t^2$",
          "$x = \\sin(t)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\cos(0^{\\circ}) = 1$, the equation $x = (v_0 \\cos \\theta)t$ simplifies to $x = v_0 t$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is kicked from the ground ($h_0 = 0$) at $50$ ft/s. What is the $x$-component of its velocity if the angle is $60^{\\circ}$?",
        "options": [
          "$25$ ft/s",
          "$50$ ft/s",
          "$43.3$ ft/s",
          "$16$ ft/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal velocity is $v_0 \\cos \\theta = 50 \\cdot \\cos(60^{\\circ}) = 50 \\cdot 0.5 = 25$ ft/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the rectangular shape of the path followed by any projectile?",

          "Parabola",
          "Circle",
          "Hyperbola",
          "Ellipse"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By eliminating the parameter $t$, the resulting equation is a quadratic in terms of $x$, which is a parabola."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The horizontal distance an object travels is often called the 'range'.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In projectile motion, range refers to the total horizontal distance ($x$) covered before hitting the ground."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to maximize the horizontal range of a projectile (ignoring air resistance), what is the ideal launch angle?",

          "$45^{\\circ}$",
          "$90^{\\circ}$",
          "$30^{\\circ}$",
          "$60^{\\circ}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mathematically, $\\sin(2\\theta)$ is maximized at $90^{\\circ}$, so $2\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$ implies $\\theta = 45^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the time of flight is $4$ seconds and the horizontal velocity is $20$ ft/s, what is the range?",
        "options": [
          "$80$ feet",
          "$40$ feet",
          "$5$ feet",
          "$160$ feet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x = v_x \\cdot t = 20 \\cdot 4 = 80$ feet."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the time of flight if you increase the initial height $h_0$?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Starting from a higher point gives the object more distance to fall, increasing the total time in the air."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do we use two equations ($x$ and $y$) for one moving object?",
        "options": [
          "Gravity only affects vertical motion, not horizontal motion.",
          "It makes the math harder.",
          "To account for the rotation of the Earth.",
          "Because calculators can't handle single equations."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity acts downward, changing the vertical velocity, while the horizontal velocity remains constant (in an ideal vacuum)."
