        "options": [
          "It applies to addition and multiplication, but not subtraction.",
          "It only applies to variables.",
          "It states that grouping does not matter.",
          "It is the same as the Distributive property."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Order matters in subtraction ($5-3 \\neq 3-5$), so the property does not apply."
