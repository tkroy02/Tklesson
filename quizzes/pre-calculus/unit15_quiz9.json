        "answer": "A",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the area approximation as the number of rectangles increases?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes more accurate.",

          "It always becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing the number of rectangles reduces the 'gap' or error between the rectangles and the actual curve."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the notation $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$, what do $a$ and $b$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The lower and upper boundaries of the area",
          "The slope and y-intercept",
          "The roots of the function",

        "question": "Using the 'Left-Hand Riemann Sum' means the height of each rectangle is determined by:",

          "The x-intercept"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A Left Riemann Sum uses $f(x_i)$ at the start of each interval to set the height."

          "A constant multiplier"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the area formula (height $\\times$ width), $f(x)$ is the height and $dx$ represents the width of the rectangles."

          "$4$",
          "$5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $f(x)=4$ is a horizontal line, the area is a rectangle with width $(5-1) = 4$ and height $4$. Area $= 4 \\times 4 = 16$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an integral result is negative, what does that usually imply about the graph?",
        "options": [
          "The area is located below the x-axis.",
          "The function is decreasing.",
          "The area is imaginary.",
          "A calculation error occurred."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Calculus treats area below the x-axis as 'negative area' because the function values (heights) are negative."

          "False"
        ],
