    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Functions with varying amplitudes",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the function $y = x^2 \\cos(x)$, which part is the damping factor?",
        "options": [
          "x²",
          "cos(x)",
          "x",
          "The amplitude"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The function multiplying the trig part, $x^2$, determines the 'envelope' or height of the wave."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the graph of $y = e^{-x} \\sin(x)$ as $x$ becomes very large?",
        "options": [
          "The oscillations get smaller and approach zero.",
          "The oscillations grow infinitely large.",
          "The oscillations stay constant.",
          "The graph becomes a straight line."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $x \\to \\infty$, $e^{-x} \\to 0$. This 'damps' the sine wave until it flattens out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The boundary lines that a damped trig function stays between are called:",
        "options": [
          "Envelopes",
          "Asymptotes",
          "Midlines",
          "Periods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The functions $f(x)$ and $-f(x)$ form the upper and lower envelopes of the graph."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $y = x \\sin(x)$, what are the equations of the envelopes?",
        "options": [
          "y = x and y = -x",
          "y = 1 and y = -1",
          "y = sin(x) and y = -sin(x)",
          "y = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The damping factor is $x$, so the wave is bounded by the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A damped trig function is still a periodic function.",
        "options": [
          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False. Because the amplitude is constantly changing, the function never exactly repeats its values, so it is not strictly periodic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does the graph of $y = f(x) \\sin(bx)$ touch the envelope?",
        "options": [
          "At its local maximum and minimum points.",
          "At its x-intercepts.",
          "Everywhere.",
          "Never."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The wave reaches the envelope whenever the sine part is $1$ or $-1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the damping factor in $y = (1/x) \\cos(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "1/x",
          "cos(x)",
          "x",
          "-1/x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficient function $1/x$ determines the decreasing height of the cosine wave."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these would represent a wave that 'explodes' (gets larger) as $x$ increases?",
        "options": [
          "y = 2^x sin(x)",
          "y = (0.5)^x sin(x)",
          "y = (1/x) sin(x)",
          "y = -5 sin(x)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $2^x$ grows as $x$ increases, the amplitude of the sine wave will grow as well."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $y = x \\cos(x)$, what is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "Undefined",
          "π"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y = (0) \\times \\cos(0) = 0 \\times 1 = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the graph of $y = |x| \\sin(x)$, the 'V' shape formed by the envelopes is due to:",
        "options": [
          "The absolute value damping factor.",
          "The sine function.",
          "Vertical shifting.",
          "Phase shifting."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The envelopes $y = |x|$ and $y = -|x|$ create a V-shaped boundary."
