      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What determines the end behavior of the polynomial $f(x) = -3x^5 + 2x^2 - 1$?",
        "options": [
          "The leading term $-3x^5$",
          "The constant term $-1$",
          "The x-intercepts",
          "The degree of the middle term $2x^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The term with the highest power (leading term) dominates the function's value as x approaches infinity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the degree of a power function is even and the leading coefficient is negative, what is the end behavior?",
        "options": [
          "Falls to the left and falls to the right.",
          "Rises to the left and rises to the right.",
          "Falls to the left and rises to the right.",
          "Rises to the left and falls to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An even degree means both ends go the same way; a negative coefficient means they both go down toward $-\\infty$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the end behavior of $f(x) = x^3$?",
        "options": [
          "As $x \\to \\infty, f(x) \\to \\infty$; as $x \\to -\\infty, f(x) \\to -\\infty$",
          "As $x \\to \\infty, f(x) \\to \\infty$; as $x \\to -\\infty, f(x) \\to \\infty$",

          "As $x \\to \\infty, f(x) \\to 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Odd degree functions with a positive coefficient start low and end high."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the graph of a power function $y = x^n$ as the even exponent $n$ increases (e.g., $x^2$ vs $x^4$)?",
        "options": [
          "The graph becomes flatter near the origin and steeper for $|x| > 1$.",
          "The graph becomes narrower near the origin.",
          "The graph turns into a straight line.",
          "The end behavior changes direction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher even powers create a 'flatter' bottom near the origin because small decimals raised to high powers become even smaller."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Determine the end behavior of $f(x) = 10x^6 - 4x^3 + 2$.",

          "$\\downarrow, \\downarrow$",
          "$\\downarrow, \\uparrow$",
          "$\\uparrow, \\downarrow$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The degree is 6 (even) and the coefficient is 10 (positive), so both ends rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A power function is defined as $f(x) = ax^n$. If $n=1$, the function is:",

          "Quadratic",
          "Cubic",
          "Constant"

          "$f(x) = -2x^3$",
          "$f(x) = 2x^3$",

          "$f(x) = x^4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This behavior occurs with odd-degree functions that have a negative leading coefficient."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, a power function $ax^n$ has no constant term added, so $f(0) = a(0)^n = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is $f(x) = 5x^{-2}$ a power function in the context of polynomials?",
        "options": [
          "No, the exponent must be a non-negative integer.",
          "Yes, all exponents are allowed.",
          "No, because the coefficient must be 1.",
          "Yes, it is a reciprocal power function."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polynomial power functions require $n$ to be a positive integer ($1, 2, 3, \\dots$). Negative exponents create rational functions."
