      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x)$ contains the point $(3, 7)$, what point must $f^{-1}(x)$ contain?",
        "options": [
          "$(7, 3)$",
          "$(-3, -7)$",
          "$(3, -7)$",
          "$(7, -3)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inverse functions swap the input and output (x and y) of the original function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which test is used to determine if a function is one-to-one and thus has an inverse?",
        "options": [
          "Horizontal Line Test",
          "Vertical Line Test",
          "Quadratic Formula",
          "Symmetry Test"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a horizontal line hits a graph more than once, multiple x-values produce the same y-value, failing the one-to-one requirement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What must be true for $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ if $f$ and $g$ are inverses?",
        "options": [
          "Both must equal $x$.",
          "Both must equal $0$.",
          "One must be the negative of the other.",
          "Their product must be $1$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inverses 'undo' each other, returning the original input $x$."

          "$f(x) = x^3$",
          "$f(x) = x$",
          "$f(x) = 1/x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parabola $x^2$ fails the horizontal line test (e.g., $f(2)=4$ and $f(-2)=4$). It only has an inverse if the domain is restricted to $x \\ge 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the domain of $f(x)$ is $[0, \\infty)$ and the range is $(-\\infty, 5]$, what is the domain of $f^{-1}(x)$?",

          "$(-\\infty, 5]$",
          "$[0, \\infty)$",

          "All real numbers"
        ],

          "$f^{-1}(x) = x - 5$",
          "$f^{-1}(x) = 5 - x$",
          "$f^{-1}(x) = 1/(x+5)$",
          "$f^{-1}(x) = -x - 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the function adds 5, the inverse operation must subtract 5."
      },

        "options": [
          "Yes, they are inverses.",
          "No, because $g(f(x))$ does not equal $x$.",
          "No, because $f(g(x))$ does not equal $x$.",
          "No, they are reciprocals."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$f(g(x)) = 2(x/2) = x$ and $g(f(x)) = (2x)/2 = x$. They satisfy the verification test."

          "No, it fails the Horizontal Line Test.",
          "Yes, it passes the Vertical Line Test.",
          "Yes, because it is a linear function.",
          "No, because it has no x-intercept."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A horizontal line has infinitely many x-values for a single y-value, so it is not one-to-one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The notation $f^{-1}(x)$ means:",

          "The derivative of $f$.",
          "The negative of $f(x)$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In function notation, the -1 is a label for the inverse, not an exponent."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Switch $x$ and $y$: $x = 3y - 2$. Add 2: $x + 2 = 3y$. Divide by 3: $y = (x + 2) / 3$."
