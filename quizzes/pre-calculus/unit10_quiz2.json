          "Factor out sin x.",
          "Divide by sin x.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $\\cos x = 0$ (gives $\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2$) and $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$ (gives $\\sin x = 1/2$, which is $\\pi/6, 5\\pi/6$)."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing by a variable expression that could be zero removes those zero-points as valid solutions."

          "π/2, 3π/2"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\sec x$ is never 0. $\\sin x = 1$ at $\\pi/2$, but $\\sec(\\pi/2)$ is undefined. Therefore, there are no valid solutions."
