    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the range of $y = \\arctan x$?",
        "options": [
          "(-π/2, π/2)",
          "[-π/2, π/2]",
          "[0, π]",
          "(-∞, ∞)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like sine, arctan is restricted to Q1 and Q4, but it cannot include the endpoints where the original tangent has asymptotes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate $\\arctan(1)$.",

          "0",
          "π/3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We need the angle where $\\tan \\theta = 1$. Since $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ are equal at $\\pi/4$, the tangent is 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\tan(0) = 0$, and $0$ is within the allowed range $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which inverse function has a domain of all real numbers $(-\\infty, \\infty)$?",

          "Arctangent",
          "Arcsine",
          "Arccosine",
          "None of them"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the range of the parent tangent function is all real numbers, the domain of its inverse is also all real numbers."
      },

          "-π/6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangent is $-\\sqrt{3}$ at $-60^\\circ$ or $-\\pi/3$. We must use the negative angle to stay in the range."

        "type": "mcq",

          "arctan(x)",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the domain of arctan is all real numbers, the function and its inverse always cancel out for any $x$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of $\\cos(\\arctan(0))$?",

          "0",
          "π/2",
          "Undefined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\arctan(0) = 0$. Then $\\cos(0) = 1$."

          "3/4",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $\\cos \\theta = 3/5$, the adjacent side is 3 and the hypotenuse is 5. Using $a^2+b^2=c^2$, the opposite side is 4. Thus, $\\sin \\theta = 4/5$."
