    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in solving $(x - 1)(x + 3) > 0$?",
        "options": [
          "Identify the boundary points $1$ and $-3$.",
          "Multiply the factors together.",
          "Set $x$ to zero.",
          "Divide by $x$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The zeros of the factors are the boundaries where the function might change signs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $x^2 - 4 < 0$.",

          "$(0, 4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The zeros are $\\pm 2$. Testing $x=0$ in the interval $(-2, 2)$ gives $-4 < 0$, which is true."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving $P(x) \\ge 0$, what type of notation is used for the boundary points in the solution?",
        "options": [
          "Brackets $[ ]$",
          "Parentheses $( )$",
          "Curly braces $\\{ \\}$",
          "Absolute value bars $| |$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'equal to' part of the inequality means the zeros themselves are included in the solution set."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a zero has an even multiplicity, how does the sign of the polynomial behave on either side of that zero?",
        "options": [
          "The sign stays the same.",
          "The sign always changes.",
          "The sign becomes zero.",
          "The sign becomes undefined."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even multiplicity means the graph 'touches and turns,' staying on the same side of the x-axis."

        "question": "Solve $x(x - 5) \\ge 0$.",

          "$(-\\infty, 5]$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zeros are $0$ and $5$. Test $x=1$ (negative) and $x=6$ (positive). The outward intervals are positive."

        "type": "mcq",

          "$0$",
          "$-3$"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A test value must be strictly inside the interval, not on the boundary."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $x^2 + 1 > 0$.",

          "No solution",
          "$(1, \\infty)$",
          "$(-1, 1)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $x^2$ is always at least $0$, $x^2+1$ is always positive for any real number."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $x^2 + 1 < 0$.",

          "$(-\\infty, -1)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A real number squared plus one can never be less than zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the inequality $(x - 2)^2(x + 1) > 0$, why doesn't the sign change at $x = 2$?",
        "options": [
          "Because the multiplicity of $(x - 2)$ is even.",
          "Because $2$ is a positive number.",
          "Because the inequality is strictly greater than.",
          "Because the leading coefficient is $1$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An even exponent ($2$) ensures that $(x - 2)^2$ is always positive (except at $x=2$), so it doesn't flip the sign."

          "$(-\\infty, \\infty)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cubing a number preserves its sign. Only positive numbers cubed are greater than zero."
