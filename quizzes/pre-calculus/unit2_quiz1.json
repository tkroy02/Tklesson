    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Identifying functions, relations, and the Vertical Line Test",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following defines a function?",
        "options": [
          "Every input corresponds to exactly one output.",
          "Every output corresponds to exactly one input.",
          "Every x-value has at least two y-values.",
          "The graph passes the horizontal line test."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, a function is a rule that assigns each element in the domain to exactly one element in the range."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which set of ordered pairs represents a function?",
        "options": [
          "{(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)}",
          "{(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)}",
          "{(2, 5), (3, 5), (2, 1)}",
          "{(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In set A, every x-value (1, 3, 5) is unique. In the others, at least one x-value repeats with a different y-value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a graph fails the Vertical Line Test, what does that tell you?",
        "options": [
          "The relation is not a function.",
          "The function is not linear.",
          "The domain is all real numbers.",
          "The graph has no y-intercept."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a vertical line touches the graph twice, it means one x-value has two different y-values, which violates the definition of a function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 9$ a function of $x$?",
        "options": [
          "No, because it is a circle and fails the VLT.",
          "Yes, because it is a common geometric shape.",
          "No, because $x$ can never be negative.",
          "Yes, because every $x$ has exactly one $y$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If you solve for $y$, you get $y = \\pm \\sqrt{9 - x^2}$. One $x$ produces two $y$ values, and the graph is a circle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the mapping of a function, can two different inputs have the same output?",
        "options": [
          "Yes (e.g., $f(x) = x^2$ where $f(-2)=4$ and $f(2)=4$).",
          "No, that would violate the definition of a function.",
          "Only if the function is a straight line.",
          "Only if the output is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Functions can be 'many-to-one.' As long as each input only goes to one specific output, it is a function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these graphs represents a function?",
        "options": [
          "A parabola opening upward.",
          "A circle centered at the origin.",
          "A vertical line.",
          "A parabola opening to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertical line will only hit an upward-opening parabola once at any point. Circles and sideways parabolas fail the VLT."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The set of all possible input values for a function is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Domain",
          "Range",
          "Codomain",
          "Relation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The domain is the set of all 'x' values that can be legally plugged into the function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = 5$ for every value of $x$, is $f$ a function?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, it is a constant function.",
          "No, because the y-value repeats.",
          "No, because it has no slope.",
          "Yes, because it is a vertical line."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a horizontal line. It passes the VLT because every $x$ has exactly one output (which happens to be 5)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a relation that is NOT a function?",
        "options": [
          "A person's height mapped to their age.",
          "A person's age mapped to their height.",
          "A car's VIN number mapped to its owner.",
          "A student's ID number mapped to their GPA."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At one specific age (input), a person can only have one height (output). However, one specific height (e.g., 5'10\") could correspond to many different ages, making 'B' the most likely to be a non-function if the mapping were reversed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Vertical Line Test helps identify functions. What does the Horizontal Line Test identify?",
        "options": [
          "If a function is one-to-one (has an inverse).",
          "If a function is linear.",
          "If the function has a y-intercept.",
          "If the domain is restricted."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We will learn this later in Unit 2: if a function passes the Horizontal Line Test, it is one-to-one and has an inverse function."
