    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many petals does the rose curve r = 3 cos(2θ) have?",

          "4",
          "2",
          "3",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since n = 2 (even), the number of petals is 2n = 2(2) = 4."
      },

          "5",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since n = 3 (odd), the number of petals is exactly n = 3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the length of each petal in the equation r = 7 cos(8θ)?",

          "7",
          "8",
          "16",
          "14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficient 'a' determines the maximum distance from the pole, which is the petal length."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equations in the form r² = a² cos(2θ) represent lemniscates (infinity shapes)."

          "50",
          "√5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "a² = 25, so a = 5. The maximum value of r is the square root of the coefficient."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. If n is odd, the curve has exactly n petals."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If n = 1 in the rose curve formula r = a cos(nθ), what shape is produced?",

          "A circle",
          "A 1-petalled rose",
          "A line",
          "A cardioid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "r = a cos(θ) is the standard equation for a circle centered on the x-axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which trigonometric function results in a rose curve with a petal starting directly on the polar axis (0°)?",
        "options": [
          "Cosine",
          "Sine",
          "Tangent",
          "Secant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since cos(0) = 1, cosine roses always have a maximum value (petal) at 0°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many petals would r = 2 cos(1/2 θ) have over the interval 0 to 4π?",
        "options": [
          "This is not a standard rose curve",
          "1",
          "0.5",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rose curves typically require n to be an integer. When n is a fraction, the curve often overlaps or creates complex shapes like nephroids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a lemniscate r² = a² cos(2θ), why are there gaps in the graph where no points exist?",
        "options": [
          "Because r² cannot be negative.",
          "Because the angle θ cannot be negative.",
          "Because the function is undefined for all θ.",
          "Because the calculator is broken."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When cos(2θ) is negative, r² would be negative, which has no real solution for r. This creates the empty space between the loops."
