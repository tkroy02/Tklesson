        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The identity function returns the same value that was input: $x$."

          "Quadrant III",
          "Quadrant IV"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since we cannot take the square root of a negative number (domain) and the result is always non-negative (range), it stays in Q1."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the graph of $f(x) = x^3$ as $x$ becomes very large and negative?",

          "$y$ becomes very large and negative.",
          "$y$ becomes very large and positive.",
          "$y$ approaches zero.",
          "$y$ remains constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cubing a negative number preserves the negative sign, so the graph goes down into the third quadrant."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A constant function $f(x) = c$ has the same $y$-value for every $x$, creating a flat line."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You cannot divide by zero, so the reciprocal function has a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$."

        "question": "Which two functions have the same domain $[0, \\infty)$?",
