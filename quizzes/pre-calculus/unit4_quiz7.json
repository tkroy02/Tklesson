      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the critical values for the inequality $\\frac{x - 3}{x + 4} \\le 0$?",
        "options": [
          "$3$ and $-4$",
          "$3$ and $4$",
          "$-3$ and $4$",
          "$0$ only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Critical values are the zeros of the numerator ($x=3$) and the zeros of the denominator ($x=-4$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving $\\frac{x - 1}{x + 2} \\ge 0$, why must you use a parenthesis for $-2$ in the solution?",
        "options": [
          "Because the function is undefined at $x = -2$.",
          "Because $-2$ is a negative number.",
          "Because the numerator is smaller than the denominator.",
          "Because the inequality is strictly greater than."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even if the inequality includes 'equal to,' you can never include a value that makes the denominator zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve $\\frac{1}{x} > 0$.",

          "All real numbers"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The fraction is positive only when $x$ is positive."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the inequality $\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{x + 5} > 0$, which critical value will NOT cause a sign change on the sign chart?",
        "options": [
          "$2$",
          "$-5$",
          "$0$",
          "Both will cause a change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the factor $(x - 2)$ is squared, the expression stays positive on both sides of $x = 2$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the solution set for $\\frac{x - 5}{x - 2} \\le 0$?",

          "$(-\\infty, 2) \\cup [5, \\infty)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Test $x=3$: $(3-5)/(3-2) = -2$ (Negative). Boundaries are 2 and 5. 2 gets a parenthesis (denominator), 5 gets a bracket (numerator)."
      },
      {

        "question": "True or False: You should multiply both sides of a rational inequality by the denominator to clear the fraction.",

          "False",
          "True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "False! Since you don't know if the denominator is positive or negative, multiplying might require flipping the inequality sign. Use a sign chart instead."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a test value in an interval results in a positive number, and the inequality is $f(x) < 0$, do you include that interval in your answer?",

          "No",
          "Yes",
          "Only if the degree is even",
          "Only if the boundary is a hole"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The solution must match the inequality's requirement ($<$ means you want negative intervals)."

          "$(1, \\infty)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The expression equals 1 everywhere except at $x = -1$, where it is undefined. 1 is always $> 0$."

          "$0$",
          "$(-\\infty, 0)$",
          "$(0, \\infty)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$1/x^2$ is always positive where defined and never equals zero, so it can never be $\\le 0$."

          "Subtract 1 from both sides to get $\\frac{x}{x - 3} - 1 > 0$.",
          "Multiply by $x - 3$.",
          "Set $x = 0$ and $x = 3$.",
          "Cross multiply."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must compare the expression to zero to effectively use a sign chart."
