    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many sign changes are in $P(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 - x + 4$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From $x^3$ (pos) to $-4x^2$ (neg) is 1 change. From $-x$ (neg) to $+4$ (pos) is another change. Total = 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $P(x)$ has 3 sign changes, what are the possible numbers of positive real zeros?",
        "options": [
          "3 or 1",
          "Exactly 3",
          "3, 2, or 1",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Descartes' Rule says the number of zeros is the count of sign changes or less by an even integer (3, or 3-2=1)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the number of possible negative real zeros, you should examine the sign changes of:",
        "options": [
          "$P(-x)$",
          "$P(x)$",
          "$-P(x)$",
          "$P(1/x)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaluating $P(-x)$ flips the signs of terms with odd exponents, allowing you to test for negative roots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In synthetic division by $(x - c)$ where $c > 0$, if the bottom row is $1, 0, 2, 5$, what can you conclude?",
        "options": [
          "$c$ is an upper bound for the real zeros.",
          "$c$ is a lower bound for the real zeros.",
          "$c$ is a zero of the function.",
          "The function has no real zeros."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since all values in the bottom row are non-negative and $c > 0$, no real zeros can be larger than $c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In synthetic division by $(x - c)$ where $c < 0$, if the bottom row is $1, -2, 3, -4$, what can you conclude?",
        "options": [
          "$c$ is a lower bound for the real zeros.",
          "$c$ is an upper bound for the real zeros.",
          "$c$ is a root.",
          "There are no negative roots."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The alternating signs ($+, -, +, -$) combined with a negative $c$ indicate that no real zeros exist below $c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many sign changes are in $P(-x)$ for $P(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$?",

          "2",
          "0",
          "1",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P(-x) = (-x)^2 + 2(-x) + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1$. Signs are $+ , -, +$, which is 2 changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Descartes' Rule indicates 0 sign changes for $P(x)$, what does this mean?",
        "options": [
          "There are no positive real zeros.",
          "There is exactly one positive real zero.",
          "All zeros are imaginary.",
          "The graph does not have a y-intercept."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zero sign changes means there is no possibility of a positive real root."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the bottom row of synthetic division is $1, 2, 0, -3$, is the value in the box an upper bound?",
        "options": [
          "No, because of the $-3$.",
          "Yes, because zero counts as positive.",
          "No, because of the $0$.",
          "Yes, if the box value is negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Upper bounds require every single number in the bottom row to be $\\ge 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When checking the alternating sign pattern for a lower bound, how can you treat a '0' in the bottom row?",
        "options": [
          "As either positive or negative to fit the pattern.",
          "Always as positive.",
          "Always as negative.",
          "The pattern is automatically broken by a zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A zero is flexible in the alternating sign test; you can assign it the sign needed to keep the pattern $+ , -, +, -$ going."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Descartes' Rule of Signs provides the _____ number of real zeros.",

          "Possible",
          "Exact",
          "Maximum only",
          "Minimum only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It gives a list of possibilities, but you often need other tests to find the exact number."
