      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary goal of Gaussian Elimination?",
        "options": [
          "To transform a matrix into Row-Echelon Form.",
          "To find the determinant of a matrix.",
          "To multiply two matrices together.",
          "To find the inverse of a matrix immediately."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gaussian elimination simplifies a system into a 'staircase' form that makes solving by back-substitution easy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a legal row operation?",
        "options": [
          "Multiplying one element in a row by a constant while leaving the others alone.",
          "Swapping two rows.",
          "Multiplying an entire row by a non-zero constant.",
          "Adding a multiple of one row to another row."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Row operations must be applied to the *entire* row to maintain the equality of the underlying equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Row-Echelon Form, what is the value of the 'leading entry' in each non-zero row?",
        "options": [
          "1",
          "0",
          "Any prime number",
          "The determinant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard Row-Echelon Form requires leading entries (pivots) to be normalized to 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a row in an augmented matrix becomes [0 0 0 | 5], what does this indicate about the system?",
        "options": [
          "The system has no solution.",
          "The system has infinite solutions.",
          "The variable z equals 5.",
          "The system is consistent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This row translates to the equation 0 = 5, which is impossible, indicating an inconsistent system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a row in an augmented matrix becomes [0 0 0 | 0], what does this indicate?",
        "options": [
          "The system has infinitely many solutions (or is dependent).",
          "The system has no solution.",
          "The solution is (0,0,0).",
          "The system is inconsistent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A row of all zeros indicates a redundant equation, leading to infinitely many solutions if the rest of the system is consistent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Gauss-Jordan Elimination' compared to 'Gaussian Elimination'?",
        "options": [
          "It goes further to reach Reduced Row-Echelon Form (zeros above and below the 1s).",
          "It is only used for 2x2 matrices.",
          "It involves matrix multiplication instead of row operations.",
          "It is the same thing, just named after two people."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gauss-Jordan elimination continues the process until the variables are completely isolated (Reduced Row-Echelon Form)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you swap Row 1 and Row 2, does the solution to the system change?",
        "options": [
          "No",
          "Yes",
          "Only if the coefficients are negative",
          "Only in 3x3 systems"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Swapping rows is simply changing the order in which you list the equations; it does not change the intersection point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step typically taken when using Gaussian elimination?",
        "options": [
          "Get a 1 in the top-left corner (entry a11).",
          "Get a 0 in the top-left corner.",
          "Add all the rows together.",
          "Find the determinant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You start by creating a 'pivot' of 1 in the first column of the first row to use for eliminating entries below it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To get a zero in the second row of a matrix where $R1=[1, 2]$ and $R2=[3, 4]$, which operation is correct?",
        "options": [
          "$-3R1 + R2 \\to R2$",
          "$R1 - R2 \\to R2$",
          "$3R1 + R2 \\to R2$",
          "$R2 / 3 \\to R2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$-3(1) + 3 = 0$, so this operation successfully creates a zero in the first column of the second row."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Gaussian elimination can be used on any size system, as long as it is linear.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Matrices and Gaussian elimination are universal tools for all linear systems, regardless of the number of variables."
