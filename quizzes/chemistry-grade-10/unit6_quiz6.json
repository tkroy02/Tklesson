    "subtitle": "6.6: Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Bonds",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Bond polarity and electronegativity",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A covalent bond in which electrons are shared equally between two atoms is called a:",
        "options": [
          "Nonpolar covalent bond",
          "Polar covalent bond",
          "Ionic bond",
          "Metallic bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In nonpolar bonds, the electronegativity difference is so small (usually < 0.5) that the electrons spend equal time around both nuclei."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What property of an atom determines how strongly it attracts electrons in a chemical bond?",
        "options": [
          "Electronegativity",
          "Atomic mass",
          "Ionization energy",
          "Atomic radius"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electronegativity is the measure of an atom's ability to 'pull' on shared electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a polar covalent bond, the atom with the higher electronegativity will develop a:",
        "options": [
          "Partial negative charge ($\\delta-$)",
          "Partial positive charge ($\\delta+$)",
          "Full $+1$ charge",
          "Full $-1$ charge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the electrons spend more time near the more electronegative atom, that side of the bond becomes slightly negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following bonds is likely to be the most polar?",
        "options": [
          "$H-F$",
          "$O-O$",
          "$C-H$",
          "$N-Cl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The difference in electronegativity between Hydrogen (2.1) and Fluorine (4.0) is the largest among the options, creating a strong dipole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A molecule that has one end with a partial positive charge and the other with a partial negative charge is called a:",
        "options": [
          "Dipole",
          "Lattice",
          "Monopole",
          "Isotope"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dipole (two poles) exists when there is a separation of charge across a bond or molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the electronegativity difference between two atoms is greater than 2.0, the bond is generally considered:",
        "options": [
          "Ionic",
          "Nonpolar covalent",
          "Polar covalent",
          "Metallic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At such a high difference, one atom essentially 'steals' the electron from the other rather than sharing it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can a molecule contain polar bonds but be nonpolar overall?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, if the bond dipoles are symmetrical and cancel each other out.",
          "No, any polar bond makes the whole molecule polar.",
          "Yes, but only if the molecule is a liquid.",
          "No, because polar bonds always lead to a bent shape."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $CO_{2}$, the two $C=O$ bonds are polar, but because the molecule is linear, the dipoles pull in opposite directions and cancel out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecules is polar (a dipole)?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}O$",
          "$CCl_{4}$",
          "$CH_{4}$",
          "$O_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water's bent shape prevents the polar $O-H$ bonds from canceling out, resulting in a net molecular dipole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Greek letter delta ($\\delta$) is used in chemistry to represent:",
        "options": [
          "Partial charge",
          "Total energy",
          "Change in temperature",
          "Atomic number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\delta+$ and $\\delta-$ indicate that the charge is less than a full integer (not a full electron transfer)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these diatomic molecules contains a purely nonpolar covalent bond?",
        "options": [
          "$Cl_{2}$",
          "$HCl$",
          "$CO$",
          "$NO$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bonds between two atoms of the same element have an electronegativity difference of zero, ensuring perfectly equal sharing."
