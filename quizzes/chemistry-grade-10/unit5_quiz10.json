    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which property allows a metal to be hammered or rolled into thin sheets?",

          "Malleability",
          "Ductility",
          "Conductivity",
          "Brittleness"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Malleability is the ability of a solid to be deformed under compression, which is possible in metals because atoms can slide past each other in the electron sea."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The property that allows metals to be drawn into thin wires is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Ductility",
          "Luster",
          "Volatility",
          "Capillarity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ductility describes a material's ability to sustain plastic deformation under tensile stress (stretching) without breaking."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are metals excellent conductors of electricity?",
        "options": [
          "Their valence electrons are delocalized and can move freely in response to a potential difference.",
          "The nuclei of metal atoms move through the wire to carry the charge.",
          "Metal atoms are closer together than nonmetal atoms, allowing charge to 'jump'.",
          "Metals contain small channels of liquid water that allow ions to flow."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electricity is the flow of charge. In metals, the 'sea' of delocalized electrons provides a path for charge to move easily throughout the material."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Unlike ionic crystals, metals do not shatter when struck because:",
        "options": [
          "The delocalized electrons act as a flexible 'glue' that maintains the bond even as atoms shift.",
          "Metal atoms are too soft to break.",
          "Metals are liquid at the microscopic level.",
          "Metal atoms have no protons and therefore do not repel each other."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an ionic crystal, shifting layers causes like-charges to repel and shatter. In metals, the mobile electron sea adjusts to the new positions of the cations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Thermal conductivity in metals is primarily due to:",
        "options": [
          "Both the movement of delocalized electrons and the vibration of the lattice.",
          "The high density of the nucleus.",
          "The metal's ability to absorb oxygen from the air.",
          "The magnetic properties of the $d$ orbitals."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat is transferred quickly as mobile electrons collide with other particles and as the metal cations vibrate in place."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a result of the 'luster' found in most metals?",
        "options": [
          "The interaction of light with the surface of the delocalized electron sea.",
          "The presence of a thin layer of transparent nonmetal on the surface.",
          "The metal's high melting point.",
          "The emission of alpha particles from the metal's surface."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Luster occurs because delocalized electrons can absorb and re-emit light energy, causing the metal to appear shiny."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the electrical conductivity of most metals as the temperature increases?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases because increased lattice vibrations interfere with electron flow.",
          "It increases because the electrons move faster.",
          "It stays the same because the number of electrons is constant.",
          "It disappears completely as the metal becomes a plasma."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As heat increases, the metal cations vibrate more vigorously, which acts as 'resistance' to the flow of the delocalized electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An 'alloy' is a mixture of elements that has metallic properties. Why are alloys often used instead of pure metals?",
        "options": [
          "They are often harder and more resistant to corrosion.",
          "They are always cheaper to produce.",
          "They have lower melting points for easier cooking.",
          "They are much more brittle than pure metals."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mixing different sized atoms (like Carbon in Iron to make Steel) disrupts the regular lattice, making it harder for layers to slide and thus increasing strength."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element would you expect to be the best conductor of electricity among the following?",
        "options": [
          "Silver ($Ag$)",
          "Sulfur ($S$)",
          "Phosphorus ($P$)",
          "Iodine ($I$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Silver is a metal with a highly efficient metallic bond; the others are nonmetals with localized electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Metallic properties are most pronounced in elements found in which region of the periodic table?",
        "options": [
          "Lower left",
          "Upper right",
          "Middle right",
          "Top center"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elements in the lower left have the largest atomic radii and lowest ionization energies, meaning they lose or delocalize electrons most easily."
