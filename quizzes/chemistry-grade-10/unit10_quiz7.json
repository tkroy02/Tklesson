    "topic": "How environmental factors change reaction speed",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In general, how does increasing the temperature of a reaction affect the reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the rate because particles move faster and collide more energetically.",
          "It decreases the rate because particles move too fast to bond.",
          "It has no effect on the rate of reaction.",
          "It only increases the rate if the reaction is endothermic."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher temperature increases kinetic energy, leading to more frequent collisions and a higher percentage of collisions that exceed the activation energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the concentration of a reactant is increased, the reaction rate usually increases because:",
        "options": [
          "There are more particles in the same volume, increasing collision frequency.",
          "The activation energy of the reaction is lowered.",
          "The particles move significantly faster at higher concentrations.",
          "The enthalpy of the reaction becomes more negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher concentration means more particles are packed together, making it statistically more likely that they will bump into one another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the '10-degree rule' of thumb in many chemical systems, increasing the temperature by 10°C often causes the rate to:",
        "options": [
          "Approximately double",
          "Stay exactly the same",
          "Decrease by half",
          "Increase by 10 times"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While not universal, many common biological and chemical reactions see their rate roughly double for every 10-degree Celsius increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a reaction involving gases, how does increasing the pressure (by decreasing volume) affect the rate?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the rate by increasing the concentration of gas particles.",
          "It decreases the rate because the particles are too crowded to move.",
          "It increases the rate by lowering the temperature of the system.",
          "It has no effect on the frequency of molecular collisions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing pressure on a gas is equivalent to increasing its concentration; particles are closer together and collide more often."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the effect of temperature on the 'energy distribution' of molecules?",
        "options": [
          "A higher temperature increases the fraction of molecules that possess enough energy to cross the activation energy barrier.",
          "Temperature only changes the orientation of the molecules, not their energy.",
          "Higher temperature forces all molecules to have the exact same energy.",
          "Temperature decreases the potential energy of the reactants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At higher temperatures, the Boltzmann distribution shifts, meaning more particles reach the threshold of the activation energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a glow stick (a chemical reaction), why does placing it in a freezer make the light dimmer?",
        "options": [
          "The lower temperature slows down the reaction rate, releasing energy more slowly.",
          "The cold temperature destroys the chemical reactants.",
          "The cold temperature increases the activation energy barrier.",
          "The light is actually brighter, but our eyes cannot see it in the cold."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lowering the temperature reduces the kinetic energy of the reactants, leading to fewer effective collisions per second."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a higher concentration not change the activation energy of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Activation energy is an intrinsic property of the reaction pathway, not the amount of substance.",
          "Concentration actually does change the activation energy.",
          "Activation energy only applies to temperature, not concentration.",
          "Concentration changes the enthalpy, which cancels out the activation energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Concentration affects how many times molecules hit each other, but it doesn't change the 'height of the hill' they have to jump over."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you dilute a solution by adding more solvent, what happens to the reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "The rate decreases because the reactant particles are farther apart.",
          "The rate increases because the particles have more room to move.",
          "The rate stays the same because the total number of moles is constant.",
          "The rate increases because the activation energy is lowered."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dilution lowers the concentration (molarity), leading to fewer collisions between reactant particles per second."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Increasing the concentration of a reactant increases the frequency of collisions. Which other factor is also increased by higher concentration?",
        "options": [
          "The probability of effective collisions per unit of time.",
          "The average kinetic energy of the particles.",
          "The specific heat capacity of the solvent.",
          "The stability of the activated complex."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the energy of individual collisions doesn't change, the total number of successful reactions per second increases because the total collision count is higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best summarizes the difference between the effects of temperature and concentration?",
        "options": [
          "Temperature affects collision energy and frequency; concentration only affects frequency.",
          "Concentration affects collision energy and frequency; temperature only affects frequency.",
          "Temperature affects orientation; concentration affects activation energy.",
          "Both factors exclusively change the activation energy of the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature makes particles move faster (frequency) AND hit harder (energy). Concentration only makes them hit more often (frequency)."
