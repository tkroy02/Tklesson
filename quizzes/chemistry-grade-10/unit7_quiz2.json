        "question": "What is the primary difference between a word equation and a skeleton equation?",
        "options": [
          "A skeleton equation uses chemical formulas instead of names.",
          "A word equation is always balanced, while a skeleton is not.",
          "A skeleton equation only shows the reactants.",
          "A word equation is used only for physical changes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Word equations use full names (e.g., 'Water'), while skeleton equations use symbols (e.g., '$H_{2}O$')."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a 'diatomic' element that must be written with a subscript of 2 when it is alone in a skeleton equation?",

          "Sodium ($Na$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen is one of the seven diatomic elements ($H, N, O, F, Cl, Br, I$) that exist as pairs in nature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $A + B \\rightarrow C + D$, the 'plus' sign between C and D means:",

          "And",
          "Reacts with",
          "Yields",
          "Dissolves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On the product side, the plus sign simply separates the different substances that were produced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a triangle ($\\Delta$) is written over the arrow in a chemical equation, what does it signify?",
        "options": [
          "Heat must be added to the reaction.",
          "The reaction takes place in a vacuum.",
          "A catalyst is being used.",
          "The reaction results in a change in shape."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The delta symbol is the shorthand for 'heat' in a chemical reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct skeleton equation for: 'Hydrogen gas and bromine gas react to form liquid hydrogen bromide'?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}(g) + Br_{2}(g) \\rightarrow HBr(l)$",
          "$H + Br \\rightarrow HBr$",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is a skeleton equation considered 'incomplete' compared to a balanced equation?",
        "options": [
          "It does not show the relative amounts of reactants and products.",
          "It does not list the state of matter.",
          "It does not name the elements correctly.",
          "It is missing the products."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Skeleton equations identify the 'who' but not the 'how much', often violating the Law of Conservation of Mass."
