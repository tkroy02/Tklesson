          "$H_{2}K$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $K^{+}$ ion from the base and the $SO_{4}^{2-}$ ion from the acid combine to form $K_{2}SO_{4}$."

          "Single-replacement"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ions 'switch partners' to form water and the salt, which is the hallmark of a double-replacement reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the net ionic equation for the neutralization of a strong acid by a strong base in aqueous solution?",
        "options": [
          "$H^{+}_{(aq)} + OH^{-}_{(aq)} \\rightarrow H_{2}O_{(l)}$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Regardless of the specific acid or base, the fundamental change is the combination of hydrogen and hydroxide ions to form liquid water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If equal moles of a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, the resulting solution will typically have a pH of:",

          "0",
          "14",
          "More than 10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Complete neutralization of a strong acid and strong base results in a neutral solution ($pH = 7$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an acid reacts with a carbonate or bicarbonate (like $NaHCO_{3}$), what additional product is formed besides salt and water?",

          "Ammonia"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reactions with carbonates produce $CO_{2}$ gas, which is why vinegar and baking soda fizz when mixed."

          "3 moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sulfuric acid is diprotic ($2$ hydrogens), so it requires $2$ hydroxide ions ($2$ moles of $NaOH$) to be fully neutralized."
