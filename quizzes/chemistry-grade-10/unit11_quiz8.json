        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This rule refers to the fact that polar solvents dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes."

          "It turns the solid gaseous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to break apart the solid lattice, allowing more solid to dissolve in the water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the term for a substance, like water, that does the dissolving in a solution?",

          "Solute",
          "Product",
          "Catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The solvent is the medium that dissolves the solute; it is always the component present in the largest amount in the mixture."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which concentration unit is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of total solution?",

          "Molarity",
          "Molality",
          "Density",
          "Molar Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molarity (M) is the standard unit of concentration used to express the amount of a chemical in a specific volume of liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect does increasing the pressure have on the solubility of a gas in a liquid solvent?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the solubility",
          "It decreases the solubility",
          "It has no effect on gases",
          "It causes the gas to freeze"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Henry's Law, as the pressure above the liquid increases, more gas molecules are forced to dissolve into the liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following actions would NOT help a solid solute dissolve faster in a liquid?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing the surface area",
          "Stirring the entire mixture",
          "Heating the liquid solvent",
          "Crushing the solid crystals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decreasing surface area (using large chunks instead of powder) slows down the process because fewer molecules touch the solvent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'Supersaturated' solution characterized by in a laboratory setting?",
        "options": [
          "Containing more solute than is normally possible",
          "Having a very low concentration of hydrogen ions",
          "Being able to dissolve many more grams of sugar",
          "Turning into a solid metal through cold pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Supersaturated solutions are unstable and hold more solute than the saturation point, often achieved by cooling a hot solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you distinguish between a 'Dilute' and a 'Concentrated' solution?",
        "options": [
          "Based on the ratio of solute to the solvent",
          "Based on the total weight of the glass bottle",
          "Based on the speed at which the liquid flows",
          "Based on the color of the labels on the tanks"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dilute solutions have a small amount of solute relative to the solvent, while concentrated solutions have a large amount."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is water often referred to as the 'Universal Solvent' in chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "It can dissolve a vast range of different substances",
          "It is found in every single corner of the universe",
          "It consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen",
          "It remains in the liquid state at room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water is highly polar, allowing it to dissolve many ionic compounds and polar molecular substances essential for life."
