    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For most solid solutes, increasing the temperature of the solvent will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase the solubility.",
          "Decrease the solubility.",
          "Have no effect on the solubility.",
          "Turn the solvent into a gas immediately."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In most solids, higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to break the intermolecular forces of the solute, allowing more to dissolve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the temperature affect the solubility of **gases** in liquids?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases solubility.",
          "It increases solubility.",
          "It has no effect on gases.",
          "It makes the gas turn into a solid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As temperature rises, gas molecules gain kinetic energy and are more likely to escape the liquid, making them less soluble (think of warm soda going flat faster)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Henry's Law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "The pressure of the gas above the liquid.",
          "The volume of the liquid.",
          "The surface area of the solute.",
          "The molar mass of the solvent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing the pressure of a gas above a liquid forces more gas particles into the solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following will increase the **rate** at which a solid dissolves, but not the total amount that can dissolve?",
        "options": [
          "Crushing the solute (increasing surface area).",
          "Increasing the temperature.",
          "Increasing the pressure.",
          "Adding more solvent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crushing a solid increases the surface area exposed to the solvent, speeding up the process, but the maximum capacity (solubility) remains the same at a given temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Stirring (agitation) increases the rate of dissolution because it:",
        "options": [
          "Brings fresh solvent into contact with the surface of the solute.",
          "Increases the chemical reactivity of the solute.",
          "Decreases the temperature of the mixture.",
          "Changes the polarity of the water molecules."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Agitation moves the dissolved solute particles away from the solid surface, allowing 'empty' solvent molecules to reach the solute faster."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a bottle of carbonated beverage hiss when you open the cap?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure decreases, causing the solubility of $CO_{2}$ to drop.",
          "The temperature increases, causing the $CO_{2}$ to expand.",
          "The volume of the liquid increases suddenly.",
          "A chemical reaction occurs between the liquid and the air."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sudden drop in pressure above the liquid reduces the solubility of the dissolved $CO_{2}$ gas, causing it to escape rapidly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these factors has almost **no effect** on the solubility of solid solutes in liquid solvents?",
        "options": [
          "Pressure",
          "Temperature",
          "Nature of the solute",
          "Nature of the solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While pressure dramatically affects gas solubility, solids and liquids are virtually incompressible, so pressure changes don't change their solubility significantly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'solubility curve' graph typically shows the relationship between:",
        "options": [
          "Solubility (g/100g solvent) and Temperature.",
          "Pressure and Volume.",
          "Mass and Moles.",
          "pH and Concentration."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solubility curves plot how many grams of a solute can dissolve in a standard amount of water as the temperature changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to dissolve a large cube of sugar as fast as possible, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Crush it, add it to hot water, and stir.",
          "Leave it whole in cold water.",
          "Increase the pressure in the room.",
          "Add it to a saturated solution."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combining increased surface area, higher temperature, and agitation maximizes the rate of dissolution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Thermal pollution in lakes (rising water temperatures) is dangerous to fish primarily because:",
        "options": [
          "Warm water holds less dissolved Oxygen gas.",
          "Warm water dissolves the fish's scales.",
          "The salt in the water becomes too concentrated.",
          "The fish cannot swim as fast in warm water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because gas solubility decreases as temperature increases, warm water can lead to oxygen depletion for aquatic life."
