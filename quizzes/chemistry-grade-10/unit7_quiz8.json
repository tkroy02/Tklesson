        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When two clear liquids react to form an opaque solid, that solid is called a precipitate."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nearly all nitrates are soluble in water, making them common 'spectator ions' in these reactions."

        "question": "What happens if a double replacement reaction results in two products that are both highly soluble (aqueous)?",

          "No actual chemical reaction occurred.",
          "A precipitate will eventually form if you wait.",
          "The solution will explode.",
          "The atoms will disappear."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If all ions remain dissolved in the water, no new chemical structure has been 'locked' into place, and no reaction has truly occurred."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the product of the reaction between $NaOH(aq)$ and $HCl(aq)$?",
