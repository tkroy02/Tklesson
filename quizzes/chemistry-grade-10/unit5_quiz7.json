    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When writing the formula for an ionic compound, which component is always written first?",
        "options": [
          "The cation (positive ion)",
          "The anion (negative ion)",
          "The element with the higher mass",
          "The element that is a nonmetal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By chemical convention, the positive ion (metal) is always placed before the negative ion (nonmetal) in the chemical formula."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct chemical formula for the compound formed between Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and Chlorine ($Cl^{-}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$CaCl_{2}$",
          "$CaCl$",
          "$Ca_{2}Cl$",
          "$Ca_{2}Cl_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To balance the charges, two chloride ions (total $-2$) are needed to neutralize one calcium ion ($+2$), resulting in $CaCl_{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the net (total) charge of any correctly written ionic compound formula?",
        "options": [
          "Zero (0)",
          "$+1$",
          "$-1$",
          "It depends on the group number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionic compounds are electrically neutral; the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct formula for Aluminum Oxide, formed from $Al^{3+}$ and $O^{2-}$?",

          "$Al_{2}O_{3}$",
          "$AlO$",
          "$Al_{3}O_{2}$",
          "$Al_{6}O_{6}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the 'criss-cross' method, two $Al^{3+}$ ions (total $+6$) balance three $O^{2-}$ ions (total $-6$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The small numbers written to the lower right of an element's symbol in a formula are called:",
        "options": [
          "Subscripts",
          "Superscripts",
          "Coefficients",
          "Oxidation numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subscripts indicate the number of atoms or ions of that specific element present in the formula unit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When writing a formula for a compound containing a polyatomic ion, when should parentheses be used?",
        "options": [
          "When more than one of that polyatomic ion is needed to balance the charge.",
          "Every time a polyatomic ion is present in the formula.",
          "Only when the polyatomic ion is a cation.",
          "Parentheses are never used in ionic formulas."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parentheses act as a grouping symbol; for example, $Mg(OH)_{2}$ indicates two hydroxide groups for every one magnesium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct formula for the compound formed between Sodium ($Na^{+}$) and the Sulfate ion ($SO_{4}^{2-}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$Na_{2}SO_{4}$",
          "$NaSO_{4}$",
          "$Na(SO_{4})_{2}$",
          "$Na_{2}S$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two sodium ions ($+1$ each) are required to balance the $-2$ charge of a single sulfate ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for Magnesium Nitride, formed from $Mg^{2+}$ and $N^{3-}$?",
        "options": [
          "$Mg_{3}N_{2}$",
          "$Mg_{2}N_{3}$",
          "$MgN$",
          "$Mg_{3}N_{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To achieve neutrality, three magnesium ions (total $+6$) combine with two nitride ions (total $-6$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct formula for Barium Nitrate ($Ba^{2+}$ and $NO_{3}^{-}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$Ba(NO_{3})_{2}$",
          "$BaNO_{32}$",

          "$BaN_{2}O_{6}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since two nitrate ions are needed, parentheses are placed around the $NO_{3}$ group before adding the subscript 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Ionic formulas should always be written in their simplest whole-number ratio, also known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Empirical formula",
          "Molecular formula",
          "Structural formula",
          "Atomic formula"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because ionic compounds form lattices, we always reduce the subscripts to the lowest ratio (e.g., $MgO$ instead of $Mg_{2}O_{2}$)."
