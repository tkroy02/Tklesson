        "answer": "A",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because molecules are discrete units held together by weak forces (Van der Waals), they require less energy to overcome these attractions and change phase."

        "question": "How do the 'building blocks' of ionic and covalent compounds differ?",
        "options": [
          "Ionic compounds consist of a lattice of ions; covalent compounds consist of discrete molecules.",
          "Ionic compounds consist of molecules; covalent compounds consist of ions.",
          "Ionic compounds are made of only nonmetals; covalent compounds are made of metals.",
          "There is no difference in their fundamental building blocks."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionic substances form repeating 3D structures (formula units), while covalent substances exist as individual, independent groups of atoms (molecules)."

          "Metallic compounds",
          "Network solids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak intermolecular forces in covalent compounds mean that molecules can easily escape from the liquid phase into the gas phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance that is a soft solid, has a low melting point, and does not conduct electricity when melted is most likely:",
        "options": [
          "A molecular covalent compound",
          "An ionic compound",
          "A metallic alloy",
          "A crystal lattice"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are characteristic properties of molecular solids like wax or sugar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Bonding in a molecule like $HCl$ is __________; the force between two $HCl$ molecules is __________.",
        "options": [
          "Intramolecular; Intermolecular",
          "Intermolecular; Intramolecular",
          "Ionic; Covalent",
          "Metallic; Ionic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bonds within a molecule (intra-) are strong covalent bonds; forces between separate molecules (inter-) are weaker dipole-dipole forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a 'network covalent' solid, which behaves differently than most molecular compounds by having a very high melting point?",
        "options": [
          "Diamond ($C$)",
          "Water ($H_{2}O$)",
          "Carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$)",
          "Ammonia ($NH_{3}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Network solids like diamond or quartz involve a continuous web of covalent bonds throughout the entire structure, making them incredibly hard and heat-resistant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When comparing $NaCl$ (ionic) and $H_{2}O$ (covalent), which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "$NaCl$ has a much higher boiling point than $H_{2}O$.",
          "$H_{2}O$ is a solid at room temperature while $NaCl$ is a gas.",
          "$H_{2}O$ conducts electricity better than molten $NaCl$.",
          "Both substances are held together by London dispersion forces only."
        ],
        "answer": "A",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are most ionic compounds brittle, while many covalent molecular solids are soft?",
        "options": [
          "Repulsion between like-charged ions shatters the lattice; weak intermolecular forces allow molecular solids to be easily displaced.",
          "Ionic bonds are weaker than covalent bonds.",
          "Covalent molecules have no nuclei.",
          "Ionic compounds contain air pockets that make them snap."
