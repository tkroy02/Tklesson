          "Shares electrons with a metal atom."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding negatively charged electrons to a neutral atom results in a net negative charge, creating an anion."
      },

          "Transition Metals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nonmetals have high electronegativity and high electron affinity, making it easy for them to attract and gain electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard suffix added to the root name of an element to name a monoatomic anion?",
        "options": [
          "-ide",
          "-ate",
          "-ite",
          "-ic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monoatomic anions use the suffix '-ide', such as Oxide ($O^{2-}$), Chloride ($Cl^{-}$), and Nitride ($N^{3-}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the radius of an anion compare to the radius of its parent atom?",
        "options": [
          "The anion is larger.",
          "The anion is smaller.",
          "They are the same size.",
          "The anion is smaller only for Halogens."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding electrons increases electron-electron repulsion, causing the electron cloud to spread out and increase the radius."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a Fluorine atom ($F$) becomes a fluoride ion ($F^{-}$), it becomes isoelectronic with:",

          "Neon",
          "Helium",
          "Argon",
          "Krypton"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluorine has 9 electrons; gaining 1 gives it 10, which is the same electron configuration as Neon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An atom of Oxygen (Group 16) will form an ion with what charge?",
        "options": [
          "$2-$",
          "$2+$",
          "$6-$",
          "$1-$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen has 6 valence electrons and needs 2 more to complete its octet, resulting in a charge of $-2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct symbol and name for the ion formed by Nitrogen?",
        "options": [
          "$N^{3-}$, Nitride ion",
          "$N^{3+}$, Nitrogen ion",
          "$N^{-}$, Nitrite ion",
          "$N^{5-}$, Nitrate ion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen is in Group 15 and gains 3 electrons to reach an octet, forming the Nitride ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do Halogens (Group 17) typically form $1-$ ions?",
        "options": [
          "They have 7 valence electrons and only need to gain 1 more.",
          "They have 1 valence electron and lose it easily.",
          "They have a full octet and are very stable.",
          "They lose 7 electrons to reach the previous noble gas."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With 7 valence electrons, gaining one is the most energetically efficient way to achieve a noble gas configuration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these elements would form an anion with a $3-$ charge?",
        "options": [
          "Phosphorus",
          "Sulfur",
          "Aluminum",
          "Chlorine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phosphorus is in Group 15 ($s^{2} p^{3}$) and needs 3 more electrons to fill its $p$ sublevel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy change associated with an atom gaining an electron is called:",

          "Electron affinity",
          "Ionization energy",
          "Electronegativity",
          "Lattice energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electron affinity is the energy released or absorbed when an atom in the gaseous state acquires an electron."
