    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines an empirical formula?",
        "options": [
          "The simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound.",
          "The actual number of atoms of each element present in a molecule.",
          "The percentage by mass of each element within a substance.",
          "The total mass of one mole of a specific chemical compound."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An empirical formula shows the lowest common denominator of elements rather than the specific molecular count."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When starting with percent composition data, what is the most helpful first step for the calculation?",
        "options": [
          "Assume you have a 100 gram sample so percentages become grams.",
          "Multiply all percentages by Avogadro's number.",
          "Divide the percentages by the total number of atoms.",
          "Subtract the percentages from the total molar mass."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If you assume 100 g, a 25% composition becomes exactly 25 grams, making the transition to moles much easier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After converting the mass of each element to moles, what is the next step to find the formula subscripts?",
        "options": [
          "Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value obtained.",
          "Multiply each mole value by the molar mass.",
          "Average all the mole values together.",
          "Round every mole value to the nearest whole number immediately."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing by the smallest number scales the ratio so that at least one element has a subscript of 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A compound contains 0.5 moles of Carbon and 1.0 mole of Oxygen. What is its empirical formula?",
        "options": [
          "$CO_{2}$",
          "$C_{0.5}O_{1}$",
          "$C_{2}O$",
          "$CO$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing both by the smallest value (0.5) gives a ratio of 1 Carbon to 2 Oxygens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If your mole ratio calculation results in a decimal ending in .5 (e.g., 1:1.5), what should you do?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply all subscripts by 2 to get whole numbers.",
          "Round the .5 up to the next whole number.",
          "Round the .5 down to the previous whole number.",
          "Leave the formula with the decimal subscript."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You cannot round .5; multiplying the entire ratio by 2 (e.g., $Fe_{1}O_{1.5} \\rightarrow Fe_{2}O_{3}$) maintains the ratio while providing whole numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the empirical formula for a compound that is 50% Sulfur and 50% Oxygen by mass? (S $\\approx$ 32g, O $\\approx$ 16g)",

          "$SO_{2}$",
          "$SO$",
          "$S_{2}O$",
          "$SO_{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "50g S / 32 $\\approx$ 1.56 mol. 50g O / 16 $\\approx$ 3.125 mol. 3.125 / 1.56 $\\approx$ 2. The ratio is 1:2."

        "question": "Which of the following molecular formulas is also an empirical formula?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_{4}$",
          "$C_{2}H_{6}$",
          "$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$",
          "$H_{2}O_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$CH_{4}$ is already in its simplest whole-number ratio (1:4) and cannot be reduced further."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a compound has a mole ratio of 1 Carbon to 1.33 Hydrogen, what factor should you multiply by?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "2",
          "4",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since 0.33 is approximately 1/3, multiplying by 3 will result in a whole number (3.99 $\\approx$ 4)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the empirical formula of a compound that is 25% Hydrogen and 75% Carbon by mass? (C=12, H=1)",

          "$CH_{4}$",
          "$CH$",
          "$C_{3}H$",
          "$C_{2}H_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "75g C / 12 = 6.25 mol. 25g H / 1 = 25 mol. 25 / 6.25 = 4. The ratio is 1 Carbon to 4 Hydrogens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can two different compounds have the same empirical formula?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, such as Acetylene ($C_{2}H_{2}$) and Benzene ($C_{6}H_{6}$).",
          "No, every compound has a unique empirical formula.",
          "Yes, but only if they are both gases at STP.",
          "No, unless they have the same molar mass."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Many compounds share the same simplest ratio ($CH$) but differ in their actual molecular structure and mass."
