    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Nomenclature for ionic compounds",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for the compound $NaCl$?",
        "options": [
          "Sodium chloride",
          "Sodium chlorine",
          "Sodide chloride",
          "Monosodium monochloride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Binary ionic compounds are named by keeping the cation name and changing the anion's suffix to '-ide'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When naming a transition metal ion that can have multiple charges, what is used to indicate the specific charge?",
        "options": [
          "Roman numerals in parentheses",
          "Greek prefixes like di- and tri-",
          "The suffix -ous or -ic only",
          "A subscript after the name"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Stock system uses Roman numerals, such as Iron(II) vs. Iron(III), to specify the oxidation state of the metal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for $Fe_{2}O_{3}$?",

          "Iron(III) oxide",
          "Iron(II) oxide",
          "Diiron trioxide",
          "Iron trioxide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $Fe_{2}O_{3}$, each Oxygen is $2-$. To balance the total $-6$ charge, each Iron must be $3+$, making it Iron(III) oxide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct name for $Mg_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}$?",

          "Magnesium phosphate",
          "Magnesium phosphide",
          "Trimagnesium diphosphate",
          "Magnesium(II) phosphate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Magnesium is a main-group metal and doesn't need Roman numerals; the polyatomic ion $PO_{4}^{3-}$ is named phosphate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the compound $CuCl$?",
        "options": [
          "Copper(I) chloride",

          "Copper chloride",
          "Monocopper chloride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since Chlorine is $1-$, Copper must be $1+$ to balance the charge, resulting in Copper(I) chloride."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A polyatomic ion ending in '-ate' usually has __________ oxygen atoms than the version ending in '-ite'.",
        "options": [
          "More",
          "Fewer",
          "The same number of",
          "Double the"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For example, Nitrate ($NO_{3}^{-}$) has more oxygens than Nitrite ($NO_{2}^{-}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for $K_{2}O$?",
        "options": [
          "Potassium oxide",
          "Dipotassium oxide",
          "Potassium(I) oxide",
          "Potassium dioxide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Greek prefixes are not used for ionic compounds, and main-group metals like Potassium do not use Roman numerals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the polyatomic ion $NH_{4}^{+}$?",
        "options": [
          "Ammonium",
          "Ammonia",
          "Nitrate",
          "Nitride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ammonium is one of the few common polyatomic cations."
      },

          "Lead(II) sulfate",
          "Lead(IV) sulfate",
          "Lead sulfate",
          "Lead sulfur tetraoxide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sulfate ($SO_{4}^{2-}$) has a $2-$ charge, so Lead must have a $2+$ charge to balance it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The name 'Calcium hydroxide' refers to which formula?",
        "options": [
          "$Ca(OH)_{2}$",
          "$CaOH$",
          "$Ca_{2}OH$",
          "$CaH_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Calcium is $2+$ and hydroxide is $1-$. We need two hydroxides to balance the charge, using parentheses."
