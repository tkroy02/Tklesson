      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cation is formed when an atom:",
        "options": [
          "Loses one or more valence electrons.",
          "Gains one or more valence electrons.",
          "Gains a proton in the nucleus.",
          "Shares electrons with a nonmetal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When an atom loses negatively charged electrons, it is left with a net positive charge, becoming a cation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which types of elements are most likely to form cations?",
        "options": [
          "Metals",
          "Nonmetals",
          "Noble Gases",
          "Halogens"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metals have low ionization energies and few valence electrons, making it energetically favorable for them to lose electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct symbol for a Magnesium ion?",
        "options": [
          "$Mg^{2+}$",
          "$Mg^{2-}$",
          "$Mg^{+}$",
          "$Mg^{M}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Magnesium is in Group 2 and loses its two valence electrons to achieve a stable octet, resulting in a $+2$ charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the radius of a cation compare to the radius of its neutral parent atom?",
        "options": [
          "The cation is always smaller.",
          "The cation is always larger.",
          "They are exactly the same size.",
          "The cation is larger only if it is a transition metal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Losing electrons reduces electron-electron repulsion and often removes an entire outer energy level, causing the cloud to shrink."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the electron configuration of a Sodium ion ($Na^{+}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{6}$",
          "$1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{6} 3s^{1}$",
          "$1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{5}$",
          "$1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{6} 3s^{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A neutral Sodium atom loses its $3s^{1}$ electron, leaving it with the same stable configuration as Neon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transition metals are unique because they can often form:",
        "options": [
          "More than one type of stable cation (multiple oxidation states).",
          "Only anions with negative charges.",
          "Cations by gaining protons instead of losing electrons.",
          "Only $+1$ ions regardless of their group."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Transition metals can lose electrons from both their outermost $s$ and inner $d$ orbitals, leading to ions like $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When naming a monoatomic cation of a main-group metal, the name is:",
        "options": [
          "The same as the name of the element followed by 'ion'.",
          "The name of the element with the suffix '-ide'.",
          "The name of the element with the suffix '-ate'.",
          "A completely unique Latin name."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For example, $Na^{+}$ is simply called the 'Sodium ion'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the charge of an Aluminum ion?",
        "options": [
          "$3+$",
          "$1+$",
          "$2+$",
          "$3-$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aluminum is in Group 13 and loses its three valence electrons to become stable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy required to remove an electron and form a cation is called:",
        "explanation": "Ionization energy is the energy cost to pull an electron away from the attraction of the nucleus.",
        "options": [
          "Ionization energy",
          "Electronegativity",
          "Electron affinity",
          "Lattice energy"

          "$Mg^{2+}$",
          "$Li^{+}$",
          "$Ca^{2+}$",
          "$K^{+}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isoelectronic means having the same electron configuration. $Mg^{2+}$ has 10 electrons, just like Neon."
