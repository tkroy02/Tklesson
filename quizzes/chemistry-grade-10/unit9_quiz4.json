        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard formula used to calculate Molarity ($M$)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{Molarity} = \\frac{\\text{moles of solute}}{\\text{liters of solution}}$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in exactly one liter of solution."

          "2.0 M",
          "0.008 M",
          "0.5 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, convert $500$ mL to $0.5$ L. Then, $4.0 \\text{ moles} / 0.5 \\text{ L} = 8.0 \\text{ M}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you need to prepare $1.0$ L of a $2.0$ M $NaOH$ solution, how many grams of $NaOH$ do you need? (Molar mass of $NaOH = 40.0$ g/mol)",

          "80.0 grams",
          "40.0 grams",

          "2.0 grams"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find moles: $2.0 \\text{ M} \\times 1.0 \\text{ L} = 2.0 \\text{ moles}$. Then convert to mass: $2.0 \\text{ mol} \\times 40.0 \\text{ g/mol} = 80.0 \\text{ g}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To convert milliliters (mL) to liters (L) for molarity calculations, you should:",

          "Divide by 1000",
          "Multiply by 1000",
          "Divide by 100",
          "Add 273"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since there are $1000$ mL in $1$ L, dividing by $1000$ shifts the decimal three places to the left to give the volume in liters."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What volume of a $3.0$ M solution is needed to provide $0.6$ moles of solute?",

          "0.2 L",
          "5.0 L",
          "1.8 L",
          "200 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $V = \\text{moles} / M$, we get $0.6 / 3.0 = 0.2$ L."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'concentrated' solution compared to a 'dilute' one?",
        "options": [
          "A concentrated solution has a large amount of solute relative to the solvent.",
          "A concentrated solution has a small amount of solute relative to the solvent.",
          "A concentrated solution must always be saturated.",
          "A concentrated solution has a lower molarity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Concentration is a qualitative measure of how much solute is packed into the solvent; higher molarity means it is more concentrated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a solution is diluted by adding more solvent, what happens to the total number of moles of solute?",
        "options": [
          "The number of moles stays the same.",
          "The number of moles increases.",
          "The number of moles decreases.",
          "The number of moles becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding solvent changes the volume and the molarity, but the physical amount of solute (the moles) remains constant."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the molarity of a solution if $116$ grams of $NaCl$ are dissolved in $2.0$ L of water? (Molar mass of $NaCl = 58.0$ g/mol)",

          "58.0 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find moles: $116 \\text{ g} / 58.0 \\text{ g/mol} = 2.0 \\text{ moles}$. Then find molarity: $2.0 \\text{ mol} / 2.0 \\text{ L} = 1.0 \\text{ M}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the molarity of a solution increases, the solution becomes:",

          "Less dense",
          "Supersaturated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molarity is a direct measure of concentration; as the value goes up, there is more solute per unit volume."
