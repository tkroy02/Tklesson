          "Destroy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nonmetals have high electronegativity and typically gain electrons to achieve a stable noble gas configuration."

          "Gases or brittle solids",
          "Lustrous liquids",
          "Malleable solids",
          "Good conductors of heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nonmetals lack the metallic bond that provides strength and conductivity, so they are often gases or crumbly solids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the term for a material that can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets?",

          "Brittle",
          "Insulator"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Malleability is a defining property of metals, allowed by the 'sea of electrons' that lets atoms slide past each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of elements is found along the 'staircase' line that divides metals from nonmetals?",

          "Nonmetal",
          "Metal",
          "Transition metal",
          "Alkaline earth metal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are classic properties of nonmetals, which act as insulators rather than conductors."
