    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Documenting experiments and results",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which section of a lab report should clearly state the purpose or the question being investigated?",
        "options": [
          "Materials",
          "Objective/Introduction",
          "Conclusion",
          "Data Table"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Objective or Introduction sets the stage by defining what the experiment is designed to test or discover."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the proper way to correct a mistake in a permanent lab notebook?",
        "options": [
          "Use correction fluid (white-out).",
          "Scribble over the error until it's unreadable.",
          "Draw a single line through the error and write the correction next to it.",
          "Tear out the page and start over."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Scientific integrity requires a transparent record; a single line allows the original entry to remain visible while showing the change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where should you place raw measurements and observations in your report?",
        "options": [
          "Hypothesis",
          "Discussion",
          "Results/Data",
          "Procedure"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Results section is dedicated to the 'raw' findings, such as numbers, colors, and temperatures recorded during the lab."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A statement that summarizes the findings and relates them back to the hypothesis is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Abstract",
          "Analysis",
          "Conclusion",
          "Variable"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The conclusion wraps up the report by stating what was learned and whether the hypothesis was supported or rejected."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is considered 'Qualitative Data' in a report?",
        "options": [
          "The mass was 5.45 grams.",
          "The liquid turned from clear to bright pink.",
          "The temperature rose by 12°C.",
          "The reaction took 45 seconds."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics (like color changes) rather than numerical measurements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the 'Analysis' section of a report, a scientist should:",
        "options": [
          "List every tool used in the lab.",
          "Describe how they felt during the experiment.",
          "Explain the meaning of the data and any patterns observed.",
          "Copy the procedure exactly as it was written."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Analysis is where you interpret the data, perform calculations, and explain why the results occurred."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important to record observations immediately during an experiment?",
        "options": [
          "To finish the lab faster.",
          "To ensure accuracy and prevent forgetting small details.",
          "Because lab notebooks are only for use during class.",
          "To keep the lab bench clean."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Human memory is fallible; recording data in real-time prevents errors and 'made-up' data later on."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When graphing data, the independent variable is typically placed on which axis?",
        "options": [
          "The X-axis (horizontal)",
          "The Y-axis (vertical)",
          "The Z-axis (depth)",
          "It does not matter."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By scientific convention, the independent variable (the one you control) goes on the X-axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these should be included in the 'Procedure' section?",
        "options": [
          "The final answer to the problem.",
          "A step-by-step account of what was done.",
          "A list of all mistakes made.",
          "The names of all students in the room."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A procedure should be detailed enough that another scientist could replicate your experiment exactly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: If your results do not support your hypothesis, the experiment is a failure.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "False. Disproving a hypothesis is just as valuable as proving one; it leads to new questions and further discovery."
