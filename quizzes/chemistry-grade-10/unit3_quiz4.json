      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the definition of an 'Isotope'?",
        "options": [
          "Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.",
          "Atoms of different elements with the same mass number.",
          "Atoms that have lost or gained electrons to become charged.",
          "Atoms with different numbers of protons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same atomic number) that differ in their mass number due to a different number of neutrons."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following remains the same between two isotopes of the same element?",

          "Atomic weight"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because chemical behavior is determined by the number of electrons (which equals the number of protons), isotopes react chemically in the same way."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Atomic Mass' listed on the Periodic Table is usually not a whole number because it is:",
        "options": [
          "A weighted average of all naturally occurring isotopes.",
          "The mass of the most common isotope only.",
          "Determined by the number of electrons in the atom.",
          "An estimate based on the size of the nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The atomic mass reflects both the mass and the relative abundance of each isotope found in nature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an element has two isotopes, one with a mass of 10 amu (20% abundance) and one with 11 amu (80% abundance), the average atomic mass will be closest to:",
        "options": [
          "10.8 amu",
          "10.2 amu",
          "10.5 amu",
          "11.0 amu"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The weighted average is calculated as: $(10 \times 0.20) + (11 \times 0.80) = 2 + 8.8 = 10.8$ amu."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are isotopes. How many more neutrons does Carbon-14 have than Carbon-12?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "6",
          "14",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon always has 6 protons. $14 - 6 = 8$ neutrons for C-14, and $12 - 6 = 6$ neutrons for C-12. The difference is 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the '14' in Carbon-14 represent?",
        "options": [
          "The mass number",
          "The atomic number",
          "The number of neutrons",
          "The number of electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In hyphen notation, the number following the element name is always the mass number ($A$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which instrument is used by scientists to determine the relative abundance of isotopes in a sample?",
        "options": [
          "Mass Spectrometer",
          "Geiger Counter",
          "Calorimeter",
          "Bunsen Burner"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A mass spectrometer separates particles by their mass-to-charge ratio, allowing scientists to see the different masses present in an element."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An isotope of Hydrogen called 'Deuterium' has 1 proton and 1 neutron. What is its mass number?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "0",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons: $1 + 1 = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two atoms are isotopes if they have the same __________ but different __________.",
        "options": [
          "Atomic number; Mass number",
          "Mass number; Atomic number",
          "Number of neutrons; Number of protons",
          "Charge; Chemical symbol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isotopes are the same element (same protons/atomic number) but have different weights (different neutrons/mass number)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are some isotopes, like Carbon-14, called 'Radioisotopes'?",
        "options": [
          "They have unstable nuclei that decay over time.",
          "They are only found in radios.",
          "They have more electrons than protons.",
          "They are the only isotopes that can form compounds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Radioisotopes have an unstable ratio of neutrons to protons, leading them to release radiation to reach a more stable state."
