        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Incomplete combustion occurs when there isn't enough oxygen to form $CO_{2}$, leading to the production of toxic carbon monoxide gas."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combustion releases energy into the surroundings, primarily in the form of heat and light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the combustion of Propane ($C_{3}H_{8} + 5O_{2} \\rightarrow 3CO_{2} + 4H_{2}O$), how many molecules of water are produced for every one molecule of propane burned?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "3",
          "5",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The balanced equation shows a coefficient of 4 for $H_{2}O$, meaning 4 molecules are produced per molecule of $C_{3}H_{8}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can a single element undergo a combustion reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, such as Magnesium burning in air to form $MgO$.",
          "No, combustion only involves compounds.",
          "Yes, but only if the element is a noble gas.",
          "No, that would be a decomposition reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The combustion of elements like $Mg$ or $S$ results in a single oxide product, which also fits the definition of a synthesis reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is necessary for a fire (combustion) to occur and be maintained?",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the coefficient of Oxygen when balancing the combustion of Ethanol: $\\_\\_C_{2}H_{5}OH + \\_\\_O_{2} \\rightarrow \\_\\_CO_{2} + \\_\\_H_{2}O$?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The balanced equation is $C_{2}H_{5}OH + 3O_{2} \\rightarrow 2CO_{2} + 3H_{2}O$. This ensures 7 oxygens on both sides."
      },

        "question": "Why is the combustion of fossil fuels a major environmental concern?",
        "options": [
          "It produces large amounts of $CO_{2}$, a greenhouse gas.",
          "It destroys all the oxygen in the atmosphere.",
          "It creates extra water that causes sea levels to rise directly.",
          "It turns the atmosphere into pure nitrogen."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon dioxide released from combustion traps heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global climate change."
