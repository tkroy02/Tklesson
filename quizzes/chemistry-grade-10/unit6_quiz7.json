    "subtitle": "6.7: Intermolecular Forces: London Dispersion Forces",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Weakest intermolecular forces",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "London dispersion forces are caused by:",
        "options": [
          "The constant motion of electrons creating temporary dipoles.",
          "The permanent attraction between two oppositely charged ions.",
          "The sharing of electron pairs between two nonmetals.",
          "The attraction between a Hydrogen atom and a Fluorine atom."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even in nonpolar atoms, electrons are constantly moving; at any split second, they may cluster on one side, creating an 'instantaneous dipole' that induces a dipole in a neighbor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following substances would possess London dispersion forces?",
        "options": [
          "All molecules and noble gas atoms.",
          "Only nonpolar molecules like $CH_{4}$.",
          "Only polar molecules like $H_{2}O$.",
          "Only ionic compounds like $NaCl$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because all atoms and molecules contain electrons, London dispersion forces are universal, though they are the only forces present in nonpolar substances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As the number of electrons in an atom or molecule increases, the strength of the London dispersion forces:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Remains constant",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More electrons (and a larger electron cloud) make a molecule more 'polarizable,' meaning it is easier to distort the cloud into a temporary dipole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following noble gases would you expect to have the highest boiling point due to stronger dispersion forces?",
        "options": [
          "Xenon ($Xe$)",
          "Helium ($He$)",
          "Neon ($Ne$)",
          "Argon ($Ar$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Xenon is the largest of these atoms with the most electrons; its electron cloud is more easily distorted, leading to stronger intermolecular attractions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "London dispersion forces are considered the __________ of all intermolecular forces.",
        "options": [
          "Weakest",
          "Strongest",
          "Most permanent",
          "Most metallic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because they rely on temporary, flickering dipoles rather than permanent charges, they are generally much weaker than dipole-dipole or hydrogen bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The ease with which the electron distribution around an atom or molecule can be distorted is called:",
        "options": [
          "Polarizability",
          "Electronegativity",
          "Ionization",
          "Viscosity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High polarizability leads to stronger London dispersion forces because it allows for larger temporary dipoles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these nonpolar molecules will have the strongest London dispersion forces?",
        "options": [
          "$I_{2}$",
          "$Br_{2}$",
          "$Cl_{2}$",
          "$F_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iodine ($I_{2}$) has the highest molar mass and the greatest number of electrons in this group, making its dispersion forces strong enough to make it a solid at room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can nonpolar substances like Oxygen ($O_{2}$) be liquefied at very low temperatures?",
        "options": [
          "London dispersion forces eventually become strong enough to overcome kinetic energy.",
          "The atoms form ionic bonds when they get cold enough.",
          "The covalent bond inside the molecule breaks.",
          "The electrons stop moving, allowing the nuclei to touch."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even though dispersion forces are weak, if the temperature is low enough (slowing molecular motion), these forces can pull the molecules together into a liquid state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a temporary dipole, the side of the atom with more electrons at a given moment has a:",
        "options": [
          "Partial negative charge ($\\delta-$)",
          "Full positive charge",
          "Neutral charge",
          "High electronegativity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The momentary imbalance of electrons creates a transient region of negative charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "London dispersion forces act between:",
        "options": [
          "Neighboring molecules",
          "Atoms within a single covalent bond",
          "Protons and neutrons in the nucleus",
          "Valence electrons and the core electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like all intermolecular forces, dispersion forces act *between* separate molecules, not within a single molecule."
