      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which symbol is used in a chemical equation to indicate that a substance is dissolved in water?",

          "(aq)",
          "(s)",
          "(l)",
          "(g)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The notation (aq) stands for aqueous, meaning the substance is a solute dissolved in water as the solvent."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction Zn + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2, what type of reaction is taking place?",
