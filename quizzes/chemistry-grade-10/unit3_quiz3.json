          "Protons plus neutrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "6",
          "14",
          "20"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$14 - 6 = 8$ neutrons."

          "Atomic number",
          "Mass number",
          "Number of neutrons",
          "Number of isotopes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The atomic number (proton count) is the unique 'ID' for an element. If the proton count changes, it's a different element."

          "The atomic number",
          "The mass number",
          "The number of neutrons",
          "The ionic charge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In isotopic notation, the bottom number (subscript) is the atomic number ($Z$)."

          "20",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a neutral atom, the number of negative electrons must equal the number of positive protons (atomic number)."
      },
