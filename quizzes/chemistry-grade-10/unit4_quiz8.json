    "subtitle": "4.8: Periodic Trends: Atomic Radius",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Size trends across the periodic table",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Atomic Radius'?",
        "options": [
          "One-half the distance between the nuclei of identical atoms bonded together.",
          "The distance from the nucleus to the innermost electron shell.",
          "The total volume of the nucleus of an atom.",
          "The number of protons found within the nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because electron clouds are fuzzy, the radius is defined as half the distance between the centers of two bonded atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As you move from top to bottom down a group, the atomic radius generally:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Changes unpredictably"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each step down a group adds a new principal energy level (shell), which increases the size of the electron cloud."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason atomic radius decreases from left to right across a period?",
        "options": [
          "Increased nuclear charge pulls electrons closer.",
          "The number of energy levels is decreasing.",
          "Electrons are losing mass as they pair up.",
          "The atoms are losing neutrons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As more protons are added to the nucleus, the 'pull' on the electrons increases, drawing the cloud tighter toward the center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements has the largest atomic radius?",
        "options": [
          "Francium ($Fr$)",
          "Fluorine ($F$)",
          "Helium ($He$)",
          "Oxygen ($O$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Francium is at the bottom-left of the table, where atoms have the most shells and the weakest relative nuclear pull."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements has the smallest atomic radius?",
        "options": [
          "Helium ($He$)",
          "Francium ($Fr$)",
          "Cesium ($Cs$)",
          "Lead ($Pb$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helium is at the top-right, having only one energy level and a high effective nuclear charge for its size."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Shielding Effect' refers to:",
        "options": [
          "Inner electrons blocking the nuclear pull from reaching valence electrons.",
          "The nucleus protecting the protons from escaping.",
          "The way the periodic table is shaped like a shield.",
          "Electrons shielding the nucleus from outside observers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inner shell electrons repel valence electrons, offsetting some of the positive pull from the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an atom loses an electron and becomes a positive cation, its radius:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Stays exactly the same",
          "Doubles in size"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Losing an electron reduces electron-electron repulsion and often results in the loss of an entire outer shell, making the ion smaller."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an atom gains an electron and becomes a negative anion, its radius:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Disappears",
          "Becomes equal to the nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding an electron increases repulsion between electrons, causing the cloud to spread out and become larger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Across Period 3, which element would you expect to be the smallest?",
        "options": [
          "Argon ($Ar$)",
          "Sodium ($Na$)",
          "Magnesium ($Mg$)",
          "Aluminum ($Al$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Argon has the highest number of protons in its period, exerting the strongest pull on its valence electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which trend direction matches an increase in atomic radius?",
        "options": [
          "Down and to the left",
          "Up and to the right",
          "Straight across to the right",
          "Up and to the left"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Radius increases as you add shells (Down) and as nuclear charge effectively weakens relative to shielding (Left)."
