    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Tare' or 'Zero' button on an electronic balance?",
        "options": [
          "To turn the balance off safely.",
          "To reset the display to zero, ignoring the mass of the container.",
          "To convert the mass from grams to ounces.",
          "To calibrate the internal weights of the balance."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Taring allows you to subtract the mass of the weigh boat or beaker so only the mass of the chemical is measured."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a chemistry lab, mass is most commonly measured in which unit?",
        "options": [
          "Liters (L)",
          "Pounds (lb)",
          "Grams (g)",
          "Newtons (N)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Grams are the standard metric unit for mass in laboratory settings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why should you never place chemicals directly onto the balance pan?",
        "options": [
          "It can corrode or damage the metal pan.",
          "It makes it harder to transfer the chemical to another flask.",
          "It can contaminate future experiments.",
          "All of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Using weigh boats or paper protects the equipment, prevents contamination, and makes handling safer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What should you do if the balance shows a small mass (like 0.02g) when the pan is empty?",
        "options": [
          "Subtract that number from your final result manually.",
          "Press the tare/zero button before starting.",
          "Assume the balance is broken and use a different one.",
          "Blow on the pan to clear any invisible dust."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pressing tare ensures the balance starts at exactly 0.00g for your specific measurement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Air currents can cause the reading on a high-precision balance to fluctuate. How is this usually prevented?",
        "options": [
          "By holding your breath while weighing.",
          "By using a draft shield or glass enclosure.",
          "By weighing the chemical very quickly.",
          "By turning off the lab's ventilation system."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Analytical balances often have glass doors (draft shields) to prevent air movement from affecting the delicate measurement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When weighing a hot object, what is the likely effect on the measured mass?",
        "options": [
          "The mass will appear higher than it actually is.",
          "The mass will appear lower than it actually is due to air buoyancy.",
          "The mass will be perfectly accurate.",
          "The balance will automatically shut down."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Hot objects create convection currents in the air that 'lift' the pan slightly, resulting in an incorrectly low reading."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Mass and weight are the same thing in a chemistry lab.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you need 5.00g of a powder, and you accidentally scoop 5.50g into the weigh boat, what should you do with the extra 0.50g?",
        "options": [
          "Pour it back into the original chemical bottle.",
          "Put it in a designated waste container.",
          "Leave it on the balance for the next student.",
          "Throw it in the regular trash can."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To prevent cross-contamination, never return used or excess chemicals to the original stock bottle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these factors could cause an electronic balance to give an unstable reading?",
        "options": [
          "Leaning on the lab bench while weighing.",
          "An unlevel balance.",
          "Spilled chemicals on the pan.",
          "All of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Balances are sensitive instruments; vibrations, being off-level, or debris can all lead to errors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct way to clean a small spill on a balance?",
        "options": [
          "Use a wet paper towel and lots of water.",
          "Use a soft brush to gently sweep it away.",
          "Blow it off with your breath.",
          "Wait for the instructor to clean it at the end of the day."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A gentle brush is the best way to remove dry solids without pushing them into the internal mechanisms of the balance."
