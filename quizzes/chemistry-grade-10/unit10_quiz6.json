    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to collision theory, what two conditions must be met for a collision between reactant molecules to be 'effective'?",
        "options": [
          "Sufficient kinetic energy and correct orientation.",
          "High temperature and the presence of a catalyst.",
          "Large surface area and high concentration.",
          "Low potential energy and gaseous state."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecules must collide with enough force to break existing bonds and be positioned so that the correct atoms can interact to form new ones."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The minimum amount of energy that reacting particles must have to form the activated complex is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Activation Energy ($E_{a}$)",
          "Enthalpy of Reaction ($\\Delta H$)",
          "Kinetic Energy",
          "Potential Energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Activation energy represents the 'energy hill' that reactants must climb before they can transform into products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the unstable, temporary arrangement of atoms that forms at the peak of the activation energy barrier?",
        "options": [
          "Activated Complex",
          "Reactant Intermediate",
          "Catalyst-Solute Complex",
          "Product Precursor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Also called a transition state, this is a short-lived grouping where old bonds are breaking and new bonds are forming simultaneously."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the activation energy for a reaction is very high, the reaction rate will likely be:",
        "options": [
          "Slow",
          "Fast",
          "Exothermic",
          "Spontaneous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A high energy barrier means fewer molecules will have enough kinetic energy to successfully cross it at a given temperature, resulting in a slower rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'orientation' requirement of collision theory?",
        "options": [
          "Reactants must hit each other at an angle that allows specific bonds to break and form.",
          "Reactants must be moving in a straight line toward the center of the container.",
          "Reactants must be oriented horizontally to the surface of the earth.",
          "Reactants must be spinning in the same direction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even with high energy, a collision will fail if the reactive parts of the molecules do not come into contact."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a potential energy diagram, the activation energy ($E_{a}$) is measured as the distance between:",
        "options": [
          "The energy of the reactants and the peak of the curve.",
          "The energy of the reactants and the energy of the products.",
          "The energy of the products and the peak of the curve.",
          "The bottom of the graph and the energy of the reactants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$E_{a}$ is the specific amount of additional energy required to reach the transition state from the starting energy of the reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the temperature affect collisions between molecules?",
        "options": [
          "It increases both the frequency of collisions and the energy of the collisions.",
          "It only increases the number of collisions, not their energy.",
          "It lowers the activation energy required for the reaction.",
          "It forces molecules to always collide with the correct orientation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher temperatures mean particles move faster (more frequent collisions) and strike with more force (more likely to overcome $E_{a}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the activated complex considered highly 'unstable'?",
        "options": [
          "It has the highest potential energy and is in the process of rearranging bonds.",
          "It is made of radioactive isotopes that decay quickly.",
          "It is a gas that immediately evaporates from the solution.",
          "It lacks a nucleus and therefore cannot hold together."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High potential energy states are unstable; the complex must quickly resolve into either products or back into reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction with a small activation energy will proceed ______ because ______ molecules have the required energy.",
        "options": [
          "Quickly; more",
          "Slowly; fewer",
          "Quickly; fewer",
          "Slowly; more"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A lower hurdle allows a larger fraction of the total population of molecules to pass over it successfully at any given time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Collision theory explains that most molecular collisions do NOT result in a reaction. Why is this?",
        "options": [
          "Most collisions lack either enough energy or the correct orientation.",
          "Molecules are naturally repelled by each other's gravitational fields.",
          "The law of conservation of mass prevents reactions from happening too often.",
          "Most molecules are in a 'sleep' state and must be woken up."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A reaction is a statistical event that requires the perfect alignment of energy and geometry at the exact same moment of impact."
