    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hydrogen bond is a specific, strong type of dipole-dipole attraction that occurs when hydrogen is bonded to:",
        "options": [
          "Fluorine, Oxygen, or Nitrogen ($F, O, N$)",
          "Any nonmetal in the periodic table",
          "Carbon or Phosphorus",
          "Alkali metals like Sodium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen bonding only occurs with the three most electronegative elements ($F, O, N$) because they create a very large partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are hydrogen bonds significantly stronger than regular dipole-dipole forces?",
        "options": [
          "The large electronegativity difference and small size of the hydrogen atom allow for close, strong attractions.",
          "Hydrogen bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between nuclei.",
          "Hydrogen bonds are actually a type of metallic bond.",
          "The hydrogen atom develops a full $+1$ ionic charge."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because hydrogen is small and its single electron is pulled away by $F, O,$ or $N$, the bare nucleus can get very close to the lone pairs of a neighboring molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecules exhibits hydrogen bonding?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}O$",
          "$CH_{4}$",
          "$H_{2}S$",
          "$HCl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water contains $O-H$ bonds, which are one of the three requirements for hydrogen bonding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What unique property of water is a direct result of extensive hydrogen bonding?",
        "options": [
          "Ice is less dense than liquid water, causing it to float.",
          "Water has an extremely low boiling point for its mass.",
          "Water is highly flammable.",
          "Water is a nonpolar solvent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen bonds organize water molecules into an open, hexagonal crystal lattice when frozen, increasing the volume and decreasing the density."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which substance would you expect to have the highest boiling point?",
        "options": [
          "$HF$",
          "$HCl$",
          "$HBr$",
          "$HI$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Despite being the smallest, $HF$ has the strongest intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding), requiring much more energy to vaporize."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydrogen bonding is responsible for holding together the two strands of which biological molecule?",
        "options": [
          "DNA",
          "Glucose",
          "Cellulose",
          "Hemoglobin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases (adenine-thymine and cytosine-guanine) maintain the double-helix structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a hydrogen bond between two water molecules, the attraction is between:",
        "options": [
          "The $\\delta+$ Hydrogen of one molecule and a lone pair on the Oxygen of another.",
          "The two Oxygen nuclei of adjacent molecules.",
          "Two Hydrogen atoms from different molecules.",
          "A Hydrogen nucleus and an Oxygen nucleus within the same bond."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'bond' is an intermolecular attraction between the positive pole of one molecule and the negative lone pair of another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a requirement for a hydrogen bond to form?",
        "options": [
          "The molecule must contain a metal atom.",
          "Hydrogen must be covalently bonded to $F, O,$ or $N$.",
          "A neighboring molecule must have a lone pair on an $F, O,$ or $N$ atom.",
          "The molecule must be polar."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen bonding is an intermolecular force between nonmetal molecular compounds, not metals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Ethanol ($C_{2}H_{5}OH$) has a much higher boiling point than dimethyl ether ($CH_{3}OCH_{3}$) even though they have the same formula ($C_{2}H_{6}O$). Why?",
        "options": [
          "Ethanol can form hydrogen bonds, while dimethyl ether cannot.",
          "Ethanol is an ionic compound.",
          "Dimethyl ether has more electrons.",
          "Ethanol is a nonpolar molecule."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethanol has an $-OH$ group capable of hydrogen bonding, whereas in the ether, the oxygens are not bonded to hydrogens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water's high surface tension, which allows some insects to 'walk' on it, is caused by:",

          "The strong cohesive forces of hydrogen bonding.",
          "The high density of water molecules.",
