        "question": "Why is volume not always strictly additive when mixing two different liquids (v/v)?",
        "options": [
          "Different molecules pack together differently, potentially changing the total volume.",
          "The solute always turns into a solid.",
          "Volume is lost to the atmosphere through immediate evaporation.",
          "Mixing liquids creates new atoms that increase the volume."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intermolecular forces and molecular sizes mean the final volume may be slightly different than the sum of the parts."
