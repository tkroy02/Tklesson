        "question": "Dipole-dipole forces are best described as the attraction between:",
        "options": [
          "The permanent partial positive end of one polar molecule and the permanent partial negative end of another.",

          "The nuclei of two adjacent metal atoms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These forces arise from the constant electrostatic attraction between the established poles of polar molecules."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only molecules with a net dipole moment (polar molecules) have the permanent partial charges necessary for these interactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do dipole-dipole forces generally compare in strength to London dispersion forces for molecules of similar size?",
        "options": [
          "Dipole-dipole forces are generally stronger.",
          "London dispersion forces are always much stronger.",
          "They are exactly equal in strength.",
          "Dipole-dipole forces only exist in the gas phase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Permanent dipoles provide a more consistent and stronger attraction than the flickering, temporary dipoles of dispersion forces."

          "$O_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen Chloride is polar because of the electronegativity difference between $H$ and $Cl$. The others are nonpolar."

        "question": "For polar molecules, as the polarity (dipole moment) of the molecule increases, the boiling point typically:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Decreases to room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stronger intermolecular attractions require more thermal energy to overcome, resulting in a higher boiling point."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a liquid consisting of polar molecules, the molecules orient themselves so that:",
        "options": [
          "Oppositely charged ends are near each other.",
          "Like-charged ends are forced together.",
          "The molecules are perfectly perpendicular at all times.",
          "The positive ends all point toward the center of the container."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrostatic attraction naturally pulls the $\\delta+$ end of one molecule toward the $\\delta-$ end of another."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecules has polar bonds but NO dipole-dipole forces because it is nonpolar overall?",

          "$PCl_{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon tetrachloride is tetrahedral and symmetrical; the four polar $C-Cl$ bonds cancel each other out."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Dipole-dipole interactions are a type of:",

        "question": "A substance with strong dipole-dipole forces is most likely to dissolve in:",
        "options": [
          "A polar solvent like water",
          "A nonpolar solvent like hexane",
          "A liquid noble gas",
          "It will not dissolve in any liquid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the 'like dissolves like' rule, polar solutes interact well with polar solvents due to similar intermolecular forces."
