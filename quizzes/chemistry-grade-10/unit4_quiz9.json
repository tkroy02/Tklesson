    "subtitle": "4.9: Ionization Energy and Electron Affinity",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Energy trends in the periodic table",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the definition of 'First Ionization Energy'?",
        "options": [
          "The energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from a neutral atom.",
          "The energy released when an atom gains an electron.",
          "The energy required to add a proton to the nucleus.",
          "The total energy of all electrons in the ground state."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionization energy measures how strongly an atom holds onto its electrons; higher values mean the electron is harder to remove."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As you move from left to right across a period, ionization energy generally:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Drops to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the nuclear charge increases and the atomic radius decreases, the nucleus exerts a stronger pull on electrons, making them harder to remove."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does ionization energy decrease as you move down a group?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons are further from the nucleus and shielded by inner shells.",
          "The nucleus is getting smaller.",
          "There are fewer protons to pull on the electrons.",
          "The atoms are becoming more stable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As more energy levels are added, the valence electrons are further away and experience more 'shielding' from inner electrons, making them easier to remove."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of elements has the highest ionization energies?",
        "options": [
          "Noble Gases",
          "Alkali Metals",
          "Alkaline Earth Metals",
          "Transition Metals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Noble gases have a stable octet and a high effective nuclear charge for their period, making them very resistant to losing electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Electron Affinity'?",
        "options": [
          "The energy change that occurs when an electron is acquired by a neutral atom.",
          "The force of gravity between two atoms.",
          "The energy required to move an electron to a higher orbit.",
          "The speed at which an electron orbits the nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electron affinity measures how much an atom 'wants' an electron; most nonmetals release energy when they gain one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements would likely have the highest (most negative) electron affinity?",
        "options": [
          "Fluorine ($F$)",
          "Lithium ($Li$)",
          "Neon ($Ne$)",
          "Cesium ($Cs$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Halogens like Fluorine are one electron away from a full shell and have a strong nuclear pull, making electron gain highly favorable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Second and third ionization energies are always __________ than the first ionization energy.",
        "options": [
          "Higher",
          "Lower",
          "The same",
          "Negative"
"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once one electron is removed, the remaining electrons experience less repulsion and a stronger relative pull from the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A massive 'jump' in ionization energy occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "An electron is removed from a stable, inner-shell noble gas configuration.",
          "An atom becomes a gas.",
          "The atom gains a neutron.",
          "The atom is heated."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Removing a 'core' electron requires significantly more energy than removing a valence electron because core electrons are much closer to the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements has the lowest first ionization energy?",
        "options": [
          "Cesium ($Cs$)",
          "Helium ($He$)",
          "Fluorine ($F$)",
          "Carbon ($C$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cesium is a large atom with many shells, so its single valence electron is very far from the nucleus and easily lost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In general, nonmetals have __________ ionization energies and __________ electron affinities than metals.",
        "options": [
          "Higher; higher",
          "Lower; lower",
          "Higher; lower",
          "Lower; higher"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nonmetals hold their electrons tightly (high ionization energy) and actively attract new ones (high electron affinity)."
