    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is used to indicate the number of atoms of each element in a binary covalent compound?",
        "options": [
          "Greek prefixes",
          "Roman numerals",
          "Oxidation numbers",
          "Superscripts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Binary covalent compounds use prefixes like mono-, di-, and tri- to specify how many atoms of each nonmetal are present."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for the compound $CO_{2}$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The prefix 'mono-' is omitted for the first element. Since there are two oxygens, we use 'di-', resulting in Carbon dioxide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct prefix for a compound containing five atoms of an element?",

          "Penta-",
          "Tetra-",
          "Hexa-",
          "Hepta-"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "Nitrous oxide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two nitrogens (di-) and four oxygens (tetra-). When 'tetra-' precedes 'oxide', the 'a' is usually dropped for pronunciation: tetroxide."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the chemical formula for Diphosphorus pentoxide?",

          "$PO_{5}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Di-' indicates 2 phosphorus atoms and 'penta-' indicates 5 oxygen atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In covalent naming, the second element in the formula always ends with which suffix?",

          "-ide",
          "-ite",
          "-ate",
          "-ic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Similar to ionic naming, the second element's ending is changed to '-ide'."

          "Sulfur hexafluoride",
          "Monosulfur hexafluoride",
          "Sulfur fluorine",
          "Sulfur pentafluoride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sulfur is the first element (no prefix needed for one) and there are six (hexa-) fluorines."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the compound $NI_{3}$?",

          "$S_{4}N_{2}$",
          "$S_{2}N_{4}$",
          "$S_{4}N$",
          "$SN_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Tetra-' means 4 sulfur atoms and 'di-' means 2 nitrogen atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When is the prefix 'mono-' used for the first element in a covalent compound name?",
        "options": [
          "Never",
          "Always",
          "Only if the second element also has 'mono-'",
          "Only if the element is Oxygen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By convention, the prefix 'mono-' is never used on the first element of a compound name."
