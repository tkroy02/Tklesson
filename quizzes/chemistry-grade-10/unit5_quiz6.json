    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Characteristics of ionic substances",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do ionic compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points?",
        "options": [
          "The electrostatic attraction between ions is extremely strong and requires significant energy to break.",
          "The ions are held together by weak intermolecular forces.",
          "They contain a sea of mobile electrons that absorb heat.",
          "The molecules are very large and heavy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the lattice is held together by strong ionic bonds in three dimensions, a large amount of thermal energy is needed to overcome these attractions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which state can ionic compounds conduct electricity?",
        "options": [
          "When melted (molten) or dissolved in water (aqueous)",
          "In the solid crystalline state only",
          "Only when they are frozen at extremely low temperatures",
          "They can never conduct electricity under any circumstances"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the solid state, ions are locked in fixed positions. When melted or dissolved, the ions are free to move and carry an electric current."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when an ionic crystal is struck with a hammer (a mechanical force)?",
        "options": [
          "It tends to shatter (brittleness).",
          "It flattens into a thin sheet (malleability).",
          "It stretches into a long wire (ductility).",
          "It bounces back like rubber (elasticity)."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mechanical force shifts layers of ions, causing like charges to align. The resulting repulsion causes the crystal to snap or shatter."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Ionic compounds that conduct electricity when dissolved in water are called:",
        "options": [
          "Electrolytes",
          "Insulators",
          "Metalloids",
          "Semiconductors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent like water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the solubility of most ionic compounds in water?",
        "options": [
          "Many are soluble because water is a polar molecule that can attract the ions.",
          "They are all completely insoluble in all liquids.",
          "They only dissolve in nonpolar solvents like oil or gasoline.",
          "They dissolve only if the water is boiling."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water's partial charges attract the cations and anions, pulling them out of the lattice and into the solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The hardness of an ionic crystal is a direct result of:",
        "options": [
          "The strength of the attractive forces holding the ions in place.",
          "The speed at which the electrons move through the lattice.",
          "The number of neutrons in the metal's nucleus.",
          "The air pressure surrounding the crystal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the ions are strongly bonded in a fixed geometric pattern, the surface of the crystal resists being scratched or displaced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a typical property of an ionic compound?",
        "options": [
          "Low vapor pressure and low volatility",
          "High melting point",
          "Brittleness",
          "Good electrical conductivity as a solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solid ionic compounds are actually insulators because their ions are not free to move; they only conduct when liquid or aqueous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an unknown substance has a melting point of $801\\text{°C}$ and is brittle, it is most likely:",
        "options": [
          "An ionic compound",
          "A molecular gas",
          "A soft metal like lead",
          "A nonpolar liquid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High melting points and brittleness are classic diagnostic physical properties of ionic substances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'aqueous' ($aq$) in a chemical equation indicates that the substance is:",
        "options": [
          "Dissolved in water",
          "In the liquid (molten) state",
          "A solid precipitate",
          "A gaseous byproduct"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aqueous refers to a solution where the solvent is water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The crystal structure of an ionic compound depends primarily on the:",
        "options": [
          "Sizes and ratios of the ions involved.",
          "Color of the metal used.",
          "Weight of the sample.",
          "Amount of light hitting the surface."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The geometric shape of the lattice is determined by how the different sized cations and anions can most efficiently pack together while balancing charges."
