    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Electronegativity'?",
        "options": [
          "The ability of an atom in a chemical compound to attract electrons from another atom.",
          "The total negative charge of an atom's nucleus.",
          "The energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom.",
          "The speed at which an atom reacts with oxygen."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom 'tugs' on shared electrons within a chemical bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element is the most electronegative on the Pauling scale?",
        "options": [
          "Fluorine ($F$)",
          "Francium ($Fr$)",
          "Oxygen ($O$)",
          "Cesium ($Cs$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluorine has the highest value (approx. 4.0) because of its small size and high effective nuclear charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Electronegativity generally __________ as you move from left to right across a period.",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the nuclear charge increases and the atomic radius decreases, the nucleus has a stronger pull on electrons in a bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does electronegativity decrease as you move down a group?",
        "options": [
          "Increased atomic radius and shielding reduce the nuclear pull on bonding electrons.",
          "The nucleus loses protons as you move down.",
          "The atoms are becoming noble gases.",
          "The number of valence electrons is increasing."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With more energy levels, the valence shell is further from the nucleus, and inner electrons shield the positive charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of elements generally has an electronegativity value of zero or undefined?",
        "options": [
          "Noble Gases",
          "Alkali Metals",
          "Halogens",
          "Transition Metals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because noble gases rarely form compounds, they do not have a standard electronegativity value for attracting bonding electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For METALS, reactivity __________ as you move down a group.",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Drops to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metals react by losing electrons. Since atoms get larger down a group, the valence electrons are easier to remove, making them more reactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For NONMETALS, reactivity __________ as you move down a group.",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Depends on the number of neutrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nonmetals react by gaining electrons. Since larger atoms have a weaker pull on incoming electrons, nonmetals become less reactive as you go down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the most reactive metal on the periodic table?",
        "options": [
          "Francium ($Fr$)",
          "Lithium ($Li$)",
          "Fluorine ($F$)",
          "Gold ($Au$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Francium is the largest atom with the lowest ionization energy, making it lose its electron most easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which trend direction generally leads to an increase in electronegativity?",
        "options": [
          "Up and to the right",
          "Down and to the left",
          "Straight down a group",
          "Straight across to the left"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Atoms become smaller and the nucleus becomes more 'exposed' to bonding electrons as you move up and right (excluding Noble Gases)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an element has low electronegativity and low ionization energy, it is most likely a:",
        "options": [
          "Metal",
          "Nonmetal",
          "Metalloid",
          "Noble Gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metals have loosely held electrons and a weak attraction for additional electrons."
