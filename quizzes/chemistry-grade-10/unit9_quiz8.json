    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Nomenclature for common acids and bases",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What prefix is used when naming a binary acid (an acid containing Hydrogen and one other element)?",
        "options": [
          "Hydro-",
          "Per-",
          "Hypo-",
          "Bi-"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Binary acids, like $HCl$, are named with the prefix 'hydro-' followed by the root of the second element and the suffix '-ic'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct name for $HCl_{(aq)}$?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrochloric acid",
          "Chloric acid",
          "Hydrogen chloride acid",
          "Chlorous acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since it is a binary acid, we use 'hydro-' + 'chlor' + '-ic' acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When naming an oxyacid, if the polyatomic ion ends in '-ate', the acid name will end in:",
        "options": [
          "-ic",
          "-ous",
          "-ide",
          "-ateic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A helpful mnemonic is 'I ate something icky'; polyatomic ions ending in '-ate' become '-ic' acids (e.g., Nitrate $\\rightarrow$ Nitric acid)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for $H_{2}SO_{3}$? ($SO_{3}^{2-}$ is the sulfite ion)",
        "options": [
          "Sulfurous acid",
          "Sulfuric acid",
          "Hydrosulfuric acid",
          "Hydrosulfurous acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polyatomic ions ending in '-ite' become '-ous' acids. Since $SO_{3}^{2-}$ is sulfite, the acid is sulfurous acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the acid $HNO_{3}$? ($NO_{3}^{-}$ is the nitrate ion)",
        "options": [
          "Nitric acid",
          "Nitrous acid",
          "Hydronitric acid",
          "Hyponitrous acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrate ends in '-ate', so the acid name ends in '-ic'. 'Hydro-' is NOT used because it is an oxyacid, not a binary acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are most Arrhenius bases named?",
        "options": [
          "Name of the metal followed by 'hydroxide'.",
          "Using the 'hydro-' prefix and '-ic' suffix.",
          "By adding '-ous' to the end of the metal name.",
          "Using Roman numerals for all metals."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bases like $NaOH$ or $Ca(OH)_{2}$ are named simply as ionic compounds containing the hydroxide ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct chemical formula for Phosphoric acid? (Phosphate is $PO_{4}^{3-}$)",
        "options": [
          "$H_{3}PO_{4}$",
          "$HPO_{4}$",
          "$H_{3}P$",
          "$H_{3}PO_{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phosphoric acid comes from the phosphate ion ($PO_{4}^{3-}$). Three $H^{+}$ ions are needed to balance the $3-$ charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the name for $KOH$?",
        "options": [
          "Potassium hydroxide",
          "Potassium hydric acid",
          "Hydrophosphoric base",
          "Potassium oxygen hydride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$KOH$ is a base named by the metal (Potassium) followed by the polyatomic ion (Hydroxide)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The name 'Hydrosulfuric acid' refers to which formula?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}S$",
          "$H_{2}SO_{4}$",
          "$H_{2}SO_{3}$",
          "$HS$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'hydro-' prefix indicates a binary acid (no oxygen). Therefore, it must be Hydrogen and Sulfur ($H_{2}S$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an oxyacid has the prefix 'hypo-' and suffix '-ous', what does it tell you about the oxygen content?",
        "options": [
          "It has the fewest oxygens in its series.",
          "It has the most oxygens in its series.",
          "It contains no oxygen.",
          "It contains exactly four oxygen atoms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'hypo-' prefix and '-ous' suffix correspond to the polyatomic ion with the lowest oxygen count (e.g., hypochlorite $\\rightarrow$ hypochlorous acid)."
