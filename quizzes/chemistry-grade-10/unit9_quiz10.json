        "question": "What is the primary purpose of a titration in the laboratory?",
        "options": [
          "To determine the unknown concentration of a solution.",
          "To measure the boiling point of a solvent.",

          "To calculate the molar mass of an unknown gas."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Titration is a quantitative analysis technique used to find the concentration of an unknown solution (analyte) using a solution of known concentration (titrant)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a titration, the solution with a known concentration that is added from a burette is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Titrant",
          "Analyte",
          "Indicator",
          "Distillate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The titrant (or standard solution) is the reagent of known concentration used to react with the substance being measured."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'equivalence point' in an acid-base titration is defined as the point where:",
        "options": [
          "The moles of $H^{+}$ from the acid equal the moles of $OH^{-}$ from the base.",
          "The solution reaches a pH of exactly 7.0.",
          "The burette is completely empty.",
          "The indicator first changes color."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equivalence point is the stoichiometric point where the amount of titrant added is enough to completely neutralize the analyte."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which piece of laboratory glassware is used to deliver precise, variable volumes of titrant?",
        "options": [
          "Burette",
          "Beaker",
          "Graduated cylinder",
          "Volumetric flask"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A burette allows for very precise, drop-by-drop addition of liquid, which is essential for identifying the exact end point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'end point' of a titration is the moment when:",
        "options": [
          "The indicator undergoes a visible color change.",
          "All the liquid has been used from the flask.",
          "The reaction stops producing heat.",
          "The solute begins to precipitate out of the solution."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The end point is the physical observation (usually a color change) that signals the titration is complete. It should be as close to the equivalence point as possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is an indicator added to the flask before beginning a titration?",
        "options": [
          "To signal the end of the reaction through a color change.",
          "To speed up the chemical reaction between the acid and base.",
          "To ensure the solution stays at a constant temperature.",
          "To prevent the glass from reacting with the chemicals."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Indicators are weak acids or bases that change color at specific pH levels, helping the chemist visualize the completion of the neutralization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a titration of a strong acid with a strong base using phenolphthalein, the end point is reached when the solution turns:",
        "options": [
          "Faint, persistent pink",
          "Bright blue",
          "Colorless",
          "Dark orange"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phenolphthalein is colorless in acid and turns pink in base. A faint, lasting pink indicates that the acid has been fully neutralized and a tiny excess of base is present."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When reading the volume on a burette, you should always read the value at the:",
        "options": [
          "Bottom of the meniscus",
          "Top of the meniscus",
          "Very top edge of the glassware",
          "Average of the top and bottom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard laboratory procedure is to read the volume at the lowest point of the curve (the meniscus) at eye level for accuracy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 20.0 mL of 0.10 M $NaOH$ is required to neutralize 10.0 mL of $HCl$, what is the molarity of the $HCl$?",
        "options": [
          "0.20 M",
          "0.10 M",
          "0.05 M",
          "0.40 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $M_{a}V_{a} = M_{b}V_{b}$ (for 1:1 ratios): $M_{a} \\times 10.0 = 0.10 \\times 20.0$. Thus, $M_{a} = 2.0 / 10.0 = 0.20$ M."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Standardizing a solution means:",
        "options": [
          "Determining its exact concentration using a primary standard.",
          "Mixing it with water until it reaches a pH of 7.",
          "Making sure it is stored in a standard plastic bottle.",
          "Heating it until it reaches a standard temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standardization is the process of confirming the precise molarity of a titrant before using it to analyze other unknowns."
