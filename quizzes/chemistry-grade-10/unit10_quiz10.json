      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Rate Law' is a mathematical equation that relates the reaction rate to the:",
        "options": [
          "Concentrations of the reactants.",
          "Total volume of the container.",
          "Enthalpy change of the products.",
          "Color of the final solution."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate laws show how the speed of a reaction depends on the molarity of the starting materials."
      },
      {

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rate constant 'k' is unique for every reaction and depends on the temperature and whether a catalyst is present."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is 'First Order' with respect to reactant [A], doubling the concentration of [A] will:",
        "options": [
          "Double the reaction rate.",
          "Quadruple the reaction rate.",
          "Have no effect on the reaction rate.",
          "Half the reaction rate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In first-order reactions, the rate is directly proportional to the concentration ($2^1 = 2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is 'Second Order' with respect to reactant [B], doubling the concentration of [B] will:",
        "options": [
          "Quadruple the reaction rate.",
          "Double the reaction rate.",
          "Triple the reaction rate.",
          "Increase the rate by eight times."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In second-order reactions, the rate changes by the square of the concentration change ($2^2 = 4$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is 'Zero Order' with respect to a reactant, changing its concentration will:",
        "options": [
          "Have no effect on the reaction rate.",
          "Slow down the reaction.",
          "Make the reaction instantaneous.",
          "Double the rate constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zero-order means the rate is independent of that reactant's concentration ($2^0 = 1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are the 'orders' (exponents) in a rate law determined?",
        "options": [
          "Through experimental data and observation.",
          "By looking at the coefficients in the balanced equation.",
          "By measuring the temperature of the reaction.",
          "By calculating the molar mass of the products."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You cannot determine a rate law just by looking at a balanced equation; it must be found by running experiments and measuring speeds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Overall Order' of a reaction is calculated by:",
        "options": [
          "Summing the exponents of all reactants in the rate law.",
          "Multiplying the rate constant by the temperature.",
          "Taking the average of all the reactant coefficients.",
          "Dividing the rate by the total volume."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a rate law is $k[A]^1[B]^2$, the overall order is $1 + 2 = 3$ (third order)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the rate constant ($k$) if the temperature of the reaction is increased?",
        "options": [
          "The value of $k$ increases.",
          "The value of $k$ decreases.",
          "The value of $k$ stays exactly the same.",
          "The value of $k$ becomes negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since temperature increases the reaction rate without changing concentrations, the rate constant $k$ must increase to balance the equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would NOT appear in a standard rate law?",

          "The concentration of the products.",
          "The concentration of the reactants.",
          "The rate constant.",
          "The order of the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate laws typically describe the initial rate and focus on the concentration of the reactants before products have significantly formed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the rate law for a reaction is $Rate = k[A][B]$, and both [A] and [B] are doubled, the rate will increase by a factor of:",

          "4",
          "2",
          "8",
          "1"
