        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because of their partially filled $d$ orbitals, transition metal ions can absorb specific wavelengths of light, resulting in colorful compounds like blue Copper(II) sulfate."

        "explanation": "The Actinides (atomic numbers 89-103) are all radioactive, and many are synthetic (man-made)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transition metals are often used in manufacturing because they are 'ductile.' What does this mean?",
        "options": [
          "They can be pulled into thin wires.",
          "They can be hammered into flat sheets.",
          "They resist the flow of electricity.",
          "They are very brittle and break easily."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ductility is the physical property of being able to be drawn into a wire, a hallmark of most metals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a 'Transition Metal' commonly used in electrical wiring due to its high conductivity?",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Unlike Groups 1 and 2, transition metals often show:",
        "options": [
          "Multiple possible oxidation states (charges).",
          "A fixed $+1$ charge only.",
          "No ability to form ions.",
          "Low melting and boiling points."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Transition metals can lose different numbers of electrons from both their $s$ and $d$ orbitals, allowing them to form ions like $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Lanthanides are historically called 'Rare Earth' elements, though many are actually quite abundant in the Earth's crust."
