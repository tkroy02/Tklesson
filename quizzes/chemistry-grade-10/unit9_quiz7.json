    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the pH scale specifically measure?",
        "options": [
          "The concentration of Hydrogen ions ($H^{+}$) in a solution.",
          "The total volume of the solvent.",
          "The mass of the solute dissolved in water.",
          "The number of neutrons in the central atom."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "pH stands for 'potential of Hydrogen' and is a logarithmic measure of the $H^{+}$ (or $H_{3}O^{+}$) concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solution with a pH of 7.0 is considered:",
        "options": [
          "Neutral",
          "Acidic",
          "Basic",
          "Supersaturated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At pH 7, the concentration of $H^{+}$ ions is exactly equal to the concentration of $OH^{-}$ ions, which is characteristic of pure water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a solution's pH changes from 4 to 3, how much more acidic has it become?",
        "options": [
          "10 times more acidic",
          "1 time more acidic",
          "2 times more acidic",
          "100 times more acidic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pH scale is logarithmic. Each decrease of 1 pH unit represents a 10-fold increase in Hydrogen ion concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pH value represents the strongest base?",
        "options": [
          "14",
          "1",
          "7",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On the 0-14 scale, values higher than 7 are basic, and 14 represents the highest concentration of hydroxide ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following pH values would most likely belong to lemon juice?",
        "options": [
          "2.0",
          "7.0",
          "9.5",
          "13.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lemon juice is highly acidic due to citric acid, putting it on the low end of the pH scale."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between pH and pOH in any aqueous solution at 25°C?",
        "options": [
          "pH + pOH = 14",
          "pH - pOH = 7",
          "pH x pOH = 14",
          "pH / pOH = 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sum of pH and pOH is always 14. If you know one, you can easily calculate the other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solution has a Hydrogen ion concentration of $1 \\times 10^{-5}$ M. What is its pH?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "10",
          "1",
          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "pH is the negative log of the concentration. For $10^{-5}$, the pH is simply the positive exponent, 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which solution would turn red litmus paper blue?",
        "options": [
          "A solution with a pH of 11",
          "A solution with a pH of 2",
          "A solution with a pH of 5",
          "Pure distilled water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bases turn red litmus paper blue, and a pH of 11 indicates a basic solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a solution with a pH of 9, which ion is more prevalent?",
        "options": [
          "Hydroxide ions ($OH^{-}$)",
          "Hydrogen ions ($H^{+}$)",
          "They are equal",
          "Neither is present"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At pH values above 7, the solution is basic, meaning $OH^{-}$ concentration is higher than $H^{+}$ concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the pH of an acidic solution if you add a large amount of water to dilute it?",
        "options": [
          "The pH increases toward 7.",
          "The pH decreases toward 0.",
          "The pH stays exactly the same.",
          "The pH immediately jumps to 14."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diluting an acid decreases the $H^{+}$ concentration, making the solution less acidic and moving its pH closer to the neutral value of 7."
