        "question": "If a piece of hot metal is placed in a calorimeter filled with cool water, which statement is true regarding the heat flow?",
        "options": [
          "The heat lost by the metal is equal to the heat gained by the water.",
          "The water will lose heat to the metal.",

          "The total energy of the system will increase significantly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, $q_{lost} = -q_{gained}$. The energy simply transfers from the hot object to the cooler one."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is polystyrene (Styrofoam) often used to make 'coffee-cup' calorimeters?",
        "options": [
          "It is a good insulator that minimizes heat exchange with the outside air.",
          "It reacts with the chemicals to produce more heat.",
          "It has a very high specific heat capacity itself.",
          "It allows heat to escape quickly so the cup doesn't melt."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Effective calorimetry requires preventing heat from leaking into or out of the environment, making insulation critical."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A high specific heat means a substance is resistant to temperature changes; it can absorb a lot of heat with only a small increase in temperature."
