    "topic": "Predicting molecular shapes",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The VSEPR theory stands for 'Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion.' What is its main premise?",
        "options": [
          "Electron pairs move as far apart from each other as possible to minimize repulsion.",
          "Electrons are attracted to each other and cluster together near the nucleus.",
          "Protons in the nucleus repel electrons to the edges of the atom.",
          "Molecular shape is determined only by the number of protons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because electrons are negatively charged, bonding pairs and lone pairs push away from each other, dictating the 3D geometry of the molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A molecule with a central atom bonded to two other atoms and having NO lone pairs (like $BeCl_{2}$) has what shape?",
        "options": [
          "Linear",
          "Bent",
          "Trigonal Planar",
          "Tetrahedral"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With only two electron domains, the furthest apart they can get is $180\\text{°}$, creating a straight line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the bond angle in a perfectly tetrahedral molecule like Methane ($CH_{4}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$109.5\\text{°}$",
          "$90\\text{°}$",
          "$120\\text{°}$",
          "$180\\text{°}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a 3D space, four electron pairs spread out into a tetrahedral shape with angles of $109.5\\text{°}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following shapes describes a molecule with three bonding pairs and one lone pair on the central atom (like $NH_{3}$)?",
        "options": [
          "Trigonal pyramidal",
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Bent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The four electron domains create a tetrahedral electron geometry, but the lone pair 'pushes' the three bonds down into a pyramid shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the bond angle in Water ($H_{2}O$) smaller than the bond angle in Methane ($CH_{4}$)?",
        "options": [
          "Lone pairs take up more space and repel bonding pairs more strongly than bonding pairs repel each other.",
          "Oxygen is smaller than Carbon, so the atoms are naturally closer.",
          "Hydrogen atoms in water are attracted to each other.",
          "Water is a liquid, which compresses the bond angles."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lone pairs are held closer to the nucleus and occupy more volume, 'squeezing' the bonding pairs together and reducing the angle to approx $104.5\\text{°}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A central atom surrounded by three bonding pairs and zero lone pairs (like $BF_{3}$) results in which geometry?",
        "options": [
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Trigonal pyramidal",
          "Linear",
          "Tetrahedral"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Three domains spread out into a flat triangle with $120\\text{°}$ bond angles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the molecular geometry of Carbon Dioxide ($CO_{2}$)?",
        "options": [
          "Linear",
          "Bent",
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Tetrahedral"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even though there are double bonds, VSEPR treats multiple bonds as a single 'electron domain.' Two domains with no lone pairs result in a linear shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a molecule has 4 bonding pairs and 0 lone pairs on the central atom, its shape is:",
        "options": [
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Square planar",
          "Trigonal pyramidal",
          "Bent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Four bonding domains result in a tetrahedral molecular geometry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Bent' molecular shape can be formed by a central atom with two bonding pairs and how many lone pairs?",
        "options": [
          "1 or 2",
          "0 only",
          "3 only",
          "None; bent shapes only happen in ionic bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecules like $SO_{2}$ (1 lone pair) or $H_{2}O$ (2 lone pairs) both exhibit bent molecular geometry because of lone pair repulsion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "VSEPR theory helps chemists predict the __________ of a molecule.",
        "options": [
          "Three-dimensional shape",
          "Color",
          "Atomic mass",
          "Number of isotopes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "VSEPR is specifically used to translate 2D Lewis structures into 3D molecular models."
