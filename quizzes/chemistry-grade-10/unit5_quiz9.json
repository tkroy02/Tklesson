      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Sea of Electrons' model?",
        "options": [
          "Valence electrons are delocalized and move freely among metal cations.",
          "Electrons are shared equally between two specific metal nuclei.",
          "Electrons are transferred from metal atoms to oxygen atoms in the air.",
          "Core electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed, circular paths."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In metallic bonding, valence electrons are not bound to any one atom and can flow throughout the entire metal structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'delocalized electrons' refers to electrons that:",
        "options": [
          "Are free to move from one atom to the next.",
          "Are locked in a covalent bond between two atoms.",
          "Have been lost completely to the surroundings.",
          "Are found only within the nucleus of the atom."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because metal atoms have few valence electrons and low ionization energies, their outer electrons can easily 'drift' through the lattice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What holds the atoms together in a metallic bond?",
        "options": [
          "The attraction between metal cations and the surrounding sea of electrons.",
          "The attraction between two adjacent nuclei.",
          "The repulsion between delocalized electrons.",
          "The magnetic force generated by the spinning Earth."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electrostatic attraction between the stationary positive metal ions and the mobile negative electrons acts as the 'glue'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Metallic bonding occurs between:",
        "options": [
          "Two or more metal atoms.",
          "A metal and a nonmetal.",
          "Two or more nonmetal atoms.",
          "A noble gas and a halogen."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metallic bonding is unique to metals (and their alloys) where atoms can readily pool their valence electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following properties is a direct result of mobile delocalized electrons?",
        "options": [
          "High electrical and thermal conductivity",
          "High brittleness and shattering",
          "Low melting and boiling points",
          "Transparency to visible light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because electrons are free to move, they can easily carry an electric charge or kinetic (thermal) energy through the material."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the valence electrons in a metal differ from those in an ionic compound?",
        "options": [
          "They are free to move, whereas in ionic compounds they are fixed in place.",
          "They are much heavier than electrons in ionic compounds.",
          "They are always positively charged.",
          "They orbit the nucleus much faster than in ionic compounds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an ionic solid, electrons are localized on the anions, preventing conductivity. In metals, they are delocalized and mobile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about the metal lattice is true?",
        "options": [
          "It consists of positive metal ions in fixed positions.",
          "It consists of neutral atoms that do not interact.",
          "It is identical to an ionic crystal lattice in every way.",
          "It is held together by the sharing of specific pairs of electrons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The metal cations stay in a relatively fixed geometric arrangement while the 'sea' of electrons flows around them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are metals often described as 'lustrous' (shiny)?",
        "options": [
          "Delocalized electrons absorb and re-emit light across a wide range of frequencies.",
          "Metal atoms are naturally painted with a thin layer of oil.",
          "The nucleus of a metal atom is larger than that of a nonmetal.",
          "Light cannot pass through the empty spaces between metal atoms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mobile electrons on the surface of a metal interact with light, reflecting it and giving the metal its characteristic shine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As the number of delocalized electrons increases, the strength of the metallic bond typically:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More delocalized electrons result in a stronger electrostatic attraction between the 'sea' and the cations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Metallic bonding explains why metals, unlike ionic compounds, are NOT:",
        "options": [
          "Brittle",
          "Conductive",
          "Solid at room temperature",
          "Dense"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the 'sea' of electrons allows atoms to slide past each other without breaking the bond, metals are malleable rather than brittle."
