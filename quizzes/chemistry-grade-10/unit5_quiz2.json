    "topic": "Achieving stable electron arrangements",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Octet Rule' states that main-group atoms tend to react so that they each have how many electrons in their valence shell?",
        "options": [
          "8",
          "2",
          "18",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A set of eight valence electrons ($s^2 p^6$) represents a stable, low-energy configuration similar to that of a noble gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of elements naturally satisfies the octet rule without forming chemical bonds?",
        "options": [
          "Noble Gases",
          "Alkali Metals",

          "Chalcogens"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Noble gases (except Helium) have eight valence electrons, making them exceptionally stable and unreactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an atom of Sodium ($Na$) obeys the octet rule, it will most likely:",
        "options": [
          "Lose 1 electron to achieve the configuration of Neon.",
          "Gain 7 electrons to fill its third shell.",
          "Share 2 electrons with another metal atom.",
          "Gain 1 proton to become Magnesium."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sodium has 1 valence electron ($3s^1$). Losing it allows the stable $n=2$ shell to become the new valence shell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common exception to the octet rule, achieving stability with only 2 electrons?",

          "Oxygen",
          "Fluorine",
          "Neon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helium ($He$) only has the $1s$ orbital, which is filled and stable with just 2 electrons (the Duet Rule)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An atom of Chlorine ($Cl$) has 7 valence electrons. To satisfy the octet rule, it will:",
        "options": [
          "Gain 1 electron to form a $1-$ ion.",
          "Lose 7 electrons to form a $7+$ ion.",
          "Lose 1 electron to form a $1+$ ion.",
          "Gain 8 electrons to fill the $d$ sublevel."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorine ($3s^2 3p^5$) needs one more electron to reach the stable configuration of Argon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The stability of an octet is due to which sublevels being completely filled?",
        "options": [
          "$s$ and $p$ sublevels",
          "$s$ and $d$ sublevels",
          "$p$ and $d$ sublevels",
          "$s$, $p$, and $f$ sublevels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An octet consists of 2 electrons in the $s$ orbital and 6 electrons in the $p$ orbitals of the highest energy level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Elements in Group 16 (like Oxygen) generally follow the octet rule by:",
        "options": [
          "Gaining 2 electrons to form $2-$ ions.",
          "Losing 6 electrons to form $6+$ ions.",
          "Gaining 6 electrons to fill the shell.",
          "Losing 2 electrons to become stable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Group 16 elements have 6 valence electrons; gaining 2 is the most energy-efficient path to an octet."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements is known for forming 'expanded octets,' holding more than 8 electrons?",
        "options": [
          "Phosphorus ($P$)",
          "Carbon ($C$)",
          "Nitrogen ($N$)",
          "Oxygen ($O$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elements in Period 3 and below have access to $d$ orbitals, allowing them to sometimes hold more than 8 electrons in covalent compounds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The tendency of atoms to reach a noble gas configuration is driven by the desire to reach:",
        "options": [
          "The lowest possible potential energy.",
          "The highest possible mass.",
          "The greatest number of protons.",
          "The largest possible atomic radius."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A full valence shell is a state of high mathematical and physical stability, minimizing the energy of the system."

        "question": "How many electrons does Calcium ($Ca$) need to lose to satisfy the octet rule?",

          "1",
          "6",
          "8"
