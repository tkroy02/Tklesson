    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Fundamentals of chemical bonding",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason that atoms form chemical bonds with one another?",
        "options": [
          "To achieve a lower, more stable potential energy state.",
          "To increase their total number of protons.",
          "To become more reactive and unstable.",
          "To gain enough mass to become a different element."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nature favors states of lower potential energy. Most atoms are at a lower energy state when they are bonded to other atoms rather than existing as independent particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which electrons are primarily involved in the formation of chemical bonds?",
        "options": [
          "Valence electrons",
          "Core electrons",
          "Nuclear electrons",
          "Inner-shell electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Valence electrons are the electrons in the highest occupied principal energy level and are the ones that interact when atoms meet."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ionic bond is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "The electrical attraction between cations and anions.",
          "The equal sharing of electron pairs between atoms.",
          "A sea of mobile electrons surrounding metal nuclei.",
          "The overlapping of $p$ orbitals to form a pi bond."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionic bonding results from the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another, creating oppositely charged ions that attract."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A covalent bond is formed when two atoms:",
        "options": [
          "Share one or more pairs of electrons.",
          "Transfer electrons from a metal to a nonmetal.",
          "Are both positively charged and repel each other.",
          "Lose all their valence electrons to the surroundings."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In covalent bonding, neither atom is strong enough to take electrons away, so they share them to achieve stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which tool is used to represent the valence electrons of an atom as dots around the element's symbol?",
        "options": [
          "Lewis electron-dot structures",
          "Bohr model diagrams",
          "Schrödinger wave equations",
          "Hund's rule charts."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lewis structures provide a shorthand way to track valence electrons and predict how an atom will bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The strength of an ionic bond is largely determined by the __________ between the ions.",
        "options": [
          "Electrostatic force",
          "Magnetic pull",
          "Gravitational attraction",
          "Nuclear strong force"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The attraction between the positive charge of a cation and the negative charge of an anion is called electrostatic force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many valence electrons does an atom of Sulfur ($S$) have?",
        "options": [
          "6",
          "2",
          "16",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sulfur is in Group 16, meaning it has 6 electrons in its outermost shell ($3s^2 3p^4$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a metallic bond, valence electrons are best described as:",
        "options": [
          "Delocalized and free to move throughout the structure.",
          "Locked into fixed positions between two nuclei.",
          "Transferred permanently to a nonmetal atom.",
          "Orbiting only their parent nucleus in circular paths."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metallic bonding involves a 'sea of electrons' where valence electrons are not bound to any single atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Atoms with high electronegativity, such as Fluorine, are more likely to:",
        "options": [
          "Attract and gain electrons during bonding.",
          "Give away their electrons to become cations.",
          "Remain chemically inert and never form bonds.",
          "Lose protons from their nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High electronegativity means the atom has a strong 'tug' on electrons, which usually leads to gaining or sharing them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is generally true about chemical bond formation?",
        "options": [
          "Energy is released when a bond forms.",
          "Energy must be added to form a bond.",
          "The total mass of the atoms increases.",
          "The atoms become more reactive after bonding."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond formation is an exothermic process because the atoms move to a lower, more stable energy state."
