      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the role of a catalyst in a chemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to occur",
          "It increases the total amount of product that can be formed",
          "It is completely consumed during the reaction and must be replaced",
          "It shifts the chemical equilibrium to favor the formation of more product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy, speeding up the reaction without being consumed."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the balanced equation $2\\text{SO}_2 + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{SO}_3$, the molar ratio of $\\text{SO}_2$ to $\\text{SO}_3$ is $1:1$, so $2.0$ moles produce $2.0$ moles."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "pH is calculated as the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration: $\\text{pH} = -\\log[H^+]$; the negative log of $10^{-7}$ is exactly $7$ (neutral)."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the greenhouse effect, what property allows $\\text{CO}_2$ to trap heat in the atmosphere?",
        "options": [
          "It absorbs infrared radiation and re-emits it back toward the Earth",
          "It reflects all incoming solar ultraviolet light back into deep space",
          "It chemically reacts with nitrogen to release thermal energy to air",
          "It increases the density of the air preventing warm air from rising"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Greenhouse gases are transparent to visible light but absorb longer-wavelength infrared radiation (heat) leaving the Earth."

          "Using chlorine to kill microorganisms and prevent waterborne diseases",
          "Removing dissolved calcium and magnesium ions to soften the supply",
          "Filtering the water through layers of activated carbon for odors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Coagulation involves adding chemicals like alum to neutralize charges, allowing tiny suspended particles to aggregate into larger masses."

          "$150$ g/mol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The molar mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses: $40 + 12 + (3 \\times 16) = 100$ grams per mole."
