        "options": [
          "It lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to occur",
          "It increases the total amount of product that can be formed",
          "It is completely consumed during the reaction and must be replaced",

          "It reflects all incoming solar ultraviolet light back into deep space",
          "It chemically reacts with nitrogen to release thermal energy to air",
          "It increases the density of the air preventing warm air from rising"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Greenhouse gases are transparent to visible light but absorb longer-wavelength infrared radiation (heat) leaving the Earth."

          "Filtering the water through layers of activated carbon for odors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Coagulation involves adding chemicals like alum to neutralize charges, allowing tiny suspended particles to aggregate into larger masses."

          "150 g/mol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The molar mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses: 40 + 12 + (3 * 16) = 100 grams per mole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary characteristic of a saturated solution?",
        "options": [
