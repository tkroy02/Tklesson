    "subtitle": "3.1: History of the Atom: Dalton, Thomson, Rutherford",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Evolution of atomic theory",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "John Dalton's atomic theory was based on the idea that atoms are:",
        "options": [
          "Tiny, indivisible, solid spheres.",
          "Composed of smaller subatomic particles.",
          "Mostly empty space with a central nucleus.",
          "Made of cloud-like regions of probability."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dalton viewed the atom as the smallest unit of matter—a solid, indivisible 'billiard ball' that could not be broken down further."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "J.J. Thomson discovered the electron using which experimental tool?",
        "options": [
          "Cathode Ray Tube",
          "Gold Foil Experiment",
          "Scanning Tunneling Microscope",
          "Oil Drop Experiment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thomson observed that rays in the tube were deflected by magnetic and electric fields, proving atoms contained negatively charged particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Rutherford’s Gold Foil experiment led to the discovery of the:",
        "options": [
          "Nucleus",
          "Electron",
          "Neutron",
          "Isotope"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because a few alpha particles bounced back, Rutherford concluded that atoms must have a small, dense, positively charged center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scientist proposed the 'Plum Pudding' model of the atom?",
        "options": [
          "J.J. Thomson",
          "John Dalton",
          "Ernest Rutherford",
          "James Chadwick"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thomson suggested the atom was a sphere of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it, like raisins in pudding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What surprising observation did Rutherford make during the Gold Foil experiment?",
        "options": [
          "Most alpha particles passed straight through the foil.",
          "All alpha particles were absorbed by the foil.",
          "The gold foil turned into lead.",
          "The electrons stopped moving."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This observation proved that the atom is mostly empty space, rather than a solid mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Dalton’s theory, all atoms of a specific element are:",
        "options": [
          "Identical in mass and properties.",
          "Able to change into other elements.",
          "Largely composed of neutrons.",
          "Differentiated by their number of electrons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dalton believed all atoms of the same element were exactly alike, though we now know isotopes mean they can have different masses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Thomson’s discovery of the electron proved that the atom was actually:",
        "options": [
          "Divisible",
          "Indivisible",
          "An empty vacuum",
          "Made only of positive charge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By finding the electron, Thomson proved that the atom was made of even smaller pieces, contradicting Dalton's 'indivisible' claim."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Rutherford concluded that the nucleus must have a positive charge because it:",
        "options": [
          "Repelled the positively charged alpha particles.",
          "Attracted the negatively charged alpha particles.",
          "Emitted blue light during the experiment.",
          "Dissolved the gold atoms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since 'like charges repel,' the deflection of positive alpha particles indicated a positive charge in the center of the atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Democritus was an ancient Greek philosopher who first used the term 'atomos,' which means:",
        "options": [
          "Uncuttable or indivisible",
          "Smallest particle",
          "Circular motion",
          "Building block"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Democritus hypothesized that matter could only be divided so many times until you reached a piece that was 'uncuttable' (atomos)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of Dalton's original postulates is now known to be incorrect due to the discovery of isotopes?",
        "options": [
          "Atoms of the same element are identical in mass.",
          "Atoms combine in whole-number ratios.",
          "Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms.",
          "All matter is composed of atoms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We now know that isotopes of the same element have different numbers of neutrons, and therefore, different masses."
