    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Sharing electrons in covalent bonds",
    "duration": 15,

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A covalent bond is primarily characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "The sharing of electron pairs between two atoms.",
          "The complete transfer of electrons from a metal to a nonmetal.",
          "The electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.",
          "A sea of mobile, delocalized electrons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Covalent bonding occurs when atoms have similar electronegativities and share electrons to achieve a stable octet."

          "Two or more metal atoms.",
          "A noble gas and an alkali metal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nonmetals have high ionization energies and prefer to share electrons rather than lose them entirely."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A neutral group of atoms held together by covalent bonds is known as a:",

          "Molecule",
          "Formula unit",
          "Crystal lattice",
          "Cation cluster"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike ionic compounds which form lattices, covalent compounds form distinct, individual particles called molecules."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The distance between two bonded atoms at their minimum potential energy is called the:",

          "Bond length",
          "Atomic radius",
          "Bond energy",
          "Ionic distance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond length is the stable distance where the attractive and repulsive forces between the atoms are balanced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy required to break a chemical bond and form neutral isolated atoms is the:",

          "Bond energy",
          "Activation energy",
          "Lattice energy",
          "Ionization energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond energy is a measure of bond strength; higher bond energy means the bond is harder to break."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a 'diatomic molecule' in its natural state?",
        "options": [
          "Nitrogen ($N_{2}$)",
          "Helium ($He$)",
          "Carbon ($C$)",
          "Sulfur ($S$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elements like $H_{2}, N_{2}, O_{2}, F_{2}, Cl_{2}, Br_{2},$ and $I_{2}$ exist as pairs of atoms bonded covalently."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the potential energy of two atoms as they move close enough to form a covalent bond?",
        "options": [
          "The potential energy decreases until a stable bond is formed.",
          "The potential energy increases indefinitely.",
          "The potential energy remains constant.",
          "The potential energy drops to absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Atoms bond because the resulting molecule is at a lower, more stable energy state than the individual atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a covalent bond, the shared electrons are attracted to:",
        "options": [
          "The nuclei of both atoms simultaneously.",
          "Only the more electronegative nucleus.",
          "Only the less electronegative nucleus.",
          "A point exactly halfway between the atoms regardless of the element."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The bond is held together by the simultaneous attraction of both positive nuclei for the same pair of negative electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A chemical formula that shows the types and numbers of atoms combined in a single molecule is a:",

          "Molecular formula",
          "Empirical formula",
          "Structural formula",
          "Ionic formula"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For example, $H_{2}O$ is the molecular formula for water, showing exactly two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following generally has the lowest bond energy?",
        "options": [
          "A long, weak bond",
          "A short, strong bond",
          "A triple bond",
          "A double bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond length and bond energy are inversely related; longer bonds are generally weaker and require less energy to break."
