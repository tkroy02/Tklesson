        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes an exothermic reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Energy is released from the system into the surroundings.",
          "Energy is absorbed by the system from the surroundings.",

          "The products have more potential energy than the reactants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an exothermic reaction, 'exo' (exit) means energy leaves the system, typically causing the surroundings to get hotter."

          "Electrically charged"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the system pulls heat energy from its environment, the temperature of the surroundings drops."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these everyday processes is an example of an exothermic change?",

          "Subscript",
          "Catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since energy is being 'consumed' or taken in, it is represented on the left (reactant) side of the equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the products of a reaction have **less** potential energy than the reactants, the reaction was:",

          "Nuclear",
          "Adiabatic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'lost' potential energy was released into the surroundings as heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Photosynthesis, where plants absorb sunlight to create glucose, is a(n) ______ process.",
        "options": [
          "Endothermic",
          "Exothermic",
          "Spontaneous",
          "Combustion"
"        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy (light) must be constantly supplied to the plant for the reaction to occur."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Breaking chemical bonds ______ energy, while forming chemical bonds ______ energy.",
        "options": [
          "Requires; releases",
          "Releases; requires",
          "Destroys; creates",
          "Doubles; halves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It always takes energy to pull atoms apart (bond breaking), and energy is always given off when atoms come together (bond forming)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an endothermic phase change?",
        "options": [
          "Evaporation",
          "Freezing",
          "Condensation",
          "Deposition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To turn a liquid into a gas, the particles must absorb energy to overcome their attractive forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an exothermic reaction, the sign of the enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$) is always:",
        "options": [
          "Negative (-)",
          "Positive (+)",
          "Zero (0)",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative $\\Delta H$ indicates that the heat content of the system has decreased because energy was given away."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A chemical 'cold pack' used for sports injuries is an application of an:",
