        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Magnetism is a physical property that allows certain metals, like iron, nickel, and cobalt, to be pulled from a mixture containing non-magnetic substances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the process of 'decanting'?",
        "options": [
          "Carefully pouring off the top liquid layer without disturbing the sediment.",
          "Using a centrifuge to spin particles to the bottom.",

          "Boiling a liquid and catching the steam."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decanting is a quick way to separate a liquid from an insoluble solid or two immiscible liquids by pouring the top layer off."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these mixtures could be easily separated using a magnet?",
        "options": [
          "Iron filings and sulfur powder",
          "Salt and sugar",
          "Aluminum cans and plastic bottles",
          "Gold dust and sand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iron is ferromagnetic and will be attracted to the magnet, while sulfur is non-magnetic and will remain behind."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Decanting is most effective for mixtures that have:",
        "options": [
          "Components with significantly different densities that don't mix.",
          "Identical boiling points.",
          "Small particles that are completely dissolved.",
          "Multiple gases mixed together."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decanting works best when there is a clear boundary between a heavy solid (sediment) and a liquid, or between two immiscible liquids like oil and water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which tool is often used to assist in a clean decantation to prevent the liquid from splashing?",
        "options": [
          "Glass stirring rod",
          "Bunsen burner",
          "Filter paper",
          "Condenser"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pouring the liquid down a glass rod helps direct the flow and prevents the sediment at the bottom from being stirred up."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is magnetism used in many large-scale recycling centers?",
        "options": [
          "To separate steel and iron from non-magnetic materials like plastic and glass.",
          "To change the chemical properties of the trash.",
          "To melt the metal into new shapes.",
          "To weigh the amount of trash collected."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Magnetic separators are efficient at pulling ferrous metals out of large streams of mixed waste."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you have a mixture of oil and water, what is the fastest way to remove the top layer of oil?",
        "options": [
          "Decanting",
          "Filtration",
          "Evaporation",
          "Magnetism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since oil and water are immiscible and have different densities, the oil floats and can be decanted (poured off) or removed with a separatory funnel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a major limitation of decanting compared to filtration?",
        "options": [
          "It is generally less precise and may leave some liquid behind.",
          "It requires very expensive machinery.",
          "It can only be done in a vacuum.",
          "It only works for homogeneous mixtures."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decanting is faster but less thorough than filtration; it is difficult to pour off all the liquid without losing some or getting some solid in the final container."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mixture of sand and water has settled in a beaker. The water on top is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Supernatant",
          "Precipitate",
          "Distillate",
          "Residue"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In decanting, the clear liquid above the solid residue is technically referred to as the supernatant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are trying to separate copper bits from iron bits, which method is best?",
        "options": [
          "Magnetism",
          "Decanting",
          "Evaporation",
          "Distillation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iron is magnetic while copper is not, making magnetism the most efficient physical separation method for this solid-solid mixture."
