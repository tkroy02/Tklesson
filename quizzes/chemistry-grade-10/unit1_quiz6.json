          "The bubble"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The meniscus is the curve seen at the top of a liquid in response to its container."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When measuring the volume of water in a graduated cylinder, where should you take the reading?",
        "options": [
          "At the top of the curve.",
          "At the bottom of the meniscus.",
          "In the exact middle of the curve.",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To get an accurate reading, you must read the volume at the lowest point of the downward-curving meniscus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To avoid 'parallax error' when reading a measurement, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Look at the cylinder from above.",
          "Look at the cylinder from below.",
          "Read the measurement at eye level.",
          "Tilt the cylinder toward you."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Parallax error occurs when a measurement is viewed from an angle. Being at eye level ensures accuracy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the standard SI unit for liquid volume in a chemistry lab?",
        "options": [
          "Grams (g)",
          "Milliliters (mL)",

          "Pounds (lb)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Milliliters (mL) and Liters (L) are the primary units used for volume in chemical measurements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are beakers and Erlenmeyer flasks NOT recommended for precise volume measurements?",
        "options": [
          "They are too heavy.",
          "They have wide openings that allow evaporation.",
          "Their markings are only approximate with high margin of error.",
          "They can only hold hot liquids."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The markings on beakers and flasks are usually accurate only within 5-10%, whereas graduated cylinders are much more precise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You need to measure exactly 25.0 mL of a solution. Which tool is the best choice?",
        "options": [
          "50 mL Beaker",
          "100 mL Erlenmeyer Flask",
          "25 mL Graduated Cylinder",
          "Large Test Tube"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A graduated cylinder is specifically designed for accurate volume delivery and measurement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'displacement method' used to measure?",
        "options": [
          "The volume of an irregular solid.",
          "The mass of a liquid.",
          "The temperature of a gas.",
          "The boiling point of water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By dropping a solid into a known volume of liquid, the change in volume represents the volume of the solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a graduated cylinder has markings every 1 mL, to what decimal place should you estimate your reading?",
        "options": [
          "The nearest 10 mL",
          "The nearest 1 mL",
          "The nearest 0.1 mL",
          "The nearest 0.01 mL"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In science, you always record all certain digits plus one estimated digit (one-tenth of the smallest scale division)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "1.0 liter is equivalent to how many milliliters?",
        "options": [
          "10 mL",
          "100 mL",
          "1,000 mL",
          "10,000 mL"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The prefix 'milli-' means one-thousandth, so there are 1,000 milliliters in one liter."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: When measuring volume, the container should be placed on a flat, level surface.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Holding the cylinder in your hand can cause it to tilt, leading to an incorrect reading of the meniscus."
