    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the Law of Conservation of Mass?",
        "options": [
          "Matter is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction.",
          "The total volume of reactants must equal the total volume of products.",
          "The number of molecules always stays the same in a reaction.",
          "Mass is lost when a solid turns into a gas during a reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This fundamental law states that the total mass of the products must equal the total mass of the reactants because atoms are simply rearranged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $12$ grams of Carbon reacts completely with $32$ grams of Oxygen, what is the total mass of the Carbon Dioxide produced?",
        "options": [
          "44 grams",
          "20 grams",
          "32 grams",
          "12 grams"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass of Reactants ($12 + 32 = 44$) must equal the Mass of Products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When $100$ grams of $HgO$ is heated, it decomposes into $92.6$ grams of liquid Mercury and a specific amount of Oxygen gas. What is the mass of the Oxygen gas?",
        "options": [
          "7.4 grams",
          "100 grams",
          "92.6 grams",
          "192.6 grams"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the equation: Total Mass ($100$) - Mass of Mercury ($92.6$) = Mass of Oxygen ($7.4$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a closed system, if a reaction produces a gas, what happens to the total mass of the system?",
        "options": [
          "The total mass remains exactly the same.",
          "The total mass decreases as the gas is formed.",
          "The total mass increases.",
          "The total mass becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a closed system, no matter can escape, so the mass remains constant regardless of phase changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might a reaction in an 'open beaker' appear to lose mass?",
        "options": [
          "A gaseous product escaped into the surrounding air.",
          "The atoms were destroyed by the heat.",
          "The reactants were heavier than the products.",
          "Mass is not conserved when liquids are involved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a gas is produced in an open container, it leaves the scale, making it look like mass disappeared even though it still exists in the air."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $50$ grams of reactant A is mixed with $50$ grams of reactant B, but only $40$ grams of B actually reacts, what is the total mass of the final mixture (products plus leftover B)?",
        "options": [
          "100 grams",
          "90 grams",
          "50 grams",
          "40 grams"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total mass into the beaker was $100$ grams ($50 + 50$). Unless something escaped, the total mass inside remains $100$ grams."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Law of Conservation of Mass was famously proven by which chemist using sealed glass vessels?",
        "options": [
          "Antoine Lavoisier",
          "John Dalton",
          "Ernest Rutherford",
          "Dmitri Mendeleev"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lavoisier's precise measurements of combustion in sealed containers established this law in the late 1700s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a reaction, if the number of atoms of each element stays the same, it follows that:",
        "options": [
          "The mass is conserved.",
          "The reaction is endothermic.",
          "The pressure must increase.",
          "New elements were created."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since each atom has a specific mass, keeping the atom count identical ensures the total mass is identical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $2H_{2} + O_{2} \\rightarrow 2H_{2}O$, the mass of the $H_{2}$ and $O_{2}$ used is $36$ grams. What is the mass of the water produced?",
        "options": [
          "36 grams",
          "18 grams",
          "72 grams",
          "4 grams"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The law states mass is conserved; if $36$ grams of reactants are consumed, $36$ grams of products must form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would NOT violate the Law of Conservation of Mass?",
        "options": [
          "A candle losing mass as it burns in an open room.",
          "Creating new Gold atoms from Lead atoms in a test tube.",
          "A reaction where $5$ grams of sugar produces $10$ grams of alcohol.",
          "A reaction where atoms are created to balance an equation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The candle burning in an open room doesn't violate the law; the 'lost' mass is simply $CO_{2}$ and water vapor that drifted away."
