    "title": "Chemistry Grade 10: Unit 11 Quiz 3",
    "subtitle": "11.3: Air Pollution and Smog Formation",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Chemicals that affect air quality",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary chemical component of photochemical smog at ground level?",
        "options": [
          "Ozone formed by reactions of NOx and VOCs",
          "Argon released from deep underground vents",
          "Helium produced by nuclear decay processes",
          "Silica stirred up by high speed wind gusts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ground-level ozone is a secondary pollutant created when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react in sunlight."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which set of conditions is most likely to lead to a temperature inversion?",
        "options": [
          "A layer of warm air trapping cooler air near the surface",
          "A steady flow of dry air moving across a tropical region",
          "A rapid rise in humidity during a midsummer thunderstorm",
          "A sudden drop in pressure before a massive winter freeze"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inversions occur when warm air acts as a lid, preventing pollutants from dispersing and causing smog to build up."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does ultraviolet (UV) radiation play in smog formation?",
        "options": [
          "It provides the energy needed for complex chemical reactions",
          "It cools the upper atmosphere to allow for cloud formation",
          "It neutralizes the toxicity of carbon monoxide gas molecules",
          "It increases the magnetic pull of heavy metallic particulates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photochemical smog requires sunlight (UV radiation) to initiate the reactions between primary pollutants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is considered a 'primary' air pollutant?",
        "options": [
          "Nitrogen dioxide emitted directly from vehicle exhausts",
          "Sulfuric acid formed when sulfur trioxide meets moisture",
          "Peroxyacetyl nitrate created during secondary reactions",
          "Hydrogen peroxide produced within localized mist clouds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Primary pollutants are those emitted directly from a source, like combustion engines or industrial smokestacks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is 'industrial' smog different from 'photochemical' smog?",
        "options": [
          "It is mainly composed of sulfur dioxide and soot particles",
          "It requires intense solar radiation to reach peak density",
          "It consists entirely of noble gases and nitrogen isotopes",
          "It originates from natural volcanic activity in the basin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Industrial smog (grey smog) comes from burning coal/oil, while photochemical smog (brown smog) is driven by sunlight and traffic."
