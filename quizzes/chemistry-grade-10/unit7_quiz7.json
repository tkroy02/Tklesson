        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a single replacement reaction, a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound, following the form $A + BC \\rightarrow AC + B$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A metal can only replace another metal that is lower than itself on the Activity Series (less reactive)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the potential reaction $Cu(s) + Mg(NO_{3})_{2}(aq) \\rightarrow$ , what will occur?",
        "options": [
          "No reaction will occur.",
          "Copper will replace Magnesium.",
          "Magnesium will turn into a gas.",
          "Copper will dissolve and form a precipitate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the activity series, Copper is less reactive than Magnesium and therefore cannot displace it from a compound."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a halogen like Chlorine ($Cl_{2}$) reacts with a compound like Potassium Bromide ($KBr$), what is produced?",

          "$KCl$ and $Br_{2}$",
          "$KBrCl$",
          "$K$ and $ClBr$",
          "No reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorine is more reactive than Bromine (higher in Group 17), so it replaces the Bromine: $Cl_{2} + 2KBr \\rightarrow 2KCl + Br_{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Active metals (like Sodium) react with water in a single replacement reaction to produce:",

          "Pure salt and water",
          "An explosion only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reaction $2Na + 2H_{2}O \\rightarrow 2NaOH + H_{2}$ shows the metal displacing one hydrogen atom from the water molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which general pattern identifies a single replacement reaction?",

          "$A + BC \\rightarrow AC + B$",
          "$A + B \\rightarrow AB$",
          "$AB \\rightarrow A + B$",
          "$AB + CD \\rightarrow AD + CB$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This pattern shows a lone element 'kicking out' an element from a compound to take its place."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Magnesium is added to Hydrochloric acid ($HCl$), which gas is produced?",

          "Hydrogen ($H_{2}$)",
          "Oxygen ($O_{2}$)",

      {

          "Fluorine ($F_{2}$)",
          "Chlorine ($Cl_{2}$)",
          "Bromine ($Br_{2}$)",
          "Iodine ($I_{2}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reactivity for halogens decreases as you go down the group; Fluorine is at the top and is the most reactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a single replacement reaction where a nonmetal is the lone reactant (A), what does it replace in compound BC?",
        "options": [
          "The nonmetal (anion) part of the compound",
          "The metal (cation) part of the compound",
          "Both parts simultaneously",
          "It does not replace anything"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nonmetals replace nonmetals (like-replaces-like). Therefore, a lone nonmetal will swap places with the anion in the compound."
