    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'reaction mechanism' in chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "The series of elementary steps by which a total reaction occurs.",
          "The mechanical stirring of a solution to increase rate.",
          "The mathematical equation used to calculate molarity.",
          "The physical container where the reaction takes place."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most reactions don't happen in one big collision; they occur through a sequence of smaller, simpler reactions called elementary steps."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The slowest step in a multi-step reaction mechanism is known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Rate-determining step",
          "Activation step",
          "Intermediate step",
          "Equilibrium step"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like a bottleneck on a highway, the slowest step limits how fast the overall reaction can produce products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance that is produced in one step of a mechanism and consumed in a later step is called a(n):",
        "options": [
          "Intermediate",
          "Catalyst",
          "Reactant",
          "Product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intermediates are temporary species; they do not appear in the final balanced equation because they are created and then used up."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a catalyst differ from a reaction intermediate?",
        "options": [
          "A catalyst is present at the start and regenerated at the end; an intermediate is created then destroyed.",
          "A catalyst is a solid while an intermediate is always a gas.",
          "An intermediate speeds up a reaction, whereas a catalyst slows it down.",
          "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts are 'put in' and 'come out' unchanged. Intermediates 'show up' in the middle and 'disappear' before the end."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a reaction mechanism, the sum of all elementary steps must:",
        "options": [
          "Equal the overall balanced chemical equation.",
          "Result in a net energy gain of zero.",
          "Have the same activation energy for every step.",
          "Contain at least one gaseous reactant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When you add the steps and cancel out intermediates/catalysts, you must arrive back at the stoichiometry of the overall reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Homogeneous Catalyst' is one that is:",
        "options": [
          "In the same phase as the reactants.",
          "In a different phase than the reactants.",
          "Made entirely of the same type of atom.",
          "Used only in nuclear reactions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the reactants and the catalyst are all dissolved in the same liquid solution, the catalyst is homogeneous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes 'Adsorption' in heterogeneous catalysis?",
        "options": [
          "Reactant molecules sticking to the surface of a solid catalyst.",
          "The catalyst being absorbed into the center of a liquid reactant.",
          "The release of energy as light during a reaction.",
          "The breaking of the catalyst into smaller pieces."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solid catalysts often work by providing a surface where reactants can land, weaken their bonds, and find each other more easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a catalyst is added to a reaction, which of the following is true about the reaction mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "The catalyst provides a completely different pathway with lower energy steps.",
          "The catalyst forces the original mechanism to move at a higher temperature.",
          "The catalyst removes the rate-determining step entirely.",
          "The catalyst increases the number of reactants required for the first step."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A catalyst doesn't just 'help' the old way; it offers a new, easier chemical 'shortcut'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Molecularity' of an elementary step refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The number of reactant particles colliding in that specific step.",
          "The total molar mass of the products.",
          "The number of moles of catalyst used.",
          "The pH of the reaction mixture."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steps are usually unimolecular (one molecule splits) or bimolecular (two collide). Termolecular (three) is very rare."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the rate-determining step if you increase the concentration of a reactant involved in that step?",
        "options": [
          "The overall reaction rate will increase.",
          "The overall reaction rate will stay the same.",
          "The overall reaction rate will decrease.",
          "The catalyst will be destroyed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the overall speed is limited by the slowest step, making the slow step faster will speed up the entire process."
