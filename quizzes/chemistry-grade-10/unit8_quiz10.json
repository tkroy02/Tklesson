      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in solving any mass-to-mass stoichiometry problem?",
        "options": [
          "Convert the given mass of the starting substance to moles.",
          "Multiply the given mass by the mole ratio.",
          "Convert the given mass directly to the mass of the product.",
          "Divide the molar mass of the reactant by the molar mass of the product."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chemical equations 'speak' in moles, not grams. You must convert to moles before you can use the mole ratio from the balanced equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the correct sequence of steps for a mass-to-mass conversion?",
        "options": [
          "Mass A $\\rightarrow$ Moles A $\\rightarrow$ Moles B $\\rightarrow$ Mass B",
          "Mass A $\\rightarrow$ Mass B $\\rightarrow$ Moles B",
          "Mass A $\\rightarrow$ Moles B $\\rightarrow$ Mass B",
          "Moles A $\\rightarrow$ Mass A $\\rightarrow$ Mass B $\\rightarrow$ Moles B"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the 'stoichiometry roadmap': use molar mass to get to moles, the mole ratio to switch substances, and molar mass again to get back to grams."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $2H_{2} + O_{2} \\rightarrow 2H_{2}O$, if you start with 4.0 grams of $H_{2}$, what is the second step in finding the mass of $H_{2}O$ produced?",
        "options": [
          "Use the mole ratio (2 mol $H_{2}O$ / 2 mol $H_{2}$) to find moles of water.",
          "Multiply 4.0 grams by the molar mass of water.",
          "Divide 4.0 grams by 22.4 liters.",
          "Convert 4.0 grams of $H_{2}$ to atoms using Avogadro's number."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After converting the 4.0g of $H_{2}$ to moles, the next logical step is to use the coefficients from the balanced equation to find moles of the product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it impossible to convert grams of one reactant directly to grams of another product in a single step?",
        "options": [
          "Because different substances have different molar masses.",
          "Because the law of conservation of mass is only a suggestion.",
          "Because grams are a measure of volume, not amount.",
          "Because chemical equations only show mass ratios, not mole ratios."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since one mole of $H_{2}$ weighs differently than one mole of $O_{2}$, we must use moles as the 'common language' to relate them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $Mg + 2HCl \\rightarrow MgCl_{2} + H_{2}$, how many grams of $H_{2}$ are produced from 24.3 g of $Mg$? ($Mg=24.3$ g/mol, $H_{2}=2.0$ g/mol)",
        "options": [
          "2.0 g",
          "24.3 g",
          "1.0 g",
          "4.0 g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "24.3g $Mg$ is 1 mole. The ratio of $Mg$ to $H_{2}$ is 1:1, so 1 mole of $H_{2}$ is produced. 1 mole of $H_{2}$ weighs 2.0 grams."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a mass-to-mass problem, which part of the calculation involves the coefficients from the balanced equation?",
        "options": [
          "The mole-to-mole ratio step.",
          "The first mass-to-mole conversion.",
          "The final mole-to-mass conversion.",
          "The calculation of molar masses."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficients are strictly used in the middle step to bridge the gap between two different substances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 100g of a reactant produces 50g of a product, does this violate the Law of Conservation of Mass?",
        "options": [
          "No, because other products (like gases) might have been released.",
          "Yes, the mass of the product must always equal the mass of the starting reactant.",
          "No, because mass is lost as energy in every reaction.",
          "Yes, unless the reaction was performed in a vacuum."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total mass of *all* reactants must equal the total mass of *all* products. One single product does not have to equal the mass of the starting material."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given $N_{2} + 3H_{2} \\rightarrow 2NH_{3}$, how many moles of $N_{2}$ are needed to produce 34 grams of $NH_{3}$? ($NH_{3} = 17$ g/mol)",
        "options": [
          "1.0 mole",
          "2.0 moles",
          "0.5 moles",
          "17 moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "34g $NH_{3}$ is 2 moles. The ratio of $N_{2}$ to $NH_{3}$ is 1:2. Therefore, 1 mole of $N_{2}$ is required."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When setting up a stoichiometry string, if you want to find the mass of the product, where does the molar mass of that product go?",
        "options": [
          "In the numerator of the final conversion factor.",
          "In the denominator of the first conversion factor.",
          "In the denominator of the mole ratio.",
          "It is not used in mass-to-mass calculations."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To end with grams, the unit 'grams' must be on top in the final step: $\\text{moles} \\times (\\text{grams} / 1 \\text{ mole}) = \\text{grams}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many grams of Oxygen ($O_{2}$) are needed to react completely with 12 grams of Carbon to form $CO_{2}$? ($C=12, O=16$)",
