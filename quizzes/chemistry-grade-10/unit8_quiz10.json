    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'limiting reactant' in a chemical reaction is the substance that:",
        "options": [
          "Is completely consumed and determines the maximum amount of product formed.",
          "Is left over after the reaction has come to a stop.",
          "Has the smallest coefficient in the balanced chemical equation.",
          "Has the smallest molar mass of all the reactants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once the limiting reactant is gone, the reaction cannot continue, regardless of how much of the other reactants remain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'theoretical yield' is defined as the:",
        "options": [
          "Maximum amount of product that can be produced based on stoichiometry.",
          "Amount of product actually measured in the laboratory.",
          "Ratio of the actual yield to the percent yield.",
          "Amount of reactant that did not participate in the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Theoretical yield is the 'perfect world' result calculated on paper using the limiting reactant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for calculating percent yield?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{\\text{Actual Yield}}{\\text{Theoretical Yield}} \\times 100\\%$",
          "$\\frac{\\text{Theoretical Yield}}{\\text{Actual Yield}} \\times 100\\%$",
          "$\\frac{\\text{Mass of Limiting Reactant}}{\\text{Mass of Excess Reactant}} \\times 100\\%$",
          "$\\frac{\\text{Actual Yield}}{\\text{Molar Mass}} \\times 100\\%$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Percent yield measures efficiency by comparing what you actually got to what you should have gotten."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common reason why the 'actual yield' is often less than the 'theoretical yield'?",
        "options": [
          "Impure reactants, side reactions, or loss of product during filtration.",
          "The law of conservation of mass was violated during the experiment.",
          "The atoms were destroyed by the heat of the reaction.",
          "The excess reactant was too heavy for the scale to measure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the real world, errors and incomplete reactions prevent us from reaching the $100\\%$ theoretical limit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you calculate that 10.0 g of product should form, but you only collect 8.0 g in the lab, what is your percent yield?",
        "options": [
          "80%",
          "125%",
          "20%",
          "10%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(8.0 / 10.0) \\times 100 = 80\\%$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a reaction where 2 moles of $H_{2}$ react with 2 moles of $O_{2}$ to form $H_{2}O$, which is the limiting reactant? ($2H_{2} + O_{2} \\rightarrow 2H_{2}O$)",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen ($H_{2}$)",
          "Oxygen ($O_{2}$)",
          "Water ($H_{2}O$)",
          "Neither, they are in perfect stoichiometric ratio."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation requires 2 moles of $H_{2}$ for every 1 mole of $O_{2}$. Since we have 2 of each, all the $H_{2}$ will be used up while 1 mole of $O_{2}$ remains."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The reactant that remains after the limiting reactant is used up is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Excess reactant",
          "Theoretical reactant",
          "Percent reactant",
          "Catalytic reactant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The excess reactant is the 'extra' stuff that didn't have a partner to react with."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is it possible for the percent yield to be greater than 100%?",
        "options": [
          "Technically no; it usually indicates the product is impure or still wet.",
          "Yes, if the catalyst works better than expected.",
          "Yes, if the reaction is exothermic.",
          "No, because the theoretical yield is always an underestimate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass cannot be created. If the yield is over $100\\%$, there is likely leftover solvent (water) or impurities in the sample."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you identify the limiting reactant when given the masses of two reactants?",
        "options": [
          "Calculate the amount of product each reactant could make; the one that makes less is limiting.",
          "The reactant with the lower starting mass in grams is always limiting.",
          "The reactant with the higher molar mass is always limiting.",
          "Divide the mass of the first reactant by the mass of the second."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The limiting reactant is the one that runs out first, which is determined by comparing how much product each could theoretically produce."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $A + B \\rightarrow C$, if $A$ is limiting, what happens if you add more of reactant $B$?",
        "options": [
          "The amount of product $C$ remains the same.",
          "The amount of product $C$ increases.",
          "The amount of product $C$ decreases.",
          "Reactant $A$ becomes the excess reactant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding more of the excess reactant doesn't help if you've already run out of the limiting one."
