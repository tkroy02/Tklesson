        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In any chemical change, the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Burning (combustion) transforms wood and oxygen into ash, smoke, and carbon dioxide, which are entirely new substances."

          "A state of matter"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Flammability describes how a substance reacts with oxygen to burn, making it a chemical property."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the chemical reaction where hydrogen and oxygen form water, what is the 'water' called?",

          "The reactant",
          "The catalyst",
          "The product",
          "The solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The substances formed during a chemical reaction are known as the products."

          "Oxidation",
          "Sublimation",
          "Distillation",
          "Neutralization"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation is a chemical process where a substance (like iron) reacts with oxygen to form a new compound."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a physical change, NOT a chemical change?",

          "Baking a cake",
          "A silver spoon tarnishing",
          "Dissolving sugar in water",
          "An apple turning brown"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Dissolving sugar is physical because the sugar molecules remain sugar; you can recover them by evaporating the water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 10 grams of reactant A reacts with 5 grams of reactant B to form one product, what will the mass of the product be?",
