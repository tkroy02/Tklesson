    "topic": "Safe heating procedures in the lab",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When lighting a Bunsen burner, what is the correct order of operations?",
        "options": [
          "Turn on gas, then strike the match.",
          "Strike the match/striker first, then slowly turn on the gas.",
          "Open the air vents fully, then turn on the gas.",
          "Blow into the tube to clear it, then light it."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To prevent a large buildup of gas that could cause a small explosion or 'poof,' always have your spark or flame ready before opening the gas valve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which part of a Bunsen burner flame is the hottest?",
        "options": [
          "The very top of the outer yellow flame.",
          "The base of the burner.",
          "The tip of the inner blue cone.",
          "The middle of the orange section."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The inner blue cone is the site of complete combustion and is the hottest part of the flame."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the flame on your Bunsen burner is yellow and 'lazy,' what adjustment should you make?",
        "options": [
          "Turn up the gas pressure.",
          "Open the air vents (collar) to allow more oxygen.",
          "Close the air vents completely.",
          "Turn off the gas and start over."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A yellow flame indicates incomplete combustion due to a lack of oxygen. Opening the collar mixes more air with the gas for a hotter, blue flame."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is a hot plate often preferred over a Bunsen burner when heating flammable liquids like ethanol?",
        "options": [
          "Hot plates heat up faster.",
          "Hot plates don't use electricity.",
          "Hot plates provide heat without an open flame, reducing fire risk.",
          "Hot plates are easier to clean."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Flammable vapors can catch fire easily from an open flame; a hot plate (especially one without exposed coils) is much safer for heating volatile substances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of adding 'boiling chips' or 'boiling stones' to a liquid before heating?",
        "options": [
          "To speed up the boiling process.",
          "To prevent 'bumping' and ensure smooth, even boiling.",
          "To change the color of the liquid when it's done.",
          "To keep the liquid from evaporating."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Boiling chips provide nucleation sites that allow bubbles to form calmly, preventing the liquid from suddenly splashing out of the container (bumping)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When using a hot plate with a magnetic stirrer, what is the small white rod placed inside the beaker called?",
        "options": [
          "Stirring stick",
          "Magnetic flea or stir bar",
          "Conductivity rod",
          "Heating element"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A magnetic stir bar is rotated by a spinning magnet inside the hot plate to mix the solution automatically as it heats."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can you tell if a glass beaker is hot just by looking at it?",
        "options": [
          "It will turn a slight red color.",
          "It will steam constantly.",
          "You cannot tell; hot glass looks exactly like cold glass.",
          "It will vibrate slightly."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is a major lab hazard. Always use tongs or heat-resistant gloves if you suspect a piece of glassware has been recently heated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following should NEVER be heated in a closed container (like a flask with a stopper)?",
        "options": [
          "Water",
          "Saltwater",
          "Any substance",
          "Only flammable chemicals"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Heating a sealed container causes gas pressure to build up rapidly, which can lead to the container exploding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'safety flame' on a Bunsen burner?",
        "options": [
          "A roaring blue flame.",
          "A flame that has been turned off.",
          "A cool, bright yellow flame with the air vents closed.",
          "A flame that is only 1 cm high."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The yellow flame is called the safety flame because it is visible and cooler than the blue flame, making it safer when the burner is not actively being used."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: You should always reach over a Bunsen burner to adjust the gas tap.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "False. Never reach over a flame; your sleeve or hair could catch fire. Always approach the controls from the side."
