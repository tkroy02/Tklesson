    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the small number placed in front of a chemical formula to balance an equation called?",

          "Coefficient",
          "Subscript",
          "Superscript",
          "Exponent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Coefficients are the multipliers used to ensure the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the equation."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Changing subscripts changes the identity of the substance. For example, changing $H_{2}O$ to $H_{2}O_{2}$ turns water into hydrogen peroxide."

          "Coulomb's Law"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A balanced equation ensures that atoms are not created or destroyed, meaning the mass remains constant."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The balanced equation is $CH_{4} + 2O_{2} \\rightarrow CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O$, which provides 4 oxygen atoms on each side."

          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The balanced equation is $4Al + 3O_{2} \\rightarrow 2Al_{2}O_{3}$. This results in 4 Aluminum and 6 Oxygen atoms on both sides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the simplest whole-number ratio of coefficients for: $\\_\\_N_{2} + \\_\\_H_{2} \\rightarrow \\_\\_NH_{3}$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "One Nitrogen molecule and three Hydrogen molecules yield two Ammonia molecules ($1 \\times 2 = 2$ Nitrogens; $3 \\times 2 = 6$ Hydrogens)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When balancing an equation containing polyatomic ions that appear on both sides, it is often easiest to:",
        "options": [
          "Balance the polyatomic ion as a single unit.",
          "Break the ions down into individual atoms immediately.",
          "Ignore the ions until the very end.",
          "Change the subscripts of the ions to match."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Treating ions like $SO_{4}^{2-}$ as a single group simplifies the counting process significantly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Balance the following: $\\_\\_Fe + \\_\\_Cl_{2} \\rightarrow \\_\\_FeCl_{3}$. What is the coefficient for $Cl_{2}$?",

          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The balanced equation is $2Fe + 3Cl_{2} \\rightarrow 2FeCl_{3}$. This balances the Chlorines at 6 on each side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a coefficient in a balanced equation is '1', how is it usually written?",
        "options": [
          "It is omitted (left blank).",
          "As a Roman numeral I.",
          "As the word 'mono'.",
          "It must always be explicitly written as '1'."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In chemistry, a coefficient of 1 is understood and typically not written, much like the number 1 in algebra ($1x = x$)."
