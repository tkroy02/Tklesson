          "Hydrogen bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionic bonds form through the electrostatic attraction between ions created when one atom gives up electrons to another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a Lewis dot structure primarily represent about an atom of a representative element?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lewis structures use dots to show only the valence electrons, which are the electrons involved in chemical bonding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a full outer shell of eight?",
        "options": [
          "The octet rule",
          "The Aufbau rule",
          "The Dalton rule",
          "The Hunds rule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The octet rule describes the tendency of atoms to prefer having eight electrons in their valence shell for stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a polar covalent bond, how are the electrons distributed between the two bonded atoms?",
        "options": [
          "They are shared unequally due to differences in electronegativity",
          "They are shared perfectly equally between the two identical nuclei",
          "They are transferred entirely from the cation to the large anion",
          "They are delocalized and move freely throughout the metal lattice"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polar covalent bonds occur when one atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the other atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of elements on the periodic table is characterized by having a naturally full valence shell?",

          "The chalcogens"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Noble gases (Group 18) have full valence shells, making them chemically stable and generally unreactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the charge of an ion that has 12 protons and 10 electrons?",
