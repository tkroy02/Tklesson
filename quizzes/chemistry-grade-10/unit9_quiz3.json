    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solution that contains the maximum amount of dissolved solute for a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature is:",
        "options": [
          "Saturated",
          "Unsaturated",
          "Supersaturated",
          "Diluted"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A saturated solution is at equilibrium; any additional solute added will not dissolve and will instead settle at the bottom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add more solute to a solution and it dissolves completely, the original solution was:",
        "options": [
          "Unsaturated",
          "Saturated",
          "Supersaturated",
          "Concentrated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An unsaturated solution contains less than the maximum amount of solute, so it still has the capacity to dissolve more."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of solution is unstable and will crystallize if a single 'seed crystal' is added?",
        "options": [
          "Supersaturated",
          "Saturated",
          "Unsaturated",
          "Homogeneous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Supersaturated solutions hold more solute than they theoretically should; this state is fragile, and the excess solute will precipitate out if disturbed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is a supersaturated solution typically created?",
        "options": [
          "Heating a saturated solution, adding more solute, and then cooling it slowly.",
          "Stirring an unsaturated solution very quickly for a long time.",
          "Adding a large amount of solute to cold water.",
          "Increasing the pressure on a solid solute."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since solubility usually increases with heat, you can dissolve more solute at high temperatures. If cooled carefully, the solute may stay dissolved despite the drop in solubility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a solubility curve graph, a point that lies exactly **on the line** represents a solution that is:",
        "options": [
          "Saturated",
          "Unsaturated",
          "Supersaturated",
          "Boiling"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The line itself represents the maximum solubility (saturation point) for that specific substance at various temperatures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a solubility curve graph, a point that lies **below the line** for a specific temperature is:",
        "options": [
          "Unsaturated",
          "Saturated",
          "Supersaturated",
          "Insoluble"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any point below the curve indicates that the solvent is holding less solute than its maximum capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you see a pile of undissolved sugar at the bottom of a cup of tea that has been stirred thoroughly, the solution is:",
        "options": [
          "Saturated",
          "Unsaturated",
          "Supersaturated",
          "Pure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The presence of visible, undissolved solute in equilibrium with the liquid is a clear physical indicator of a saturated solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the excess solute in a supersaturated solution when it is disturbed?",
        "options": [
          "It precipitates out until the solution becomes saturated.",
          "It disappears and turns into energy.",
          "The entire solution turns into a gas.",
          "It becomes even more dissolved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The excess solute crystallizes rapidly, leaving behind a stable, saturated solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common real-world example of a supersaturated solution being used?",
        "options": [
          "Sodium acetate 'hot packs' that crystallize to release heat.",
          "Salt water in the ocean.",
          "Oxygen dissolved in a lake.",
          "Vinegar used in cooking."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The crystallization of a supersaturated sodium acetate solution is an exothermic process often used in reusable hand warmers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the solubility of $KNO_{3}$ is $138$ g per $100$ g of water at $70$°C, and you have $100$ g in $100$ g of water, the solution is:",
        "options": [
          "Unsaturated",
          "Saturated",
          "Supersaturated",
          "Concentrated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $100$ g is less than the limit of $138$ g, the solution is unsaturated."
