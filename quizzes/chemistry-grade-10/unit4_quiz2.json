          "Abundance in nature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The modern periodic table is organized by the number of protons (atomic number), which ensures that elements with similar properties fall into the same columns."
      },

          "Blocks"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical columns are known as groups or families; elements within a group typically share similar chemical properties and the same number of valence electrons."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The horizontal rows of the periodic table are called:",
        "options": [
          "Periods",
          "Groups",
          "Families",
          "Valence shells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are 7 periods in the modern periodic table, each representing a new principal energy level being filled with electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Elements in the same group have the same number of __________ , which explains their similar chemical behavior.",

          "Valence electrons",
          "Total electrons",
          "Neutrons",
          "Principal energy levels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because they have the same number of electrons in their outermost shell, elements in a group react in very similar ways."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What do all elements in Period 3 have in common?",
        "options": [
          "Their valence electrons are in the third principal energy level.",
          "They all have three valence electrons.",
          "They all have the same atomic mass.",
          "They are all gases at room temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period number indicates the highest occupied principal energy level ($n$) for the atoms of those elements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which block of the periodic table contains the transition metals?",
        "options": [
          "d-block",
          "s-block",
          "p-block",
          "f-block"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The transition metals correspond to the filling of the $d$ sublevel orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The elements in Groups 1, 2, and 13 through 18 are collectively known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Representative elements",
          "Transition elements",
          "Inner transition elements",
          "Noble elements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are also called Main Group elements because they display a wide range of physical and chemical properties that vary predictably."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many groups and periods are there in the standard modern periodic table?",
        "options": [
          "18 groups and 7 periods",
          "7 groups and 18 periods",
          "8 groups and 5 periods",
          "10 groups and 10 periods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The table consists of 18 vertical columns (Groups) and 7 horizontal rows (Periods)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To which block do the Lanthanides and Actinides belong?",
        "options": [
          "f-block",
          "s-block",
          "p-block",
          "d-block"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These elements, often shown at the bottom of the table, represent the filling of the $f$ sublevel orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An element is located in Group 18 of the periodic table. This indicates that it:",
        "options": [
          "Has a full outer energy level.",
          "Is highly reactive with water.",
          "Is a metal that conducts electricity well.",
          "Has 18 protons in its nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Group 18 elements are the Noble Gases, characterized by a full valence shell, which makes them very stable and unreactive."
