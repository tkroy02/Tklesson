        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between a strong acid and a weak acid in aqueous solution?",
        "options": [
          "Strong acids ionize completely while weak acids only ionize partially",
          "Strong acids are much more concentrated than any known weak acids",
          "Strong acids always contain more hydrogen atoms in their molecules",
          "Strong acids cannot be neutralized by the addition of a weak base"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strength refers to the degree of ionization; strong acids dissociate $100\\%$ into ions, whereas weak acids exist in equilibrium."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Similar to pH, pOH is the negative log of the hydroxide concentration: $\\text{pOH} = -\\log[\\text{OH}^-]$. The negative log of $10^{-4}$ is $4$."
