          "Element"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where one substance is completely dissolved in another."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you take two different samples from a heterogeneous mixture, what will you likely find?",
        "options": [
          "The samples have different ratios of components.",
          "The samples are identical in every way.",
          "The samples have turned into pure elements.",
          "The samples have lost all their mass."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because heterogeneous mixtures are not uniform, the composition varies from one part of the mixture to another."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An alloy, such as brass or bronze, is classified as a:",

        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'Suspension'?",
        "options": [
          "A heterogeneous mixture where large particles settle out over time.",
          "A homogeneous mixture that never settles.",
          "A pure substance made of two metals.",
          "A gas dissolved in a liquid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Suspensions, like muddy water, are heterogeneous because the particles are large enough to be seen and will eventually sink to the bottom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a homogeneous mixture of gases?",

          "Smoke from a campfire",
          "Dust in a sunbeam",
          "Fog over a lake"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Clean air is a solution of nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases that is uniform throughout."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Colloid' is a mixture that has properties between a solution and a suspension. Which is an example?",
        "options": [
          "Milk",
          "Sand in water",
          "Sugar water",
          "Copper wire"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Milk is a colloid because its particles are larger than those in a solution but small enough that they don't settle out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the individual properties of substances when they form a mixture?",
        "options": [
          "The substances retain their original properties.",
          "The substances lose all their physical properties.",
          "The substances gain entirely new chemical formulas.",
          "The substances disappear completely."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In any mixture, whether homo- or heterogeneous, the components are physically combined and keep their own identities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Tyndall Effect (scattering of light) can be used to distinguish a solution from a colloid. Which one scatters light?",

          "Colloid",
          "Solution",
          "Pure water",
          "Element"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The larger particles in a colloid or suspension scatter light, making the beam visible, whereas a true solution does not."
