        "question": "How does increasing the surface area of a solid reactant affect the rate of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the rate by providing more sites for collisions to occur.",
          "It decreases the rate by spreading the particles too thin.",
          "It increases the rate by lowering the activation energy.",
          "It has no effect on the reaction speed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More surface area (like a powder vs. a chunk) means more reactant atoms are exposed and available to collide with other reactants."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts speed up reactions by lowering the 'energy hill' (activation energy) required for the reaction to proceed."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a pile of flour not burn easily, but a cloud of flour dust in the air can be explosive?",
        "options": [
          "The dust cloud has a much larger surface area exposed to oxygen.",
          "The dust cloud has a higher temperature than the pile.",

          "The dust cloud has a higher activation energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Splitting the flour into tiny particles maximizes the contact area between the flour and the oxygen in the air."

        "options": [
          "It is recovered unchanged in its original chemical form.",
          "It is converted into a gas and lost to the atmosphere.",
          "It is incorporated into the chemical structure of the products.",
          "It is completely used up and cannot be used again."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts participate in the reaction mechanism but are regenerated at the end, meaning they are not consumed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Biological catalysts that speed up reactions in living organisms are called:",

        "question": "A 'Heterogeneous Catalyst' is one that:",
        "options": [
          "Exists in a different physical state than the reactants.",
          "Exists in the same physical state as the reactants.",
          "Is made of at least three different metals.",
          "Only works in endothermic reactions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An example is a solid catalytic converter in a car reacting with gaseous exhaust fumes."

        "question": "How does a catalyst affect the Potential Energy Diagram of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It lowers the peak of the curve (the transition state).",
          "It lowers the energy level of the reactants.",
          "It raises the energy level of the products.",
          "It increases the distance between reactants and products."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The catalyst lowers the activation energy ($E_{a}$), which is represented by the height of the peak on the diagram."

        "question": "If you want to speed up the dissolving of a sugar cube in water, why should you crush it?",
        "options": [
          "Crushing it increases the surface area for water molecules to collide with.",
          "Crushing it increases the temperature of the sugar.",
          "Crushing it lowers the activation energy of dissolving.",
          "Crushing it turns the sugar into a catalyst."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More surface area allows more water-to-sugar interactions to happen simultaneously."

        "question": "Does a catalyst change the total amount of product (yield) that can be formed in a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "No, it only changes how fast the equilibrium or end point is reached.",
          "Yes, it increases the total amount of product produced.",
          "Yes, it decreases the total amount of product produced.",
          "Only if the reaction is performed in a vacuum."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts affect the kinetics (speed) but not the thermodynamics (the final amount of product possible)."
