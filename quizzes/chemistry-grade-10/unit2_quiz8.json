        "question": "Which technique is best for separating an insoluble solid from a liquid?",
        "options": [
          "Filtration",
          "Evaporation",
          "Distillation",
          "Chromatography"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Filtration uses a porous barrier (like filter paper) to catch solid particles while letting the liquid pass through."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the liquid that passes through the filter paper during filtration called?",

          "Filtrate",
          "Residue",
          "Solute",
          "Distillate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The liquid collected after passing through the filter is the filtrate; the solid left behind is the residue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To recover dissolved salt from a saltwater solution, which method should you use?",
        "options": [
          "Evaporation",
          "Filtration",
          "Decanting",
          "Magnetism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaporation removes the liquid solvent (water) as a gas, leaving the dissolved solid (salt) behind."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Filtration relies on which physical property to separate substances?",
        "options": [
          "Particle size",
          "Boiling point",
          "Density",
          "Magnetism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Filtration works because the holes in the filter are smaller than the solid particles but larger than the liquid molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary disadvantage of using evaporation to separate a mixture?",
        "options": [
          "The liquid component is lost to the atmosphere.",
          "It is impossible to get the solid back.",
          "It requires toxic chemicals to work.",
          "It only works for heterogeneous mixtures."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In simple evaporation, the liquid is turned into vapor and escapes, whereas distillation would allow you to collect it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which piece of lab equipment is most commonly used to hold a liquid being evaporated over a Bunsen burner?",
        "options": [
          "Evaporating dish",
          "Graduated cylinder",
          "Volumetric flask",
          "Test tube rack"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaporating dishes are shallow, porcelain containers designed to withstand high heat and allow for a large surface area for evaporation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a mixture of sand and water, the sand is considered the __________ and can be removed via filtration.",
        "options": [
          "Residue",
          "Filtrate",
          "Solvent",
          "Solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The material trapped by the filter paper is known as the residue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaporation relies on which physical property to separate substances?",
        "options": [
          "Boiling point",
          "Solubility",
          "Magnetism",
          "Color"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaporation works because the liquid has a much lower boiling point than the dissolved solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't filtration be used to separate sugar dissolved in water?",
        "options": [
          "The sugar particles are small enough to pass through the filter paper.",
          "Sugar is more dense than water.",
          "The filter paper will react chemically with the sugar.",
          "Sugar is a liquid when it is dissolved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once dissolved, sugar particles are individual molecules that are far too small to be caught by standard filter paper."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most efficient way to separate a mixture of sand, salt, and water?",
        "options": [
          "Filter the sand out first, then evaporate the water to get the salt.",
          "Evaporate the water first, then filter the dry salt and sand.",
          "Use a magnet to pull out the salt.",
          "Distill the mixture to get the sand out."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Filtering removes the insoluble sand; then, evaporation recovers the dissolved salt from the remaining solution."
