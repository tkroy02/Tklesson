          "They have the same mass number."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Valence electrons determine how an atom bonds and reacts; since group members share this count, they exhibit similar chemical behavior."

          "The total number of isotopes the element has."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each period represents a new 'shell' or principal energy level being filled as you move across the row."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Group 17 elements (F, Cl, Br, I, At) are known as the halogens and are highly reactive nonmetals."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Neon ($Ne$) is in Group 18, characterized by a full valence shell and very low reactivity."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Elements in Group 2 are collectively known as the:",
        "options": [

          "Chalcogens"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Group 2 contains elements like Magnesium and Calcium, which are known as the alkaline earth metals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As you move from top to bottom down a group, the atomic radius generally:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Changes unpredictably"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moving down a group adds more principal energy levels (shells), making the atom larger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element is considered part of Group 1 but is NOT an Alkali Metal?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen",
          "Lithium",
          "Sodium",
          "Potassium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen ($H$) is placed in Group 1 because it has one valence electron, but it is a nonmetal gas, not an alkali metal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The elements in Groups 3 through 12 are known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Transition Metals",
          "Representative Elements",
          "Inner Transition Metals",
          "Metalloids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Groups 3-12 make up the d-block and are called the transition metals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What do all elements in Period 2 have in common regarding their electron configuration?",
        "options": [
          "Their valence electrons are in the second principal energy level.",
          "They all have two valence electrons.",
          "They all have a full outer shell.",
          "They all end in a 'p' orbital."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period number indicates that the second shell ($n=2$) is the highest energy level containing electrons."
      },
      {
