        "question": "Which of the following is a defining characteristic of the Alkali Metals (Group 1)?",
        "options": [
          "They are extremely reactive, especially with water.",
          "They have two valence electrons.",
          "They are found in nature as pure, uncombined elements.",
          "They are hard, dense, and difficult to cut."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkali metals are so reactive that they are never found free in nature and must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with moisture in the air."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many valence electrons do the Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2) possess?",

          "2",
          "1",
          "8",
          "Variable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All Group 2 elements have two electrons in their outermost $s$ orbital ($ns^2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element in the Alkali Metal family is the most reactive?",
        "options": [
          "Francium",
          "Lithium",
          "Sodium",
          "Potassium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reactivity increases as you move down the group because the single valence electron is further from the nucleus and more easily lost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Alkaline Earth Metals are __________ compared to Alkali Metals in the same period.",
        "options": [
          "Harder and denser",
          "More reactive",
          "Softer and easier to cut",
          "Liquids at room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because they have two valence electrons and a stronger metallic bond, Group 2 metals are generally harder and have higher melting points than Group 1 metals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an Alkali Metal reacts, it typically forms an ion with what charge?",
        "options": [
          "$+1$",
          "$+2$",
          "$-1$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkali metals lose their one valence electron to achieve a stable noble gas configuration, resulting in a $+1$ cation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a common use for the Alkaline Earth Metal, Magnesium?",
        "options": [
          "Lightweight alloys for aircraft and auto parts.",
          "Table salt for flavoring food.",
          "Fuel for nuclear fission reactors.",
          "Liquid coolant for high-temperature thermometers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Magnesium is valued for its low density and high strength when alloyed with other metals like aluminum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which Group 1 element is essential for nerve signaling and fluid balance in the human body?",
        "options": [
          "Sodium",
          "Cesium",
          "Beryllium",
          "Francium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sodium ($Na^+$) and Potassium ($K^+$) ions are critical for the electrical impulses used by the nervous system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the atomic radius as you move down Group 2 from Beryllium to Radium?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It decreases then increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like all groups, moving down adds principal energy levels, which increases the overall size of the atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Alkali metals are known for being soft enough to be cut with a:",
        "options": [
          "Butter knife",
          "Diamond saw",
          "Laser beam",
          "Stream of water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to their relatively weak metallic bonding (only one valence electron), metals like Sodium and Potassium are surprisingly soft."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which Alkaline Earth Metal is a primary component of bones and teeth?",
        "options": [
          "Calcium",
          "Strontium",
          "Barium",
          "Magnesium"
