        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ozone layer acts as a shield, absorbing UVC and most UVB rays which can cause skin cancer and damage ecosystems."
      },

          "Nitrogen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "UV light breaks down CFCs to release chlorine atoms, which can destroy thousands of ozone molecules without being consumed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) particularly damaging to the ozone layer compared to other gases?",
        "options": [
          "They are chemically stable enough to reach the stratosphere",
          "They are highly reactive and explode upon reaching the air",
          "They are very heavy and sink into the deep crustal layers",
          "They are soluble in water and wash away during heavy rain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CFCs are unreactive in the lower atmosphere, allowing them to drift up to the stratosphere where UV light finally breaks them apart."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to an ozone molecule (O3) when it successfully absorbs UV radiation?",
        "options": [
          "It dissociates into an oxygen molecule and a free oxygen atom",
          "It expands in size to form a large cloud of ionized noble gas",
          "It transforms into a liquid state and falls toward the ocean",
          "It bonds with nitrogen to create a stable nitrous oxide gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is part of the natural ozone-oxygen cycle; the energy from UV light breaks O3 into O2 and O, which then recombine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the international agreement designed to phase out the production of ozone-depleting substances?",
        "options": [
          "The Montreal Protocol",
          "The Geneva Convention",
          "The Paris Agreement",
          "The Kyoto Protocol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, is considered one of the most successful environmental treaties for protecting the ozone layer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following was a common industrial use for CFCs before they were heavily regulated?",
        "options": [
          "Refrigerants in cooling systems and aerosol propellants",
          "Fuel additives used to increase the octane rating in cars",
          "Fertilizers used to provide nitrogen for commercial crops",
          "Disinfectants used for the purification of municipal water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CFCs were widely used in air conditioners, refrigerators, and spray cans due to their non-toxic and non-flammable nature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the 'Ozone Hole' over Antarctica primarily form during the polar spring?",
        "options": [
          "Ice crystals in polar clouds provide surfaces for reactions",
          "High winds carry all the ozone away toward the equator",
          "Lack of sunlight prevents the formation of any new oxygen",
          "The extreme heat causes the ozone to boil and evaporate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs) provide a surface for inactive chlorine to turn into active forms that rapidly destroy ozone when the sun returns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which unit is commonly used to measure the total concentration of ozone in a column of the atmosphere?",

          "Dobson Unit (DU)",
          "Newton Meter (Nm)",
          "Pascal Unit (Pa)",
          "Kelvin Unit (K)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Dobson Unit measures the total thickness of the ozone layer if it were compressed to standard temperature and pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a major biological consequence of increased UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface?",
        "options": [
          "Increased rates of DNA mutations and skin malignancies",
          "Higher levels of oxygen production in tropical forests",
          "A decrease in the global average temperature of oceans",
          "An increase in the structural strength of animal shells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "UV radiation can damage DNA, leading to skin cancers, cataracts in humans, and reduced yields in sensitive agricultural crops."
