      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When predicting products for the reaction $Mg(s) + Cl_{2}(g)$, which reaction type and product are correct?",
        "options": [
          "Synthesis; $MgCl_{2}$",
          "Decomposition; $Mg + Cl_{2}$",
          "Single Replacement; $MgCl$",
          "Double Replacement; $Mg_{2}Cl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two elements combine in a synthesis reaction to form a single ionic compound. Since $Mg$ is $2+$ and $Cl$ is $1-$, the formula is $MgCl_{2}$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decomposition of a binary compound breaks it down into its constituent elements. Oxygen must be written as the diatomic molecule $O_{2}$."

        "explanation": "Zinc is higher than copper on the activity series, so it displaces the copper to form Zinc nitrate and solid copper metal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a double replacement reaction between $KI(aq)$ and $Pb(NO_{3})_{2}(aq)$, what is the formula of the insoluble precipitate?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By swapping ions, we get $Pb^{2+}$ pairing with $I^{-}$. According to solubility rules, Lead(II) iodide is insoluble and forms a solid precipitate."

          "$C$ and $H_{2}O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The complete combustion of any hydrocarbon in the presence of oxygen always yields carbon dioxide and water vapor."

          "$AgNO_{3}$ and $Li$ are produced.",
          "$AgLi$ and $NO_{3}$ are produced.",
          "The silver dissolves into $Ag_{2}O$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Silver is much lower on the activity series than Lithium. It is not reactive enough to displace Lithium from its compound."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a double replacement reaction. The cations and anions swap to form Barium sulfate (a precipitate) and Sodium chloride."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the halogen activity series, Fluorine is more reactive than Chlorine. Therefore, Chlorine cannot displace Fluorine from the compound."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To correctly predict products, the first and most important step is to:",

          "Identify the type of reaction based on the reactants.",
          "Balance the equation immediately.",
          "Change the subscripts of the reactants.",
          "Check the periodic table for the atomic mass."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must first determine the reaction pattern (synthesis, decomposition, etc.) to know how the atoms will rearrange."
