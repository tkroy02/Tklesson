        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A fire blanket smothers the flames. You should avoid using a fire extinguisher directly on a person due to potential skin and lung irritation."

          "Pour water into the beaker immediately.",
          "Run out of the room to pull the fire alarm."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Smothering a small, contained fire is the safest method. Adding water can cause some chemical fires to splash or intensify."

          "Hide them under the desk."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Turning off heat and power sources prevents the emergency from escalating into a fire while the room is unoccupied."

          "By asking the principal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Every lab is required to have a clearly posted map showing the location of safety equipment and exit paths."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you feel dizzy or faint while working with chemicals in a fume hood, you should:",

          "Using the wrong type (like water on a grease fire) can be dangerous.",
          "One is much heavier than the other.",
          "Only teachers are allowed to use Class B."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Different fires (wood vs. chemical vs. electrical) require different extinguishing agents to be put out safely."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
