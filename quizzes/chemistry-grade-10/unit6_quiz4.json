    "subtitle": "6.4: Lewis Dot Structures for Molecules",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Electron dot diagrams for molecules",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the very first step in drawing a Lewis structure for a molecule?",
        "options": [
          "Sum the total number of valence electrons from all atoms.",
          "Place the most electronegative atom in the center.",
          "Draw triple bonds between all atoms to maximize stability.",
          "Subtract electrons for every metal present in the formula."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must determine the total 'budget' of valence electrons available before you can distribute them into bonds and lone pairs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Lewis structure, what do a pair of dots ( : ) located on a single atom represent?",
        "options": [
          "A lone pair (unshared pair) of electrons",
          "A single covalent bond",
          "An alpha particle",
          "A double bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lone pairs are valence electrons that belong to only one atom and are not shared in a bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which atom is generally the 'central atom' in a Lewis structure?",
        "options": [
          "The least electronegative atom (excluding Hydrogen).",
          "The most electronegative atom, like Fluorine.",
          "The atom with the highest atomic mass.",
          "Any Hydrogen atom in the molecule."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The least electronegative atom is more willing to share electrons with multiple surrounding atoms. Hydrogen is never central because it only forms one bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When drawing the Lewis structure for a polyatomic ion with a $1-$ charge, such as $OH^{-}$, you must:",
        "options": [
          "Add one electron to the total valence electron count.",
          "Subtract one electron from the total valence electron count.",
          "Add one proton to the Oxygen nucleus.",
          "Ignore the charge until the very end."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative charge means the ion has gained an extra electron, which must be accounted for in the structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many total valence electrons are used in the Lewis structure for Methane ($CH_{4}$)?",
        "options": [
          "8",
          "10",
          "4",
          "16"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon provides 4 valence electrons and each of the four Hydrogens provides 1 ($4 + 1 \\times 4 = 8$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you run out of electrons before all atoms have reached an octet, the next step is to:",
        "options": [
          "Convert one or more lone pairs into double or triple bonds.",
          "Add more electrons from the 'core' levels.",
          "Leave the central atom with a partial octet.",
          "Remove an atom from the molecule."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiple bonds are formed when atoms need to share more electrons to reach a stable configuration without using extra electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these molecules contains a triple bond in its Lewis structure?",
        "options": [
          "$N_{2}$",
          "$O_{2}$",
          "$F_{2}$",
          "$H_{2}O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen atoms have 5 valence electrons and must share three pairs to satisfy the octet rule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element is a common exception to the octet rule, often being stable with only 6 valence electrons?",
        "options": [
          "Boron ($B$)",
          "Carbon ($C$)",
          "Nitrogen ($N$)",
          "Oxygen ($O$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boron is 'electron deficient' and often forms stable compounds like $BF_{3}$ with only 6 electrons around it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Lewis structure for $CO_{2}$, how many lone pairs are present on the Carbon atom?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "2",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon forms two double bonds with the Oxygen atoms, using all 4 of its valence electrons in bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What should be placed around the Lewis structure of a polyatomic ion to indicate its charge?",
        "options": [
          "Square brackets with the charge as a superscript.",
          "A circle with a plus or minus sign.",
          "A double line underneath the formula.",
          "Parentheses around every individual atom."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Brackets signify that the charge is distributed over the entire molecular ion rather than one specific atom."
