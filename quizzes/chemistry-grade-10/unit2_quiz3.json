    "subtitle": "2.3: Three States of Matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Characteristics of different states of matter",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter has a definite shape and a definite volume?",
        "options": [
          "Solid",
          "Liquid",
          "Gas",
          "Plasma"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a solid, particles are packed closely together in fixed positions, allowing it to maintain its own shape and volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The particles in a liquid are best described as:",
        "options": [
          "Fixed in a rigid structure.",
          "Far apart and moving randomly at high speeds.",
          "Close together but able to slide past one another.",
          "Completely stationary."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Liquid particles have enough kinetic energy to move around each other, which allows liquids to flow while remaining relatively incompressible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter is the most easily compressed?",
        "options": [
          "Solid",
          "Liquid",
          "Gas",
          "All are equally compressible"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Gas particles are separated by large amounts of empty space, allowing them to be pushed closer together under pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the kinetic energy of particles as a substance is heated?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases.",
          "It increases.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It disappears."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy; heating a substance causes its particles to move faster."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter will expand to fill the entire volume of its container?",
        "options": [
          "Solid",
          "Liquid",
          "Gas",
          "None of them"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Gases have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume; they expand until they hit the boundaries of their container."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Kinetic Molecular Theory' suggests that particles of matter are:",
        "options": [
          "Always in motion.",
          "Only moving when liquid.",
          "Completely still at room temperature.",
          "Only found in gases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The theory states that all matter is made of tiny particles that are constantly moving, even if only vibrating in place as in a solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Fluid' states of matter?",
        "options": [
          "Only liquids",
          "Only gases",
          "Liquids and gases",
          "Solids and liquids"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A fluid is any substance that can flow; both liquids and gases fit this definition because their particles can move past one another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance with a high 'intermolecular force' of attraction between particles is most likely a __________ at room temperature.",
        "options": [
          "Solid",
          "Liquid",
          "Gas",
          "Vacuum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strong attractions hold particles tightly together, typically resulting in a solid structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter is characterized by particles vibrating in fixed positions?",
        "options": [
          "Gas",
          "Liquid",
          "Solid",
          "Plasma"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Solids have the lowest kinetic energy of the three common states, with particles vibrating around fixed points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The chemical identity of water changes when it turns from ice to steam.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "False. Phase changes are physical changes; the molecules remain $H_2O$ regardless of whether they are solid, liquid, or gas."
