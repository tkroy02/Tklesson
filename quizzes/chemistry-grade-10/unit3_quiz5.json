    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Early quantum atomic model and electron energy levels",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Bohr model, where are electrons located?",
        "options": [
          "In fixed, circular orbits around the nucleus.",
          "Randomly scattered throughout the atom.",
          "Inside the nucleus with the protons.",
          "In three-dimensional clouds called orbitals."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Niels Bohr proposed that electrons travel in definite, circular paths (orbits) at specific distances from the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to an electron's energy as it moves to an orbit further away from the nucleus?",
        "options": [
          "Its energy increases.",
          "Its energy decreases.",
          "Its energy remains exactly the same.",
          "Its energy becomes negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Orbits further from the nucleus correspond to higher energy levels; electrons must absorb energy to move outward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The lowest energy state of an atom is known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Ground state",
          "Excited state",
          "Quantum state",
          "Neutral state"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ground state is the most stable, lowest-energy configuration where electrons are in the orbits closest to the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an electron moves from a high energy level back to a lower energy level, it:",
        "options": [
          "Emits a photon (light energy).",
          "Absorbs a photon.",
          "Becomes a proton.",
          "Collapses into the nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To drop to a lower energy level, the electron must release the excess energy, often in the form of a specific color of light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'quantum' of energy is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The exact amount of energy required to move an electron between levels.",
          "The total energy of the entire atom.",
          "The energy of a single proton.",
          "A continuous stream of energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bohr's model was 'quantized,' meaning electrons can only exist at specific energy levels and not in the spaces between them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why did the Bohr model eventually need to be replaced?",
        "options": [
          "It only accurately predicted the behavior of the Hydrogen atom.",
          "It claimed that the nucleus was negatively charged.",
          "It stated that atoms could not form molecules.",
          "It failed to account for the existence of neutrons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While groundbreaking, Bohr's math failed for any element more complex than Hydrogen because it didn't account for electron-electron repulsions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes an atom in an 'excited state'?",
        "options": [
          "An electron has absorbed energy and jumped to a higher level.",
          "The atom has lost an electron to become an ion.",
          "The nucleus is vibrating rapidly.",
          "All electrons are in the lowest possible energy levels."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An excited state occurs when an electron occupies an energy level higher than its ground state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The lines seen in an element's 'Atomic Emission Spectrum' are caused by:",
        "options": [
          "Electrons dropping from higher levels to lower levels.",
          "Electrons jumping from ground state to excited state.",
          "Protons moving between atoms.",
          "Neutrons decaying into protons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each line represents a specific 'quantum' jump as electrons release energy while returning to lower states."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Bohr model, how many electrons can the first (innermost) energy level hold?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "8",
          "18",
          "32"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first energy level ($n=1$) is small and can only accommodate a maximum of 2 electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Bohr, electrons do not fall into the nucleus because:",
        "options": [
          "They are restricted to specific energy levels or orbits.",
          "The nucleus repels them.",
          "They are moving faster than the speed of light.",
          "Gravity pulls them outward."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bohr postulated that as long as an electron stays in its allowed orbit, it does not lose energy and therefore cannot spiral into the nucleus."
