        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because ionic compounds form repeating patterns (lattices), the formula represents the simplest whole-number ratio of ions."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lattice energy is a measure of the strength of the bonds in an ionic compound; higher lattice energy indicates stronger bonds."

          "Atoms that share electrons equally"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Coulomb's Law, the force of attraction is stronger when charges are greater and the distance between them (radius) is smaller."

        "question": "What is the overall electrical charge of any ionic compound?",

          "Variable depending on the temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total positive charge of the cations must exactly balance the total negative charge of the anions in an ionic compound."

          "Neon and Argon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionic bonds typically form between a metal (which loses electrons) and a nonmetal (which gains them)."
      },

        "question": "The formation of a crystal lattice is an __________ process.",
        "options": [

          "Endothermic (requires energy)",
          "Isothermal (no energy change)",
          "Atmospheric"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formation of a lattice is highly stable, and the system releases a significant amount of energy as the ions come together."
