    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical property does distillation primarily use to separate the components of a liquid mixture?",
        "options": [
          "Boiling point",
          "Density",
          "Particle size",
          "Solubility"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distillation works by heating a mixture to the boiling point of the substance with the lowest boiling point, turning it into vapor, and then condensing it back into a liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Büchner funnel"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The condenser typically uses a jacket of cold water surrounding a glass tube to lower the temperature of the passing vapor, causing it to liquefy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Paper chromatography is most commonly used to separate the different components of:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chromatography is an excellent tool for separating complex mixtures of soluble substances, like the various pigments found in ink."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Chromatography separates substances based on their different rates of movement through a medium, which is determined by their:",

          "Solubility and attraction to the paper",
          "Boiling points",
          "Magnetic properties",
          "Radioactivity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substances that are more soluble in the mobile phase (solvent) and have less attraction to the stationary phase (paper) will travel further up the strip."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the liquid collected at the end of the distillation process called?",
        "options": [
          "Distillate",
          "Filtrate",
          "Residue",
          "Precipitate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distillate is the purified liquid that has been evaporated and then condensed into the receiving flask."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In chromatography, the solvent that moves up the paper is known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Mobile phase",
          "Stationary phase",
          "Distillate",
          "Residue"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mobile phase is the fluid (liquid or gas) that carries the mixture through the stationary phase (like the chromatography paper)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method would be most effective for obtaining pure drinking water from seawater while saving the water?",
        "options": [
          "Distillation",
          "Evaporation",
          "Filtration",
          "Chromatography"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While evaporation leaves the salt behind, distillation allows you to capture and condense the water vapor, providing pure liquid water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In chromatography, if a component does not move from the original starting line, it means:",
        "options": [
          "It is not soluble in that specific solvent.",
          "It is too light to be carried by the solvent.",
          "The solvent is moving too fast.",
          "The paper is upside down."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a substance isn't soluble in the mobile phase, it cannot be carried up the stationary phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fractional distillation is a specialized version of distillation used to separate liquids that:",
        "options": [
          "Have boiling points that are very close to each other.",
          "Have very different densities.",
          "Do not mix together at all (immiscible).",
          "Are different colors."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fractional distillation uses a column to allow for multiple 'mini-distillations,' providing better separation for liquids with similar boiling points, like those in crude oil."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Retention Factor' ($R_f$ value) in chromatography used for?",
        "options": [
          "To identify a specific substance by comparing how far it traveled relative to the solvent.",
          "To measure the temperature of the solvent.",
          "To determine the mass of the paper.",
          "To see how much water the paper can hold."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $R_f$ value is a ratio: $R_f = \\frac{distance\\ traveled\\ by\\ substance}{distance\\ traveled\\ by\\ solvent\\ front}$, which is characteristic for a substance in a specific system."
