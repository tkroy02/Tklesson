        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The thyroid gland naturally absorbs iodine, so radioactive Iodine-131 ($^{131}I$) is used to image or destroy diseased thyroid tissue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary danger of 'Ionizing Radiation' to human health?",
        "options": [
          "It can damage DNA and cause mutations or cancer.",

          "It causes the body to become a permanent magnet.",
          "It increases the boiling point of blood."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionizing radiation has enough energy to strip electrons from atoms, which can break chemical bonds in DNA molecules."
      },
      {

          "Half-life",
          "Expiration date",
          "Critical mass",
          "Reaction rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Half-life ($t_{1/2}$) is a constant property for each radioisotope and is independent of the initial amount of the substance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which radioisotope is found in most household smoke detectors?",
        "options": [
          "Americium-241",
          "Plutonium-239",
          "Radon-222",
          "Uranium-235"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Americium-241 ($^{241}Am$) emits alpha particles that ionize air; when smoke disrupts this ion flow, the alarm triggers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a method used to protect people from radiation exposure?",
        "options": [
          "Shielding with lead or concrete.",
          "Wearing bright white clothing.",

          "Staying in high-altitude locations."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dense materials like lead block the path of alpha, beta, and especially gamma radiation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Radiation therapy is used to treat cancer primarily because:",
        "options": [
          "Rapidly dividing cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation damage.",
          "Radiation makes the body stronger against viruses.",
          "Cancer cells are the only cells that absorb radiation.",
          "Radiation turns cancer cells into healthy cells."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because cancer cells divide more frequently than most healthy cells, they are less able to repair DNA damage caused by targeted radiation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Food irradiation is a process used to:",
        "options": [
          "Kill bacteria and parasites to extend shelf life.",
          "Make the food taste much sweeter.",
          "Cook the food instantly without heat.",
          "Turn the food into a radioactive power source."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exposing food to gamma rays kills microorganisms that cause spoilage and illness without making the food itself radioactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main concern regarding the long-term storage of nuclear waste?",
        "options": [
          "The waste remains radioactive for thousands of years.",
          "The waste will eventually evaporate into the atmosphere.",
          "The waste will turn into solid gold and be stolen.",
          "The waste is too heavy to be moved by trucks."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isotopes like Plutonium-239 have very long half-lives, requiring storage solutions that can remain secure for geological time scales."
