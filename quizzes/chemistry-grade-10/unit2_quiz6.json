        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elements are pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means because they consist of only one kind of atom."

          "It has a constant chemical composition and distinct properties.",
          "It can be separated into components by physical filtration.",
          "It is always made of at least three different types of atoms.",
          "Its properties change depending on the size of the sample."
        ],
        "answer": "A",

        "question": "How does a mixture differ from a pure substance?",
        "options": [
          "Mixtures can be separated by physical means, while pure substances cannot.",
          "Mixtures are always solid, while pure substances are always liquid.",
          "Mixtures have a fixed chemical formula, while pure substances do not.",
          "Mixtures contain only one type of molecule."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the components of a mixture are not chemically bonded, they can be separated using physical properties like boiling point, size, or magnetism."

          "Brass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distilled water is a compound ($H_2O$) with a fixed composition. Saltwater, air, and brass are all mixtures."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you can see the different parts of a mixture with the naked eye, it is classified as:",

          "Heterogeneous",
          "Homogeneous",
          "A compound",
          "An element"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heterogeneous mixtures are not uniform in composition; the individual substances remain distinct."

          "Colloid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "24-karat gold is pure gold, containing only gold atoms ($Au$), making it an element."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sucrose (table sugar) has the formula $C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$. It is a(n):",

          "Element",
          "Homogeneous mixture",
          "Heterogeneous mixture"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because it has a fixed chemical formula and consists of different elements bonded together, it is a compound."
      },

          "A compound that has been melted into a liquid.",
          "A type of element found in the periodic table.",
          "A mixture where you can see the different layers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where the solute is evenly distributed within the solvent."
