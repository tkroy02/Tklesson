        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fission occurs when a large, unstable nucleus (like Uranium-235) breaks apart into smaller 'fragments' after being struck by a neutron."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Nuclear Fusion is the process that powers:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fusion involves combining light nuclei (like Hydrogen) under extreme heat and pressure to form a heavier nucleus, releasing massive amounts of energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a nuclear chain reaction, what particle is released by a fission event that then strikes other nuclei?",
        "options": [
          "Neutron",
          "Proton",
          "Electron",
          "Alpha particle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a nucleus undergoes fission, it releases 2 or 3 neutrons. If these strike other nuclei, they cause further fission, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a major challenge in achieving controlled nuclear fusion on Earth?",
        "options": [
          "The extremely high temperatures required to overcome proton repulsion.",
          "The lack of Hydrogen fuel in the universe.",
          "Fusion produces too much long-lived radioactive waste.",
          "Fusion reactions are too slow to produce usable electricity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To get two positive nuclei to fuse, they must overcome enormous electrostatic repulsion, which requires temperatures in the millions of degrees."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation, proposed by Albert Einstein, explains why nuclear reactions release so much energy?",
        "options": [
          "$E = mc^2$",
          "$PV = nRT$",
          "$F = ma$",
          "$A = Z + n$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A small amount of mass ('mass defect') is lost during nuclear reactions and converted into a massive amount of energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the function of 'Control Rods' in a nuclear fission reactor?",
        "options": [
          "To absorb excess neutrons and slow down the chain reaction.",
          "To provide the fuel for the fission process.",
          "To reflect alpha particles back into the core.",
          "To turn the steam turbines directly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Control rods are made of materials like boron or cadmium that capture neutrons, allowing operators to manage the rate of the reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which process results in the production of more radioactive 'waste' products?",
        "options": [
          "Nuclear Fission",
          "Nuclear Fusion",
          "Both produce equal amounts",
          "Neither produces waste"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fission produces 'fission fragments' that are often highly radioactive isotopes with long half-lives. Fusion products, like Helium, are typically stable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Critical Mass' in the context of nuclear fission?",
        "options": [
          "The minimum amount of fissionable material needed to sustain a chain reaction.",
          "The total mass of the entire nuclear power plant.",
          "The mass of a single proton inside a Uranium atom.",
          "The amount of lead needed to stop gamma radiation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If there is not enough material (subcritical mass), too many neutrons escape before they can cause further fission events."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to chemical reactions (like burning coal), nuclear reactions release:",
        "options": [
          "Millions of times more energy per gram of fuel.",
          "The same amount of energy.",
          "Slightly less energy.",
          "Energy only in the form of sound waves."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nuclear forces are much stronger than the chemical bonds involved in combustion, leading to vastly higher energy yields."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Moderator' in a nuclear reactor is used to:",
        "options": [
          "Slow down fast-moving neutrons so they can be captured by fuel nuclei.",
          "Cool the reactor down when it gets too hot.",
          "Speed up the electrons to create more electricity.",
          "Shield the workers from gamma radiation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slow-moving ('thermal') neutrons are much more likely to cause fission in Uranium-235 than fast-moving ones."
