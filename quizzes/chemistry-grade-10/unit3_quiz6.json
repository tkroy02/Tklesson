        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Aufbau Principle' states that electrons must:",
        "options": [
          "Occupy the lowest energy orbital available first.",
          "Have opposite spins when in the same orbital.",
          "Fill orbitals of equal energy one at a time before pairing up.",
          "Only exist in circular orbits like planets."
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "10"

          "14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A $p$ sublevel contains three orbitals ($p_x, p_y, p_z$), and since each holds 2 electrons, the total is 6."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which rule states that electrons will fill empty orbitals of the same energy before pairing up?",

          "Hund's Rule",
          "Pauli Exclusion Principle",
          "Aufbau Principle",
          "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hund's Rule states that single electrons with the same spin must occupy each equal-energy orbital before additional electrons with opposite spins can be added."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the total electron capacity of the third principal energy level ($n=3$)?",

          "18",
          "8",
          "2",
          "32"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the formula $2n^2$, for $n=3$ we get $2(3^2) = 18$ electrons ($s=2, p=6, d=10$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an orbital diagram, what do the upward and downward arrows represent?",
        "options": [
          "Opposite electron spins",
          "Different energy levels",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Arrows represent electrons, and the direction indicates their clockwise or counter-clockwise 'spin'."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which sublevel begins to fill after the 4s sublevel is complete?",

          "3d",
          "4p",
          "5s",
          "3p"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to overlapping energy levels, the $3d$ sublevel is slightly higher in energy than $4s$, so it fills after $4s$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct electron configuration for a neutral Nitrogen atom (atomic number 7)?",
