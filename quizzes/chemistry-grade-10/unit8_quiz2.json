    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Calculating mass per mole",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The molar mass of an element (in grams per mole) is numerically equal to its:",
        "options": [
          "Average atomic mass in atomic mass units (amu).",
          "Atomic number.",
          "Number of neutrons in the nucleus.",
          "Density at standard temperature and pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The periodic table provides the average atomic mass, which tells us both the mass of one atom in amu and the mass of one mole of that element in grams."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen is diatomic. Since one atom of Oxygen is approximately 16.00 g/mol, a molecule of $O_{2}$ is $16.00 \\times 2 = 32.00$ g/mol."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms present: $(2 \\times 1.01) + (1 \\times 16.00) = 18.02$ g/mol."

          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The subscript outside the parentheses applies to everything inside, so there are 2 Oxygen atoms and 2 Hydrogen atoms."
