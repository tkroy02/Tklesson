    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Phase transitions and energy changes",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the process called when a solid changes directly into a gas without becoming a liquid?",
        "options": [
          "Evaporation",
          "Sublimation",
          "Deposition",
          "Condensation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sublimation occurs when a solid gains enough energy to bypass the liquid phase entirely, such as with dry ice ($CO_2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following processes is 'endothermic' (absorbs heat)?",
        "options": [
          "Freezing",
          "Condensation",
          "Vaporization",
          "Deposition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Vaporization requires the input of energy to overcome the attractive forces between liquid particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the temperature of a substance while it is actively melting?",
        "options": [
          "It increases steadily.",
          "It decreases as it absorbs cold.",
          "It stays constant until all the solid has melted.",
          "It fluctuates up and down."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "During a phase change, the energy added is used to break intermolecular bonds rather than increasing the kinetic energy (temperature) of the particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The change of state from a gas to a liquid is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Vaporization",
          "Sublimation",
          "Condensation",
          "Melting"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Condensation occurs when gas particles lose thermal energy and move closer together to form a liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which transition involves a substance releasing energy to its surroundings?",
        "options": [
          "Melting",
          "Freezing",
          "Vaporization",
          "Sublimation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Freezing is an exothermic process; particles must lose energy to slow down and form a rigid structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Deposition'?",
        "options": [
          "A liquid turning into a solid.",
          "A gas turning directly into a solid.",
          "A solid turning into a liquid.",
          "A liquid turning into a gas."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deposition is the reverse of sublimation, where a gas changes directly to a solid, such as frost forming on a window."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaporation differs from boiling because evaporation:",
        "options": [
          "Occurs only at the surface of the liquid.",
          "Requires much more energy.",
          "Only happens at the boiling point.",
          "Changes the chemical formula of the water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaporation can occur at temperatures below the boiling point and only takes place at the surface of the liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the 'Boiling Point', the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "The internal temperature",
          "The external atmospheric pressure",
          "The density of the liquid"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, bubbles of vapor can form throughout the liquid, which is the definition of boiling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a heating curve, what do the flat, horizontal lines represent?",
        "options": [
          "The substance is exploding.",
          "The substance is changing temperature.",
          "The substance is undergoing a phase change.",
          "The substance is cooling down."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Plateaus on a heating curve indicate that energy is being used for a phase change, so the temperature remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Steam at 100°C contains more thermal energy than liquid water at 100°C.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. Steam has additional 'latent heat' required to have transitioned from liquid to gas at that same temperature."
