    "subtitle": "4.6: Halogens and Noble Gases",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Properties of Group 17 and Group 18 elements",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Halogens' (Group 17)?",
        "options": [
          "Highly reactive nonmetals with seven valence electrons.",
          "Unreactive gases with a full octet.",
          "Soft metals that react violently with water.",
          "Transition metals used in jewelry."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Halogens need only one more electron to fill their valence shell, making them the most reactive nonmetals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Noble Gases (Group 18) are known for being 'inert' because:",
        "options": [
          "They have a full outer energy level.",
          "They have no electrons at all.",
          "They are located on the far left of the table.",
          "They only exist at absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Having 8 valence electrons (or 2 for Helium) provides maximum stability, so they rarely gain, lose, or share electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which Halogen is a liquid at room temperature?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bromine ($Br$) is one of only two elements (along with Mercury) that is liquid at standard room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most electronegative and reactive element in the Halogen group?",

          "Fluorine",
          "Chlorine",
          "Iodine",
          "Astatine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluorine ($F$) is the most reactive of all nonmetals because its valence electrons are very close to the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which Noble Gas is commonly used in weather balloons and to provide 'lift' because it is less dense than air?",
        "options": [
          "Helium",
          "Neon",
          "Argon",
          "Xenon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helium ($He$) is the second lightest element and is non-flammable, making it safer than Hydrogen for lifting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When Halogens react with metals, they typically form compounds known as:",
        "options": [
          "Salts",
          "Acids",
          "Oxides",
          "Alloys"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The word 'halogen' actually means 'salt-former' (e.g., $NaCl$, $KBr$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which Halogen is added to drinking water and toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay?",
        "options": [
          "Fluorine",
          "Chlorine",
          "Bromine",
          "Iodine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluoride ions help strengthen tooth enamel against acid attacks from bacteria."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the physical state of the Halogens as you move down the group from Fluorine to Iodine?",
        "options": [
          "They change from gas to liquid to solid.",
          "They change from solid to liquid to gas.",
          "They all remain gases.",
          "They all remain solids."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluorine/Chlorine are gases, Bromine is a liquid, and Iodine is a solid due to increasing intermolecular forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which Noble Gas is used in high-intensity lamps and as an anesthetic in some medical procedures?",

          "Xenon",
          "Helium",
          "Neon",
          "Radon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Xenon ($Xe$) has various specialized uses in lighting and medicine due to its unique properties."
      },
