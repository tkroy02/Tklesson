          "Become zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pressure and volume have an inverse relationship; squeezing a gas into a smaller space increases the frequency of collisions."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Charles's Law describes the V-T relationship, which requires the external pressure to be held steady."

          "Joule"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Kelvin is an absolute scale starting at absolute zero ($0 K$), which is mathematically necessary to avoid negative volumes or pressures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the Kelvin temperature of a gas in a rigid container (fixed volume), what happens to the pressure?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure is cut in half.",
          "The pressure doubles.",
          "The pressure stays the same.",
          "The pressure increases fourfold."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gay-Lussac's Law states that pressure and Kelvin temperature are directly proportional when volume is constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "100°C and 10 atm",
          "0 K and 1 bar",
          "0°C and 1 atm",
          "25°C and 760 atm"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "STP is the standard reference point for comparing gas behavior, set at the freezing point of water and sea-level pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balloon left in a hot car on a summer day may burst. This is a real-world application of which gas law?",
        "options": [
          "Boyle's Law",
          "Charles's Law",
          "Dalton's Law",
          "Graham's Law"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As the temperature increases, the volume of the gas inside the balloon expands until the rubber reaches its limit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following variables is NOT involved in the Ideal Gas Law equation ($PV=nRT$)?",
        "options": [
          "Moles of gas",
          "Temperature",
          "Volume",
          "Density"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Ideal Gas Law relates Pressure, Volume, Moles ($n$), and Temperature. Density can be derived from it but is not a direct variable in the primary formula."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the particles of a gas at 'Absolute Zero' ($0 K$)?",
        "options": [
          "They move at the speed of light.",
          "They turn into energy.",
          "Theoretically, all molecular motion stops.",
          "They become infinitely large."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Absolute zero is the theoretical temperature where all kinetic energy—and thus all motion—reaches its minimum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A scuba diver notices bubbles getting larger as they rise to the surface. This happens because:",
        "options": [
          "Water temperature increases.",
          "Water pressure decreases with depth.",
          "The diver is exhaling more gas.",
          "The salt in the water is evaporating."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As the diver rises, the external pressure from the water decreases, allowing the volume of the gas bubbles to expand (Boyle's Law)."
