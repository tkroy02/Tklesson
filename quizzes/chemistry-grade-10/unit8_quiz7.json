    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The molecular formula of a compound is always a whole-number multiple of its:",
        "options": [
          "Empirical formula.",
          "Atomic number.",
          "Percent composition.",
          "Molar volume at STP."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A molecular formula represents the actual number of atoms, which is always $n$ times the simplest ratio (empirical formula)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To determine the molecular formula from an empirical formula, what additional piece of information is required?",
        "options": [
          "The molar mass of the actual compound.",
          "The density of the substance.",
          "The number of valence electrons.",
          "The boiling point of the liquid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must compare the 'true' molar mass to the 'empirical' mass to find the multiplier $n$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the empirical formula is $CH_{2}$ and the molar mass is $42.0$ g/mol, what is the molecular formula? (Empirical mass $\\approx 14.0$ g/mol)",

          "$CH_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$42.0 / 14.0 = 3$. Multiplying the subscripts in $CH_{2}$ by $3$ gives $C_{3}H_{6}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the multiplier ($n$) if the empirical formula is $HO$ (mass $\\approx 17$) and the molecular mass is $34$ g/mol?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "3",
          "17"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$n = \\text{Molecular Mass} / \\text{Empirical Mass} = 34 / 17 = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the relationship between the empirical formula and molecular formula of Glucose ($C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$)?",
        "options": [
          "The molecular formula is 6 times the empirical formula ($CH_{2}O$).",
          "They are exactly the same.",
          "The empirical formula is 6 times the molecular formula.",
          "There is no mathematical relationship."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reducing $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$ by its greatest common factor (6) results in the empirical formula $CH_{2}O$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A compound has an empirical formula of $NO_{2}$ and a molar mass of $92$ g/mol. What is the molecular formula? ($N=14, O=16$)",
        "options": [
          "$N_{2}O_{4}$",
          "$NO_{2}$",
          "$N_{3}O_{6}$",
          "$N_{2}O_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Empirical mass $= 14 + (2 \\times 16) = 46$. Multiplier $n = 92 / 46 = 2$. Therefore, $2 \\times (NO_{2}) = N_{2}O_{4}$."
      },

        "question": "Can the molecular formula be the same as the empirical formula?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, if the multiplier $n$ is equal to 1.",
          "No, the molecular formula must always be larger.",
          "Yes, but only for ionic compounds.",
          "No, unless the molar mass is exactly 100 g/mol."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For compounds like $H_{2}O$ or $CH_{4}$, the simplest ratio is also the actual molecular count."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the percent composition of a substance when you move from the empirical formula to the molecular formula?",
        "options": [
          "The percent composition remains exactly the same.",
          "The percent composition doubles.",
          "The percentages decrease as the molecule gets larger.",
          "The percentage of the heaviest element increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the ratio of atoms remains the same, the mass ratio (percent composition) also remains constant."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance with empirical formula $CH$ has a molar mass of $78$ g/mol. What is its molecular formula? ($C=12, H=1$)",

          "$C_{6}H_{12}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Empirical mass $= 13$. Multiplier $n = 78 / 13 = 6$. The formula is $C_{6}H_{6}$ (benzene)."

          "Multiply the subscripts by 2.99.",
          "Assume the experiment failed.",
          "Divide all subscripts by 3."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to minor rounding in atomic masses or experimental data, $n$ should be rounded to the nearest whole number."
