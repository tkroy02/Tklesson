          "Positron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Protons are the positively charged particles found in the dense central nucleus of an atom."

        "question": "Which of the following describes the mass and location of an electron?",
        "options": [
          "Negligible mass, located in the electron cloud",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrons have a mass so small (approx. $1/1836$ of a proton) that it is considered negligible, and they exist in the orbitals surrounding the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The identity of an element is determined solely by its number of:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The number of protons (atomic number) is unique to each element. Changing the proton count changes the element itself."
      },

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both protons and neutrons contribute to the atom's mass, each weighing about 1 atomic mass unit."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the electric charge of a neutron?",
        "options": [
          "Neutral (zero charge)",
          "Positive (+1)",
          "Negative (-1)",
          "Variable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the name suggests, neutrons are electrically neutral and serve to help 'glue' the nucleus together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a neutral atom, the number of protons must be equal to the number of:",

          "Quarks",
          "Nuclei"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an atom to have no net charge, the positive charge of the protons must be balanced by an equal number of negative electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Most of the volume (space) of an atom is occupied by the:",
        "options": [
          "Electron cloud",
          "Nucleus",
          "Protons",
          "Neutrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the nucleus contains almost all the mass, it is tiny compared to the vast space where electrons are found."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which particle is the least massive?",

          "Proton",
          "Neutron",
          "Alpha particle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electron is significantly lighter than the nucleons (protons and neutrons)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Strong Nuclear Force' acts to hold together which two particles?",

          "Atoms and molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The strong force overcomes the electromagnetic repulsion between positive protons to keep the nucleus stable."
      },
      {
