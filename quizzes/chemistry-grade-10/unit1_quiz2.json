        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The process begins by noticing and describing events or processes in a careful, orderly way."

        "options": [
          "A proven fact.",
          "A summary of experimental results.",
          "A testable explanation for an observation.",
          "A scientific law."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A hypothesis is a tentative scientific explanation that can be tested by further observation or by experimentation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a controlled experiment, which variable is deliberately changed by the scientist?",
        "options": [
          "Dependent variable",
          "Controlled variable",
          "Independent variable",
          "Constant variable"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The independent variable is the factor that is intentionally manipulated to observe its effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of quantitative data?",
        "options": [
          "The liquid turned a deep blue color.",
          "The reaction produced a strong odor of sulfur.",
          "The temperature of the solution increased by 15°C.",
          "Large bubbles formed on the surface of the metal."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Quantitative data involves numbers and measurements, such as temperature, mass, or volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important to have a 'control group' in a chemistry experiment?",
        "options": [
          "To speed up the chemical reaction.",
          "To provide a standard for comparison.",
          "To ensure all chemicals are used up.",
          "To guarantee the hypothesis is proven correct."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A control group is exposed to the same conditions as the experimental group except for one independent variable, allowing scientists to see the effect of that variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A scientific _________ is a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations.",
        "options": [
          "Theory",
          "Law",
          "Hypothesis",
          "Guess"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A theory explains *why* something happens based on extensive evidence, whereas a law describes *what* happens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If experimental data does not support a hypothesis, what should a scientist do next?",
        "options": [
          "Discard the data and try again until it matches.",
          "Stop the investigation entirely.",
          "Revise the hypothesis and test again.",
          "Publish the results as a new scientific law."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Science is an iterative process; unsuccessful hypotheses lead to new questions and refined explanations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a scientific Law?",
        "options": [
          "A description of an observed phenomenon, often mathematical.",
          "A preliminary explanation of an event.",
          "A collection of opinions from experts.",
          "A temporary idea used only in labs."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Laws, like the Law of Conservation of Mass, describe a consistent relationship in nature without necessarily explaining the underlying cause."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Qualitative observations focus on:",
        "options": [
          "Precise numerical measurements.",
          "Descriptions of physical characteristics like color or texture.",
          "Calculations of molar mass.",
          "Statistical analysis of results."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Qualitative observations are descriptive and involve the senses rather than numerical values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: The scientific method is a rigid, linear path that must always follow the exact same steps in order.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "False. In practice, the scientific method is flexible and often involves circling back to previous steps as new information is discovered."
