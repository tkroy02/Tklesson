    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Dmitri Mendeleev is known as the 'father' of the periodic table because he organized elements based on their:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing atomic mass and similar properties.",
          "Increasing atomic number.",
          "Alphabetical order of their symbols.",
          "Density and boiling point only."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mendeleev arranged the 63 known elements by atomic mass and noticed that chemical properties appeared at regular intervals (periodically)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What was the most impressive feature of Mendeleev's periodic table?",
        "options": [
          "He left gaps for undiscovered elements and predicted their properties.",
          "He was the first to discover the existence of electrons.",
          "He organized elements by the number of neutrons in their nuclei.",
          "He successfully predicted the discovery of the noble gases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mendeleev predicted the existence of elements like Gallium and Germanium, describing their properties with incredible accuracy before they were found."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How did Henry Moseley change the organization of the periodic table later on?",
        "options": [
          "He organized elements by increasing atomic number.",
          "He organized elements by their electronegativity.",
          "He added the transition metals to the center of the table.",
          "He removed all nonmetals from the main groups."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moseley used X-ray spectroscopy to determine the actual nuclear charge (atomic number) of elements, resolving inconsistencies in Mendeleev's mass-based table."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mendeleev noticed that when elements were ordered by mass, certain properties repeated. This concept is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Periodic Law",
          "Law of Conservation of Mass",
          "The Octet Rule",
          "Atomic Theory"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Periodic Law states that the physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers (or masses, in Mendeleev's time)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why did Mendeleev switch the order of some elements, such as Tellurium and Iodine, even though it broke the atomic mass rule?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure they were grouped with elements of similar chemical properties.",
          "Because he believed his measurements of their mass were wrong.",
          "To make the table fit onto a single sheet of paper.",
          "Because Iodine was discovered much later than Tellurium."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mendeleev prioritized chemical reactivity over strict mass order, a decision that was later justified by the discovery of atomic numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scientist proposed the 'Law of Octaves,' noticing that properties repeated every eighth element?",
        "options": [
          "John Newlands",
          "Lothar Meyer",
          "Antoine Lavoisier",
          "Glenn Seaborg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newlands noticed the musical-like 'octave' pattern, but his theory was initially mocked because it didn't work for elements heavier than Calcium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mendeleev's work allowed him to predict 'Eka-aluminum.' Which element was eventually discovered that matched his predictions?",
        "options": [
          "Gallium",
          "Silicon",
          "Scandium",
          "Germanium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gallium was discovered in 1875 and its properties closely matched Mendeleev's 'Eka-aluminum' predictions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following was NOT a reason why the periodic table was difficult to organize in the 1800s?",
        "options": [
          "The number of protons in atoms was already well-known.",
          "Many elements had not been discovered yet.",
          "Atomic masses were not always accurately measured.",
          "Noble gases were completely unknown at the time."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Protons were not discovered until the early 20th century; Mendeleev had to rely on atomic mass and reactivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The horizontal rows of the periodic table are called periods. What do all elements in the same period have in common?",
        "options": [
          "The same number of occupied principal energy levels.",
          "The same number of valence electrons.",
          "Similar chemical reactivity.",
          "The same atomic mass."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each period corresponds to the filling of a new principal energy level ($n$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Who is credited with the first attempt to group elements into 'triads' based on similar properties?",
        "options": [
          "Johann Döbereiner",
          "Dmitri Mendeleev",
          "Henry Moseley",
          "Louis de Broglie"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Döbereiner's Triads (like Lithium, Sodium, and Potassium) were an early observation that elements could be grouped by similar chemical behavior."
