          "The total number of atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since each percent represents a portion of the whole, they must add up to $100\\%$ (allowing for minor rounding differences)."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $NH_{3}$, Nitrogen is $14/17 \\approx 82\\%$. In the others, the heavy Oxygen atoms significantly lower Nitrogen's mass percentage."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Does the percent composition of a pure compound change if you have a larger sample of that compound?",
        "options": [
          "No, the ratio of elements by mass is constant for a pure substance.",
          "Yes, more substance means higher percentages.",
          "Yes, the percentage of the heaviest element increases.",
          "No, but only if the temperature remains at STP."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Law of Definite Proportions, a pure compound always contains the same elements in the same proportion by mass."

          "1",
          "3",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The subscript 2 outside the parentheses applies to Nitrogen, meaning there are 2 moles of N per 1 mole of compound."
