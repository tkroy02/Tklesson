        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a chemical change rather than a physical change?",

          "An ice cube melting on a counter",
          "Sugar dissolving in hot tea",
          "Slicing an apple into thin pieces"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rusting is the oxidation of iron to form a new compound, iron(III) oxide, which cannot be reversed by physical means."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sudden, unexpected change in color is evidence of a chemical reaction because it suggests:",

          "A change in the molecular structure of the substance",
          "The substance has simply been diluted",
          "The light in the room has changed",
          "The temperature of the substance has reached absolute zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Color changes often result from the formation of a new product with different light-absorption properties than the reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The smell of food rotting is an indicator of a chemical reaction because:",
        "options": [
          "A new substance (gas) with a distinct odor is being produced.",
          "The food is getting colder.",
          "The food is changing its shape.",
          "Bacteria are physically moving the food around."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The production of distinct odors is a sign of chemical decomposition and the formation of volatile compounds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a laboratory, you observe a 'precipitate' forming. What exactly are you seeing?",
        "options": [
          "A solid settling out of a liquid solution",
          "A liquid turning into a gas very quickly",
          "A solid melting into a liquid",
          "A gas condensing into a liquid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Precipitation is the emergence of an insoluble solid from a liquid-phase reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is evidence of a chemical reaction when a candle burns?",
        "options": [
          "The production of light and heat",
          "The wax melting into a liquid",
          "The wax dripping down the side",
          "The candle changing from a tall shape to a short shape"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While melting is a physical change, the combustion of the wick and wax to produce light, heat, $CO_{2}$, and water vapor is a chemical change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which observation would likely indicate an endothermic chemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The temperature of the surroundings decreases.",
          "The mixture begins to glow with light.",
          "The temperature of the surroundings increases.",
          "A loud 'pop' sound is heard."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the environment, causing the temperature of the surroundings to drop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is 'dissolving salt in water' generally NOT considered a chemical reaction in introductory chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "No new chemical bonds are formed and the salt can be recovered by evaporation.",
          "The salt disappears completely.",
          "The water turns into a different liquid.",
          "It does not involve any atoms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dissolving is typically a physical change because the chemical identity of the sodium chloride and the water remains the same, despite the dissociation of ions."
