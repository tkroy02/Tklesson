        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A mole always contains the same number of particles ($6.022 \\times 10^{23}$), regardless of the substance's identity, mass, or volume."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1.0 mole of $H_{2}O$ contains $3 \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23})$ total atoms (2 Hydrogen + 1 Oxygen), whereas $Fe$ and $He$ only contain $1 \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23})$ atoms."

          "Molecular compounds",
          "Noble gases",
          "Metallic elements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because ionic compounds like $NaCl$ exist in a crystal lattice rather than discrete molecules, we refer to their simplest whole-number ratio as a formula unit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "answer": "A",

        "question": "Why is the mole used as a counting unit in chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "Atoms are so small that a large counting unit is needed to work with macroscopic amounts.",
          "It is the only way to measure the volume of a liquid.",
          "It was mandated by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in 1950.",
          "It allows scientists to count atoms using a microscope."
