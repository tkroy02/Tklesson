        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hardness is caused by multivalent cations, primarily Ca2+ and Mg2+, which interfere with soap and cause scale buildup in pipes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary role of 'Aeration' in the treatment of drinking water?",
        "options": [
          "To remove dissolved gases and improve the taste and odor of the water supply",
          "To add large amounts of chlorine gas for the destruction of biological organisms",
          "To filter out the remaining fine particles of sand and gravel from the reservoir",
          "To increase the density of the liquid to allow for faster sedimentation of flocs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aeration exposes water to air, which helps release trapped gases like hydrogen sulfide and increases dissolved oxygen for better flavor."
