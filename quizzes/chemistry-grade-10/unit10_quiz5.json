      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines the 'rate' of a chemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit of time.",
          "The total amount of product formed when the reaction is complete.",
          "The amount of energy required to start the reaction.",
          "The temperature at which the reaction occurs most efficiently."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reaction rate is a measure of how quickly reactants are consumed or products are created over a specific time interval."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a chemical reaction proceeds over time, what typically happens to the concentration of the **reactants**?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases.",
          "It increases.",
          "It remains constant until the very end.",
          "It doubles every ten seconds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reactants are used up to form products, so their concentration falls as the reaction progresses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following units is commonly used to express reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "M/s (Molarity per second)",
          "kg/L (Kilograms per liter)",
          "J/mol (Joules per mole)",
          "mL/g (Milliliters per gram)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate is typically measured as a change in molarity ($M$) divided by the change in time (seconds, minutes, etc.)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction produces a gas, which method would be most effective for measuring the reaction rate in a lab?",
        "options": [
          "Measuring the volume or pressure of the gas produced over time.",
          "Measuring the change in color using a spectrophotometer.",
          "Measuring the pH of the solution.",
          "Counting the number of atoms using a microscope."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For reactions involving gases, tracking the volume of gas collected or the increase in pressure in a closed container provides a direct measurement of the rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the rate of most reactions **decrease** as the reaction progresses?",
        "options": [
          "The concentration of reactants decreases, leading to fewer collisions.",
          "The products act as a catalyst to slow down the reaction.",
          "The temperature of the system always drops to absolute zero.",
          "The molecules get tired and stop moving."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As reactants are consumed, there are fewer particles available to collide and react, which naturally slows the reaction speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a graph showing the concentration of a **product** over time, the slope of the curve represents:",
        "options": [
          "The reaction rate.",
          "The activation energy.",
          "The total enthalpy change.",
          "The equilibrium constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The slope (change in concentration / change in time) is the mathematical definition of the rate at that specific moment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction rate measured at a specific, single point in time is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Instantaneous rate",
          "Average rate",
          "Initial rate",
          "Molar rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The instantaneous rate is determined by the slope of the tangent line to the concentration-time curve at a specific point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be an appropriate way to monitor the rate of a reaction that involves ions in an aqueous solution?",
        "options": [
          "Measuring the electrical conductivity of the solution.",
          "Measuring the mass of the beaker on a balance.",
          "Measuring the volume of the liquid with a ruler.",
          "Measuring the humidity of the room."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the number or type of ions changes during a reaction, the solution's ability to conduct electricity will change, allowing the rate to be monitored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Initial Rate' of a reaction is typically measured:",
        "options": [
          "At the very beginning of the reaction ($t = 0$).",
          "Only after the reaction has reached equilibrium.",
          "When exactly half of the reactants are gone.",
          "Five minutes after the reaction has finished."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The initial rate is the rate at the moment the reactants are mixed, before the concentration of reactants has had a chance to decrease significantly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $0.60$ moles of a product are formed in a $2.0$ L container over $30$ seconds, what is the average rate of reaction?",
        "options": [
          "0.010 M/s",
          "0.020 M/s",
          "0.30 M/s",
          "0.60 M/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, find the change in molarity: $0.60 \\text{ mol} / 2.0 \\text{ L} = 0.30 \\text{ M}$. Then divide by time: $0.30 \\text{ M} / 30 \\text{ s} = 0.010 \\text{ M/s}$."
