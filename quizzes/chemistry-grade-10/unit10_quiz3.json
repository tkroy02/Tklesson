    "topic": "Measuring and representing heat change",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In thermodynamics, 'Enthalpy' ($H$) is best defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The total heat content of a system at constant pressure.",
          "The measure of disorder or randomness in a system.",
          "The speed at which a chemical reaction occurs.",
          "The total number of moles of gas in a container."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy accounts for internal energy plus the product of pressure and volume. In most chemistry contexts, $\\Delta H$ represents the heat exchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$) for a reaction is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta H = H_{products} - H_{reactants}$",
          "$\\Delta H = H_{reactants} - H_{products}$",
          "$\\Delta H = H_{products} + H_{reactants}$",
          "$\\Delta H = H_{products} \\times H_{reactants}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like all 'delta' values in science, it is the final state (products) minus the initial state (reactants)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction has a $\\Delta H$ of $+150$ kJ, what does this indicate about the process?",
        "options": [
          "The reaction is endothermic and absorbs heat.",
          "The reaction is exothermic and releases heat.",
          "The reaction is spontaneous and releases light.",
          "The reaction destroyed energy during the process."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A positive $\\Delta H$ means the products have more enthalpy than the reactants, meaning energy was taken in from the surroundings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $CH_{4} + 2O_{2} \\rightarrow CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O$ where $\\Delta H = -890$ kJ, the heat is:",
        "options": [
          "Released as a product of the reaction.",
          "Absorbed as a reactant of the reaction.",
          "Used to break the bonds of the products.",
          "Not involved in the reaction at all."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative $\\Delta H$ represents an exothermic reaction, meaning heat is a product and is given off to the environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a potential energy diagram for an **exothermic** reaction, the product line is:",
        "options": [
          "Lower than the reactant line.",
          "Higher than the reactant line.",
          "At the same level as the reactant line.",
          "At the very top of the activation energy peak."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because energy is released, the products end up at a lower potential energy state than the reactants started at."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard unit used to measure molar enthalpy changes in chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "kJ/mol",
          "Molarity",
          "Grams/mL",
          "Atmospheres"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy is typically measured in kilojoules (kJ) per mole of substance reacted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a thermochemical equation, where would you place the energy value for an **endothermic** reaction?",
        "options": [
          "On the reactant (left) side.",
          "On the product (right) side.",
          "Above the reaction arrow only.",
          "It is never written in the equation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In endothermic reactions, energy is 'consumed,' so it is treated like a reactant: $A + B + \\text{energy} \\rightarrow C$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for a reaction with $\\Delta H = -50$ kJ?",
        "options": [
          "The bonds formed in the products are stronger/more stable than those in the reactants.",
          "The surroundings will feel colder after the reaction.",
          "The reactants have less energy than the products.",
          "Energy was absorbed from the environment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exothermic reactions produce more stable bonds, releasing the excess energy as heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the coefficients in a balanced thermochemical equation, the $\\Delta H$ value will:",
        "options": [
          "Double",
          "Stay the same",
          "Halve",
          "Become zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy is an extensive property; if you react twice as much material, twice as much heat is exchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents a 'Heat of Combustion'?",
        "options": [
          "The $\\Delta H$ for the complete burning of one mole of a substance.",
          "The energy required to melt one mole of a solid.",
          "The heat absorbed when a compound is formed from its elements.",
          "The energy released when an acid neutralizes a base."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat of combustion refers specifically to the enthalpy change during a combustion reaction involving oxygen."
