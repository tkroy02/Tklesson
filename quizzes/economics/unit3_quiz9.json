        "question": "A surplus in a market occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied",
          "Quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded",
          "Supply and demand are perfectly balanced",
          "Prices are below equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A surplus (excess supply) occurs when the quantity that producers are willing to supply at the current price exceeds the quantity that consumers are willing to buy."
      },

          "Prices are above equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A shortage (excess demand) occurs when the quantity that consumers want to buy at the current price exceeds the quantity that producers are willing to supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When there is a surplus in a market, we would expect:",
        "options": [
          "Prices to rise toward equilibrium",
          "Prices to fall toward equilibrium",
          "No change in price",
          "Increased demand automatically"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A surplus creates downward pressure on prices as sellers compete to sell their excess inventory, moving the market toward equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When there is a shortage in a market, we would expect:",
        "options": [
          "Prices to rise toward equilibrium",
          "Prices to fall toward equilibrium",
          "No change in price",
          "Decreased supply automatically"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A shortage creates upward pressure on prices as buyers compete for limited goods, moving the market toward equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price ceiling set below the equilibrium price will create:",
        "options": [
          "A surplus",
          "A shortage",
          "Market equilibrium",
          "No effect on the market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding price ceiling set below equilibrium prevents price from rising to clear the market, resulting in a persistent shortage (excess demand)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price floor set above the equilibrium price will create:",
        "options": [
          "A surplus",
          "A shortage",
          "Market equilibrium",
          "Lower prices for consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A binding price floor set above equilibrium prevents price from falling to clear the market, resulting in a persistent surplus (excess supply)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a surplus, producers are likely to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production further",
          "Build up inventories and reduce prices",
          "Raise prices to increase revenue",
          "Exit the market immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Facing unsold inventory during a surplus, producers typically accumulate stock and eventually lower prices to stimulate demand and clear the market."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a shortage, consumers are likely to experience:",
        "options": [
          "Lower prices and abundant supply",
          "Long lines, waiting lists, or rationing",
          "Decreased quality of products",
          "Immediate government intervention"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shortages lead to visible symptoms like long lines, waiting lists, empty shelves, and sometimes non-price rationing mechanisms as demand exceeds supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government imposes a price ceiling on rental apartments below the market equilibrium, the result will be:",
        "options": [
          "A surplus of available apartments",
          "A shortage of available apartments",
          "No change in the rental market",
          "Higher quality apartments"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling below equilibrium creates a shortage - more people want apartments at the lower price than landlords are willing to supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The minimum wage is an example of a price floor that can create:",
        "options": [
          "A shortage of workers",
          "A surplus of workers (unemployment)",
          "Market equilibrium in labor markets",
          "Automatic wage increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wage for low-skilled labor, it can create a surplus of workers (unemployment) as quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a free market, the natural response to a surplus is:",
        "options": [
          "Government purchase of excess supply",
          "Price decreases that continue indefinitely",
          "Price competition that drives prices down toward equilibrium",
          "Producers permanently reducing output"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Market forces naturally correct surpluses through price competition - sellers lower prices until quantity demanded increases and quantity supplied decreases to reach equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Black markets often emerge when:",
        "options": [
          "There is a surplus of goods",
          "Price ceilings create persistent shortages",
          "Markets are in equilibrium",
          "Prices are falling rapidly"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When price ceilings create shortages, black markets often develop where goods are sold illegally at higher prices to satisfy the excess demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a sudden increase in demand creates a shortage, the market adjustment process involves:",
        "options": [
          "Prices falling to eliminate the shortage",
          "Prices rising to eliminate the shortage",
          "Government setting new prices",
          "Producers immediately increasing supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shortages create competitive bidding that drives prices up, which simultaneously reduces quantity demanded and increases quantity supplied until equilibrium is restored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A persistent surplus indicates that:",
        "options": [
          "The market price is below equilibrium",
          "The market price is above equilibrium",
          "Supply and demand are balanced",
          "Government intervention is unnecessary"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A persistent surplus suggests the price is being maintained above the equilibrium level, preventing the natural market adjustment process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a shortage, the 'rationing function' of prices is disrupted because:",
        "options": [
          "Prices are too high to allocate goods efficiently",
          "Prices cannot rise to allocate scarce goods to those most willing to pay",
          "Everyone can afford the goods at current prices",
          "Supply automatically increases to meet demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When prices are prevented from rising during shortages, they cannot perform their rationing function of allocating goods to those who value them most (as shown by willingness to pay)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If agricultural price supports keep farm prices above equilibrium, the government often must:",
        "options": [
          "Ration food to consumers",
          "Purchase and store the surplus production",
          "Import additional food supplies",
          "Subsidize consumer purchases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price floors in agriculture typically require government purchase of surplus production to maintain the above-equilibrium price, often leading to large stockpiles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main difference between temporary and persistent disequilibrium is that:",
        "options": [
          "Temporary disequilibrium corrects through price adjustments, while persistent disequilibrium involves price controls",
          "Only temporary disequilibrium affects markets",
          "Persistent disequilibrium always benefits consumers",
          "Temporary disequilibrium requires government intervention"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temporary disequilibrium is quickly corrected by market price adjustments, while persistent disequilibrium typically results from government price controls that prevent market clearing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a housing market with rent control (price ceiling), landlords may respond by:",
        "options": [
          "Building more rental units",
          "Reducing maintenance and quality",
          "Lowering rents further",
          "Increasing tenant services"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With rents artificially low due to price ceilings, landlords have less incentive to maintain properties, often leading to deterioration of housing quality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the 1970s gasoline shortages in the US, non-price rationing methods included:",
        "options": [
          "Automatic price increases",
          "Odd-even license plate purchasing systems",
          "Increased production by oil companies",
          "Government gasoline distribution"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With price controls preventing market clearing, non-price rationing methods like odd-even day systems based on license plate numbers were used to allocate scarce gasoline."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental problem with persistent disequilibrium is that it:",
        "options": [
          "Prevents markets from allocating resources efficiently",
          "Always leads to higher prices eventually",
          "Eliminates the need for consumer choice",
          "Guarantees equal distribution of goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Persistent disequilibrium prevents prices from performing their essential functions of rationing scarce resources and signaling relative scarcity, leading to inefficient allocation and wasted resources."

        "90": "Excellent! You thoroughly understand market disequilibrium and can analyze the causes and consequences of surpluses and shortages.",
        "70": "Good work! You understand the basic concepts but review how price controls create persistent disequilibrium and the various market responses to shortages and surpluses.",
        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: Surplus = quantity supplied > quantity demanded; Shortage = quantity demanded > quantity supplied; Markets naturally adjust through price changes unless prevented by controls.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that surpluses occur when prices are too high, shortages when prices are too low, and markets naturally move toward equilibrium unless government intervention prevents price adjustments."
