      {

        "question": "Identify the coefficient of price-elasticity of demand when the percentage increase in the quantity of a commodity demanded is smaller than the percentage fall in its price.",
        "options": ["Equal to 1", "Greater than 1", "Less than 1", "0"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If quantity demanded increases by a smaller percentage than the percentage fall in price, demand is inelastic, so elasticity coefficient is less than 1 (in absolute value)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The “Point of inflection” comes in which stage of the law of variable proportions?",
        "options": ["Stage I", "Stage II", "Stage III", "Stage IV"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stage I (increasing returns) is where TP increases at an increasing rate initially, then at a decreasing rate after the point of inflection (where MP is maximum)."

        "options": ["Less than unity", "Greater than unity", "Equal to unity", "Zero"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Durable goods (e.g., cars, appliances) typically have elastic demand (greater than 1) because they are postponable and often have substitutes."
