        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: the main factor payment categories, how to move from GDP to National Income, and the differences between various income measures.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that the income approach sums all factor payments (wages, rent, interest, profit) and requires adjustments for depreciation, indirect taxes, and foreign income to reconcile with GDP."
