        "question": "A decrease in demand causes the equilibrium price to ________.",
        "options": ["Rise", "Fall", "Remain constant", "Indeterminate"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A decrease in demand shifts the demand curve leftward, leading to a lower equilibrium price (assuming supply remains unchanged)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The price of a product falls by 10% and its demand rises by 30%. The elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": ["10%", "30%", "3", "1"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Price elasticity of demand = percentage change in quantity demanded / percentage change in price = 30% / 10% = 3."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the aspect of taxation which is related to normative economics:",

          "Definition of tax"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Normative economics deals with value judgments (what ought to be). Equity of tax involves fairness judgments, which are normative."

        "question": "If elasticity of demand is very low, it shows that the commodity is:",
        "options": ["A necessity", "A luxury", "A merit good", "A demerit good"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Low price elasticity (inelastic demand) typically indicates a necessity—consumers buy roughly the same quantity even if the price changes."
