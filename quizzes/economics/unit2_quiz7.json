      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good when it:",
        "options": [
          "Can produce more of the good than other countries",
          "Has the lowest opportunity cost of producing that good",
          "Uses the most advanced technology for that good",
          "Has the largest domestic market for that good"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage is determined solely by opportunity cost - the country that gives up the least of other goods to produce a particular good has the comparative advantage in that good."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental basis for mutually beneficial trade is:",
        "options": [
          "Absolute advantage in different goods",
          "Differences in comparative advantage",
          "Identical production costs",
          "Government trade agreements"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Differences in comparative advantage (opportunity costs) create the potential for gains from trade. Even if one country has absolute advantage in everything, both can benefit when they specialize according to comparative advantage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country A: 1 unit of cloth = 2 units of wine. Country B: 1 unit of cloth = 3 units of wine. Which country has comparative advantage in cloth?",
        "options": [
          "Country A",
          "Country B",
          "Both countries",
          "Neither country"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Country A gives up only 2 wine to produce 1 cloth, while Country B gives up 3 wine. Since Country A has lower opportunity cost for cloth, it has comparative advantage in cloth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage demonstrates that:",
        "options": [
          "Only countries with absolute advantage should trade",
          "Trade can benefit all countries regardless of absolute productivity",
          "Trade always benefits rich countries at the expense of poor ones",
          "Countries should be self-sufficient in essential goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ricardo showed that differences in comparative advantage allow all countries to benefit from trade, even if one country is more productive in all goods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country X's opportunity cost for cars is 2 trucks, and Country Y's is 4 trucks, which country should specialize in car production?",
        "options": [
          "Country X",
          "Country Y",
          "Both countries",
          "Neither country"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Country X has lower opportunity cost for cars (2 trucks vs 4 trucks), so Country X has comparative advantage in cars and should specialize in car production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'law of comparative advantage' states that:",
        "options": [
          "Countries should export goods they produce most efficiently",
          "Total output is maximized when countries specialize according to opportunity costs",
          "Trade benefits only the more productive country",
          "Opportunity costs are irrelevant in modern trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The law of comparative advantage states that world output is maximized when each country specializes in producing goods where it has the lowest opportunity cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country can have comparative advantage in a good even if it:",
        "options": [
          "Has absolute disadvantage in that good",
          "Has identical productivity to other countries",
          "Has no natural resources",
          "Does not currently produce that good"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage depends on opportunity costs, not absolute productivity. A country can be less productive in all goods but still have comparative advantage in some goods where its productivity disadvantage is smallest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To determine comparative advantage, you need to compare:",
        "options": [
          "Total production levels between countries",
          "Resource endowments of each country",
          "Opportunity cost ratios between countries",
          "Labor costs in different industries"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage is determined by comparing the opportunity cost of producing one good in terms of another good across different countries."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two countries have identical opportunity cost ratios:",
        "options": [
          "Substantial trade will occur",
          "No basis for mutually beneficial trade exists",
          "Both countries have comparative advantage in all goods",
          "Only one country can benefit from trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When opportunity costs are identical, no comparative advantage differences exist, so no mutually beneficial trade based on specialization is possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The classic Ricardo example of England and Portugal trading cloth and wine demonstrates that:",
        "options": [
          "Portugal should not trade since it's more productive in both",
          "Both countries benefit by specializing according to comparative advantage",
          "Absolute advantage determines all trade patterns",
          "Trade benefits only the less productive country"
        ],
        "explanation": "Ricardo showed that even though Portugal had absolute advantage in both goods, both countries benefited when Portugal specialized in wine (its greater comparative advantage) and England specialized in cloth (its smaller comparative disadvantage).",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When countries specialize according to comparative advantage, world production:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases due to transportation costs",
          "Increases due to more efficient resource allocation",
          "Remains unchanged but is redistributed",
          "Becomes concentrated in wealthy countries"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Specialization according to comparative advantage allows global resources to be allocated to their most productive uses across countries, increasing total world output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A doctor who is better at both medicine and typing than her secretary should:",
        "options": [
          "Do both tasks herself",
          "Specialize in medicine and hire the secretary for typing",
          "Split time equally between both tasks",
          "Fire the secretary and type herself"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Even with absolute advantage in both, the doctor has greater comparative advantage in medicine (higher opportunity cost for typing), so she should specialize in medicine and trade for typing services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comparative advantage explains why:",
        "options": [
          "High-wage countries can compete with low-wage countries",
          "All trade benefits flow to developed countries",
          "Countries should produce everything they consume",
          "Productivity differences eliminate trade opportunities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage explains how high-wage countries can successfully export goods to low-wage countries by specializing in goods where they have the greatest productivity advantage (lowest opportunity cost)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country A: 1 computer = 5 phones, and Country B: 1 computer = 3 phones, which country has comparative advantage in phones?",
        "options": [
          "Country A",
          "Country B",
          "Both countries",
          "Neither country"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For phones: Country A's opportunity cost is 1/5 computer per phone, Country B's is 1/3 computer per phone. Country A has lower opportunity cost for phones (0.2 computers vs 0.33 computers), so Country A actually has comparative advantage in phones. Let me recalculate: Country A gives up 5 phones for 1 computer, so 1 phone = 0.2 computers. Country B gives up 3 phones for 1 computer, so 1 phone = 0.33 computers. Country A has lower opportunity cost for phones. The correct answer should be A."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The gains from comparative advantage come from:",
        "options": [
          "Eliminating all transportation costs",
          "More efficient global resource allocation",
          "Reducing wages in all countries",
          "Making opportunity costs identical worldwide"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The gains from trade based on comparative advantage come from allocating the world's resources to their most productive uses across countries, increasing total global output."

          "The lowest production costs",
          "The largest domestic market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Countries maximize benefits by exporting goods where they have comparative advantage and importing goods where they have comparative disadvantage (higher opportunity cost)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comparative advantage can change over time due to:",

          "Identical technologies worldwide",
          "No transportation costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The basic Ricardian model assumes constant opportunity costs (linear PPFs), though more advanced models incorporate increasing opportunity costs (bowed-out PPFs)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the opportunity cost of producing wheat is lower in Canada than in Japan, then:",
        "options": [
          "Canada should export wheat to Japan",
          "Japan should export wheat to Canada",
          "Both countries should be self-sufficient in wheat",
          "No trade in wheat will occur"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since Canada has lower opportunity cost for wheat (comparative advantage), it should specialize in wheat production and export wheat to Japan, while Japan specializes in other goods."
