        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Balance of Payments uses double-entry bookkeeping - every transaction creates both a credit and debit entry, so the total BOP always equals zero theoretically."

        ],
        "explanation": "Current Account + Capital Account + Financial Account = 0. So -$150B + Capital Account + $120B = 0, therefore Capital Account = +$30 billion.",
