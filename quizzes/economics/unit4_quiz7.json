    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price elasticity of supply (PES) measures:",
        "options": [
          "How quantity demanded responds to price changes",
          "How quantity supplied responds to price changes",
          "How demand responds to income changes",
          "How supply responds to cost changes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price elasticity of supply measures the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price - it shows how responsive producers are to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The formula for price elasticity of supply is:",
        "options": [
          "% change in quantity demanded / % change in price",
          "% change in quantity supplied / % change in price",
          "% change in price / % change in quantity supplied",
          "Change in quantity supplied / change in price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "PES = (% change in quantity supplied) / (% change in price). This measures how sensitive producers are to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Unlike demand elasticity, supply elasticity is typically:",
        "options": [
          "Always negative",
          "Always positive",
          "Always zero",
          "Always greater than 1"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Supply elasticity is generally positive because of the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied - higher prices encourage more production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If supply is perfectly inelastic, the supply curve is:",

          "2.50"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "PES = (% change in quantity supplied) / (% change in price) = 15% / 10% = 1.5"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Supply tends to be more elastic in the long run because:",
