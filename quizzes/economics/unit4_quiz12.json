      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A coffee shop owner notices that when she raises prices by 10%, her total revenue increases. What can she conclude about the price elasticity of demand for her coffee?",
        "options": [
          "Demand is elastic (PED > 1)",
          "Demand is inelastic (PED < 1)",
          "Demand is unit elastic (PED = 1)",
          "Demand is perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When price increases and total revenue increases, demand must be inelastic. The percentage decrease in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage increase in price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During an economic recession, a discount grocery chain sees its sales increase while premium grocery stores see sales decrease. What does this suggest about the income elasticity of demand for discount groceries?",
        "options": [
          "YED is positive and greater than 1",
          "YED is positive but less than 1",
          "YED is negative",
          "YED is zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When demand increases as income decreases, the good is an inferior good with negative income elasticity. Consumers switch from premium stores to discount stores during recessions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pharmaceutical company develops both a life-saving drug and a cosmetic drug. Which drug likely has more inelastic demand, and why?",
        "options": [
          "The cosmetic drug, because it has more substitutes",
          "The life-saving drug, because it's a necessity with no close substitutes",
          "Both have equally elastic demand",
          "The life-saving drug, because it's more expensive to produce"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Life-saving drugs have highly inelastic demand because they are necessities with no close substitutes. Consumers will pay almost any price when their health is at stake."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A university finds that when it raises tuition by 5%, enrollment decreases by only 2%. If the university wants to maximize revenue, what should it do?",
        "options": [
          "Lower tuition further",
          "Keep tuition unchanged",
          "Raise tuition further",
          "Offer more scholarships"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With inelastic demand (PED = 0.4), raising tuition increases total revenue because the percentage decrease in enrollment is smaller than the percentage increase in price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might electricity demand be more elastic in the long run than in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Because electricity prices always decrease over time",
          "Because consumers have time to invest in energy-efficient appliances and solar panels",
          "Because government regulates electricity prices",
          "Because electricity becomes less essential over time"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, consumers can make capital investments like energy-efficient appliances, insulation, or solar panels, making them less dependent on grid electricity and more responsive to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car manufacturer notices that when the price of its luxury sedan increases, demand for its economy model increases. What is the relationship between these two car models?",
        "options": [
          "They are complements",
          "They are substitutes",
          "They are unrelated",
          "They are inferior goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Positive cross-price elasticity indicates substitute goods. When the price of one increases, demand for the other increases as consumers switch to the more affordable alternative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Farmers often experience large price fluctuations for their crops from year to year. What does this suggest about the price elasticity of supply for agricultural products?",
        "options": [
          "Supply is highly elastic",
          "Supply is highly inelastic",
          "Supply is unit elastic",
          "Supply is perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Large price fluctuations with relatively stable quantities suggest inelastic supply. Agricultural supply is constrained by growing seasons and biological processes, making it difficult to quickly adjust production in response to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A company selling software notices that business customers are less price-sensitive than individual consumers. What does this imply about the price elasticity of demand for these two segments?",
        "options": [
          "Business demand is more elastic than consumer demand",
          "Business demand is more inelastic than consumer demand",
          "Both have the same elasticity",
          "Business demand is perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Business customers often have more inelastic demand because software may be essential for operations, represents a smaller portion of their budget, and switching costs are higher compared to individual consumers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why would a restaurant offer 'early bird' discounts but charge premium prices during peak dinner hours?",
        "options": [
          "Because food costs more to prepare early in the day",
          "Because demand elasticity differs by time of day",
          "Because they want to encourage unhealthy eating habits",
          "Because government requires different pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Demand is more elastic during off-peak hours (price-sensitive customers willing to eat early for discounts) and more inelastic during peak hours (customers less sensitive to price when they want to dine at popular times)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A city imposes a tax on hotel rooms. Hotel owners complain they cannot pass the full tax to consumers through higher prices. What does this suggest about the price elasticity of demand for hotel rooms?",
        "options": [
          "Demand is perfectly inelastic",
          "Demand is elastic",
          "Demand is unit elastic",
          "Demand is perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If hotels cannot fully pass the tax to consumers, demand must be elastic. With elastic demand, price increases lead to significant quantity decreases, so producers absorb some of the tax burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a gasoline price spike, why might the quantity demanded decrease more in the long run than in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Because people stop driving completely",
          "Because in the long run, consumers can buy more fuel-efficient cars or change commuting patterns",
          "Because gasoline becomes less necessary over time",
          "Because government imposes rationing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Demand becomes more elastic over time. In the long run, consumers can make significant adjustments like buying fuel-efficient vehicles, moving closer to work, or using public transportation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A study finds that when the price of cigarettes increases by 10%, consumption decreases by 4% among adults but by 8% among teenagers. What does this indicate?",
        "options": [
          "Adults have more elastic demand than teenagers",
          "Teenagers have more elastic demand than adults",
          "Both groups have equally elastic demand",
          "The study must be flawed"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Teenagers show more elastic demand (PED = 0.8) than adults (PED = 0.4), likely because teenagers have lower incomes and may be more sensitive to price changes, while addicted adults continue purchasing despite price increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might the demand for a specific brand of bottled water be more elastic than the demand for bottled water in general?",
        "options": [
          "Because all bottled water is identical",
          "Because there are many substitute brands available",
          "Because bottled water is a luxury good",
          "Because production costs vary by brand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While bottled water overall may have relatively inelastic demand, specific brands face elastic demand because consumers can easily switch to competing brands if prices rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A manufacturer observes that when raw material prices increase, they can easily substitute alternative materials without affecting product quality. What does this imply about their supply elasticity?",
        "options": [
          "Supply is more inelastic",
          "Supply is more elastic",
          "Supply is perfectly inelastic",
          "Supply elasticity is unaffected"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The ability to substitute inputs makes supply more elastic because producers can maintain production levels even when some input prices rise, making them more responsive to output price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why would a company continue heavy advertising for a well-established brand like Coca-Cola?",
        "options": [
          "Because they have excess marketing budget",
          "To maintain brand differentiation and keep demand relatively inelastic",
          "Because advertising has no effect on elasticity",
          "Because government requires constant advertising"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Continuous advertising maintains brand loyalty and perceived differentiation, keeping demand relatively inelastic compared to generic alternatives, allowing premium pricing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country's exports become more competitive when its currency depreciates. According to the Marshall-Lerner condition, this requires that:",
        "options": [
          "The sum of import and export demand elasticities is less than 1",
          "The sum of import and export demand elasticities is greater than 1",
          "Only export elasticity matters",
          "Only import elasticity matters"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Marshall-Lerner condition states that currency depreciation improves the trade balance if the sum of the absolute values of import and export demand elasticities exceeds 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During economic expansions, why do luxury car manufacturers typically see sales increase faster than economy car manufacturers?",
        "options": [
          "Because luxury cars have lower income elasticity",
          "Because luxury cars have higher income elasticity",
          "Because economy cars become inferior goods",
          "Because all car sales increase equally"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods have high income elasticity (YED > 1), meaning demand increases more than proportionally to income growth during economic expansions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A company selling printer ink at high prices while selling printers at low prices is using which elasticity concept?",
        "options": [
          "They don't understand elasticity",
          "The demand for printers is elastic while demand for ink is inelastic",
          "Both products have the same elasticity",
          "They want to lose money on printers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is 'razor and blades' pricing. Printers have elastic demand (many substitutes), while proprietary ink has inelastic demand (locked-in customers must buy compatible ink)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might a tax on luxury yachts generate less revenue than expected?",
        "options": [
          "Because yacht demand is perfectly inelastic",
          "Because yacht demand is highly elastic",
          "Because yacht manufacturers avoid taxes",
          "Because yachts are essential goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Luxury yachts have highly elastic demand because they are discretionary purchases with many substitutes (other luxury goods, different types of boats). When taxed, consumption decreases significantly, limiting revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental business insight from elasticity analysis is that successful pricing requires:",
        "options": [
          "Always setting the lowest possible price",
          "Always setting the highest possible price",
          "Understanding how different customer segments respond to price changes",
          "Ignoring customer price sensitivity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Elasticity analysis reveals that optimal pricing strategies depend on understanding how different market segments respond to price changes, allowing businesses to tailor prices to different demand elasticities."
