    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Natural Rate Hypothesis, primarily associated with Friedman and Phelps, posits that the long-run Phillips Curve is:",
        "options": [
          "Downward sloping, indicating a permanent trade-off",
          "Upward sloping, indicating worsening stagflation",
          "Vertical at the natural rate of unemployment",
          "Horizontal at the current rate of inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The core of the Natural Rate Hypothesis is that there is no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The economy returns to the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) in the long run, making the LRPC vertical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The natural rate of unemployment is primarily determined by:",
        "options": [
          "The current rate of inflation and monetary policy",
          "Frictional and structural factors in the labor market",
          "Cyclical fluctuations in aggregate demand",
          "The level of government spending and taxation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The natural rate is the unemployment rate that exists when the economy is at potential GDP. It is determined by structural, long-term factors like labor market institutions, demographics, and technology, not by short-term demand policies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, if the central bank persistently attempts to keep unemployment below the natural rate using expansionary policy, the most likely result is:",
        "options": [
          "A permanent decrease in unemployment with stable inflation",
          "Stagflation, with both high inflation and high unemployment",
          "Constantly accelerating inflation without a permanent drop in unemployment",
          "A leftward shift in the long-run Phillips Curve"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is the 'accelerationist' view. To keep unemployment below the natural rate, policymakers must continuously surprise the public with higher inflation. Once expectations adjust, unemployment returns to its natural rate, but now at a higher, accelerating rate of inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The vertical long-run Phillips Curve implies that in the long run, changes in the inflation rate are primarily caused by:",
        "options": [
          "Changes in the level of unemployment",
          "Changes in the growth rate of aggregate demand",
          "Supply shocks like oil price changes",
          "Changes in labor productivity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since unemployment is fixed at the natural rate in the long run (u = uⁿ), the Phillips Curve equation (π = πᵉ - β(u - uⁿ)) simplifies to π = πᵉ. Inflation in the long run is therefore a monetary phenomenon, driven by the growth of aggregate demand, which is controlled by factors like monetary policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) is essentially:",
        "options": [
          "The unemployment rate when inflation is zero",
          "A different name for the cyclical unemployment rate",
          "The practical equivalent of the natural rate of unemployment",
          "The unemployment rate that triggers a recession"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "NAIRU is the unemployment rate at which inflation is stable (non-accelerating). It is the operational definition of the natural rate of unemployment (uⁿ) used in policy analysis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Natural Rate Hypothesis, an unexpected increase in the money supply will:",
        "options": [
          "Reduce unemployment permanently below the natural rate",
          "Have no effect on either inflation or unemployment",
          "Reduce unemployment temporarily, but not in the long run",
          "Increase the natural rate of unemployment permanently"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the short run, with sticky prices and wages, an unexpected monetary expansion can lower real wages and stimulate hiring, reducing unemployment. In the long run, as expectations adjust, real wages return to their equilibrium level and unemployment returns to the natural rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The policy ineffectiveness proposition, stemming from rational expectations, suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "All government policies are useless",
          "Only fiscal policy can affect output and employment",
          "Systematic, anticipated monetary policy has no real effects in the short run",
          "Policies are only effective in the long run"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If people have rational expectations and a policy change is announced and understood, they will immediately adjust their price and wage demands. This means anticipated changes in aggregate demand will only change the price level, with no temporary effect on real output or unemployment, even in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause the long-run Phillips Curve to shift to the right?",
        "options": [
          "A temporary contractionary monetary policy",
          "An increase in the prevalence of unemployment benefits",
          "A surge in aggregate demand that raises inflation",
          "A temporary positive supply shock"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The LRPC is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment. An increase in unemployment benefits may reduce the incentive to search for jobs intensively, increasing frictional unemployment and thus raising the natural rate. This would shift the vertical LRPC to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The experience of 'stagflation' in the 1970s provided strong empirical support for:",
        "options": [
          "The original, downward-sloping Phillips Curve",
          "The Keynesian view of permanent policy trade-offs",
          "The Natural Rate Hypothesis",
          "The effectiveness of fiscal stimulus"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stagflation—the simultaneous occurrence of high inflation and high unemployment—was inconsistent with the original Phillips Curve trade-off. It was explained by the Natural Rate Hypothesis: adverse supply shocks and rising inflation expectations shifted the short-run Phillips curve upward, validating the idea of a vertical long-run curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long-run equilibrium of the economy, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "Actual inflation is always zero",
          "Actual inflation equals expected inflation",
          "The unemployment rate is always zero",
          "The short-run and long-run Phillips Curves are identical"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Long-run equilibrium is defined as a state where there are no surprises. Therefore, people's expectations of inflation (πᵉ) are on average correct, meaning actual inflation (π) must equal expected inflation (π = πᵉ)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main critique of the adaptive expectations approach, offered by the Rational Expectations school, is that it assumes people:",
        "options": [
          "Use all available information efficiently",
          "Make systematic, predictable forecasting errors",
          "Never learn from past mistakes",
          "Can perfectly foresee the future"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Under adaptive expectations, people only look at the past. If the government follows a systematic policy (e.g., always increasing money supply before an election), people with adaptive expectations would consistently be surprised. Rational expectations assumes people use all available information, including the understanding of policy rules, and thus would not make such systematic errors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country undergoes labor market reforms that make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers, the most likely impact on the long-run Phillips Curve is a:",
        "options": [
          "Shift to the left",
          "Shift to the right",
          "Movement along the curve",
          "Change in its slope from vertical to downward-sloping"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Such reforms would likely reduce frictional unemployment by improving the matching process in the labor market. This decreases the natural rate of unemployment (uⁿ), causing the vertical long-run Phillips Curve to shift to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Sacrifice Ratio' is most relevant in the context of:",
        "options": [
          "Expanding output beyond potential GDP",
          "The long-run relationship between inflation and growth",
          "Moving the economy along the long-run Phillips Curve",
          "The cost of reducing inflation in the short run"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The sacrifice ratio quantifies the cost of disinflation. It measures the cumulative loss in output or increase in unemployment required to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point. This cost arises due to the short-run trade-off described by the Phillips Curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The distinction between the short-run and long-run Phillips Curve fundamentally depends on the:",
        "options": [
          "Level of government debt",
          "Speed of adjustment of inflation expectations",
          "Size of the labor force",
          "Current account balance"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the short run, with sticky prices and slow-adjusting expectations (like adaptive expectations), a trade-off exists. In the long run, expectations fully adjust to match reality (π = πᵉ), eliminating the trade-off and making the curve vertical. The key is the adjustment of expectations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A key policy implication of the vertical long-run Phillips Curve is that central banks should primarily focus on:",
        "options": [
          "Minimizing the unemployment rate at all costs",
          "Managing inflation and anchoring inflation expectations",
          "Using monetary policy to fine-tune the natural rate of unemployment",
          "Targeting a specific, fixed rate of money supply growth"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since monetary policy cannot influence unemployment in the long run, its primary goal should be to maintain price stability. By credibly committing to a low inflation target, a central bank can anchor inflation expectations, which reduces the sacrifice ratio during economic adjustments and minimizes volatility."
