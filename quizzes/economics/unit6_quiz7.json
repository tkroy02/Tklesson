    "subject": "Economics",
    "topic": "Monopoly Pricing, Profit Maximization, Market Power, Elasticity and Pricing",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist maximizes profit by producing where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = MC$",
          "$MR = MC$",
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$TR$ is maximized"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Like all profit-maximizing firms, monopolists produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost ($MR = MC$), then charge the highest price consumers will pay for that quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the profit-maximizing output, a monopolist charges a price that is:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to marginal cost",
          "Greater than marginal cost",
          "Less than marginal cost",
          "Equal to average total cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since the monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve where $MR < P$, and produces where $MR = MC$, it follows that $P > MC$ at the optimal output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The monopolist's pricing power comes from:",
        "options": [
          "Being a price taker",
          "Lack of close substitutes and barriers to entry",
          "Perfect information in the market",
          "Having many competitors"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopoly power arises from the absence of close substitutes (making demand less elastic) and barriers to entry that prevent competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between price ($P$), marginal revenue ($MR$), and price elasticity of demand ($E_d$) for a monopolist is:",
        "options": [
          "$MR = P$",
          "$MR = P(1 + \\frac{1}{E_d})$",
          "$MR = P(1 - \\frac{1}{|E_d|})$",
          "$MR = \\frac{P}{E_d}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This formula $MR = P(1 - \\frac{1}{|E_d|})$ shows that $MR = P$ when $|E_d| = \\infty$ (perfect competition), and $MR < P$ when demand is less than perfectly elastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit-maximizing monopolist will always operate in the portion of the demand curve where:",
        "options": [
          "Demand is inelastic ($|E_d| < 1$)",
          "Demand is unit elastic ($|E_d| = 1$)",
          "Demand is elastic ($|E_d| > 1$)",
          "Marginal cost is decreasing"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When demand is inelastic, marginal revenue is negative. A profit-maximizing monopolist will always produce where $MR > 0$, which requires elastic demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist is currently producing where $MR > MC$, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase price and decrease output",
          "Decrease price and increase output",
          "Keep price and output unchanged",
          "Shut down operations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When $MR > MC$, producing additional units adds more to revenue than to cost, so the monopolist should lower price to sell more units and increase profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Lerner Index of monopoly power is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{P - MC}{P}$",
          "$\\frac{MR - MC}{P}$",
          "$\\frac{P - ATC}{P}$",
          "$\\frac{TR - TC}{Q}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Lerner Index $L = \\frac{P - MC}{P}$ measures the degree of monopoly power, ranging from 0 (perfect competition) to 1 (maximum monopoly power)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Lerner Index, monopoly power is greater when:",
        "options": [
          "Demand is more elastic",
          "Demand is less elastic",
          "Marginal cost is higher",
          "Fixed costs are lower"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Lerner Index equals $\\frac{1}{|E_d|}$, so monopoly power is inversely related to the price elasticity of demand - less elastic demand means greater pricing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopolist facing linear demand $P = 100 - 2Q$ and constant $MC = 20$, the profit-maximizing price is:",
        "options": [
          "$20$",
          "$40$",
          "$60$",
          "$80$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$MR = 100 - 4Q$. Set $MR = MC$: $100 - 4Q = 20$, so $Q = 20$. Then $P = 100 - 2(20) = 60$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist will never charge a price where:",
        "options": [
          "$P > ATC$",
          "$P > MC$",
          "Demand is inelastic",
          "$MR$ is negative"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A profit-maximizing monopolist always operates where demand is elastic ($|E_d| > 1$) because in the inelastic region, marginal revenue is negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist's marginal cost decreases, the profit-maximizing response is to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase price and decrease output",
          "Decrease price and increase output",
          "Keep price and output unchanged",
          "Increase both price and output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower marginal cost shifts the $MR = MC$ intersection to a higher quantity and lower price, increasing both consumer surplus and monopolist profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The monopolist's markup over marginal cost is determined by:",
        "options": [
          "The price elasticity of demand",
          "The level of fixed costs",
          "Government regulations",
          "The number of potential entrants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From the Lerner Index, $\\frac{P - MC}{P} = \\frac{1}{|E_d|}$, so the markup is inversely related to the price elasticity of demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand becomes more elastic, a monopolist will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase its markup over marginal cost",
          "Decrease its markup over marginal cost",
          "Keep the same markup",
          "Stop producing altogether"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More elastic demand means consumers are more price-sensitive, forcing the monopolist to set a price closer to marginal cost to maximize profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist earning economic profit in the short run:",
        "options": [
          "Will definitely lose it to new entrants in the long run",
          "Can maintain it in the long run due to barriers to entry",
          "Must share it with consumers through lower prices",
          "Will voluntarily reduce prices to normal profit levels"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unlike perfect competition, monopolists can maintain economic profits in the long run because barriers to entry prevent new firms from competing away those profits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopolist, total revenue is maximized when:",
        "options": [
          "$MR = MC$",
          "$MR = 0$",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$P = ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total revenue is maximized where marginal revenue equals zero. A profit-maximizing monopolist produces less than this quantity (where $MR = MC > 0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental reason monopoly leads to allocative inefficiency is that:",
        "options": [
          "Firms earn economic profits",
          "$P > MC$ at the profit-maximizing output",
          "Average costs are not minimized",
          "There's only one firm in the market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Allocative inefficiency occurs because $P > MC$, meaning the value consumers place on additional units exceeds the cost of producing them, but the monopolist doesn't produce these units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist could practice perfect price discrimination, it would produce where:",
        "options": [
          "$MR = MC$",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$MR = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With perfect price discrimination, the demand curve becomes the marginal revenue curve, so the profit-maximizing condition becomes $P = MC$, the allocatively efficient output level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist facing constant marginal cost and linear demand will set price:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to marginal cost",
          "Halfway between the demand curve intercept and marginal cost",
          "At the demand curve intercept",
          "At twice the marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With linear demand $P = a - bQ$ and constant $MC$, the profit-maximizing price is $P = \\frac{a + MC}{2}$ - exactly halfway between the maximum willingness to pay and marginal cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss from monopoly represents:",
        "options": [
          "The transfer from consumers to producers",
          "The economic profit earned by the monopolist",
          "The total surplus lost compared to perfect competition",
          "The fixed costs of production"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the reduction in total economic surplus (consumer surplus + producer surplus) that results from the monopolist's output restriction below the competitive level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a perfectly competitive market, a single-price monopolist produces:",
        "options": [
          "More output at a lower price",
          "The same output at a higher price",
          "Less output at a higher price",
          "More output at a higher price"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The monopolist restricts output and charges higher prices than would prevail under perfect competition to maximize profits, creating deadweight loss."
