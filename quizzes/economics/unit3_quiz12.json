    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at the current market price, this creates:",
        "options": [
          "A surplus (excess supply)",
          "A shortage (excess demand)",
          "Market equilibrium",
          "Price stability"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A shortage occurs when consumers want to buy more than producers are willing to sell at the current price, indicating the price is below equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key difference between market demand and aggregate demand is that:",
        "options": [
          "Market demand refers to a single good, while aggregate demand refers to all goods and services in the economy",
          "Market demand is always elastic, while aggregate demand is always inelastic",
          "Market demand includes government spending, while aggregate demand does not",
          "There is no difference - the terms are interchangeable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Market demand analyzes consumer behavior for a specific product, while aggregate demand examines total spending across the entire economy at different price levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a competitive market, a persistent surplus indicates that:",
        "options": [
          "The market price is below equilibrium",
          "The market price is above equilibrium",
          "Supply and demand are perfectly balanced",
          "Government intervention is unnecessary"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A persistent surplus suggests the price is being maintained above the equilibrium level, preventing the natural market adjustment process through price decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Aggregate supply differs from market supply in that aggregate supply:",
        "options": [
          "Shows the total production of all goods and services at different price levels",
          "Applies only to agricultural products",
          "Is always perfectly elastic",
          "Does not consider production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aggregate supply represents the total quantity of all goods and services that producers are willing to supply at different overall price levels in the economy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a shortage exists in a free market, the natural adjustment process involves:",
        "options": [
          "Prices falling to eliminate the shortage",
          "Prices rising to eliminate the shortage",
          "Government rationing of goods",
          "Producers voluntarily reducing prices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shortages create competitive bidding among buyers that drives prices upward, which simultaneously reduces quantity demanded and increases quantity supplied until equilibrium is restored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The aggregate demand curve slopes downward because of:",
        "options": [
          "The wealth effect, interest rate effect, and international trade effect",
          "Only the substitution effect",
          "Producer profit maximization",
          "Government fiscal policy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aggregate demand slopes downward due to three effects: wealth effect (real balances), interest rate effect, and international trade effect (net exports)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the market price for apartments is below the equilibrium price, we would expect to see:",
        "options": [
          "Vacant apartments and lower rents",
          "Long waiting lists and potential black markets",
          "Builders constructing more apartments",
          "Immediate market adjustment to equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Below-equilibrium prices create shortages, leading to visible symptoms like waiting lists, and sometimes black markets where apartments are rented illegally at higher prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between individual market demands and aggregate demand is that:",
        "options": [
          "Aggregate demand is simply the sum of all individual market demands",
          "They are completely unrelated concepts",
          "Aggregate demand only considers consumer spending, ignoring individual markets",
          "Individual market demands determine microeconomics, while aggregate demand determines macroeconomics"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Individual market demands analyze specific products (microeconomics), while aggregate demand examines total spending in the entire economy (macroeconomics), though they are related through the composition of GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When agricultural price supports keep prices above equilibrium, the typical result is:",
        "options": [
          "Shortages and rationing",
          "Government purchases of surplus production",
          "Automatic price decreases",
          "Increased consumer consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price floors in agriculture create persistent surpluses that often require government intervention, such as purchasing and storing excess production to maintain the above-equilibrium price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run aggregate supply curve slopes upward because:",
        "options": [
          "Higher price levels increase production costs",
          "Higher price levels make production more profitable in the short run",
          "Consumers buy less when prices are higher",
          "Government controls all production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the short run, some costs are fixed, so when overall price levels rise, producers can earn higher profits by increasing output, making them willing to supply more."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A market surplus creates pressure for:",
        "options": [

          "Increased production",
          "Government subsidies"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Surpluses create competitive pressure among sellers to dispose of excess inventory, driving prices downward toward the equilibrium level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The components of aggregate demand include:",
        "options": [
          "Only consumer spending",
          "Consumer spending, investment, government spending, and net exports",
          "Only business investment",
          "Supply-side factors only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Aggregate demand consists of Consumption (C) + Investment (I) + Government Spending (G) + Net Exports (X-M) - the standard GDP expenditure approach."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumers suddenly prefer electric vehicles over gasoline cars, the gasoline car market will experience:",
        "options": [
          "A surplus at the original price",
          "A shortage at the original price",
          "No change in market conditions",
          "Immediate price increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decreased consumer preference shifts the demand curve leftward, creating a surplus at the original price as quantity supplied exceeds the new, lower quantity demanded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because:",
        "options": [
          "Prices are fixed in the long run",
          "The economy's productive capacity is determined by real factors, not price levels",
          "Government controls all production",
          "Consumer demand becomes perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "explanation": "In the long run, the economy's output is determined by available resources, technology, and institutions - real factors that aren't affected by the price level.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a shortage, non-price rationing mechanisms may include:",
        "options": [
          "First-come-first-served, waiting lists, or seller preferences",
          "Automatic price decreases",
          "Government production mandates",
          "Consumer income increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When prices cannot rise to allocate scarce goods, alternative rationing methods emerge, such as queues, waiting lists, lotteries, or seller discrimination."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between market supply and aggregate supply is that:",
        "options": [
          "Aggregate supply is the horizontal sum of all market supplies",
          "They are identical concepts",
          "Market supply determines macroeconomics, while aggregate supply determines microeconomics",
          "Aggregate supply only applies to manufacturing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aggregate supply represents the economy's total production capacity, derived from combining the supply capabilities across all individual markets and sectors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If technological improvement increases productivity across the entire economy, this would:",
        "options": [
          "Shift aggregate supply to the left",
          "Shift aggregate supply to the right",
          "Only affect individual market supplies",
          "Have no effect on production capacity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economy-wide technological progress increases productive capacity, shifting both short-run and long-run aggregate supply curves to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price ceiling that creates a persistent shortage typically leads to:",
        "options": [
          "Improved product quality",
          "Black markets and reduced product quality",
          "Increased producer investment",
          "Automatic market correction"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price ceilings often reduce quality (since producers cut costs to maintain profitability) and encourage illegal markets where goods sell at higher prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental difference in analyzing individual markets versus the aggregate economy is that:",
        "options": [
          "Individual markets focus on relative prices, while aggregate analysis focuses on the general price level",
          "There is no meaningful difference",
          "Only individual markets use supply and demand analysis",
          "Aggregate analysis ignores price mechanisms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Microeconomics examines how relative prices allocate resources among different goods, while macroeconomics studies how the overall price level affects total output and employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When both aggregate demand and aggregate supply increase, the effect on the price level is:",
        "options": [
          "Definitely inflationary",
          "Definitely deflationary",
          "Ambiguous - depends on relative magnitudes",
          "Always neutral"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increased aggregate demand pushes prices up, while increased aggregate supply pushes prices down. The net effect on the price level depends on which shift is larger."
