      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the 'point of inflection':",
        "options": [
          "MP is maximum",
          "AP is maximum",
          "TP is maximum",
          "AP is minimum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The point of inflection on the total product curve is where total product stops increasing at an increasing rate and starts increasing at a decreasing rate; at this point, marginal product reaches its maximum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Returns to Scale refers to the production function where:",
        "options": [
          "All factors are fixed",
          "Some factors are fixed and others are variable",
          "All factors are variable",
          "The firm is unable to employ more workers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Returns to scale analyze what happens to output when all inputs (factors) are increased proportionately in the long run, when all factors are variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Diminishing returns to scale indicate that:",
        "options": [
          "Output increases less than proportionately to an increase in all factors",
          "Output increases more than proportionately to an increase in all factors",
          "Output remains unchanged when all factors are increased",
          "Output decreases when all factors are increased"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diminishing returns to scale occur when a proportional increase in all inputs leads to a less‑than‑proportional increase in output."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rise in supply and demand in equal proportion will result in:",
        "options": [
          "Increase in equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity",
          "Decrease in equilibrium price and increase in equilibrium quantity",
          "No change in equilibrium price and increase in equilibrium quantity",
          "Increase in equilibrium price and no change in equilibrium quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If both demand and supply increase equally (same rightward shift), equilibrium quantity rises, but price remains unchanged because both shifts counteract each other's price effect."
