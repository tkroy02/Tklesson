    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the fundamental economic problem?",
        "options": [
          "How societies can fully satisfy all human wants using innovation",
          "How to allocate limited resources among unlimited wants",
          "How to expand the money supply to support growth",
          "How producers can eliminate the need for trade-offs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Scarcity arises because human wants exceed available resources. As a result, societies must decide how to allocate limited inputs among competing uses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is scarcity in economic terms?",
        "options": [
          "A condition in which resources temporarily run out due to market shortages",
          "The situation where available resources cannot satisfy all human wants",
          "A case where producers restrict output to raise prices artificially",
          "An outcome where high prices prevent consumers from purchasing goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Scarcity refers to the universal condition in which resources are insufficient to satisfy every possible want. This is not the same as temporary shortages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Opportunity cost is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The value of all alternatives not chosen when a decision is made",
          "The value of the next best alternative forgone",
          "The difference between total cost and total revenue",
          "The monetary expenditure recorded for a chosen option"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the value of the *next best* alternative given up, not the value of all possible forgone options."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of absolute scarcity?",

          "A finite mineral deposit that cannot be replenished once depleted",
          "A shortage of skilled labor during rapid economic expansion",
          "An economy experiencing insufficient circulating money"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Absolute scarcity refers to physically finite resources—such as a mineral deposit with a fixed, exhaustible quantity—regardless of price or demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Relative scarcity occurs when:",

          "Demand exceeds supply even if the resource is not physically limited",
          "Production processes break down entirely due to inefficiency",
          "A market has insufficient buyers to justify continued output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Relative scarcity arises when supply is insufficient *at prevailing prices*, even though the resource itself may not be inherently finite."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The three basic economic questions that every system must answer are:",
        "options": [

          "Production, distribution, and consumption in fixed proportions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "All economic systems must determine what goods to produce, the methods of production, and the distribution of output across the population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which form of scarcity applies uniformly to all people?",

          "Financial scarcity, because income is always limited",
          "Skill scarcity, since individuals cannot master all abilities",
          "Time scarcity, because everyone has exactly $24$ hours per day",
          "Resource scarcity, because natural resources are universally limited"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Time scarcity is universal; regardless of wealth, status, or skill, every person has only $24$ hours daily."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A workshop can produce Item X (takes 3 hours, yields $24 profit) or Item Y (takes 6 hours, yields $60 profit). What is the profit per labor hour for Item X?",

    "$6.00",
    "$7.50",
    "$8.00",
    "$9.00"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Profit per hour for Item X = $24 ÷ 3 = $8.00. However, only one option matches the correct value: $8.00."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Economics as a course of study exists fundamentally because of:",
  "options": [
    "Scarcity",
    "Leadership",
    "Society",
    "Resources"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Economics exists because resources are limited relative to human wants. Scarcity forces individuals and societies to make choices, creating the need to study allocation, incentives, and decision-making."

    "Access to an office space required to perform job duties",
    "All the listed options"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Implicit benefits are non-monetary or indirect advantages, such as job security, skills gained, or personal satisfaction. Monetary salaries and immediate promotions are explicit benefits."

          "Administrative and bureaucratic costs alone"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost includes both financial and non-financial effects, such as social outcomes, externalities, and equity considerations."

        "question": "Which statement about scarcity is FALSE?",
        "options": [
          "Scarcity can be eliminated entirely through technological progress",
          "Scarcity forces individuals and societies to make trade-offs",
          "Scarcity applies to all economic actors regardless of wealth",
          "Scarcity creates opportunity costs whenever choices are made"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Technology can reduce scarcity but cannot eliminate it because human wants continue to expand."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Another term for opportunity cost is:",
  "options": [
    "Real cost",
    "Money cost",
    "Choice",
    "Scale of preference"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Opportunity cost is sometimes called the 'real cost' because it reflects the value of the next best alternative forgone, not just monetary outlay."

          "The cost of producing one additional unit of output",
          "The average cost obtained by dividing total cost by quantity",
          "A firm's fixed operational cost independent of output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Marginal cost is the incremental cost of producing one more unit, not the average or total cost."

          "Whether producing an additional unit is worthwhile",
          "A firm's fixed cost structure",
          "Its long-run share of the market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Production should continue while marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost; once MC > MB, further production reduces net gain."
