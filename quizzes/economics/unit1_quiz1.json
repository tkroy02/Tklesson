    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the fundamental economic problem?",
        "options": [
          "How societies can fully satisfy all human wants using innovation",
          "How to allocate limited resources among unlimited wants",
          "How to expand the money supply to support growth",
          "How producers can eliminate the need for trade-offs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Scarcity arises because human wants exceed available resources. As a result, societies must decide how to allocate limited inputs among competing uses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is scarcity in economic terms?",
        "options": [
          "A condition in which resources temporarily run out due to market shortages",
          "The situation where available resources cannot satisfy all human wants",
          "A case where producers restrict output to raise prices artificially",
          "An outcome where high prices prevent consumers from purchasing goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Scarcity refers to the universal condition in which resources are insufficient to satisfy every possible want. This is not the same as temporary shortages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Opportunity cost is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The value of all alternatives not chosen when a decision is made",
          "The value of the next best alternative forgone",
          "The difference between total cost and total revenue",
          "The monetary expenditure recorded for a chosen option"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the value of the *next best* alternative given up, not the value of all possible forgone options."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of absolute scarcity?",
        "options": [
          "A city where demand outpaces available rental homes due to population growth",
          "A finite mineral deposit that cannot be replenished once depleted",
          "A shortage of skilled labor during rapid economic expansion",
          "An economy experiencing insufficient circulating money"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Absolute scarcity refers to physically finite resources—such as a mineral deposit with a fixed, exhaustible quantity—regardless of price or demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Relative scarcity occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "A resource is fully depleted and cannot be replenished",
          "Demand exceeds supply even if the resource is not physically limited",
          "Production processes break down entirely due to inefficiency",
          "A market has insufficient buyers to justify continued output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Relative scarcity arises when supply is insufficient *at prevailing prices*, even though the resource itself may not be inherently finite."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The three basic economic questions that every system must answer are:",

          "Production, distribution, and consumption in fixed proportions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "All economic systems must determine what goods to produce, the methods of production, and the distribution of output across the population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which form of scarcity applies uniformly to all people?",
        "options": [
          "Financial scarcity, because income is always limited",
          "Skill scarcity, since individuals cannot master all abilities",
          "Time scarcity, because everyone has exactly 24 hours per day",
          "Resource scarcity, because natural resources are universally limited"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Time scarcity is universal; regardless of wealth, status, or skill, every person has only 24 hours daily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bakery can produce Product A (requires 2 hours, yields $15 profit) or Product B (requires 5 hours, yields $45 profit). What is the profit per labor hour for Product A?",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the bakery example, which product should be prioritized to maximize profit per labor hour?",
        "options": [
          "Product A, because it requires fewer hours per unit",
          "Product B, because its profit per hour is higher at $9.00",
          "Both products, since they have equal total profit potential",
          "Neither, because opportunity cost cannot be calculated here"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Product B yields $45 / 5 = $9.00 per hour, exceeding Product A's $7.50 per hour."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$20,000"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Units produced = 2000 / 5 = 400. Total profit = 400 × $45 = $18,000."

          "Giving up one alternative to gain another due to scarcity",

          "The price adjustments made to clear markets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A trade-off is the act of sacrificing one option for another as a consequence of scarcity."

          "Inflation rates exclusively"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Present value calculations discount future costs and benefits so they can be compared meaningfully."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Technology can reduce scarcity but cannot eliminate it because human wants continue to expand."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A graduate has $6,000 and can either (A) invest in training that yields a $3,000 annual salary increase or (B) pay down loans. Over 3 years at a 4% discount rate, the present value of the training option is approximately:",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "PV = $3,000 × annuity factor for 3 years at 4% ≈ $8,473."

          "A firm's fixed operational cost independent of output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Marginal cost is the incremental cost of producing one more unit, not the average or total cost."
