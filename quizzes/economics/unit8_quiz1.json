        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Households supply factors of production (labor, capital, land) to firms and use the income earned to demand goods and services from firms."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the product market, firms supply goods and services to households, and households use their income to purchase these goods and services."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the circular flow, the money flow moving from firms to households represents:",

          "Goods, services, and factors of production",
          "Only government services",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The real flow represents the physical movement of goods, services, and factors of production, as opposed to the money flow which represents financial payments."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the circular flow model includes the government sector, tax payments represent:",
        "options": [
          "A leakage from the circular flow",
          "An injection into the circular flow",
          "Neither leakage nor injection",
          "Only international transactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Taxes are a leakage because they represent money flowing out of the domestic spending stream from households and firms to the government."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expanded circular flow, government spending represents:",

          "Only international transactions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Government spending is an injection because it adds purchasing power back into the economy through expenditures on goods, services, and transfers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Savings in the circular flow model are considered:",
        "options": [

          "Government revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Savings represent income that is not spent on consumption, thus leaking out of the circular flow of spending (until invested)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Investment spending in the circular flow represents:",

          "Government taxation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Investment spending by firms injects money back into the circular flow by creating demand for capital goods and generating income for those who produce them."

        "question": "In the circular flow with international trade, imports represent:",

          "Government revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Imports are a leakage because money flows out of the domestic economy to purchase goods and services from other countries."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Exports in the circular flow model are considered:",

          "Government expenditure"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Exports are an injection because they bring money into the domestic economy from foreign buyers purchasing domestic goods and services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The circular flow model demonstrates that total income equals:",

          "Only consumption spending",
          "Only investment spending",
          "Total spending on final goods and services",
          "Government tax revenue only"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For the economy as a whole, total income generated must equal total expenditure on final goods and services, a fundamental identity in national income accounting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the circular flow, when leakages exceed injections, the economy will likely:",
        "options": [
          "Expand and grow rapidly",
          "Contract or experience reduced economic activity",
          "Experience no change in economic activity",
          "Only affect international trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When leakages (savings, taxes, imports) exceed injections (investment, government spending, exports), total spending decreases, potentially leading to economic contraction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The financial sector in the circular flow model primarily:",
        "options": [
          "Channels savings into investment",
          "Produces consumer goods directly",
          "Replaces the product market",
          "Eliminates the need for households"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Financial institutions facilitate the flow of savings from households to firms for investment purposes, connecting leakages and injections."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transfer payments in the circular flow represent:",
        "options": [
          "Payments for current production of goods and services",
          "Money transfers without current productive activity",
          "International capital flows",
          "Business investment spending"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transfer payments (like Social Security, unemployment benefits) move money between sectors without corresponding current production, affecting income distribution but not directly measuring current output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the circular flow, the concept of 'value added' helps avoid:",
        "options": [
          "Measuring international trade",
          "Double counting in national income",
          "Calculating government spending",
          "Measuring household consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Value added measures only the additional value created at each production stage, preventing double counting that would occur if we summed all sales at every production stage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The circular flow model illustrates why GDP can be measured by:",
        "options": [
          "Only the expenditure approach",
          "Only the income approach",
          "Multiple equivalent approaches",
          "Only government statistics"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Because every dollar spent becomes someone's income, GDP can be measured equivalently through expenditure, income, or production approaches."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a balanced circular flow with no government or foreign sector:",
        "options": [
          "Savings must equal investment",
          "Consumption must equal zero",
          "Investment must exceed savings",
          "Savings must exceed investment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the basic two-sector model, for the circular flow to remain in equilibrium, the leakage of savings must be matched by the injection of investment spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The circular flow model helps explain the concept of:",
        "options": [
          "Absolute advantage in trade",
          "Economic interdependence",
          "Only microeconomic behavior",
          "Individual consumer preferences only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The circular flow demonstrates how households, firms, government, and international sectors are economically interdependent through continuous exchanges of resources, goods, services, and money."

        "90": "Excellent! You thoroughly understand the circular flow model and its importance in explaining economic interdependence and national income accounting.",
        "70": "Good work! You understand the basic circular flow but should review the concepts of leakages, injections, and how different sectors interact.",
        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: the difference between real and money flows, the roles of households and firms, and how leakages and injections affect economic activity.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that the circular flow model shows how money and resources move between households, firms, government, and international sectors in a continuous cycle."
