      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economic model is best defined as:",
        "options": [
          "A perfect replica of the real economy",
          "A simplified representation of reality used to understand economic relationships",
          "A computer program for stock trading",
          "A statistical database of economic facts"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic models are simplified representations that capture essential features of reality while omitting irrelevant details, helping us understand complex economic relationships."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do economists use models?",
        "options": [
          "To make economics more complicated",
          "Because reality is too simple",
          "To simplify complexity and focus on key relationships",
          "To avoid using real data"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Models help economists simplify complex reality, isolate key variables, and understand cause-and-effect relationships that would be obscured by real-world complexity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The assumption of 'ceteris paribus' means:",

          "Everything changes at once",
          "All other things being equal or held constant",
          "Economic models are always perfect",
          "Data must be collected carefully"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ceteris paribus (Latin for 'all else equal') is the assumption that allows economists to isolate the effect of one variable by holding all other factors constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are assumptions necessary in economic models?",
        "options": [
          "To make models more realistic",
          "To simplify reality and make analysis tractable",
          "To hide flaws in economic theory",
          "Assumptions are not necessary"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Assumptions simplify complex reality, making it possible to analyze relationships mathematically and logically while focusing on essential factors."

        "question": "The assumption of 'rational behavior' in economics means:",
        "options": [
          "People are always correct",
          "People systematically pursue their objectives given constraints",
          "People never make mistakes",
          "Everyone thinks exactly alike"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rational behavior assumes people make decisions that systematically pursue their goals (like maximizing utility or profit) given available information and constraints."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A good economic model should:",
        "options": [
          "Include every detail of reality",
          "Make accurate predictions about key relationships",
          "Be as complex as possible",
          "Avoid all simplifications"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Good models balance simplicity with predictive power—they should capture essential relationships and make testable predictions, not replicate every detail."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The circular flow model is used to illustrate:",

        "question": "The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) model demonstrates:",
        "options": [
          "How to maximize profits",
          "Trade-offs, opportunity cost, and efficient resource allocation",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The PPF illustrates fundamental concepts: scarcity, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and the efficiency of resource allocation when producing two goods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an economic model's predictions consistently match real-world outcomes, the model is:",
        "options": [
          "Too simple and should be discarded",
          "Useful and validated by evidence",
          "Definitely perfect and complete",
          "No longer needed"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Models that make accurate predictions are useful tools, even if simplified. Predictive success validates a model's usefulness for understanding reality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a model assumes 'perfect competition,' this means it assumes:",
        "options": [
          "All firms compete perfectly in every way",
          "Many buyers and sellers, identical products, perfect information",
          "No competition exists",
          "Only two firms compete"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition is a model assumption involving many buyers/sellers, homogeneous products, perfect information, and free entry/exit—simplifying market analysis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The statement 'Assume workers are identical in skill and productivity' is an example of:",

          "A data collection method"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a simplifying assumption that allows economists to analyze other factors (like wages or employment) without dealing with skill variation complexity."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economic model assumes 'no government intervention,' this assumption:",
        "options": [
          "Means the model cannot study any real economy",
          "Helps isolate market forces before adding government complexity",
          "Proves government is unnecessary",
          "Makes the model useless"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Starting with no government helps economists understand pure market mechanisms before adding government's effects—a step-by-step analytical approach."

          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This illustrates all three: it's an important assumption (ceteris paribus) that isolates the price-quantity relationship by holding other factors constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A model that assumes 'people maximize utility' is making an assumption about:",

          "Consumer objectives and decision-making",
          "Production technology",
          "Market structure"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Utility maximization is a behavioral assumption about consumer objectives—that people make choices to maximize their satisfaction given constraints."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is NOT a valid criticism of economic models?",
        "options": [
          "They oversimplify reality",
          "Their assumptions are sometimes unrealistic",
          "They don't include every possible variable",
          "They use mathematics"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Using mathematics is not a criticism—it's a tool for precision. Valid criticisms focus on whether simplifications are too extreme or assumptions inappropriate."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The supply and demand model assumes 'many buyers and sellers' to:",

          "Ensure no single buyer or seller can influence price",
          "Guarantee economic growth",
          "Eliminate all trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Assuming many participants ensures competitive markets where individuals are price-takers, simplifying analysis of market equilibrium."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Following Milton Friedman's methodology, models should be judged by predictive power, not assumption realism—useful simplifications can yield accurate predictions."

          "Random variables"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Exogenous variables are determined outside the model and taken as given, while endogenous variables are determined within the model by its equations."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary purpose of economic modeling is to:",

          "Understand cause-and-effect relationships and make predictions",
          "Avoid collecting real-world data",
          "Make economics seem more scientific than it is"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Models help economists understand causal relationships, make predictions, test theories, and analyze policy effects—not to perfectly replicate every detail of reality."
