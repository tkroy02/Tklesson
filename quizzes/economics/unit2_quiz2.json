      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy can produce 200 units of corn or 100 units of wheat. What is the opportunity cost of producing 1 unit of wheat?",
        "options": [
          "0.5 units of corn",
          "1 unit of corn",
          "2 units of corn",
          "100 units of corn"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "To produce 100 wheat, they give up 200 corn. So per unit of wheat: 200 corn / 100 wheat = 2 units of corn per wheat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a PPF is linear, what does this imply about opportunity cost?",
        "options": [
          "Opportunity cost increases as production increases",
          "Opportunity cost decreases as production increases",
          "Opportunity cost remains constant",
          "There is no opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A linear PPF indicates constant opportunity cost. Resources are perfectly adaptable between uses, so the trade-off ratio doesn't change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country's PPF shows it can produce either 50 cars or 150 trucks. What is the opportunity cost of producing 10 cars?",
        "options": [
          "10 trucks",
          "30 trucks",
          "50 trucks",
          "150 trucks"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost of 50 cars = 150 trucks. So per car: 150/50 = 3 trucks. For 10 cars: 10 × 3 = 30 trucks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Moving from point A (20 pizzas, 10 robots) to point B (30 pizzas, 8 robots) on a PPF, what is the opportunity cost of 10 additional pizzas?",
        "options": [
          "2 robots",
          "8 robots",
          "10 robots",
          "18 robots"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To gain 10 pizzas (from 20 to 30), they give up 2 robots (from 10 to 8). The opportunity cost is 2 robots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a bowed-out PPF indicate increasing opportunity costs?",
        "options": [
          "Because resources are perfectly adaptable",
          "Because resources are not equally efficient in all uses",
          "Because technology improves over time",
          "Because consumers prefer variety"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Resources are specialized. As you produce more of one good, you must use resources that are less and less suited to that production, requiring ever greater sacrifices of the other good."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the opportunity cost of producing 1 computer is 3 phones, what is the opportunity cost of producing 1 phone?",
        "options": [
          "1/3 of a computer",
          "1 computer",
          "3 computers",
          "6 computers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If 1 computer = 3 phones, then 1 phone = 1/3 computer. The opportunity cost relationship is reciprocal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy produces at point X (40 books, 60 lamps). Moving to point Y (50 books, 45 lamps) on the PPF. What is the opportunity cost per additional book?",
        "options": [
          "0.67 lamps",
          "1.5 lamps",
          "15 lamps",
          "45 lamps"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gain: 10 books (50-40). Loss: 15 lamps (60-45). Opportunity cost per book: 15 lamps / 10 books = 1.5 lamps per book."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A PPF for guns and butter is bowed outward. As a society produces more guns, the opportunity cost of producing additional guns:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Remains constant",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "On a bowed-out PPF, opportunity cost increases. Producing more guns requires giving up increasing amounts of butter as resources specialized in butter production are shifted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy can produce combinations: (0 A, 100 B) or (25 A, 75 B) or (50 A, 0 B). What is the opportunity cost of producing 25 units of A?",
        "options": [
          "25 units of B",
          "50 units of B",
          "75 units of B",
          "100 units of B"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moving from (0A,100B) to (25A,75B): Gain 25A, Lose 25B (100-75). So opportunity cost of 25A is 25B."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country is producing inside its PPF, the calculated opportunity cost of moving between two points:",
        "options": [
          "Is the same as when on the PPF",
          "Is zero because resources are available",
          "Is irrelevant since they're being inefficient",
          "Cannot be determined from the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When inside the PPF, resources are unemployed or misallocated. Moving between points inside the frontier may not require giving up anything, so the opportunity cost is effectively zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A nation can produce 300 tons of steel or 500 tons of wheat. If it chooses to produce 120 tons of steel, what is the maximum wheat it can produce?",
        "options": [
          "180 tons",
          "300 tons",
          "420 tons",
          "500 tons"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost of 1 steel = 500/300 = 1.67 wheat. Producing 120 steel uses resources that could make 120 × 1.67 = 200 wheat. So maximum wheat = 500 - 200 = 300? Wait, let's calculate properly: At 120 steel, they're using 120/300 = 40% of resources on steel, leaving 60% for wheat: 60% of 500 = 300 wheat. Actually 500 - (120 × 500/300) = 500 - 200 = 300 wheat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a bowed-out PPF, the opportunity cost of good X in terms of good Y is:",
        "options": [
          "Constant at all points",
          "Highest when producing little X",
          "Highest when producing much X",
          "Always equal to 1"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "On a bowed-out PPF, opportunity cost increases as you produce more of a good. The opportunity cost of X is highest when you're already producing a lot of X, as you must give up increasingly more Y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy produces either 100 units of education or 200 units of healthcare. What is the opportunity cost of increasing education from 20 to 40 units?",
        "options": [
          "20 units of healthcare",
          "40 units of healthcare",
          "60 units of healthcare",
          "80 units of healthcare"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost of 100 education = 200 healthcare, so per unit: 2 healthcare per education. For 20 additional education: 20 × 2 = 40 healthcare."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If technological improvement makes farmers 50% more productive in growing corn but doesn't affect wheat, what happens to the opportunity cost of wheat?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases",
          "It increases",
          "It stays the same",
          "It becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With better corn technology, the PPF shifts outward more on the corn axis. Now, to produce a unit of wheat, you give up more potential corn than before, so the opportunity cost of wheat increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A factory can produce 100 cars or 200 motorcycles. If it's currently producing 60 cars and 80 motorcycles, where is it operating?",
        "options": [
          "On the PPF",
          "Inside the PPF",
          "Outside the PPF",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Maximum is 100 cars or 200 motorcycles. At 60 cars, they should be able to produce more than 80 motorcycles (likely around 80 motorcycles only if they were at full efficiency with 60 cars). Let's check: If 100 cars = 0 motorcycles, and 0 cars = 200 motorcycles, then each car costs 2 motorcycles. At 60 cars, they've given up 120 motorcycles (60×2), so maximum motorcycles possible = 200-120 = 80. So they're actually ON the PPF, not inside it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When calculating opportunity cost along a PPF, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Only consider monetary costs",
          "Consider what is given up to get more of something",
          "Ignore the slope of the PPF",
          "Assume resources are unlimited"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is fundamentally about what is sacrificed when making a choice. Along a PPF, it's measured by how much of one good decreases when production of another good increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country discovers new oil reserves. How does this affect opportunity costs on its PPF?",
        "options": [
          "Increases all opportunity costs",
          "Decreases all opportunity costs",
          "Has no effect on opportunity costs",
          "Eliminates opportunity costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More resources shift the PPF outward. With more resources available, the sacrifice needed to produce additional units of any good decreases, thus decreasing opportunity costs across the PPF."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the opportunity cost of 1 ton of coffee is 2 tons of bananas in Brazil but 3 tons of bananas in Colombia:",
        "options": [
          "Brazil should produce both goods",
          "Colombia has comparative advantage in coffee",
          "Brazil has comparative advantage in coffee",
          "Opportunity cost doesn't affect trade"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The country with the lower opportunity cost for a good has comparative advantage in that good. Brazil gives up fewer bananas (2) for coffee than Colombia (3), so Brazil has comparative advantage in coffee."

          "50 units of food",
          "100 units of food",
          "200 units of food",
          "400 units of food"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost of 800 shelter = 400 food, so per unit shelter: 400/800 = 0.5 food. For 100 shelter: 100 × 0.5 = 50 food."
      },

        "options": [
          "PPFs are always straight lines",
          "PPFs are typically bowed outward",
          "Economic growth never occurs",
          "Countries should produce everything themselves"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increasing opportunity cost—the fact that resources are not equally suited to all production—is precisely why PPFs are typically bowed outward rather than straight lines."
