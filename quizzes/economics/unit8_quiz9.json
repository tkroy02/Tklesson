          "Market economic activity",
          "Income distribution equality",
          "Environmental sustainability"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP measures market economic activity and production, but it was never intended as a comprehensive measure of welfare, happiness, or social progress."
      },

          "New car production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unpaid household work, while economically valuable, is excluded from GDP because it doesn't involve market transactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The underground economy includes:",
        "options": [

          "The distribution of income",
          "Total market production",
          "Government services",
          "Business investment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GDP measures total output but doesn't indicate how that output or income is distributed among the population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which activity would increase GDP but potentially decrease welfare?",

          "Volunteering at a homeless shelter",
          "Growing your own vegetables",
          "Carpooling to work"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oil spill cleanup increases GDP (market activity) but represents economic loss rather than gain, as resources are used to fix damage rather than create new value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'defensive expenditures' problem refers to:",

          "Business inventory accumulation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Defensive expenditures (like pollution cleanup, security costs, medical treatment from pollution) increase GDP but represent costs rather than welfare improvements."

        "question": "Leisure time is:",
        "options": [
          "Valued in GDP calculations",
          "Not included in GDP despite its welfare value",
          "Counted as unemployment",
          "Included as government services"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased leisure time, which contributes to welfare, is not measured in GDP. In fact, reduced work hours that increase leisure could lower measured GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "GDP growth may overstate welfare improvements because it:",
        "options": [

          "Understates technological progress",
          "Overcounts consumer savings"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP counts resource extraction as income but doesn't subtract the depletion of natural capital, potentially overstating sustainable welfare."

          "Overstates investment spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GDP treats all market production equally, whether it's education, healthcare, weapons, or pollution - it doesn't account for what types of goods improve welfare."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which alternative measure attempts to account for environmental costs?",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Robert Kennedy famously criticized GDP because it:",
        "options": [
          "Measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile",
          "Is too focused on environmental protection",
          "Understates military spending",
          "Only counts illegal activities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kennedy argued GDP 'measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile,' highlighting its limitations as a welfare measure."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "GDP counts the production of harmful goods as:",
        "options": [
          "Negative contributions to welfare",
          "Positive contributions equal to beneficial goods",
          "Not included in calculations",
          "Only if they are illegal"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cigarettes, pollution-generating factories, and other harmful products count positively in GDP the same as beneficial goods like education and healthcare."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Easterlin Paradox' refers to the finding that:",
        "options": [
          "Higher GDP always increases happiness",
          "Happiness increases with GDP only up to a point",
          "GDP and happiness are completely unrelated",
          "Only absolute income affects happiness"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Easterlin Paradox shows that while happiness increases with GDP at low income levels, beyond a certain point additional income doesn't significantly increase happiness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Net Economic Welfare (NEW) attempts to adjust GDP by:",
        "options": [
          "Adding the value of leisure and unpaid work, subtracting environmental costs",
          "Only counting government services",

          "Focusing only on wealth distribution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "NEW adds the value of leisure and non-market production while subtracting environmental costs and other negative externalities."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about GDP and technological progress is true?",
        "options": [
          "GDP perfectly captures quality improvements",
          "GDP often understates true technological progress",
          "GDP overstates the value of new technologies",
          "GDP excludes all technological products"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP may understate technological progress because quality improvements (like better computers or medical treatments) aren't fully captured in price indices."

        "question": "Which factor is NOT a recognized limitation of GDP?",
        "options": [
          "It measures total market production",
          "It excludes non-market production",
          "It ignores income distribution",
          "It doesn't account for environmental costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Measuring total market production is what GDP is designed to do. The limitations are what it excludes or fails to account for beyond market production."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The most appropriate use of GDP is for:",

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: what types of economic activities GDP excludes, why it doesn't measure welfare perfectly, and examples of alternative measures.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that GDP measures market economic activity but has significant limitations in measuring overall welfare, environmental sustainability, and quality of life."
