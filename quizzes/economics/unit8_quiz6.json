        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The car purchase increases consumption (C) but also increases imports (M), so the net effect on GDP is zero since C and M increase by the same amount."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using Y = C + I + G + (X-M): $10 = $7 + $2 + $2 + (X-M), so (X-M) = $10 - $11 = -$1 trillion."

          "Calculating average income levels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The expenditure approach tracks all spending on final goods and services, based on the principle that every dollar spent becomes someone's income."

          "No effect on future production capacity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Low investment means less capital accumulation, which can limit future production capacity and economic growth potential."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The expenditure components must sum to GDP because:",

          "Government requires it by law",
          "International standards dictate the formula"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The fundamental identity arises because every transaction has both a spending side and an income side - what is spent on output becomes income for the factors that produced it."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: memorizing the expenditure formula, understanding what each component includes, and practicing classification of economic transactions.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember the expenditure approach formula: GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports, and learn what types of spending go into each category."
