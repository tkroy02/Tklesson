    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic growth is represented on a PPF diagram by:",
        "options": [
          "A movement along the existing PPF",
          "A movement from inside to on the PPF",
          "An outward shift of the entire PPF",
          "An inward shift of the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economic growth increases an economy's productive capacity, allowing it to produce more of all goods. This is shown as an outward shift of the entire PPF."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause the PPF to shift outward?",
        "options": [
          "Unemployment decreases from 8% to 5%",
          "A new technology improves manufacturing efficiency",
          "Resources are reallocated from consumer to capital goods",
          "The economy moves from inside to on the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Technological improvement increases productive capacity, shifting the PPF outward. Decreasing unemployment (A) and moving to the PPF (D) represent better resource use, not growth. Reallocating resources (C) moves along the PPF."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the labor force would cause:",
        "options": [
          "Movement along the PPF",
          "An outward shift of the PPF",
          "An inward shift of the PPF",
          "Movement inside the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More labor means more resources available for production, increasing the economy's maximum possible output of all goods - an outward PPF shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If technology improves only in computer production, the PPF will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift outward evenly in all directions",
          "Shift outward only on the computer axis",
          "Shift inward on the computer axis",
          "Become steeper but not shift"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When technology improves for only one good, the PPF pivots outward along that good's axis while the intercept for the other good remains unchanged."
      },

          "Immediate maximum consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Investing in capital goods (factories, machinery) sacrifices current consumption but increases future productive capacity, leading to faster outward PPF shifts over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural disaster that destroys factories and infrastructure would cause:",

          "Movement inside the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Destruction of productive resources reduces the economy's capacity to produce goods, shown as an inward shift of the PPF."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'trade-off between present and future consumption' refers to:",

          "Producing inside the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Producing more capital goods means more investment in future productive capacity, leading to faster outward PPF shifts and economic growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An improvement in education that makes workers more productive would:",
        "options": [
          "Cause movement along the PPF",

        "question": "If both goods on a PPF are capital goods, economic growth would:",
        "options": [
          "Be impossible",
          "Be slower than with consumer goods",
          "Be faster than with consumer goods",
          "Depend on technological change only"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When an economy produces capital goods that are used to make more capital goods, it creates a powerful cycle of investment and growth, potentially leading to very rapid economic expansion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country discovers large new oil reserves. This would cause:",
        "options": [
          "An outward shift of the PPF",

          "Movement inside the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Discovering new natural resources increases the economy's resource base, expanding productive capacity and shifting the PPF outward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents economic growth rather than just better resource use?",
        "options": [
          "Eliminating unemployment",
          "Moving from inside to on the PPF",

          "Reallocating resources to more valued uses"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Technological innovation increases productive capacity (PPF shifts). The other options represent using existing capacity more efficiently (moving to or along the PPF)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's population ages and many workers retire, the PPF will likely:",
        "options": [
          "Shift outward rapidly",
          "Shift inward",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Become steeper"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A shrinking labor force reduces the economy's productive capacity, causing an inward shift of the PPF as maximum possible output decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of 'creative destruction' in economic growth refers to:",

          "Consumers destroying products quickly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Creative destruction describes how technological progress creates new industries while making old ones obsolete. While disruptive, this process drives long-term economic growth and PPF shifts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy that specializes in producing consumer goods may experience:",
        "options": [
          "Rapid economic growth",
          "Slow economic growth",
          "Immediate outward PPF shifts",
          "No trade-offs with future consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Focusing on consumer goods means less investment in capital goods, reducing future productive capacity growth and leading to slower outward PPF shifts over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "International trade can cause an effect similar to economic growth because it:",

          "Eliminates all opportunity costs",
          "Allows consumption outside the domestic PPF",
          "Shifts the PPF outward permanently",
          "Increases the labor force"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Through specialization and trade, countries can consume combinations of goods that lie outside their domestic PPF, achieving a similar benefit to economic growth without actually shifting the PPF."

          "An inward PPF shift",
          "Movement along the PPF",
          "Movement inside the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Regulations that reduce productive capacity (even for valid environmental reasons) decrease maximum possible output, shown as an inward PPF shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'balanced growth' path on a PPF typically involves:",
        "options": [
          "Producing only capital goods",
