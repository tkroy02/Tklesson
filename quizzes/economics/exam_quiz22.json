          "Marginal product decreases",
          "Total product is zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns (law of diminishing returns) means that adding more of a variable input, while holding other inputs fixed, eventually yields smaller increases in output (marginal product declines)."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Returns to scale describe how output changes when all inputs are increased proportionally in the long run."
