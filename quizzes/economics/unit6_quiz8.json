    "topic": "Monopolistic Competition, Product Differentiation, Short-run and Long-run Equilibrium",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Monopolistic competition is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "Many firms selling identical products",
          "A single firm with no close substitutes",
          "Many firms selling differentiated products",
          "A few large firms dominating the market"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolistic competition features many firms selling similar but differentiated products, giving each firm some market power while facing competition from close substitutes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key feature that distinguishes monopolistic competition from perfect competition is:",
        "options": [
          "The number of firms in the market",
          "Barriers to entry and exit",
          "Product differentiation",
          "The profit-maximization rule"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While both have many firms and easy entry/exit, monopolistic competition features product differentiation, whereas perfect competition has homogeneous products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, each firm faces a demand curve that is:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic (horizontal)",
          "Perfectly inelastic (vertical)",
          "Downward sloping but relatively elastic",
          "Upward sloping"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Due to product differentiation, each firm has some pricing power and faces a downward-sloping demand curve, but it's relatively elastic because of many close substitutes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a monopolistically competitive firm can earn:",
        "options": [
          "Only normal profits",
          "Only economic profits",
          "Economic profits, normal profits, or economic losses",
          "Only economic losses"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Like perfect competition, monopolistically competitive firms can experience economic profits, normal profits, or economic losses in the short run due to fixed market conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long-run equilibrium for a monopolistically competitive firm occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = MC$ and $P = ATC$",
          "$P = MC$ and $P > ATC$",
          "$MR = MC$ and $P = ATC$",
          "$MR = MC$ and $P > ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium, $MR = MC$ (profit maximization) and $P = ATC$ (zero economic profit due to free entry and exit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run equilibrium, a monopolistically competitive firm produces at:",
        "options": [
          "The minimum point of its ATC curve",
          "A point where $P > MC$",
          "A point where $P = MC$",
          "Maximum capacity output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Due to product differentiation and downward-sloping demand, the firm produces where $P > MC$ and $P = ATC$, but not at the minimum ATC (excess capacity)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The excess capacity theorem in monopolistic competition refers to:",
        "options": [
          "Firms producing more than the competitive output",
          "Firms producing at less than the minimum-cost output",
          "Firms having unused fixed resources",
          "Firms operating in the short run only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Excess capacity means firms don't produce at the minimum point of their ATC curve, resulting in higher average costs than necessary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Non-price competition in monopolistic competition typically includes:",
        "options": [
          "Price wars among firms",
          "Advertising and product differentiation",
          "Collusion on output levels",
          "Predatory pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Firms in monopolistic competition compete through advertising, product features, quality, service, and branding rather than just price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If firms in monopolistic competition are earning economic profits, in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "Firms will exit the industry",
          "New firms will enter the industry",
          "Prices will increase further",
          "Costs will automatically decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic profits attract new entrants, increasing competition and reducing each firm's market share until economic profits are eliminated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to perfect competition, monopolistic competition results in:",
        "options": [
          "Lower prices and more output",
          "Higher prices and less output",
          "The same price and output",
          "Lower prices and less output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Due to product differentiation and market power, monopolistically competitive firms charge higher prices and produce less output than perfectly competitive firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm becomes more elastic when:",
        "options": [
          "There are fewer substitutes available",
          "Products become more differentiated",
          "More competitors enter the market",
          "Consumer preferences become stronger"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "As more firms enter with similar products, consumers have more alternatives, making each firm's demand more elastic (more responsive to price changes)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, product differentiation allows firms to:",
        "options": [
          "Become price takers",
          "Charge prices above marginal cost",
          "Earn long-run economic profits",
          "Avoid all competition"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Product differentiation gives firms some market power, allowing them to set prices above marginal cost, though competition prevents long-run economic profits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The social benefit of monopolistic competition is:",
        "options": [
          "Lower production costs",
          "Greater product variety",
          "Higher output levels",
          "Perfect resource allocation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While monopolistic competition leads to some inefficiency, it provides consumers with greater product variety and choice compared to perfect competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run equilibrium, a monopolistically competitive firm operates with:",
        "options": [
          "Excess capacity",
          "No fixed costs",
          "Economic profits",
          "Price equal to marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Excess capacity occurs because firms don't produce at the minimum point of their ATC curve, operating at less than optimal scale."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolistically competitive firm's demand curve becomes more inelastic, it can:",
        "options": [
          "Charge a higher markup over cost",
          "Produce more output",
          "Earn long-run economic profits",
          "Avoid competition entirely"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More inelastic demand means consumers are less price-sensitive, allowing the firm to charge a higher price relative to marginal cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Advertising in monopolistic competition is used primarily to:",
        "options": [
          "Lower production costs",
          "Make demand more elastic",
          "Make demand less elastic",
          "Coordinate with competitors"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Successful advertising makes demand less elastic by increasing brand loyalty and product differentiation, giving firms more pricing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The inefficiency in monopolistic competition comes from:",
        "options": [
          "$P > MC$ and excess capacity",
          "$P < MC$ and underproduction",
          "$P = MC$ and overproduction",
          "Barriers to entry"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two sources of inefficiency exist: $P > MC$ (allocative inefficiency) and excess capacity (productive inefficiency from not producing at minimum ATC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to monopoly, monopolistic competition typically has:",
        "options": [
          "Higher prices and less output",
          "Lower prices and more output",
          "The same price and output",
          "Higher prices and more output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Due to competition from close substitutes, monopolistically competitive firms have less market power than monopolists, leading to lower prices and more output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Real-world examples of monopolistic competition include:",
        "options": [

          "Restaurants and clothing stores",
          "Automobile manufacturers",
          "Agricultural markets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Restaurants, clothing stores, hair salons, and similar retail businesses are classic examples of monopolistic competition with product differentiation and easy entry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental trade-off in monopolistic competition is between:",
        "options": [
          "Price and quality",
          "Efficiency and product variety",
          "Profit and market share",
          "Short-run and long-run outcomes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Society faces a trade-off: perfect competition offers productive efficiency but homogeneous products, while monopolistic competition offers product variety but some inefficiency."
