    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good when it:",
        "options": [
          "Can produce more of the good than other countries",
          "Has the lowest opportunity cost of producing the good",
          "Uses the most advanced technology",
          "Has abundant natural resources for that good"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage is determined by opportunity cost, not absolute productivity. The country with the lower opportunity cost for producing a good has the comparative advantage in that good."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country has an absolute advantage when it:",
        "options": [
          "Has the lowest opportunity cost",
          "Can produce more of a good with the same resources",
          "Has specialized in that good historically",
          "Has the largest population"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Absolute advantage refers to being more productive - able to produce more output with the same amount of resources, regardless of opportunity costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two countries can benefit from trade if:",
        "options": [
          "One country is better at producing everything",
          "Each has an absolute advantage in different goods",
          "Each has a comparative advantage in different goods",
          "They have identical opportunity costs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The basis for mutually beneficial trade is comparative advantage - differences in opportunity costs. Even if one country has absolute advantage in everything, both can benefit from specializing according to comparative advantage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country A can produce 10 cars or 5 computers. Country B can produce 8 cars or 4 computers. Which country has comparative advantage in computers?",
        "options": [
          "Country A",
          "Country B",
          "Both countries",
          "Neither country"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Country A: 1 computer costs 2 cars (10/5). Country B: 1 computer costs 2 cars (8/4). Both have the same opportunity cost for computers, so neither has comparative advantage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Specialization and trade allow countries to:",
        "options": [
          "Eliminate all opportunity costs",
          "Consume outside their production possibilities frontier",
          "Avoid the problem of scarcity",
          "Produce more with the same resources"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Through specialization according to comparative advantage and trade, countries can consume combinations of goods that would be unattainable if they produced everything domestically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the US opportunity cost for 1 ton of wheat is 2 computers, and China's is 4 computers, which country should specialize in wheat?",
        "options": [
          "United States",
          "China",
          "Both countries",
          "Neither country"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The US has lower opportunity cost for wheat (2 computers vs 4 computers), so the US has comparative advantage in wheat and should specialize in wheat production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'gains from trade' refer to:",
        "options": [
          "The increase in total world production through specialization",
          "The profits made by trading companies",
          "The elimination of transportation costs",
          "Having identical production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gains from trade are the increased total output that results when countries specialize according to comparative advantage and trade with each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country should export goods in which it has:",
        "options": [
          "Absolute advantage",
          "Comparative advantage",
          "The highest production costs",
          "The largest domestic market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Countries maximize the benefits of trade by exporting goods in which they have comparative advantage (lowest opportunity cost) and importing goods in which they have comparative disadvantage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country X has lower opportunity costs for both goods than Country Y:",
        "options": [
          "No trade is possible",
          "Country X should produce both goods",
          "Country Y has comparative advantage in both goods",
          "Trade can still benefit both countries"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Even if one country has lower opportunity costs for both goods, the country with the smallest comparative disadvantage should specialize in that good, and both can benefit from trade."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The terms of trade refer to:",
        "options": [
          "The ratio at which two goods are exchanged",
          "The legal agreements between trading partners",
          "The transportation costs of trade",
          "The quality standards for traded goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Terms of trade is the ratio at which one good trades for another - for example, how many units of wheat exchange for one unit of cloth in international markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For trade to benefit both countries, the terms of trade must lie:",
        "options": [
          "Below both countries' opportunity costs",
          "Above both countries' opportunity costs",
          "Between the two countries' opportunity costs",
          "At exactly one country's opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The terms of trade must be between the two countries' opportunity costs for both to benefit. Each country imports goods cheaper than their domestic opportunity cost and exports goods at favorable rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Specialization increases total output because:",
        "options": [
          "It eliminates transportation costs",
          "Countries focus on what they do relatively best",
          "It makes opportunity costs identical",
          "It requires government planning"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Specialization allows countries to allocate resources to their most productive uses according to comparative advantage, increasing total world production efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Brazil's opportunity cost for coffee is 2 oranges, and Argentina's is 3 oranges, mutually beneficial trade requires that 1 unit of coffee trades for:",
        "options": [
          "1 orange",
          "2 oranges",
          "2.5 oranges",
          "4 oranges"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The terms of trade must be between the two opportunity costs (between 2 and 3 oranges per coffee). 2.5 oranges per coffee allows both countries to benefit compared to their domestic trade-offs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of comparative advantage explains why:",
        "options": [
          "Rich countries dominate poor countries in trade",
          "Trade can benefit all participating countries",
          "Some countries should not trade at all",
          "Trade always creates winners and losers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The law of comparative advantage demonstrates that when countries specialize according to their relative efficiencies and trade, all participating countries can be better off."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A doctor who is also a faster typist than her secretary should:",
        "options": [
          "Do her own typing to save money",
          "Hire the secretary and focus on medical practice",
          "Fire the secretary and type herself",
          "Split time equally between both tasks"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This classic example illustrates comparative advantage. Even if the doctor has absolute advantage in both activities, she has greater comparative advantage in medicine (higher opportunity cost for typing), so she should specialize in medicine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "International trade is based on comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage because:",
        "options": [
          "Absolute advantage doesn't exist in reality",
          "Comparative advantage determines the gains from trade",
          "Transportation costs eliminate absolute advantage",
          "Governments prohibit trade based on absolute advantage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage, not absolute advantage, determines the pattern of trade and the potential gains. Differences in opportunity costs create the basis for mutually beneficial exchange."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When countries specialize according to comparative advantage, world production:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases due to transportation costs",
          "Increases due to more efficient resource allocation",
          "Remains unchanged but is redistributed",
          "Becomes concentrated in rich countries"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Specialization allows global resources to be allocated to their most productive uses across countries, increasing total world output beyond what would be possible without trade."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main limitation of the comparative advantage model is that it:",
        "options": [
          "Assumes constant opportunity costs",
          "Only applies to wealthy countries",
          "Doesn't account for transportation costs",
          "Is mathematically incorrect"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The simple comparative advantage model typically assumes constant opportunity costs (linear PPFs), while in reality, opportunity costs often increase (bowed-out PPFs), which can limit complete specialization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Free trade based on comparative advantage typically leads to:",
        "options": [
          "Higher prices for all goods",
          "Lower overall economic efficiency",
          "Increased consumption possibilities for all countries",
          "Identical production patterns worldwide"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By allowing countries to specialize and trade according to comparative advantage, free trade expands consumption possibilities beyond what each country could produce alone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental reason trade creates value is that:",
        "options": [
          "It allows redistribution from rich to poor",
          "People value what they receive more than what they give up",
          "It increases government tax revenue",
          "It makes countries self-sufficient"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Trade creates value because voluntary exchange occurs only when both parties expect to benefit - each values what they receive more than what they give up, based on their different opportunity costs and preferences."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: Comparative advantage = lower opportunity cost; countries should specialize in what they give up less to produce; trade allows consumption outside PPF.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember: Comparative advantage is about opportunity cost, not being the best. Trade benefits countries when they specialize in what they're relatively better at producing."
