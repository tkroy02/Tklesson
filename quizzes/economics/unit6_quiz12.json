    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopsony is a market structure characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "Many buyers and one seller",
          "One buyer and many sellers",
          "Few buyers and few sellers",
          "Perfect competition among buyers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopsony occurs when there is only one buyer in a market but many sellers, giving the buyer significant market power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monopsony labor market, the wage rate is:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to the marginal revenue product of labor",
          "Less than the marginal revenue product of labor",
          "Greater than the marginal revenue product of labor",
          "Determined solely by workers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A monopsonist pays workers less than their marginal revenue product because it faces an upward-sloping labor supply curve and must raise wages to hire more workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The marginal factor cost (MFC) for a monopsonist is:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to the wage rate",
          "Less than the wage rate",
          "Greater than the wage rate",
          "Unrelated to the wage rate"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "MFC > wage rate because to hire additional workers, the monopsonist must raise wages for all workers, not just the marginal ones."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit-maximizing monopsonist hires labor up to the point where:",
        "options": [
          "Wage = MRP",
          "MFC = MRP",
          "Wage = MFC",
          "MRP = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The monopsonist maximizes profit where marginal factor cost equals marginal revenue product (MFC = MRP), then pays the wage indicated by the labor supply curve for that quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a competitive labor market, a monopsony results in:",
        "options": [
          "Higher employment and higher wages",
          "Lower employment and lower wages",
          "Higher employment but lower wages",
          "Lower employment but higher wages"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopsony leads to both lower wages and lower employment compared to a perfectly competitive labor market."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Oligopsony refers to a market with:",
        "options": [
          "Many buyers",
          "One buyer",
          "A few dominant buyers",
          "No buyers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Oligopsony is a market structure where a few large buyers dominate purchasing, giving them significant bargaining power over sellers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Real-world examples of monopsony power often occur in:",
        "options": [
          "Consumer retail markets",
          "Labor markets in company towns",
          "Stock markets",
          "International currency markets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Company towns, specialized professional sports, and certain agricultural markets often exhibit monopsony characteristics where one employer dominates local hiring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss in monopsony results from:",
        "options": [
          "Too much employment compared to competitive markets",
          "The difference between MRP and the wage rate",
          "Employment being restricted below the competitive level",
          "Workers being overpaid"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss occurs because the monopsonist hires fewer workers than would be employed in a competitive market, reducing total economic surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A minimum wage set above the monopsony wage but below the competitive wage can:",
        "options": [
          "Reduce both wages and employment",
          "Increase both wages and employment",
          "Have no effect on the market",
          "Only benefit the monopsonist"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In monopsony, a properly set minimum wage can force the employer to pay higher wages while also increasing employment by making the MFC constant up to that wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market structure has the most price-setting power for buyers?",

          "Monopsony"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Monopsony gives the single buyer the most power to influence prices paid to sellers."

          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfectly competitive firms are price takers and face perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand curves at the market price."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The market structure most likely to have significant advertising is:",

          "Pure monopsony"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolistic competition features extensive advertising as firms try to differentiate their products from close substitutes."
      },

          "Monopsony"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In oligopoly, firms are mutually interdependent - each firm's decisions affect others, leading to strategic behavior."

          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition leads to zero economic profit in the long run due to free entry and exit."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Product differentiation is a key feature of:",
        "options": [

          "All market structures"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Product differentiation is central to monopolistic competition and is common in oligopoly markets."
      },

          "Oligopoly",
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Only perfect competition achieves both productive efficiency (minimum ATC) and allocative efficiency (P = MC) in long-run equilibrium."
      },
      {
