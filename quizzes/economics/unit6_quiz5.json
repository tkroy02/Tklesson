        "question": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, perfectly competitive firms earn:",
        "options": [
          "Economic profits",
          "Normal profits (zero economic profit)",
          "Accounting profits only",
          "Losses"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Free entry and exit ensure that in long-run equilibrium, firms earn zero economic profit (normal profit only), where they cover all costs including opportunity costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long-run equilibrium condition for a perfectly competitive firm is:",
        "options": [
          "$P = MC = ATC$",
          "$P = MC > ATC$",
          "$P = MC < ATC$",
          "$P > MC = ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium: $P = MC$ (profit maximization) and $P = ATC$ (zero economic profit), so $P = MC = ATC$ at the minimum point of ATC."
      },

          "Firms will exit the industry",
          "New firms will enter the industry",
          "Prices will increase further",
          "Costs will decrease automatically"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic profits attract new firms to enter, increasing market supply and driving down the market price until economic profits are eliminated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If firms in a perfectly competitive industry are incurring economic losses, in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "Firms will enter the industry",
          "Some firms will exit the industry",

          "The output where MR is maximized"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Competitive pressure forces firms to produce at the minimum point of their average total cost curve, achieving productive efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Allocative efficiency is achieved in perfect competition because:",
        "options": [
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$MR = MC$",
          "$P = AVC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency means resources are allocated to produce the goods and services most valued by society. This occurs when $P = MC$, the value to consumers equals the cost of production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Productive efficiency is achieved in perfect competition because:",
        "options": [

          "Perfectly inelastic (vertical)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a constant-cost industry, expansion doesn't affect input prices, so firms' cost curves remain unchanged, and the long-run supply curve is horizontal at $P = min(ATC)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an increasing-cost industry, the long-run supply curve is:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In increasing-cost industries, expansion drives up input prices, raising firms' cost curves, so higher prices are needed to induce more output in the long run."
      },

          "Firms are indifferent about entry/exit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With zero economic profit, there's no incentive for new firms to enter or existing firms to exit - the industry is in stable equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long-run adjustment process ensures that market price always returns to:",
        "options": [

          "The break-even price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Entry and exit forces drive price to the minimum ATC in the long run, where firms earn zero economic profit."

          "Market price will remain unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cost reductions create temporary economic profits, attracting entry until market price falls to the new, lower minimum ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, consumer surplus is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximized",
          "Minimized",
          "Zero",
          "Equal to producer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition maximizes total economic surplus, and with $P = MC$, consumer surplus is maximized given the cost structure."

          "Higher price and same quantity",
          "Same price and higher quantity",
          "Higher price and higher quantity",
          "Lower price and higher quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In constant-cost industries, long-run supply is perfectly elastic, so increased demand leads to more firms entering but price returns to original minimum ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Normal profit represents:",
        "options": [

          "Decreasing returns to scale"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Firms produce at the minimum of their long-run average cost curve, meaning they've chosen the optimal plant size for their output level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply curve because:",

          "Prices are fixed in the long run",
          "Demand is more elastic in the long run",
          "Costs decrease over time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the long run, firms can enter or exit and adjust all inputs, making quantity supplied more responsive to price changes."
      },

          "Is earning exactly normal profit",
          "Cannot cover its variable costs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Zero economic profit means the firm is earning exactly normal profit - enough to cover all costs including the opportunity cost of resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key difference between short-run and long-run in perfect competition is:",
        "options": [
          "The profit-maximization rule",
          "The ability of firms to enter or exit",
          "The shape of the demand curve",
          "The calculation of marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the short run, the number of firms is fixed. In the long run, firms can enter or exit, which is the mechanism that drives economic profit to zero."
