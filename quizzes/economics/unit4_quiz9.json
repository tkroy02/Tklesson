      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do luxury hotels often charge high prices even when they have vacant rooms?",
        "options": [
          "They don't understand elasticity concepts",
          "Demand is inelastic among their target customers",
          "They want to maintain exclusivity and brand image",
          "Both B and C"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Luxury hotels face inelastic demand from wealthy customers who value exclusivity. Lowering prices might attract different customer segments and damage their premium brand positioning."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Farmers sometimes destroy crops rather than sell them at low prices because:",
        "options": [
          "They enjoy wasting food",
          "Agricultural demand is often inelastic",
          "It costs more to harvest than the crops are worth",
          "Both B and C"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Agricultural demand is typically inelastic, so price decreases don't significantly increase quantity demanded. Sometimes harvesting costs exceed market value, making destruction economically rational."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do airlines use complex yield management systems with constantly changing prices?",
        "options": [
          "To confuse customers",
          "Because demand elasticity varies by time, route, and customer type",
          "They enjoy complicated pricing",
          "Government requires it"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Airlines face different demand elasticities - business travelers have inelastic demand (will pay more for flexibility) while leisure travelers have elastic demand (will shop for deals)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Pharmaceutical companies can charge high prices for patented drugs because:",
        "options": [
          "Demand is perfectly elastic",
          "Demand is highly inelastic for life-saving medications",
          "They want to help poor people",
          "Production costs are extremely high"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Life-saving drugs have highly inelastic demand - consumers will pay almost any price when their health is at stake, allowing patent holders to charge premium prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do movie theaters charge high prices for popcorn and concessions?",
        "options": [
          "The popcorn is exceptionally high quality",
          "Demand for concessions is relatively inelastic once customers are in the theater",
          "They want to drive customers away",
          "Production costs are astronomical"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Once inside the theater, customers have limited alternatives, making concession demand inelastic. This allows theaters to charge high margins while keeping ticket prices competitive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Gasoline prices often rise quickly but fall slowly because:",
        "options": [
          "Oil companies are greedy",
          "Demand is relatively inelastic in the short run",
          "Supply is perfectly elastic",
          "Government controls gasoline pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gasoline demand is inelastic - consumers need to drive regardless of price. This allows suppliers to raise prices without losing many customers, and they're slow to lower prices since demand won't increase much."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do software companies often offer student discounts?",
        "options": [
          "They love students",
          "Student demand is more price elastic than corporate demand",
          "Students can't afford regular prices",
          "It's required by educational institutions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Students have more elastic demand due to budget constraints, while businesses have inelastic demand for essential software. Price discrimination maximizes revenue from both segments."
      },

        "question": "During natural disasters, why do prices for essential goods like water and generators often spike?",
        "options": [
          "Sellers are exploiting the situation",
          "Demand becomes highly inelastic during emergencies",
          "Supply becomes perfectly elastic",
          "Government encourages price increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In emergencies, essential goods become necessities with no substitutes, making demand extremely inelastic. Higher prices help ration scarce supplies to those who value them most."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do companies often lower prices for new technology products over time?",
        "options": [
          "Production costs always decrease",
          "Demand becomes more elastic as substitutes emerge and markets saturate",

          "Government price controls take effect"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Early adopters have inelastic demand and will pay premium prices. As markets mature, demand becomes more elastic due to competition and saturation, requiring lower prices to maintain sales."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are cigarette taxes often very high despite concerns about regressivity?",
        "options": [
          "Governments want to encourage smoking",
          "Cigarette demand is relatively inelastic, generating substantial revenue",
          "Tobacco companies lobby for higher taxes",
          "It's the only way to reduce consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Addiction makes cigarette demand inelastic, so high taxes generate significant government revenue without causing large decreases in consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do restaurants often have 'early bird' specials?",
        "options": [

          "Demand is more elastic during off-peak hours",
          "Food is lower quality in the evening",
          "Chefs prefer working early shifts"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Demand during peak dinner hours is relatively inelastic, while early diners are more price-sensitive. Lower prices fill tables during slow periods without sacrificing peak-hour revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do luxury car manufacturers rarely offer significant discounts?",
        "options": [
          "Their production costs are too high",
          "Price reductions would signal lower quality to status-conscious buyers",

          "All luxury car buyers are extremely wealthy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods often have Veblen good characteristics where higher prices signal status. Price cuts could reduce perceived exclusivity and actually decrease demand among status-conscious consumers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do utility companies (water, electricity) typically have regulated pricing?",
        "options": [
          "Their services have highly inelastic demand",
          "They are natural monopolies",
          "Unregulated they could exploit their market power",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Utilities face inelastic demand for essential services and are often natural monopolies. Without regulation, they could charge excessively high prices, hence government oversight is necessary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do companies like Apple maintain high prices for their products despite competition?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Single-payer healthcare systems and government negotiating power make demand more elastic in other countries, forcing lower prices compared to the fragmented US market with more inelastic demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do supermarkets often sell 'loss leaders'?",
        "options": [
          "They make accounting errors",
          "To attract customers who will also buy other items with more inelastic demand",
          "They want to get rid of old inventory",
          "Government requires certain items be sold below cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Loss leaders have elastic demand and attract price-sensitive shoppers. Once in the store, customers buy other items with more inelastic demand, increasing overall profitability."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental business lesson from elasticity applications is that:",
        "options": [
          "Higher prices always increase profits",
          "Understanding customer price sensitivity is crucial for pricing strategy",
          "All products should be priced the same way",
          "Elasticity concepts don't work in the real world"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Successful businesses understand that different products and customer segments have different price sensitivities, and optimal pricing strategies must account for these variations in elasticity."
