          "Competitor pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The time period is the most crucial determinant - supply becomes more elastic as producers have more time to adjust their production processes and capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Supply becomes more elastic over longer time periods because:",
