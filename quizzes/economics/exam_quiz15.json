      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the supply of a commodity is caused by:",
        "options": [
          "Improvements in technology",
          "A rise in the commodity's own price",
          "An increase in consumer income",
          "An increase in the cost of raw materials"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Technology improvements lower production costs, shifting the supply curve rightward (increase in supply)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When price is below equilibrium level, there will be:",
        "options": [
          "Surplus commodity in the market",
          "Shortage of commodity in the market",
          "Supply curve will shift",
          "Demand curve will shift"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At a price below equilibrium, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, causing a shortage."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The following are causes of shift in demand EXCEPT:",
        "options": [
          "Change in income",
          "Change in price",
          "Change in fashion",
          "Change in prices of substitutes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A change in the good’s own price causes movement along the demand curve, not a shift of the demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When demand is perfectly inelastic, an increase in price will result in:",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in total revenue",
          "An increase in total revenue",
          "No change in total revenue",
          "A decrease in quantity demanded"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic demand means quantity demanded does not change when price changes, so total revenue (= price × quantity) rises when price rises."
