    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The labor supply curve typically shows the relationship between:",
        "options": [
          "Wage rate and quantity of labor demanded",
          "Wage rate and quantity of labor supplied",
          "Product price and labor productivity",
          "Education level and worker earnings"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The labor supply curve graphs the wage rate (vertical axis) against the quantity of labor workers are willing to supply (horizontal axis)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an individual worker, the labor supply curve is based on the:",
        "options": [
          "Firm's production function",
          "Work-leisure trade-off",
          "Government labor policies",
          "International wage rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Individual labor supply decisions involve trading off work (income) against leisure time, with the wage rate representing the price of leisure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The substitution effect of a wage increase causes workers to:",
        "options": [
          "Work less hours",
          "Work more hours",
          "Not change their work hours",
          "Switch to different jobs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The substitution effect makes leisure more expensive (higher opportunity cost), encouraging workers to substitute work for leisure."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The income effect of a wage increase causes workers to:",

          "Work more hours",
          "Not change their work hours",
          "Demand higher benefits"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The income effect makes workers feel richer with the same hours worked, increasing demand for normal goods including leisure, thus reducing work hours."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A backward-bending labor supply curve occurs when:",
        "options": [

          "Workers have unlimited leisure time",
          "There is no income effect"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At high wage levels, the income effect (desire for more leisure) can overcome the substitution effect (incentive to work more), causing the curve to bend backward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a standard labor supply graph, the vertical axis represents:",

          "Higher income taxes",
          "A decrease in population"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Immigration increases the number of workers willing to work at each wage rate, shifting the supply curve rightward."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The reservation wage is:",
        "options": [

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in non-labor income (such as inheritance) would cause the labor supply curve to:",

          "Become steeper",
          "Not be affected"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher non-labor income increases the demand for leisure, reducing labor supply at each wage rate and shifting the curve leftward."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The substitution effect is strongest for:",
        "options": [

          "Low-wage workers with limited income",
          "Retired individuals",
          "People with high non-labor income"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Low-wage workers are more responsive to wage changes because they have stronger incentives to increase work hours to raise their standard of living."

          "Controlling worker productivity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher labor force participation means more people are willing to work at each wage rate, shifting the supply curve rightward."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a backward-bending labor supply curve, the upward-sloping portion indicates:",

          "The market is in equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The upward-sloping portion occurs at lower wage levels where the substitution effect (work more when wages rise) dominates the income effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Changes in social norms regarding women working would affect labor supply by:",

          "The slope of the labor demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Labor supply elasticity = % change in quantity supplied ÷ % change in wage. It indicates how sensitive workers are to wage changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly inelastic labor supply curve would be:",

          "Upward sloping",
          "Backward bending"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A vertical supply curve means quantity supplied does not change when the wage changes - perfectly inelastic supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in income tax rates would likely cause the labor supply curve to:",

          "Not change position"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher income taxes reduce the net wage, making work less attractive and reducing labor supply at each gross wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The market labor supply curve for a specific occupation is generally:",
        "options": [
          "More elastic than individual supply curves",
          "Less elastic than individual supply curves",
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "Always backward bending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Market supply is more elastic because workers can move between occupations in response to wage differences, while individuals face more constraints."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: the work-leisure choice, substitution vs. income effects, and factors that shift vs. move along the supply curve.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that labor supply involves trading off work (income) against leisure, and workers respond to both substitution and income effects of wage changes."
