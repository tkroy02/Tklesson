    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good when it:",
        "options": [
          "Has the lowest opportunity cost for that good",
          "Can produce more output per unit of input than other countries",
          "Has specialized in that good historically",
          "Has the largest domestic market for that good"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Absolute advantage is about productivity - the ability to produce more output using the same amount of resources (or the same output using fewer resources) compared to other producers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Absolute advantage is primarily concerned with:",
        "options": [
          "Relative efficiency and opportunity costs",
          "Absolute productivity levels",
          "Consumer preferences",
          "Government trade policies"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Absolute advantage focuses on absolute productivity - how much output can be produced with given inputs, without considering the trade-offs or opportunity costs of producing other goods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country A can produce 50 cars with 100 workers and Country B can produce 40 cars with 100 workers, which country has absolute advantage in car production?",
        "options": [
          "Country A",
          "Country B",
          "Both countries",
          "Neither country"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Country A produces more cars (50) with the same number of workers (100), so Country A has absolute advantage in car production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country can have absolute advantage in producing a good without having comparative advantage if:",
        "options": [
          "Its opportunity cost is higher than other countries",
          "Its productivity is lower than other countries",
          "It has no natural resources",
          "Transportation costs are too high"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A country can be the most productive (absolute advantage) but still have a higher opportunity cost for that good, meaning another country has comparative advantage despite lower absolute productivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which concept is more important for determining the pattern of trade?",
        "options": [
          "Absolute advantage",
          "Comparative advantage",
          "Labor productivity alone",
          "Resource abundance"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage (differences in opportunity costs) determines trade patterns, not absolute advantage. Countries trade based on their relative efficiencies, not absolute productivity levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country X: 1 worker produces 10 computers or 20 shirts. Country Y: 1 worker produces 8 computers or 16 shirts. Which statement is correct?",
        "options": [
          "Country X has absolute advantage in both goods",
          "Country Y has comparative advantage in computers",
          "No trade is beneficial",
          "Country X has comparative advantage in shirts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Country X produces more of both goods per worker (10 computers vs 8, 20 shirts vs 16), so Country X has absolute advantage in both goods. However, both have the same opportunity costs (1 computer = 2 shirts in both countries), so no comparative advantage exists."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Absolute advantage is typically measured by:",
        "options": [

          "Total production capacity",
          "Market prices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Absolute advantage is measured by productivity - output per unit of input (such as output per worker, output per hour, or output per unit of capital)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country has absolute advantage in all goods, it:",
        "options": [
          "Should not trade with other countries",
          "Can still benefit from trade",
          "Has comparative advantage in all goods",
          "Will dominate world markets completely"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Even with absolute advantage in all goods, a country can benefit from trade by specializing in goods where it has the greatest comparative advantage (lowest opportunity cost) and importing other goods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of absolute advantage was originally developed by:",
        "options": [

          "Adam Smith",
          "John Maynard Keynes",
          "Karl Marx"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Adam Smith developed the concept of absolute advantage in 'The Wealth of Nations' (1776), arguing that countries should specialize in goods they can produce most efficiently."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which situation demonstrates absolute advantage but not comparative advantage?",
        "options": [
          "A country has lower opportunity costs for all goods",
          "A country is more productive but has identical opportunity costs",
          "A country has higher productivity and lower opportunity costs",
          "A country has specialized in production historically"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When countries have different productivity levels but identical opportunity cost ratios, one has absolute advantage but no comparative advantage exists, so no beneficial trade is possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the real world, absolute advantage helps explain:",
        "options": [
          "Why some countries are rich and others poor",
          "The complete pattern of international trade",
          "Why all countries benefit equally from trade",
          "The elimination of opportunity costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute advantage differences help explain income differences between countries - countries with higher productivity (absolute advantage) tend to have higher standards of living."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A company has absolute advantage in production when it:",
        "options": [
          "Has the lowest prices in the market",
          "Can produce at lower cost than competitors",
          "Uses more advanced technology than others",
          "Has monopoly power in its industry"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At the firm level, absolute advantage typically comes from technological superiority that allows higher productivity - producing more output with the same inputs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country A's worker produces 6 tons of wheat or 3 tons of steel, and Country B's worker produces 4 tons of wheat or 2 tons of steel:",
        "options": [
          "Country A has absolute advantage in both goods",
          "Country B has comparative advantage in wheat",
          "Trade will benefit both countries equally",
          "Country A should export steel to Country B"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Country A produces more of both goods per worker (6 wheat vs 4, 3 steel vs 2), so Country A has absolute advantage in both. However, both have the same opportunity cost (1 steel = 2 wheat), so no comparative advantage exists."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main limitation of using absolute advantage to explain trade patterns is that it:",
        "options": [
          "Cannot explain why countries with lower productivity still export goods",
          "Doesn't account for productivity differences",
          "Overemphasizes the role of opportunity costs",
          "Only applies to agricultural products"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute advantage alone cannot explain why countries that are less productive in all goods still export successfully. Comparative advantage explains this by focusing on relative opportunity costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Labor productivity is a key measure of absolute advantage because it:",
        "options": [
          "Shows opportunity costs directly",
          "Measures output per worker",
          "Determines comparative advantage",
          "Reflects consumer preferences"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Labor productivity (output per worker per time period) is a common measure of absolute advantage since it directly shows how productive workers are in different countries or industries."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Countries often try to develop absolute advantage in key industries through:",
        "options": [
          "Eliminating all trade barriers",
          "Investing in education and technology",
          "Focusing only on comparative advantage",
          "Reducing labor costs only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Countries invest in education, technology, infrastructure, and research to increase productivity and develop absolute advantages in high-value industries."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In modern global trade, absolute advantage is particularly important for:",
        "options": [
          "Determining which goods get traded",
          "Explaining wage differences between countries",
          "Eliminating all competition",
          "Making opportunity costs irrelevant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Differences in absolute advantage (productivity) help explain why wages differ across countries - workers in high-productivity countries typically earn higher wages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two countries have different absolute advantages but identical comparative advantages:",
        "options": [
          "Substantial trade will occur",
          "No mutually beneficial trade is possible",
          "Only one country will benefit from trade",
          "Trade will benefit both countries equally"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When opportunity cost ratios are identical (same comparative advantage), no basis for mutually beneficial trade exists, regardless of differences in absolute productivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between absolute advantage and standards of living is that:",
        "options": [
          "Countries with absolute advantage in many goods have higher living standards",
          "Absolute advantage has no effect on living standards",
          "Only comparative advantage affects living standards",
          "Low-productivity countries always have high living standards"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Countries with higher productivity (absolute advantage) in many sectors can produce more goods and services per person, leading to higher material standards of living."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country can gain absolute advantage through:",
        "options": [
          "Lowering its opportunity costs only",
          "Improving technology and worker skills",
          "Increasing its population size only",
          "Eliminating international trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Countries develop absolute advantage by investing in technology, education, infrastructure, and innovation that increase productivity - the amount that can be produced with available resources."
