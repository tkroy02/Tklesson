    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of supply states that, all other factors being equal:",
        "options": [
          "As price increases, quantity supplied decreases",
          "As price increases, quantity supplied increases",
          "Price and quantity supplied have no relationship",
          "Supply remains constant regardless of price changes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The law of supply describes the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied - when the price of a good rises, producers are willing to supply more, and vice versa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A supply curve typically slopes upward because:",
        "options": [
          "Consumers buy less at higher prices",
          "Higher prices make production more profitable, encouraging increased output",
          "Government regulations require upward-sloping curves",
          "Demand curves always slope downward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The upward slope reflects producers' profit motivation - higher prices increase potential profits, making it worthwhile to produce more, even if it means higher production costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause a movement along the supply curve for wheat?",
        "options": [
          "A change in technology for farming equipment",
          "A change in the price of wheat",
          "A change in the price of corn (alternative crop)",
          "A change in weather conditions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A change in the good's own price causes movement along the supply curve. Changes in other factors (technology, input prices, etc.) shift the entire supply curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the market price of smartphones increases from $500 to $700, what happens to quantity supplied?",
        "options": [
          "Quantity supplied decreases",
          "Quantity supplied increases",
          "Supply decreases",
          "Supply increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the law of supply, a price increase leads to an increase in quantity supplied. This is movement along the supply curve, not a shift of the supply curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The profit incentive is the primary reason supply curves slope upward because:",
        "options": [
          "Higher prices allow producers to cover increasing marginal costs",
          "Consumers always buy more at lower prices",
          "Government subsidizes production at higher prices",
          "Input costs decrease as production increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As production increases, marginal costs typically rise due to capacity constraints. Higher prices make it profitable to produce these additional, more expensive units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If production technology improves, the supply curve will:",

          "Become flatter"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Improved technology reduces production costs, making producers willing to supply more at each price level, shifting the supply curve to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A supply schedule shows: Price $10 - Quantity 100; Price $15 - Quantity 200; Price $20 - Quantity 300. This demonstrates:",

          "A change in supply",
          "Market equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This shows the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied - as price increases, quantity supplied increases, illustrating the law of supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If input costs (raw materials, labor) increase, the supply curve will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift to the left",
          "Shift to the right",
          "Become steeper",
          "Become flatter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher input costs make production more expensive, reducing the quantity producers are willing to supply at each price, shifting the supply curve to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a standard supply curve graph, which variable is plotted on the vertical axis?",
        "options": [
          "Quantity supplied",
          "Price",
          "Production costs",
          "Time"

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In economics, price is always plotted on the vertical (y) axis and quantity on the horizontal (x) axis, following the mathematical convention established by Alfred Marshall."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between a 'change in supply' and a 'change in quantity supplied' is that:",
        "options": [
          "A change in supply involves movement along the curve, while a change in quantity supplied shifts the curve",
          "A change in supply shifts the curve, while a change in quantity supplied involves movement along the curve",
          "Both terms mean the same thing",
          "Only quantity supplied can change, supply is always fixed"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A change in supply refers to a shift of the entire supply curve due to non-price factors. A change in quantity supplied refers to movement along the curve due to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the number of producers in a market increases, the market supply curve will:",

          "Become flatter"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More producers means more total production capacity at each price level, increasing overall market supply and shifting the supply curve to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly inelastic supply curve would appear on a graph as:",

          "A downward-sloping line"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic supply means quantity supplied does not change at all when price changes, represented by a vertical supply curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If producers expect prices to rise significantly in the future, current supply will:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease (supply curve shifts left)",
          "Increase (supply curve shifts right)",
          "Not change",
          "Become perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expectations of future price increases encourage producers to reduce current supply and wait to sell when prices are higher, shifting the current supply curve to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The area above the supply curve but below the market price represents:",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run supply curve is typically more inelastic than the long-run supply curve because:",
        "options": [
          "Producers can't quickly adjust their production capacity",
          "Consumers are less responsive in the short run",
          "Prices are fixed in the short run",
          "Government controls short-run production"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the short run, producers face fixed factors of production and cannot easily expand capacity, making supply less responsive to price changes."

          "Decreased supply",
          "Increased supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A flatter supply curve indicates greater price elasticity - quantity supplied is more responsive to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main determinants of supply that shift the supply curve include all EXCEPT:",

          "Number of sellers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The good's own price causes movement along the supply curve. The other factors are supply shifters that move the entire curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of supply holds true because producers:",
        "options": [
          "Always want to maximize consumer satisfaction",
          "Face increasing opportunity costs as they produce more",
          "Have unlimited production capacity",
          "Are required by law to increase output when prices rise"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As producers increase output, they typically use resources that are less suited to that production (increasing opportunity costs), so they require higher prices to justify producing additional units."
