      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm's production technology becomes more labor-augmenting, what happens to the marginal revenue product (MRP) curve?",
        "options": [
          "Shifts leftward and becomes steeper",
          "Shifts rightward as each worker becomes more productive",
          "Becomes perfectly elastic",
          "Unchanged because only capital productivity matters"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Labor-augmenting technology increases the productivity of each worker, raising MRP at every employment level and shifting the labor demand curve rightward."
