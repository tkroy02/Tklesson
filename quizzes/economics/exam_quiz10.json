        "question": "The offer curves introduced by Alfred Marshall help us to understand how the _______ is established in international trade.",
        "options": [
          "Terms of trade",
          "Equilibrium price ratio",
          "Exchange rate",
          "Satisfaction level"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Offer curves show the quantities of imports a country demands and exports it supplies at various terms of trade, helping determine the equilibrium terms of trade."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Demand for factors of production is:",
        "options": [
          "Derived demand",
          "Joint demand",
          "Composite demand",
          "Aggregate demand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor demand is derived from the demand for the goods and services they help produce."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The producer’s demand for a factor of production is governed by the _______ of the factor.",
        "options": [
          "Price",
          "Marginal productivity",
          "Market supply",
          "Profitability"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In profit maximization, a firm hires factors up to the point where the factor's marginal revenue product equals its price, so demand depends on marginal productivity."
      },

          "MRP > VMP",
          "VMP > MRP",
          "None of the options"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, price equals marginal revenue (P = MR), so Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) equals Value of Marginal Product (VMP = P × MP)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When average product is at a maximum, marginal product is:",

          "Greater than average product"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When AP is at its maximum, MP equals AP. This is because MP intersects AP at AP’s highest point."

          "Utility",
          "Value",
          "Marginal Utility"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Utility is the economic term for the satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming a good or service."

        "question": "In the case of a monopolist applying price discrimination, the deadweight loss:",
        "options": [
          "can be zero",
          "will always be higher than in the case of perfect competition",
          "will always be higher than in the case of a monopolist that does not price discriminate",
          "is equal to the total consumer surplus in the case of perfect competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With perfect price discrimination, the monopolist produces the socially optimal output, eliminating deadweight loss."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a city, there are two car factories, Factory A and Factory B. Factory A can produce 100 red cars or 200 yellow cars per batch, while Factory B can produce 50 red cars or 150 yellow cars per batch. Which factory has the higher opportunity cost of producing one yellow car?",
        "options": [
          "Both factories have the same opportunity cost",
          "Factory A",
          "There is not enough information to answer",
          "Factory B"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For Factory A, opportunity cost of 1 yellow car = 100/200 = 0.5 red cars. For Factory B, it is 50/150 ≈ 0.33 red cars. 0.5 > 0.33, so Factory A has a higher opportunity cost."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "There are 4 consumers in the market for sweaters. Consumer 1 is willing to spend $40 on a sweater, Consumer 2 is willing to spend $35, Consumer 3 is willing to spend $25, and Consumer 4 is willing to spend $20. Each consumer only wants to buy one sweater. If the market price for sweaters is $28, what is the total consumer surplus in this market?",
        "options": [
          "Consumer surplus is equal to $19.",
          "Consumer surplus is equal to $16.",
          "Consumer surplus is equal to $8.",
          "It is impossible to calculate consumer surplus in this market without more information about the market demand curve."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only Consumers 1 and 2 buy sweaters. Consumer 1: $40 − $28 = $12 surplus. Consumer 2: $35 − $28 = $7 surplus. Total = $12 + $7 = $19."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Following an increase in price, which of the following would have the biggest impact on increasing the price elasticity of supply for a typical producer?",
        "options": [
          "The business can only operate in its ‘short run’",
          "There are stocks, but no spare capacity",
          "There are stocks and spare capacity",
          "There are no stocks, and no spare capacity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stocks allow quick sales without new production, and spare capacity allows rapid production increases—both make supply more responsive to price (higher PES)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the XED between two products is (+) infinity, then the goods are:",

          "Normal goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Infinite positive XED means consumers treat the goods as identical substitutes—any price difference leads to complete shift in demand."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The need for exchange exists because:",

          "Unemployment will fall as a result of exchange"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Specialization increases efficiency but requires exchange—people produce what they are best at and trade for other goods and services."

        "question": "Which of the following is not a positive statement?",

          "Falling prices can encourage consumer spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Good for consumers' is a value judgement (normative). The others describe cause-effect relationships that can be tested (positive)."
      },
