        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Offer curves show the quantities of imports a country demands and exports it supplies at various terms of trade, helping determine the equilibrium terms of trade."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In profit maximization, a firm hires factors up to the point where the factor's marginal revenue product equals its price, so demand depends on marginal productivity."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, price equals marginal revenue (P = MR), so Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) equals Value of Marginal Product (VMP = P × MP)."
