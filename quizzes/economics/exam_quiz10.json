        "question": "The offer curves introduced by Alfred Marshall help us to understand how the _______ is established in international trade.",
        "options": [
          "Terms of trade",
          "Equilibrium price ratio",
          "Exchange rate",
          "Satisfaction level"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Offer curves show the quantities of imports a country demands and exports it supplies at various terms of trade, helping determine the equilibrium terms of trade."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Demand for factors of production is:",
        "options": [
          "Derived demand",
          "Joint demand",
          "Composite demand",
          "Aggregate demand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor demand is derived from the demand for the goods and services they help produce."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The producer’s demand for a factor of production is governed by the _______ of the factor.",

          "Price",
          "Marginal productivity",
          "Market supply",
          "Profitability"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In profit maximization, a firm hires factors up to the point where the factor's marginal revenue product equals its price, so demand depends on marginal productivity."

          "VMP > MRP",
          "None of the options"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, price equals marginal revenue (P = MR), so Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) equals Value of Marginal Product (VMP = P × MP)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When average product is at a maximum, marginal product is:",

          "Equal to average product",
          "Greater than average product"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When AP is at its maximum, MP equals AP. This is because MP intersects AP at AP’s highest point."

          "Marginal Utility"

          "can be zero",
          "will always be higher than in the case of perfect competition",
          "will always be higher than in the case of a monopolist that does not price discriminate",
          "is equal to the total consumer surplus in the case of perfect competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With perfect price discrimination, the monopolist produces the socially optimal output, eliminating deadweight loss."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a city, there are two car factories, Factory A and Factory B. Factory A can produce 100 red cars or 200 yellow cars per batch, while Factory B can produce 50 red cars or 150 yellow cars per batch. Which factory has the higher opportunity cost of producing one yellow car?",
        "options": [
          "Both factories have the same opportunity cost",
          "Factory A",
          "There is not enough information to answer",
          "Factory B"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For Factory A, opportunity cost of 1 yellow car = 100/200 = 0.5 red cars. For Factory B, it is 50/150 ≈ 0.33 red cars. 0.5 > 0.33, so Factory A has a higher opportunity cost."

        "question": "There are 4 consumers in the market for sweaters. Consumer 1 is willing to spend $40 on a sweater, Consumer 2 is willing to spend $35, Consumer 3 is willing to spend $25, and Consumer 4 is willing to spend $20. Each consumer only wants to buy one sweater. If the market price for sweaters is $28, what is the total consumer surplus in this market?",
        "options": [
          "Consumer surplus is equal to $19.",
          "Consumer surplus is equal to $16.",
          "Consumer surplus is equal to $8.",
          "It is impossible to calculate consumer surplus in this market without more information about the market demand curve."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only Consumers 1 and 2 buy sweaters. Consumer 1: $40 − $28 = $12 surplus. Consumer 2: $35 − $28 = $7 surplus. Total = $12 + $7 = $19."
