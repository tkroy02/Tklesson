          "Market supply and demand curves"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Game theory studies strategic situations where the outcome of a decision depends on the choices of multiple interdependent players."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In game theory, players are assumed to be:",
        "options": [
          "Always cooperative",
          "Rational and self-interested",
          "Altruistic and generous",
          "Unaware of other players' actions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Game theory typically assumes rational players who act to maximize their own payoffs, considering others' likely actions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Nash equilibrium occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "All players receive their highest possible payoff",
          "No player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing strategy",
          "Players cooperate to maximize joint payoffs",
          "One player dominates all others"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Nash equilibrium, each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies chosen by other players, with no incentive to deviate unilaterally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Prisoner's Dilemma demonstrates that:",
        "options": [
          "Cooperation always leads to the best outcome",
          "Individual rationality can lead to collective inefficiency",
          "Games always have dominant strategies",
          "Players should never confess"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Prisoner's Dilemma shows how individually rational decisions (confessing) can lead to a worse collective outcome than cooperation (both remaining silent)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the classic Prisoner's Dilemma, the dominant strategy for each prisoner is to:",
        "options": [
          "Remain silent",
          "Confess",
          "Flip a coin randomly",
          "Wait for the other to move first"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Confessing is dominant because it yields a better outcome regardless of what the other prisoner does, though mutual confession is worse than mutual silence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A dominant strategy is one that:",
        "options": [
          "All players must use",
          "Yields the highest payoff no matter what others do",
          "Is only optimal if others cooperate",
          "Leads to the socially optimal outcome"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A strategy is dominant if it provides a player with their best payoff regardless of the strategies chosen by other players."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a simultaneous-move game, players:",
        "options": [
          "Take turns making decisions",
          "Make decisions at the same time without knowing others' choices",
          "Know all previous moves before deciding",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In simultaneous-move games, players choose their strategies at the same time, without knowledge of what others have chosen."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In game theory, a zero-sum game is one where:",
        "options": [
          "All players get zero payoff",
          "One player's gain equals another's loss",
          "No Nash equilibrium exists",
          "Players have identical payoffs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In zero-sum games, the total payoff is constant, so one player's gain is exactly offset by another player's loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of 'tit-for-tat' strategy involves:",
        "options": [
          "Always cooperating regardless of others' actions",
          "Always defecting to maximize individual payoff",
          "Matching the other player's previous move",
          "Randomly choosing between cooperate and defect"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Tit-for-tat means starting with cooperation and then doing whatever the other player did in the previous round, promoting reciprocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In sequential games, players:",
        "options": [

          "Always choose dominant strategies"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sequential games involve players moving in sequence, with later players able to observe earlier moves before making their decisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Backward induction in sequential games involves:",

          "Choosing strategies randomly",
          "Always cooperating in the first move",
          "Ignoring other players' potential responses"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Backward induction works backward from the final decision points to determine optimal strategies at each stage of the game."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A subgame perfect equilibrium is:",
        "options": [
          "Any Nash equilibrium in a game",
          "A Nash equilibrium that remains optimal in every subgame",
          "The first move in a sequential game",
          "A cooperative outcome in repeated games"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Subgame perfect equilibrium requires that players' strategies form a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the original game."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In repeated games, cooperation is more likely when:",
        "options": [
          "The game is played only once",
          "Players are anonymous",
          "The future is heavily discounted",
          "Players interact repeatedly and value future payoffs"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Repeated interactions allow players to use strategies like tit-for-tat to punish defection and reward cooperation over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'folk theorem' in game theory suggests that:",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In oligopoly markets, game theory helps explain why:",
        "options": [
          "Firms always charge competitive prices",
          "Collusion is difficult to maintain",
          "Barriers to entry don't matter",
          "Firms never advertise"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Game theory models like the Prisoner's Dilemma explain why cartel members have incentives to cheat on agreements, making collusion unstable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mixed strategy involves:",

          "Using dominated strategies occasionally",
          "Changing strategies mid-game"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In mixed strategies, players randomize their choices according to specific probabilities to keep opponents uncertain."
      },

          "Games with no Nash equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In sequential games, the first mover may gain advantage by committing to a strategy that influences later players' decisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of oligopoly, game theory predicts that price wars:",
        "options": [
          "Never occur in rational markets",
          "Can occur as non-cooperative equilibria",
          "Always benefit consumers",
          "Are prevented by government regulation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Game theory models show how price wars can emerge as Nash equilibria when firms independently choose aggressive pricing strategies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key insight of game theory for business strategy is that:",
        "options": [
          "Firms should always minimize costs",
          "Optimal decisions depend on competitors' likely responses",
          "Market share is the only important goal",
          "Advertising never affects consumer behavior"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Game theory emphasizes that in strategic environments, a firm's best choice depends on anticipating and responding to competitors' actions."
