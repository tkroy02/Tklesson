    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country's national debt is best described as a ______, while the annual budget deficit is a ______.",
        "options": [
          "Flow variable; stock variable",
          "Stock variable; flow variable",
          "Monetary variable; fiscal variable",
          "Liability; asset"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The national debt is a stock—it's the total accumulated amount owed at a point in time (like the water in a bathtub). The deficit is a flow—it's the amount added to the debt over a specific period, like a year (like the water flowing in)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a government runs a primary budget surplus, it means the government:",
        "options": [
          "Is reducing the total national debt.",
          "Has revenues sufficient to cover all spending except interest on the existing debt.",
          "Is running an expansionary fiscal policy.",
          "Has a negative debt-to-GDP ratio."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary balance is revenue minus non-interest spending. A primary surplus indicates that current tax revenues are enough to fund all government programs; the government only needs to borrow to pay the interest on the debt it has already accumulated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'burden of the debt' is considered lower if the debt is largely:",
        "options": [
          "Held by foreign investors and governments.",
          "Financed by printing new money.",
          "Owned by a country's own citizens and institutions.",
          "Accumulated during a period of war."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When debt is internally held, the interest payments are transfers within the country—from taxpayers to bondholders. While this may have distributional effects, it does not represent a direct drain of resources from the national economy, unlike payments to foreign creditors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country's debt-to-GDP ratio is most likely to decrease if:",
        "options": [
          "The government runs a small deficit and nominal GDP growth is zero.",
          "The government runs a large surplus and nominal GDP is stagnant.",
          "The government runs a small deficit and nominal GDP growth is strong.",
          "The government runs a balanced budget and nominal GDP is falling."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The debt-to-GDP ratio falls when the denominator (GDP) grows faster than the numerator (debt). Even with a small deficit (which increases the debt), robust nominal GDP growth can cause the ratio to decline, as the economy's capacity to support the debt is growing faster than the debt itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of 'fiscal sustainability' primarily concerns whether a government:",
        "options": [
          "Can balance its budget every year.",
          "Can meet its future financial obligations without resorting to excessive money creation or default.",
          "Has a debt-to-GDP ratio of zero.",
          "Spends more on investment than on consumption."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fiscal sustainability is about the long-run path. A sustainable fiscal position means the government can continue servicing its debt (paying interest) and funding its programs without triggering a fiscal crisis, high inflation from money printing, or a loss of creditor confidence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the 'Ricardian Equivalence' theory, government borrowing to finance a tax cut will:",
        "options": [
          "Lead to a significant increase in private consumption.",
          "Cause a one-for-one increase in private saving, leaving consumption unchanged.",
          "Result in immediate demand-pull inflation.",
          "Force the central bank to raise interest rates."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ricardian Equivalence posits that rational taxpayers see government borrowing as deferred taxation. They save the money from a tax cut to pay for the future taxes they expect will be needed to service the new debt, thus neutralizing the stimulative effect on consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A major risk associated with a high level of public debt held by foreigners is that it:",
        "options": [
          "Increases domestic control over economic policy.",
          "Makes the country vulnerable to sudden capital flight and currency crises.",
          "Guarantees lower interest rates on government bonds.",
          "Reduces the need for a domestic bond market."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Foreign investors can quickly lose confidence and sell a country's bonds, leading to a sharp currency depreciation and a spike in borrowing costs. This external vulnerability is a key difference between internally and externally held debt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the nominal interest rate on government bonds is 4% and the inflation rate is 2%, the real burden of servicing the debt:",
        "options": [
          "Is increasing because the nominal rate is positive.",
          "Is lower than the nominal burden because inflation erodes the real value of the debt.",
          "Is unaffected by inflation.",
          "Can only be determined by the central bank."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The real interest rate is approximately 2% (4% nominal - 2% inflation). Inflation reduces the real value of the outstanding debt. Therefore, the government's real cost of servicing that debt is lower than the nominal interest payments suggest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'crowding out' effect suggests that high levels of public debt can lead to:",
        "options": [
          "Lower interest rates and more private investment.",
          "Higher interest rates and reduced private investment.",
          "An increase in the national savings rate.",
          "A more efficient allocation of resources by the government."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To finance its debt, the government competes for funds in the loanable funds market, driving up interest rates. These higher rates can discourage businesses from borrowing for productive investments, thus 'crowding out' private investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'debt spiral' can occur when:",
        "options": [
          "The primary budget is in surplus for many years.",
          "High debt leads to high interest payments, which lead to larger deficits and even more debt.",
          "The central bank independently lowers interest rates.",
          "The economy is growing faster than the debt."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A debt spiral is a self-reinforcing cycle. High debt requires large interest payments, which worsen the deficit. To finance the larger deficit, the government must borrow more, increasing the debt further, and so on. This can lead to a loss of market confidence and a crisis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key argument made by proponents of 'Modern Monetary Theory' (MMT) regarding sovereign debt?",
        "options": [
          "Governments that borrow in their own currency can never be forced to default.",
          "The debt-to-GDP ratio is the only important metric for fiscal health.",
          "All public debt is inherently harmful and should be eliminated.",
          "Fiscal policy should always be subordinate to monetary policy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A core tenet of MMT is that a sovereign government with its own central bank and currency can always create money to pay its nominal obligations, making involuntary default technically impossible. The real constraint, they argue, is inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From an intergenerational equity perspective, the main concern about public debt is that it may:",
        "options": [
          "Benefit future generations at the expense of the current one.",
          "Transfer resources from future taxpayers to current bondholders.",
          "Always lead to higher economic growth for children and grandchildren.",
          "Make it easier for future generations to borrow."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If debt is used to finance current consumption, future generations are left with the tax liability to pay the interest, but without the offsetting benefit of the assets that were consumed. This represents a transfer of purchasing power from the future to the present."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'risk premium' on a country's government bonds is likely to increase if:",
        "options": [
          "The country's debt-to-GDP ratio is falling steadily.",
          "International investors perceive a higher risk of default or inflation.",
          "The country's central bank becomes more independent.",
          "The global demand for safe assets increases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The risk premium is the extra interest investors demand to compensate for the risk of default or the risk that inflation will erode the bond's value. Perceptions of higher risk, often due to political instability or unsustainable debt, directly increase this premium and the government's borrowing costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a government uses debt to finance productive public infrastructure, this can:",
        "options": [
          "Never be justified due to the burden of the debt.",
          "Increase the debt burden without any economic return.",
          "Be justified if the projects increase future GDP enough to service the additional debt.",
          "Only be effective if the debt is held entirely domestically."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Debt-financed public investment can be sustainable if it boosts the economy's long-term productive capacity (shifting LRAS). The higher future tax revenues from a larger economy can be used to service the debt, potentially leaving future generations better off despite the debt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country with a high debt-to-GDP ratio is often advised to pursue 'fiscal consolidation,' which typically means:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing spending and cutting taxes to stimulate growth.",
          "Raising taxes and/or cutting spending to reduce deficits.",
          "Printing money to pay off the debt directly.",
          "Defaulting on a portion of the debt to reduce the principal."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fiscal consolidation, or austerity, involves policies aimed at reducing government deficits and stabilizing debt. This is usually achieved through spending cuts and tax increases, though these policies can be contractionary in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'opportunity cost' of servicing a large public debt refers to the:",
        "options": [
          "Profit made by bondholders.",
          "Tax revenue that must be used for interest payments instead of public goods or tax cuts.",
          "Initial cost of the programs that created the deficit.",
          "Administrative cost of managing the bond issuances."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Money spent on interest payments is money that cannot be used for education, healthcare, infrastructure, or lower taxes. This trade-off is a key real-world cost of a high debt level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does it mean if a government is engaging in 'financial repression' to manage its debt?",
        "options": [
          "It is openly defaulting on its obligations.",
          "It is using regulations and policies to keep interest rates artificially low.",
          "It is running large primary surpluses to pay down the debt quickly.",
          "It is selling national assets to foreign investors."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Financial repression includes policies like capital controls, interest rate caps, and directed lending to the government. These measures force domestic savers to lend to the government at below-market rates, effectively transferring wealth from savers to the government to ease the debt burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sovereign default occurs when a government:",
        "options": [
          "Runs a budget deficit.",
          "Fails to make scheduled interest or principal payments on its debt.",
          "Sees its debt-to-GDP ratio exceed 100%.",
          "Prints money to finance its spending."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A sovereign default is a formal failure to meet the legal obligations of debt repayment. This is distinct from simply having high debt or financing it through inflation, which is a de facto reduction in the real value of the debt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between the total public debt and the publicly held debt is that the total debt includes:",
        "options": [
          "Debt owed to foreign governments.",
          "Debt held by government trust funds, like Social Security.",
          "Only debt with a maturity of less than one year.",
          "The debt of state and local governments."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The total (or gross) debt includes debt held by the public (individuals, corporations, the Fed, foreign governments) PLUS debt held by government accounts (like the Social Security Trust Fund, which is essentially the government owing money to itself)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, a government's ability to sustain its debt is primarily determined by the relationship between the:",
        "options": [
          "Deficit and the money supply.",
          "Interest rate on the debt and the growth rate of the economy.",
          "Level of taxes and the level of spending.",
          "Size of the domestic and foreign-held portions of the debt."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the average interest rate on the debt (r) is less than the nominal growth rate of the economy (g), the debt-to-GDP ratio can stabilize or even fall without needing primary surpluses. This is because the economy outgrows the cost of the debt. If r > g, the situation is more challenging."
