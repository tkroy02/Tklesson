    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The labor demand curve for an individual firm is graphically represented by:",
        "options": [
          "The marginal revenue product (MRP) curve",
          "The average product of labor curve",
          "The total product curve",
          "The wage supply curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a profit-maximizing firm, the labor demand curve is the MRP curve because the firm hires workers up to the point where $W = MRP$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a graph with wage on the vertical axis and quantity of labor on the horizontal axis, the labor demand curve slopes:",
        "options": [
          "Upward to the right",
          "Downward to the right",
          "Vertically",
          "Horizontally"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The labor demand curve slopes downward because as wages decrease, firms are willing to hire more workers (higher quantity demanded at lower prices)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A movement along the labor demand curve occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Technology improves",
          "The price of output changes",
          "The wage rate changes",
          "Worker productivity increases"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Changes in the wage rate cause movement along the demand curve, while other factors (technology, output price) shift the entire curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the market wage increases from $W_1$ to $W_2$, on the labor demand graph this causes:",
        "options": [
          "A rightward shift of the demand curve",
          "A leftward shift of the demand curve",
          "Movement upward along the demand curve",
          "Movement downward along the demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A wage increase causes upward movement along the demand curve, resulting in a lower quantity of labor demanded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The labor demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm in the product market is:",
        "options": [
          "The same as the VMP (value of marginal product) curve",
          "The same as the MRP curve but below VMP",
          "Perfectly elastic at the market wage",
          "Upward sloping"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For perfect competitors, $P = MR$, so $MRP = MP \\times P = VMP$, making the labor demand curve the same as the VMP curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopoly in the product market, the labor demand curve lies:",

          "On top of the VMP curve",
          "To the right of the VMP curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since monopolists have $MR < P$, their $MRP = MP \\times MR$ is less than $VMP = MP \\times P$, so labor demand is below VMP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in worker productivity would cause the labor demand curve to:",

          "Total revenue from output",
          "Economic profit",
          "Consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The area under the MRP curve represents total revenue attributable to labor, since MRP is the additional revenue from each worker."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a firm's output decreases, the labor demand curve will:",

          "Become steeper",
          "Not be affected"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower output price reduces MRP at each employment level, decreasing labor demand and shifting the curve leftward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The market labor demand curve is derived by:",
        "options": [

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At each wage rate, sum the quantities of labor demanded by all firms to get the market labor demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When graphing labor demand, the vertical distance between the MRP curve and the wage line at the profit-maximizing quantity represents:",
        "options": [
          "Total economic profit",
          "The marginal worker's contribution",
          "The rent earned by inframarginal workers",
          "Deadweight loss"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inframarginal workers (those hired before the last worker) have MRP > wage, creating economic rent - the surplus the firm earns from these workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A technological improvement that is labor-saving would cause the labor demand curve to:",
        "options": [
          "Shift rightward unambiguously",
          "Shift leftward unambiguously",
          "Shift rightward due to output effect but leftward due to substitution effect",
          "Become perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Labor-saving technology has conflicting effects: substitution effect reduces labor demand, but output effect (lower costs, more output) may increase it. The net effect is ambiguous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a labor demand graph, the firm's total wage bill is represented by:",
        "options": [
          "The area under the MRP curve",
          "The rectangle: wage × quantity of labor",
          "The triangle above the wage line",
          "The vertical intercept of the demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total wage cost = wage rate × quantity of labor hired, which is the area of the rectangle from the origin to the equilibrium point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If labor and capital are complements in production, an increase in the price of capital will cause the labor demand curve to:",

          "Shift leftward",
          "Become steeper",
          "Not change"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For complements, higher price of one input reduces demand for both inputs, shifting labor demand leftward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The elasticity of labor demand is reflected in the graph by:",

          "The vertical position of the curve",
          "The horizontal position of the curve",
          "The steepness of the curve",
          "The curvature of the curve"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Flatter demand curves are more elastic (quantity responds greatly to wage changes), while steeper curves are more inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run with fixed capital, the labor demand curve is:",

          "More elastic than in the long run",
          "Less elastic than in the long run",
          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Short-run labor demand is less elastic because firms cannot adjust capital, making substitution more difficult."

          "The total area under the demand curve",
          "The wage × quantity rectangle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The area above the wage and below the demand curve represents the surplus firms get from workers whose MRP exceeds their wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wage, on the labor demand graph this creates:",
        "options": [
          "A surplus of labor (unemployment)",
          "A shortage of labor",
          "Increased employment",
          "No change in the market"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the higher wage, quantity demanded decreases while quantity supplied increases, creating unemployment (surplus of labor)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The backward-bending labor supply curve, when combined with a typical labor demand curve, can result in:",

          "Multiple equilibrium wage points",
          "No equilibrium possible",
          "Perfectly competitive outcomes only",
          "Unambiguous employment effects"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "The wage differential"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The gap between VMP and MRP measures the firm's market power in the product market, since $VMP - MRP = MP \\times (P - MR)$."
