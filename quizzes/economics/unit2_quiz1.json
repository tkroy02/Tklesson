    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) shows:",
        "options": [
          "The price of goods in the market",
          "The maximum combinations of two goods an economy can produce given its resources",
          "Consumer preferences for products",
          "Government spending levels"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The PPF illustrates the maximum output combinations of two goods that can be produced with available resources and technology when resources are fully and efficiently utilized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Points on the PPF curve represent:",
        "options": [
          "Inefficient production",
          "Impossible production levels",
          "Efficient production using all available resources",
          "Unlimited production capacity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Points on the PPF represent efficient production—all resources are fully employed and used in the best possible way to maximize output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Points inside the PPF represent:",
        "options": [
          "Efficient production",
          "Inefficient production or unemployed resources",
          "Impossible production levels",
          "Maximum efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Points inside the PPF indicate inefficiency—resources are either unemployed (idle) or not used optimally, so more output could be produced without additional resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Points outside the PPF represent:",
        "options": [
          "Efficient production",
          "Inefficient production",
          "Currently unattainable production levels",
          "Historical production"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Points outside the PPF are currently impossible to achieve with existing resources and technology—they require economic growth through more resources or better technology."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The slope of the PPF represents:",
        "options": [
          "Consumer demand",
          "The opportunity cost of producing one good in terms of the other",
          "Government regulations",
          "Population growth"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The PPF's slope indicates the opportunity cost—how many units of one good must be given up to produce an additional unit of the other good."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a PPF is bowed outward (concave to the origin), this indicates:",
        "options": [
          "Constant opportunity cost",
          "Increasing opportunity cost",
          "Decreasing opportunity cost",
          "Zero opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A bowed-out PPF shows increasing opportunity cost—as production of one good increases, increasingly larger amounts of the other good must be sacrificed due to resource specialization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A straight-line PPF indicates:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing opportunity cost",
          "Decreasing opportunity cost",
          "Constant opportunity cost",
          "No opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A linear PPF shows constant opportunity cost—the trade-off between goods remains the same regardless of production levels, implying resources are equally suited to both goods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy produces on its PPF at point A (50 cars, 100 computers). Moving to point B (70 cars, 80 computers), the opportunity cost of 20 additional cars is:",
        "options": [
          "20 computers",
          "80 computers",
          "70 cars",
          "50 cars"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The opportunity cost is what was given up: $100 - 80 = 20$ computers were sacrificed to gain the 20 additional cars."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic growth would be represented on a PPF diagram by:",
        "options": [
          "A movement along the existing PPF",
          "A movement from inside to on the PPF",
          "An outward shift of the entire PPF",
          "An inward shift of the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economic growth (from more resources, better technology, or improved productivity) shifts the entire PPF outward, making previously unattainable production levels possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Moving from unemployment (point inside PPF) to full employment (point on PPF) represents:",
        "options": [
          "Economic growth",
          "Better resource utilization without growth",
          "Technological decline",
          "Decreased production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Moving from inside to on the PPF doesn't shift the frontier—it represents better use of existing resources (reducing unemployment or inefficiency) rather than growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the PPF typically bowed outward?",
        "options": [
          "Resources are equally productive in all uses",
          "Resources are specialized and not equally suited to producing different goods",
          "There are no opportunity costs",
          "Government mandates it"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The bowed shape reflects the law of increasing opportunity cost—resources are specialized, so shifting them from what they do best to other uses becomes increasingly costly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy can produce either 100 units of food or 50 units of clothing. If it currently produces 60 food and 20 clothing, this point is:",
        "options": [
          "On the PPF and efficient",
          "Outside the PPF and impossible",
          "Inside the PPF and inefficient",
          "Showing economic growth"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The maximum is 100 food or 50 clothing. Producing only 60 food and 20 clothing is below capacity, indicating the point is inside the PPF with unemployed or misallocated resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A PPF showing butter and guns illustrates:",
        "options": [
          "Only military decisions",
          "The trade-off between consumer goods and military goods",
          "Only economic growth",
          "International trade only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The classic 'guns and butter' PPF illustrates society's fundamental trade-off between military spending (guns) and civilian consumption (butter)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Technological improvement in producing computers only would:",
        "options": [
          "Shift the PPF outward at the computer axis",
          "Shift the PPF inward",
          "Not affect the PPF",
          "Make the PPF a straight line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Technology improving only one good shifts the PPF outward at that axis, creating a new intercept there while the other axis remains unchanged, making the PPF asymmetric."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy produces at point A on the PPF, moving to point B (also on the PPF) involves:",
        "options": [
          "Economic growth",
          "Increasing total production",
          "A reallocation of resources with opportunity cost",
          "Eliminating scarcity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Moving along the PPF reallocates resources between goods, increasing one while decreasing the other—illustrating opportunity cost without changing total productive capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The PPF assumes which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Unlimited resources",
          "Fixed resources and technology in the short run",
          "No opportunity costs exist",
          "Only one good can be produced"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The PPF assumes resources and technology are fixed (at least in the short run), illustrating how scarcity forces choices and creates opportunity costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy operating inside its PPF could reach the frontier by:",
        "options": [
          "Reducing production",
          "Decreasing efficiency",
          "Employing idle resources or improving resource allocation",
          "Doing nothing"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Operating inside the PPF means inefficiency or unemployment. Reaching the frontier requires employing idle resources or reallocating resources more effectively."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country that invests heavily in capital goods rather than consumer goods will likely:",
        "options": [
          "Experience no change in its PPF",
          "See its PPF shift outward faster in the future",
          "See its PPF shift inward",
          "Eliminate all opportunity costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Investing in capital goods (machinery, infrastructure) enhances future productive capacity, causing faster outward PPF shifts and higher future growth at the cost of current consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural disaster that destroys part of a country's resources would:",
        "options": [
          "Shift the PPF outward",
          "Shift the PPF inward",
          "Not affect the PPF",
          "Make the PPF a straight line"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Destruction of resources reduces productive capacity, shifting the PPF inward and making some previously attainable production combinations now impossible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main purpose of the PPF model is to illustrate:",
        "options": [
          "How to eliminate scarcity",
          "Scarcity, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and efficiency concepts",
          "Only government policy",
          "How to maximize profits"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The PPF is a fundamental model illustrating key economic concepts: scarcity (limited production), trade-offs (can't have everything), opportunity cost (slope), and efficiency (on vs. inside)."
