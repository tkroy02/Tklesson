    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In perfect competition, individual firms are described as:",
        "options": [
          "Price makers",
          "Price takers",
          "Price setters",
          "Price leaders"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Firms in perfect competition are price takers because each firm is so small relative to the market that it cannot influence the market price and must accept the price determined by market supply and demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand curve faced by an individual perfectly competitive firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Downward sloping",
          "Perfectly elastic (horizontal)",
          "Perfectly inelastic (vertical)",
          "Upward sloping"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Each firm faces a perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand curve at the market price because it can sell any quantity at that price but would sell nothing if it tried to charge a higher price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue equals:",
        "options": [
          "Price",
          "Average total cost",
          "Marginal cost only at equilibrium",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the firm can sell all output at the market price, each additional unit sold adds exactly the price to total revenue, so $MR = P$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm maximizes profit by producing where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$P = AVC$",
          "$MR = MC$",
          "$MC$ is minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Like all profit-maximizing firms, perfect competitors produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Since $MR = P$ in perfect competition, this is equivalent to $P = MC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a perfectly competitive firm will shut down if:",
        "options": [
          "$P < ATC$",
          "$P < AVC$",
          "$P < AFC$",
          "Economic profit is negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If price falls below average variable cost, the firm cannot cover its variable costs and should shut down immediately to minimize losses (fixed costs are sunk in the short run)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run supply curve for a perfectly competitive firm is:",
        "options": [
          "The entire $MC$ curve",
          "The $MC$ curve above the $ATC$ curve",
          "The $MC$ curve above the $AVC$ curve",
          "The $ATC$ curve above minimum point"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The firm will only produce if $P \\geq AVC$, so its supply curve is the portion of the $MC$ curve that lies above the minimum point of the $AVC$ curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, firms earn:",
        "options": [
          "Economic profits",
          "Normal profits (zero economic profit)",
          "Accounting profits only",
          "Losses"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Free entry and exit ensure that in long-run equilibrium, firms earn zero economic profit (normal profit only), where $P = ATC$ at the minimum point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, firms produce at:",
        "options": [
          "The point where $MC$ is minimized",
          "The minimum point of the $ATC$ curve",
          "The point where $AVC$ is minimized",
          "The profit-maximizing point regardless of cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Competitive pressure forces firms to produce at the minimum point of their average total cost curve, achieving productive efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If firms in a perfectly competitive market are earning economic profits, in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "Firms will exit the industry",
          "New firms will enter the industry",
          "Prices will increase",
          "Costs will decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic profits attract new firms to enter the industry, increasing market supply and driving down the market price until economic profits are eliminated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Allocative efficiency occurs in perfect competition because:",
        "options": [
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$MR = MC$",
          "$P = AVC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency means resources are allocated to produce the goods and services most valued by society. This occurs when $P = MC$, which happens in long-run competitive equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfectly competitive firm, if $P > ATC$ at the profit-maximizing output:",
        "options": [
          "The firm should shut down",
          "The firm is earning economic profits",
          "The firm is incurring losses",
          "The firm should decrease production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When price exceeds average total cost, the firm is earning economic profits because total revenue exceeds total cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The break-even point for a perfectly competitive firm occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = AVC$",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$MR = MC$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The break-even point is where the firm earns zero economic profit, which occurs when price equals average total cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If market demand increases in a perfectly competitive industry, in the short run:",
        "options": [
          "Firms will exit the industry",
          "Price will decrease and output will increase",
          "Price will increase and firms will increase output",
          "Firms will continue producing the same output"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increased demand shifts the market demand curve rightward, increasing market price. Existing firms respond by moving up their $MC$ curves to produce more output where $P = MC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In perfect competition, the market supply curve in the short run is:",
        "options": [
          "The horizontal sum of individual firms' $MC$ curves",
          "The vertical sum of individual firms' $ATC$ curves",
          "Always perfectly elastic",
          "Determined solely by market demand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The short-run market supply curve is the horizontal summation of all individual firms' supply curves (the portions of their $MC$ curves above $AVC$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A constant-cost industry is one where:",
        "options": [
          "Input prices increase as industry output expands",
          "Input prices decrease as industry output expands",
          "Input prices remain constant as industry output expands",
          "Firms' cost curves are horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a constant-cost industry, expansion doesn't affect input prices, so firms' cost curves remain unchanged, and the long-run supply curve is horizontal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long-run industry supply curve in perfect competition is typically:",
        "options": [
          "More elastic than the short-run supply curve",
          "Less elastic than the short-run supply curve",
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "The same as the short-run supply curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The long-run supply curve is more elastic because firms can enter or exit and adjust all inputs, making quantity supplied more responsive to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a perfectly competitive firm is producing where $P = MC$ but $P < ATC$, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production",
          "Decrease production",
          "Continue operating in the short run if $P > AVC$",
          "Shut down immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Even though the firm is incurring losses ($P < ATC$), it should continue operating in the short run as long as $P > AVC$, because it can cover variable costs and contribute to fixed costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Productive efficiency in perfect competition means:",
        "options": [
          "Goods are produced at minimum cost",
          "The right mix of goods is produced",
          "$P = MC$",
          "Firms earn economic profits"
        ],
        "explanation": "Productive efficiency occurs when goods are produced at the lowest possible cost, which happens in long-run competitive equilibrium where firms produce at the minimum point of the $ATC$ curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfectly competitive firm, if $MR > MC$ at the current output level, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production",
          "Decrease production",
          "Shut down",
          "Keep output unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, producing an additional unit adds more to revenue than to cost, so increasing production will increase profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key characteristic that makes perfect competition 'perfect' is:",
        "options": [
          "Many buyers and sellers",
          "Perfect information",
          "Homogeneous products",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition requires all these conditions: many small firms, identical products, perfect information, free entry and exit, and perfect resource mobility."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: the price taker concept, $MR = MC$ rule, short-run supply curve, and long-run equilibrium conditions.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that perfect competitors are price takers who maximize profit where $MR = MC$, and free entry/exit leads to zero economic profit in the long run."
