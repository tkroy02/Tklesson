    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a competitive labor market, equilibrium occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "Labor demand equals labor supply",
          "Wage equals marginal revenue product",
          "Quantity demanded equals quantity supplied",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In competitive equilibrium, labor demand = labor supply, wage = MRP (for firms), and quantity demanded = quantity supplied."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The equilibrium wage in a competitive labor market is determined by:",
        "options": [
          "Government regulation",
          "The intersection of labor demand and supply curves",
          "Labor unions only",
          "International wage rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In competitive markets, the equilibrium wage and employment level are found where the labor demand and supply curves intersect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the market wage is above the equilibrium wage, there will be:",
        "options": [
          "A labor shortage",
          "A labor surplus (unemployment)",
          "No effect on employment",
          "Increased labor demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When wage > equilibrium, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, creating unemployment (labor surplus)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the competitive equilibrium wage, all workers hired have MRP:",
        "options": [
          "Less than the wage",
          "Equal to the wage",
          "Greater than the wage",
          "Unrelated to the wage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Firms hire until MRP = wage, so the marginal worker's MRP equals the wage, though inframarginal workers have MRP > wage."
      },

          "Wage to decrease but employment to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity shifts labor demand rightward, increasing both the equilibrium wage and employment level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If immigration increases the labor supply, the equilibrium:",
        "options": [
          "Wage increases and employment decreases",
          "Wage decreases and employment increases",

          "Both wage and employment decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased labor supply shifts the supply curve rightward, lowering the equilibrium wage but increasing employment."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total wage bill = equilibrium wage × equilibrium employment, which is the area of the rectangle from origin to equilibrium point."
      },

          "Under the demand curve only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Worker surplus = area below the wage line and above the supply curve, representing the difference between wages received and reservation wages."

          "A labor surplus",
          "No change in employment",
          "Higher wages for all workers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage creates a surplus of labor (unemployment) because quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded at that wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss from a binding minimum wage is represented by:",
        "options": [
          "The reduction in employment",

          "The administrative costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the triangle between demand and supply curves for the employment reduction, representing lost gains from trade."

        "question": "In a monopsony labor market, the equilibrium wage is:",
        "options": [
          "Higher than in perfect competition",
          "Lower than in perfect competition",

          "Determined solely by workers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopsonists pay lower wages and employ fewer workers than would occur in competitive markets."

        "question": "Labor market equilibrium is efficient when:",
        "options": [
          "All workers are employed",
          "Wages are maximized",
          "MRP = wage for the last worker hired",
          "Labor supply is perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Efficiency requires that the value of the marginal worker's output (MRP) equals the opportunity cost of their time (wage)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economic recession typically causes labor market equilibrium to shift toward:",

          "Lower wages but higher employment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Recessions reduce labor demand, shifting the demand curve leftward, lowering both equilibrium wage and employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If both labor demand and supply increase, equilibrium employment will:",
        "options": [
          "Definitely increase",
          "Definitely decrease",
          "Definitely stay the same",
          "Change ambiguously"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both shifts increase equilibrium employment unambiguously, though the wage effect depends on the relative magnitude of shifts."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'market-clearing wage' refers to the wage that:",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The market-clearing wage is the equilibrium wage where labor demand equals labor supply, with no involuntary unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, workers earn:",
        "options": [
          "Economic rents only",
          "Their opportunity cost",
          "More than their marginal product",
          "Less than competitive firms would pay"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium, workers earn wages equal to their opportunity cost (reservation wage), with no economic rent unless they have unique skills."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Labor market frictions (like search costs) can cause:",
        "options": [
          "The equilibrium to occur more quickly",
          "Persistent unemployment even at market-clearing wages",
          "Wages to always be above equilibrium",
          "No change in market outcomes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Search and matching frictions mean that even at the market-clearing wage, it takes time for workers and employers to find each other, creating frictional unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If labor demand is perfectly inelastic, an increase in labor supply will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase employment but not change wages",
          "Decrease wages but not change employment",
          "Increase both wages and employment",
          "Decrease both wages and employment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With perfectly inelastic demand, employment is fixed, so increased supply only lowers wages without changing employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The total economic surplus in labor market equilibrium is maximized when:",
        "options": [
          "Wages are as high as possible",
          "Employment is as high as possible",
          "The market reaches competitive equilibrium",
          "Government sets the wage"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Competitive equilibrium maximizes the sum of worker and employer surplus, achieving allocative efficiency in the labor market."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: how equilibrium wage and employment are determined, reading labor market graphs, and effects of minimum wages.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that labor market equilibrium occurs where demand equals supply, determining both wages and employment levels."
