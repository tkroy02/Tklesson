      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the demand for a good is inelastic, an increase in its price will cause the total expenditure of the consumers of the good to:",
        "options": ["Increase", "Decrease", "Remain the same", "Become zero"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When demand is inelastic (% change in quantity demanded < % change in price), a price increase leads to higher total expenditure (P × Q)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The horizontal demand curve parallel to x-axis implies that the elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": ["Zero", "Infinite", "Equal to 1", "Greater than zero but less than infinity"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A perfectly horizontal demand curve indicates perfectly elastic demand—any price increase reduces quantity demanded to zero; elasticity is infinite."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An individual demand curve slopes downward to the right because of the _________:",
        "options": [
          "Working of the law of diminishing marginal utility",
          "Substitution effect of decrease in price",
          "Income effect of fall in price",
          "All of the options"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All three factors—diminishing marginal utility, substitution effect, and income effect—contribute to the downward slope of the demand curve."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Income elasticity of demand is defined as the responsiveness of _________ :",

          "Quantity demanded to a change in income",
          "Quantity demanded to a change in price",
          "Price to a change in income",
          "Income to a change in quantity demanded"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity measures how the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumer income."

        "question": "When savings exceeds the demand for savings, the rate of interest will:",
        "options": ["Rise", "Fall", "Remain constant", "None of these"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If supply of savings exceeds demand for savings, interest rates fall to encourage more borrowing and less saving."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Rate of interest will increase when the demand for saving is:",

          "Less than its supply",
          "Equal to its supply",
          "More than its supply",
          "Less than or equal to its supply"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When demand for savings (borrowing) exceeds supply (saving), interest rates rise to balance the market."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Self interest, competition, profit motive are the features of:",

          "Average propensity to save",
          "Marginal propensity to consume",
          "Marginal propensity to save"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "APC = Total Consumption / Total Income."
