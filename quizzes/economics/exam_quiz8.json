      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the demand for a good is inelastic, an increase in its price will cause the total expenditure of the consumers of the good to:",
        "options": ["Increase", "Decrease", "Remain the same", "Become zero"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When demand is inelastic (% change in quantity demanded < % change in price), a price increase leads to higher total expenditure (P × Q)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The horizontal demand curve parallel to x-axis implies that the elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": ["Zero", "Infinite", "Equal to 1", "Greater than zero but less than infinity"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A perfectly horizontal demand curve indicates perfectly elastic demand—any price increase reduces quantity demanded to zero; elasticity is infinite."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When demand for savings (borrowing) exceeds supply (saving), interest rates rise to balance the market."

          "A high income elasticity of demand for coffee"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If supply is highly elastic, an increase in demand leads to a large increase in quantity supplied with only a small price increase."

        "question": "If two goods produced by two different firms have a high positive cross elasticity of demand, then both firms are likely to:",

          "Operate independently"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "High positive XED means the goods are close substitutes. If one firm lowers price, it will attract demand from the other firm's product."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The average incomes of the inhabitants of country A and B are rising by 5% and 2% respectively. Demand for good X in both countries rises by 10%, and demand for good Y falls by 2% in both countries. Which one of the following statements is true?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "X’s demand rises with income → normal good. Y’s demand falls with income → inferior good. Pattern is consistent in both countries."
