          "The price of complementary inputs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The wage rate causes movement along the labor demand curve, while the other factors shift the entire labor demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in consumer demand for a firm's products will:",

          "Making labor demand perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A minimum wage creates a higher price floor, causing upward movement along the existing labor demand curve and reducing quantity demanded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During an economic recession, labor demand typically:",
        "options": [
          "Increases due to lower wages",
          "Decreases due to reduced product demand",
          "Remains unchanged",
          "Becomes more elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Recessions reduce consumer spending and business investment, decreasing the derived demand for labor across most sectors."
