      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary function of markets in an economy is to:",
        "options": [
          "Generate profits for businesses",
          "Allocate scarce resources efficiently",
          "Eliminate all competition",
          "Set government price controls"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Markets serve as the primary mechanism for allocating scarce resources to their most valued uses through the price system and competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Perfect competition is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "Few sellers and significant barriers to entry",
          "Many buyers and sellers of identical products",
          "One seller controlling the entire market",
          "Differentiated products and advertising"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition requires many buyers and sellers, identical products, perfect information, free entry and exit, and price-taking behavior."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive market, individual firms:",
        "options": [
          "Set their own prices above market levels",
          "Are price takers who accept the market price",
          "Control the entire market supply",
          "Use advertising to differentiate their products"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, each firm is so small relative to the market that it cannot influence the price and must accept the market-determined price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pure monopoly exists when:",
        "options": [
          "Many firms sell similar products",
          "One firm is the sole seller of a product with no close substitutes",
          "A few large firms dominate the market",
          "The government controls all production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A pure monopoly exists when a single firm is the only producer of a product for which there are no close substitutes, and significant barriers prevent entry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Barriers to entry are important in maintaining monopoly power because they:",
        "options": [
          "Increase consumer choice",
          "Prevent new competitors from entering the market",
          "Lower prices for consumers",
          "Promote perfect competition"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Barriers to entry such as patents, control of resources, or high startup costs prevent new firms from entering and competing, allowing monopolies to maintain their market power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Oligopoly is a market structure characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "Many small firms selling identical products",
          "A single dominant firm",
          "A few large interdependent firms",
          "Perfect information and free entry"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Oligopoly features a small number of large firms that are interdependent in their decision-making, often resulting in strategic behavior and potential collusion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Monopolistic competition differs from perfect competition primarily in that firms:",
        "options": [
          "Are price takers",
          "Sell identical products",
          "Have no market power",
          "Sell differentiated products"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In monopolistic competition, firms sell differentiated products (through branding, quality, or features) giving them some price-setting power, unlike perfect competition where products are identical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'invisible hand' concept suggests that in competitive markets:",
        "options": [
          "Government intervention is always necessary",
          "Self-interest leads to socially beneficial outcomes",
          "Monopolies naturally form and persist",
          "Resources are always allocated inefficiently"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Adam Smith's invisible hand describes how individuals pursuing their self-interest in competitive markets are led, as if by an invisible hand, to promote the social good through efficient resource allocation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price signals in markets serve to:",
        "options": [
          "Guarantee equal distribution of income",
          "Coordinate the decisions of buyers and sellers",
          "Eliminate all scarcity",
          "Prevent any changes in supply or demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Prices convey information about scarcity and value, coordinating the independent decisions of millions of buyers and sellers and directing resources to their most valued uses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Market efficiency occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "All firms make maximum profits",
          "Resources are allocated to their highest-valued uses",
          "Prices are set by government regulators",
          "No competition exists"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Market efficiency means resources are allocated to produce the goods and services that consumers value most, and production occurs at the lowest possible cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which market structure are firms most likely to engage in extensive advertising?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "All market structures equally"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Firms in monopolistic competition engage in significant advertising and product differentiation to establish brand loyalty and gain some market power, unlike perfect competition (no need) or monopoly (less need)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural monopoly occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "The government creates a monopoly by law",
          "One firm can supply the entire market at lower cost than multiple firms",
          "Firms collude to fix prices",
          "A single firm controls essential natural resources"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Natural monopolies arise when economies of scale are so extensive that one firm can supply the entire market at lower average cost than multiple competing firms could."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main problem with monopoly from an efficiency perspective is that:",
        "options": [
          "Monopolies always earn zero economic profit",
          "Monopolies produce too much output at too low prices",
          "Monopolies restrict output and charge higher prices",
          "Monopolies create perfect competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolies typically produce less output and charge higher prices than would occur under perfect competition, creating deadweight loss and reducing economic efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Product differentiation in monopolistic competition means that:",
        "options": [
          "All products are identical",
          "Each firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve",
          "Firms have some control over their prices",
          "No advertising occurs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Product differentiation gives each firm a slightly downward-sloping demand curve, allowing them some price-setting power rather than being pure price takers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In oligopoly markets, firms are interdependent because:",
        "options": [
          "They sell identical products",
          "Each firm's decisions affect other firms in the market",
          "They are all price takers",
          "Government regulates their behavior"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In oligopoly, the small number of firms means each firm must consider competitors' reactions when making pricing, output, or product decisions, leading to strategic interdependence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Market failure occurs when:",
        "options": [

          "Governments intervene in markets",
          "Firms earn economic profits",
          "Prices change frequently"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Market failure happens when free markets, left to themselves, fail to allocate resources efficiently - due to externalities, public goods, market power, or information asymmetries."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The continuum of market structures ranges from:",
        "options": [
          "Monopoly to government control",
          "Perfect competition to monopoly",
          "Oligopoly to perfect competition only",
          "All structures being equally competitive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Market structures exist on a continuum from perfect competition (most competitive) through monopolistic competition and oligopoly to monopoly (least competitive)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run equilibrium, firms in perfect competition earn:",
        "options": [
          "Substantial economic profits",
          "Zero economic profit (normal profit only)",
          "Consistent losses",
          "Profits determined by government"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In long-run perfect competition, free entry and exit ensure firms earn only normal profit (zero economic profit), as any economic profits attract new entrants that drive prices down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key difference between economic markets and other exchange systems is that markets:",
        "options": [
          "Always involve money",
          "Use prices to coordinate exchange",
          "Require government supervision",
          "Eliminate all voluntary exchange"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic markets are distinguished by their use of price signals to coordinate the voluntary exchange of goods and services between buyers and sellers, allocating resources based on relative scarcity and value."
