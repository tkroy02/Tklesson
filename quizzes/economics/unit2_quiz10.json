        "question": "The law of demand states that, all else equal:",
        "options": [
          "As price increases, quantity demanded increases",
          "As price increases, quantity demanded decreases",
          "Price and quantity demanded are unrelated",
          "Demand is always constant regardless of price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The law of demand states there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded - when price rises, quantity demanded falls, and vice versa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A demand curve slopes downward because:",
        "options": [
          "Producers are willing to sell more at higher prices",
          "Consumers buy less when prices are lower",
          "Higher prices reduce consumers' purchasing power and willingness to buy",
          "Government regulations require it"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The downward slope reflects both the substitution effect (consumers switch to alternatives as price rises) and income effect (higher prices reduce real income)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of supply states that, all else equal:",
        "options": [
          "As price increases, quantity supplied decreases",
          "As price increases, quantity supplied increases",
          "Price and quantity supplied are unrelated",
          "Supply is always constant regardless of price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The law of supply states there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied - when price rises, producers are willing to supply more, and vice versa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Market equilibrium occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Quantity demanded equals quantity supplied",
          "Price is at its maximum possible level",
          "There is either a shortage or surplus",
          "Government sets the price"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium is the price-quantity combination where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, with no inherent tendency for price to change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A shortage in a market occurs when:",
        "options": [

          "The price is above equilibrium",
          "Supply and demand are both decreasing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A shortage (excess demand) happens when quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at the current price, typically when price is below equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If there is a surplus in a market, we would expect:",
        "options": [
          "Prices to rise",
          "Prices to fall",
          "Demand to increase automatically",
          "Supply to decrease automatically"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A surplus (excess supply) creates downward pressure on prices as sellers compete to sell their excess inventory."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A change in which factor would shift the entire demand curve?",
        "options": [
          "The price of the good itself",

          "Decrease supply of cars"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Better technology reduces production costs, making producers willing to supply more cars at each price - this shifts the supply curve to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumers expect prices to rise significantly in the future, current demand will:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease",
          "Increase",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Become perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Expectations of future price increases encourage consumers to buy now rather than later, increasing current demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The price system serves as a rationing mechanism because:",
        "options": [
          "It guarantees equal distribution to all",
          "It allocates goods to those willing and able to pay",
          "Government controls all prices",
          "It eliminates scarcity entirely"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Prices ration scarce goods by allocating them to buyers who value them most (as shown by their willingness to pay) and can afford them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If both demand and supply increase simultaneously, we can expect:",

          "Quantity to definitely increase",
          "Quantity to definitely decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When both curves shift right, quantity definitely increases, but the effect on price is ambiguous - it depends on the relative magnitude of the shifts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price ceiling set below the equilibrium price will create:",

          "Increased quality"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding price ceiling set below equilibrium prevents price from rising to clear the market, resulting in a persistent shortage (excess demand)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price floor set above the equilibrium price will create:",
        "options": [
          "A surplus",
          "A shortage",
          "No effect on the market",
          "Lower prices for consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A binding price floor set above equilibrium prevents price from falling to clear the market, resulting in a persistent surplus (excess supply)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Elasticity of demand measures:",
        "options": [
          "How much demand shifts when price changes",
          "How responsive quantity demanded is to price changes",

          "The slope of the demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price - it shows how sensitive consumers are to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is price elastic, an increase in price will cause:",

          "Quantity demanded to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When demand is elastic, the percentage decrease in quantity demanded exceeds the percentage increase in price, so total revenue decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of consumer surplus represents:",
        "options": [

          "The cost of producing consumer goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price consumers are willing to pay and the actual price they pay, representing the net benefit consumers receive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental role of prices in a market economy is to:",
