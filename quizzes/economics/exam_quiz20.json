        "question": "Demand is said to be elastic when:",
        "options": [
          "Price change has no effect on quantity",
          "Quantity changes more than price",
          "Quantity changes less than price",
          "Quantity does not change"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Elastic demand means the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price (|Ed| > 1)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor does NOT affect demand?",
        "options": ["Income", "Taste", "Technology", "Price of substitutes"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Technology affects production and supply, not consumer demand. Demand is influenced by income, tastes, prices of substitutes/complements, and expectations."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Increase in supply is shown by:",
        "options": [
          "Rightward shift of supply curve",
          "Leftward shift of supply curve",
          "Movement along supply curve",
          "Steeper supply curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An increase in supply means producers offer more at each price, represented by a rightward shift of the supply curve."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price floor above equilibrium results in:",
        "options": ["Shortage", "Surplus", "Inflation", "Deflation"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A price floor set above the equilibrium price creates excess supply (quantity supplied > quantity demanded), i.e., a surplus."
