      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economies of scale refer to:",
        "options": [
          "The reduction in average costs as output increases in the long run",
          "The reduction in marginal costs in the short run",

          "The fixed costs that remain constant with output"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Economies of scale occur when long-run average costs decrease as the scale of production increases, allowing larger firms to produce at lower per-unit costs."
