          "Demand decreases when consumer income increases",
          "Demand increases when consumer income increases",
          "Demand remains constant regardless of income changes",
          "Price and quantity demanded are inversely related"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Normal goods are those for which demand increases when consumer income rises, and decreases when income falls, holding all other factors constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An inferior good is characterized by:",
        "options": [

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumer income increases and demand for a product increases, the product is:",
        "options": [
          "An inferior good",
          "A normal good",
          "A luxury good",
          "A complementary good"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When demand increases with rising income, the product is a normal good. This includes both necessities and luxury goods."

          "A perfect substitute"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity between 0 and 1 indicates a normal necessity - demand increases with income but less than proportionally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The classification of a good as normal or inferior can change over time because:",
        "options": [
          "Consumer preferences and technology evolve",
          "Prices always increase with inflation",
          "All goods become normal eventually",
          "Government reclassifies goods regularly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "What consumers consider normal vs inferior can change with technology, social norms, and economic development. For example, mobile phones transitioned from luxury to necessity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a good has income elasticity of 2.0, a 10% increase in income will cause demand to:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease by 20%",
          "Increase by 20%",
          "Decrease by 5%",
          "Increase by 5%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity of 2.0 means demand changes by 2% for every 1% change in income. A 10% income increase causes a 20% demand increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about inferior goods is correct?",
        "options": [
          "They are always low-quality products",
          "They have negative income elasticity",

          "They always have substitute goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inferior goods are defined by negative income elasticity, not necessarily low quality. Even high-quality goods can be inferior if consumers switch to even better alternatives as income rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During an economic expansion, a company producing generic food products should expect:",

          "Decreased demand for their products",
          "No change in demand",
          "More elastic demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Generic food products are typically inferior goods. During economic expansions with rising incomes, consumers switch to name-brand products, decreasing demand for generics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A good can be normal for some consumers and inferior for others because:",
        "options": [
          "Income elasticity depends on individual preferences and circumstances",
          "The government sets different classifications",
          "All goods are inherently normal",
          "Price elasticity overrides income effects"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A good's classification depends on individual income levels and preferences. For example, bus transportation might be inferior for middle-income consumers but normal for very low-income consumers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key difference between necessities and luxuries among normal goods is:",
        "options": [
          "Necessities have income elasticity less than 1, luxuries greater than 1",
          "Necessities are always cheaper than luxuries",
          "Luxuries are always imported goods",
          "Necessities have negative income elasticity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Necessities (0 < income elasticity < 1) see demand increase less than proportionally with income, while luxuries (income elasticity > 1) see demand increase more than proportionally."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: Normal goods = demand increases with income; Inferior goods = demand decreases with income; Luxuries have income elasticity > 1.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember the key distinction: normal goods see demand rise with income, while inferior goods see demand fall with income."
