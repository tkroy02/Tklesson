        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Injections are additions to the circular flow that increase spending on domestic output and stimulate economic activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The three primary injections in the circular flow are:",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economic equilibrium occurs when total leakages equal total injections: S + T + M = I + G + X"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If injections exceed leakages in an economy, we would expect:",

          "Immediate price stability"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When injections > leakages, more spending is being added than withdrawn, leading to increased aggregate demand and economic expansion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When leakages exceed injections, the economy will likely:",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Savings is considered a leakage because:",
        "options": [
          "It represents income not spent on consumption",
          "It always becomes investment spending",
          "It increases government revenue",
          "It stimulates export activity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Savings represents income that households do not spend on current consumption, thus withdrawing it from the immediate circular flow of spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Investment spending is an injection because:",
        "options": [
          "It represents business spending on capital goods",
          "It reduces household consumption",
          "It increases government taxes",
          "It decreases national income"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Investment spending by businesses on capital goods adds to aggregate demand and creates income for those producing investment goods."

          "Leakages exceed injections",
          "Injections exceed leakages",
          "Perfect balance in the economy",
          "No relationship to circular flow"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High savings (leakage) with low investment (injection) means S > I, indicating leakages exceed injections in that component of the circular flow."

          "No effect on circular flow"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A budget deficit means government spending (G, injection) exceeds tax revenue (T, leakage), adding net spending to the circular flow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A trade surplus (X > M) means:",
        "options": [
          "Foreign sector adds net spending to domestic economy",
          "Foreign sector withdraws net spending from domestic economy",
          "No net effect from international trade",
          "Only affects government budget"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A trade surplus means exports (injection) exceed imports (leakage), so the foreign sector adds net spending to the domestic circular flow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental identity S + T + M = I + G + X demonstrates that:",

          "Only consumption matters for GDP",
          "Government cannot run deficits",
          "International trade must be balanced"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This identity shows that in equilibrium, total withdrawals from the circular flow must equal total additions to maintain stable economic activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During an economic recession, automatic stabilizers work by:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing leakages and decreasing injections",
          "Decreasing leakages and increasing injections automatically",
          "Having no effect on the circular flow",
          "Only affecting international trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers like unemployment benefits (increased G) and lower tax revenues (decreased T) reduce leakages and increase injections during downturns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If households suddenly increase their savings rate, this creates:",
        "options": [
          "An increase in injections",
          "An increase in leakages",
          "No change in circular flow",
          "Automatic increase in investment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased savings represents increased leakage from the circular flow, which could lead to reduced economic activity unless matched by increased investment."

          "Attempts to increase savings can reduce national income",
          "Savings and investment are always equal",
          "Government should encourage maximum savings"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The paradox of thrift shows that if everyone tries to save more simultaneously, reduced consumption can cause economic contraction, potentially reducing total savings in the economy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an open economy with government, if S = I, T = G, then for equilibrium we need:",
        "options": [
          "X > M",
          "X = M",
          "X < M",
          "No international trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If savings equals investment and taxes equal government spending, then for overall equilibrium, exports must equal imports (balanced trade)."
      },

          "Changing tax rates and government spending",
          "Only affecting international trade",
          "Controlling household consumption directly",
          "Eliminating all savings"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fiscal policy changes tax rates (affecting T leakage) and government spending (affecting G injection) to influence aggregate demand and economic activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of leakages and injections helps explain:",
        "options": [
          "Only microeconomic consumer behavior",
          "Business cycle fluctuations and economic stability",
          "Individual firm production decisions only",
          "International exchange rates exclusively"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The balance between leakages and injections helps explain business cycles, as imbalances can lead to economic expansion or contraction, and policy can be used to restore equilibrium."
