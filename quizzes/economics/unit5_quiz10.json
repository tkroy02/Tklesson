      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary economic assumption about firm behavior is that firms aim to:",
        "options": [
          "Maximize social welfare",
          "Maximize profit",
          "Maximize revenue",
          "Minimize costs regardless of output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Standard economic theory assumes firms are profit-maximizers, meaning they seek to maximize the difference between total revenue and total cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Total revenue is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "Price × Quantity",
          "Total Cost - Profit",
          "Fixed Cost + Variable Cost",
          "Marginal Revenue × Quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total Revenue (TR) = Price × Quantity Sold. This represents the total money received from selling goods or services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Marginal revenue is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue divided by quantity",
          "The additional revenue from selling one more unit",
          "The maximum possible revenue",
          "Average revenue minus costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Marginal Revenue (MR) = Change in Total Revenue / Change in Quantity. It measures how much revenue increases when one more unit is sold."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue equals:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Price",
          "Average total cost",
          "Marginal cost only at equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, firms are price takers and can sell any quantity at the market price, so each additional unit sold adds exactly the price to total revenue (MR = P)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Average revenue is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue divided by quantity",
          "Marginal revenue times quantity",
          "Price minus average cost",
          "Total cost divided by quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average Revenue (AR) = Total Revenue / Quantity. For most firms, average revenue equals price since AR = (P × Q) / Q = P."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The profit-maximizing rule for firms is to produce where:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue is maximized",
          "Marginal revenue equals marginal cost",
          "Average cost is minimized",
          "Price equals average variable cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Firms maximize profit by producing where MR = MC. If MR > MC, producing more increases profit; if MR < MC, producing less increases profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic profit is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue minus explicit costs only",
          "Total revenue minus both explicit and implicit costs",
          "Accounting profit plus implicit costs",
          "Total revenue minus variable costs only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic Profit = Total Revenue - (Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs). This accounts for all opportunity costs, including the value of owned resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Normal profit occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Economic profit is positive",
          "Economic profit is zero",
          "Accounting profit is zero",
          "Total revenue equals variable costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Normal profit means economic profit is zero - the firm is earning exactly enough to cover all costs, including the opportunity cost of resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is earning economic profits, this means:",
        "options": [
          "It is earning more than the opportunity cost of its resources",
          "It is about to go bankrupt",
          "It is earning exactly normal profit",
          "Its total revenue equals total costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Economic profits represent returns above what is needed to keep resources in their current use - returns exceeding all opportunity costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopoly, the relationship between price and marginal revenue is that:",
        "options": [
          "Price equals marginal revenue",
          "Price is greater than marginal revenue",
          "Price is less than marginal revenue",
          "Price and marginal revenue are unrelated"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolists face downward-sloping demand curves, so to sell more units, they must lower price on all units, making MR < P."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The shutdown point for a firm in the short run occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Price equals average total cost",
          "Price equals average variable cost",
          "Price equals marginal cost",
          "Total revenue equals total fixed cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A firm should shut down if price falls below average variable cost, as it cannot even cover its variable costs of production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm should continue operating in the short run even with losses if:",
        "options": [
          "Price is below average total cost but above average variable cost",
          "Price is below average variable cost",
          "Total revenue is less than total fixed cost",
          "Economic profits are negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If P > AVC, the firm covers its variable costs and contributes something toward fixed costs, which must be paid regardless."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The break-even point for a firm occurs where:",
        "options": [

          "Price equals average total cost",
          "Price equals marginal cost",
          "Total revenue equals total fixed cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the break-even point, price equals average total cost, meaning the firm earns zero economic profit (normal profit only)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If marginal revenue is positive but decreasing, total revenue is:",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing",
          "Increasing at a decreasing rate",
          "Constant",
          "Increasing at an increasing rate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When MR is positive, TR is increasing. When MR is decreasing, TR increases at a decreasing rate (the slope of TR is flattening)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A revenue-maximizing firm would produce where:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal revenue equals zero",
          "Marginal revenue equals marginal cost",
          "Average revenue is maximized",
          "Total cost is minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total revenue is maximized where MR = 0. Beyond this point, MR becomes negative and TR decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between total revenue and price elasticity of demand is that:",
        "options": [
          "When demand is elastic, price increases reduce total revenue",
          "When demand is elastic, price increases increase total revenue",
          "Elasticity doesn't affect total revenue",
          "Total revenue is always maximized when demand is unit elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When demand is elastic (PED > 1), the percentage decrease in quantity demanded exceeds the percentage increase in price, so TR decreases when price rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm's supply curve in perfect competition is its:",
        "options": [
          "Average total cost curve above minimum AVC",
          "Marginal cost curve above minimum AVC",
          "Average revenue curve",
          "Total revenue curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, the firm's short-run supply curve is the portion of its MC curve that lies above the minimum point of the AVC curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is producing where MR > MC, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production",
          "Decrease production",
          "Keep production unchanged",
          "Shut down immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When MR > MC, the additional revenue from one more unit exceeds the additional cost, so producing more increases profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sales maximization subject to a minimum profit constraint is an alternative goal that:",
        "options": [
          "Ignores costs completely",
          "Seeks maximum market share while earning acceptable profits",
          "Always results in higher prices",
          "Is identical to profit maximization"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Some firms prioritize market share and sales volume, producing where MR = 0, as long as they earn at least some minimum required profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental insight about firm behavior is that:",
        "options": [
          "All firms have identical goals",
          "Profit maximization provides a powerful predictive model",
          "Firms never consider costs in decisions",
          "Revenue is the only important variable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While real firms may have multiple objectives, the profit-maximization model successfully predicts much firm behavior and provides a foundation for market analysis."
