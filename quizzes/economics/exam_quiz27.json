        "question": "Kyle has a preference for chickens. The owner of Chicken Republic doubles the prices of chickens. Kyle never stopped buying as many chickens as he used to. This shows that his demand is:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Elastic",
          "Fairly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If quantity demanded does not change at all when price doubles, demand is perfectly inelastic (price elasticity = 0)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the case of a straight-line demand curve meeting the two axes, the price-elasticity of demand at the mid-point of the line would be:",
        "options": ["0", "1", "1.5", "2"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "On a linear demand curve, the midpoint corresponds to unit elasticity (|Ed| = 1). Above the midpoint, demand is elastic; below it, inelastic."

        "question": "Which of the following is the first-order condition for the profit of a firm to be maximum?",
        "options": ["AC = MR", "MC = MR", "MR = AR", "AC = AR"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit is maximized where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC), provided the MC curve cuts the MR curve from below (second-order condition)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price and demand are positively correlated in case of:",
        "options": ["Normal goods", "Comforts", "Giffen goods", "Luxuries"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Giffen goods are inferior goods for which demand rises when price rises, due to a strong income effect overriding the substitution effect."
