      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Nominal GDP measures economic output using:",
        "options": [
          "Constant prices from a base year",
          "Current market prices",
          "Only physical quantities",
          "Adjusted for quality changes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Nominal GDP values goods and services at their current market prices, so it reflects both changes in production quantities and changes in price levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Real GDP measures economic output using:",
        "options": [
          "Current market prices",
          "Constant prices from a base year",
          "Future expected prices",
          "Only international prices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Real GDP uses constant prices from a selected base year, eliminating the effects of price changes and showing changes in actual physical output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The GDP deflator is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "(Nominal GDP / Real GDP) × 100",
          "(Real GDP / Nominal GDP) × 100",
          "(Current year prices / Base year prices) × 100",
          "Only consumer price changes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) × 100. It measures the average price level of all goods and services included in GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If nominal GDP increases by 8% and real GDP increases by 3%, the inflation rate is approximately:",
        "options": [
          "5%",
          "11%",
          "2.7%",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The approximate relationship is: % change in nominal GDP ≈ % change in real GDP + inflation rate. So 8% ≈ 3% + 5% inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The base year in real GDP calculation:",
        "options": [
          "Changes every month",
          "Is a reference year where prices = 100",
          "Is always the current year",
          "Only applies to consumer goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The base year is a reference point where the price index equals 100. Real GDP uses base year prices to value output in all years."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which measure is better for comparing economic output over time?",
        "options": [
          "Nominal GDP",
          "Real GDP",
          "Both are equally good",
          "GDP per capita only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Real GDP is better for comparing output over time because it eliminates the distorting effects of inflation, showing changes in actual production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If prices are rising and output is constant, then:",
        "options": [
          "Nominal GDP increases, real GDP is unchanged",
          "Real GDP increases, nominal GDP is unchanged",
          "Both measures increase",
          "Both measures decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher prices with constant output increase nominal GDP (values output at higher prices) but leave real GDP unchanged (same physical output)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The chain-weighted method for calculating real GDP:",
        "options": [
          "Uses fixed weights from the base year only",
          "Updates weights annually to reflect changing consumption patterns",
          "Only applies to international comparisons",
          "Eliminates the need for price indices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Chain-weighting updates the price weights each year, providing a more accurate measure of real GDP growth by accounting for changing consumption patterns and relative prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country experiencing deflation would show:",
        "options": [
          "Nominal GDP growing faster than real GDP",
          "Real GDP growing faster than nominal GDP",
          "Both growing at the same rate",
          "No relationship between the measures"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "During deflation, falling prices cause nominal GDP to grow slower than real GDP, or nominal GDP could fall while real GDP grows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The GDP deflator differs from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) because:",
        "options": [
          "GDP deflator includes all GDP components, CPI only consumer basket",
          "CPI includes all GDP components, GDP deflator only consumer goods",
          "They are identical measures",
          "Only CPI accounts for imports"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GDP deflator covers all goods and services in GDP (including investment and government), while CPI covers only a fixed basket of consumer goods and services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If real GDP is growing faster than nominal GDP, this indicates:",
        "options": [
          "Inflation",
          "Deflation",
          "Stagnant economy",
          "Rapid population growth"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When real GDP growth exceeds nominal GDP growth, prices must be falling (deflation), since nominal GDP = real GDP × price level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The conversion from nominal to real GDP is called:",
        "options": [
          "Inflation adjustment or deflating",
          "Nominalization",
          "Base year correction",
          "Quantity revaluation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Converting nominal GDP to real GDP is called 'deflating' because it removes the effects of inflation from the nominal figures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the base year, nominal GDP and real GDP are:",
        "options": [
          "Always equal",
          "Always different",
          "Unrelated",
          "Real GDP is always higher"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the base year, current prices equal base year prices, so nominal GDP = real GDP by definition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about economic growth is most accurate?",
        "options": [
          "Growth should be measured using nominal GDP",
          "Growth should be measured using real GDP",
          "Both measures show identical growth rates",
          "Nominal GDP understates true growth"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Real GDP growth measures changes in actual production capacity and is the standard measure for economic growth, as it eliminates price change effects."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the GDP deflator increases from 120 to 132, the inflation rate is:",
        "options": [
          "10%",
          "9.1%",
          "12%",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inflation rate = [(132 - 120) / 120] × 100 = (12/120) × 100 = 10%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'implicit price deflator' is another name for:",
        "options": [
          "Consumer Price Index",
          "GDP deflator",
          "Producer Price Index",
          "Export price index"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The GDP deflator is also called the implicit price deflator because it's derived implicitly from the ratio of nominal to real GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During hyperinflation, nominal GDP:",
        "options": [
          "Grows very slowly",
          "Grows very rapidly due to rising prices",
          "Is unaffected by price changes",
          "Always equals real GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "During hyperinflation, rapidly rising prices cause nominal GDP to increase dramatically, even if real output is stagnant or declining."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Real GDP per capita is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "Nominal GDP divided by population",
          "Real GDP divided by population",
          "GDP deflator times population",
          "Nominal GDP adjusted for inflation only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Real GDP per capita = Real GDP / Population, providing a measure of average economic output per person adjusted for price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The limitation of fixed-weight real GDP is that it:",
        "options": [
          "Doesn't account for changing consumption patterns",
          "Overstates economic growth",
          "Understates price changes",
          "Only works for service industries"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fixed-weight real GDP uses constant weights from the base year, which can become outdated as consumption patterns and relative prices change over time."

        "90": "Excellent! You thoroughly understand the distinction between nominal and real GDP and can work with price adjustments and growth calculations.",
        "70": "Good work! You understand the basic concepts but should practice calculations involving GDP deflator, inflation rates, and converting between nominal and real values.",
        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: the definitions of nominal vs. real GDP, how to calculate and interpret the GDP deflator, and why real GDP is better for growth comparisons.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that nominal GDP uses current prices while real GDP uses constant prices, and the GDP deflator converts between them while measuring overall price changes."
