          "Revenue from selling X"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The opportunity cost of producing X is the next best alternative forgone — the 200 units of Y that could have been produced."

  ],
  "answer": "D",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The next best alternative forgone — the benefits that would have come from schools — represents the opportunity cost."

  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What is the difference between economic cost and accounting cost?",
  "options": [

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Producing 500 tables foregoes 1000 chairs; thus, opportunity cost = 1000 ÷ 500 = 2 chairs per table."
