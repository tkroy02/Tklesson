        "options": [
          "Stock available for sale",
          "Total stock in the warehouse",
          "Actual production of the good",
          "Quantity of the good offered for sale at a particular price per unit of time"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Supply is the quantity of a good that producers are willing and able to sell at various prices during a given time period."

        "question": "The cost of one thing in terms of the alternative given up is called _________ :",

        "question": "Assume that consumer’s income and the number of sellers in the market for good X both falls. Based on this information, we can conclude with certainty that the equilibrium _________ :",
        "options": [
          "Price will decrease",
          "Price will increase",
          "Quantity will decrease",
          "Quantity will increase"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Decrease in income (if X is a normal good) decreases demand, and decrease in sellers decreases supply. Both shifts reduce equilibrium quantity. Price effect is ambiguous (demand shift lowers price, supply shift raises price), but quantity definitely falls."
