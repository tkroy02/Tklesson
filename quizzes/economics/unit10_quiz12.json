    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary function of a commercial bank is to:",
        "options": [
          "Print currency and mint coins for the public.",
          "Set the nation's monetary policy and interest rates.",
          "Act as a financial intermediary, taking deposits and making loans.",
          "Regulate the stock market and other financial institutions."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Commercial banks are profit-seeking institutions that serve as intermediaries between savers (depositors) and borrowers. They use the funds from deposits to create loans, facilitating investment and consumption in the economy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A central bank's role as a 'lender of last resort' refers to its function of:",
        "options": [
          "Providing loans to the general public at low interest rates.",
          "Issuing the first mortgage loan in a new housing development.",
          "Providing liquidity to solvent but illiquid financial institutions during a crisis.",
          "Lending money to the government to cover budget deficits."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "As lender of last resort, the central bank prevents solvent banks from failing due to temporary liquidity shortages (a bank run). This function is crucial for maintaining stability in the financial system, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the required reserve ratio is 10% and a bank receives a new demand deposit of $1,000, what is the maximum amount of new money the banking system as a whole can create from this initial deposit?",
        "options": [
          "$100",
          "$1,000",
          "$9,000",
          "$10,000"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The simple money multiplier is 1 / Reserve Ratio = 1 / 0.10 = 10. The maximum potential increase in the money supply is the initial deposit multiplied by the multiplier: $1,000 * 10 = $10,000. However, the question asks for the amount of *new* money created, which is the total increase minus the initial deposit: $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'monetary base' (or high-powered money) consists of:",
        "options": [
          "All currency in circulation plus checkable deposits.",
          "Currency in circulation plus bank reserves held at the central bank.",
          "The total value of loans made by commercial banks.",
          "The M2 money supply measure."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The monetary base (MB) is the sum of currency in the hands of the public and the reserves (vault cash + deposits at the central bank) held by commercial banks. It is the liability of the central bank and serves as the foundation for the broader money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Federal Reserve's 'dual mandate' is to promote:",
        "options": [
          "Price stability and balanced government budgets.",
          "Maximum employment and stable prices.",
          "High economic growth and low interest rates.",
          "A strong dollar and trade surpluses."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Federal Reserve Act mandates that the Fed pursue the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. This is known as the dual mandate and guides its monetary policy decisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a central bank sells government securities in the open market, the most immediate effect is to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase the money supply and lower interest rates.",
          "Decrease the money supply and increase interest rates.",
          "Increase bank reserves and encourage more lending.",
          "Directly finance the government's budget deficit."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An open market sale involves the central bank selling bonds to the public. Buyers pay for these bonds with money from their bank accounts, which reduces bank reserves. With fewer reserves, banks have less capacity to lend, which contracts the money supply and puts upward pressure on interest rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'federal funds rate' is the interest rate at which:",
        "options": [
          "The Federal Reserve lends money to commercial banks.",
          "Commercial banks lend reserves to each other on an overnight basis.",
          "The U.S. government borrows money by issuing Treasury bonds.",
          "Banks offer mortgages to their best customers."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The federal funds rate is the rate on overnight loans of reserves between commercial banks. It is a key benchmark interest rate that the Federal Reserve targets through its open market operations to influence broader economic activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve lowers the discount rate, this is intended to:",
        "options": [
          "Signal a more contractionary monetary policy stance.",
          "Make it cheaper for banks to borrow reserves directly from the Fed.",
          "Directly lower the interest rates that consumers pay on car loans.",
          "Increase the required amount of reserves banks must hold."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges commercial banks for short-term loans. Lowering it reduces the cost for banks to borrow reserves from the Fed, encouraging them to seek this source of liquidity and, in turn, support lending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bank's balance sheet must always balance. If a customer deposits $500 in cash into their checking account, the immediate effect on the bank's balance sheet is:",
        "options": [
          "Assets increase by $500; Liabilities are unchanged.",
          "Assets are unchanged; Liabilities increase by $500.",
          "Assets increase by $500; Liabilities increase by $500.",
          "Reserves decrease by $500; Loans increase by $500."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The cash deposit increases the bank's assets (vault cash/reserves) by $500. Simultaneously, because the bank now owes this money to the depositor, its liabilities (demand deposits) also increase by $500. The balance sheet remains in balance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'fractional reserve banking system' describes a system where:",
        "options": [
          "Banks are required to hold 100% of their deposits as reserves.",
          "Banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves and lend out the rest.",
          "Banks can only lend money they have received from the central bank.",
          "The money supply is fixed and cannot be expanded."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a fractional reserve system, banks are required to keep only a percentage (fraction) of their deposit liabilities as reserves. The remainder can be lent out to borrowers, which is the process through which the banking system creates new money."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Quantitative Easing (QE) is a monetary policy tool used when:",
        "options": [
          "The inflation rate is too high.",
          "Short-term interest rates are already near zero.",
          "The government is running a large budget surplus.",
          "The central bank wants to reduce the money supply."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "QE is an unconventional policy used when the traditional tool (lowering the short-term policy rate) is no longer effective because it is already at or near zero (the zero lower bound). It involves the large-scale purchase of longer-term securities to further lower long-term interest rates and stimulate the economy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the public decides to hold more currency and fewer bank deposits, the money multiplier will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase.",
          "Decrease.",
          "Remain unchanged.",
          "Become negative."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When people hold more cash, it drains reserves from the banking system. Banks have a smaller base of reserves to support lending, which reduces the lending and money creation process. This increase in the currency-to-deposit ratio reduces the value of the money multiplier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is responsible for:",
        "options": [
          "Setting the federal government's annual budget.",
          "Regulating all commercial banks in the United States.",
          "Directing open market operations to implement monetary policy.",
          "Minting coins and printing paper currency."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The FOMC is the body within the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy. Its primary tool is directing open market operations (buying and selling government securities) to influence the federal funds rate and overall financial conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bank is considered 'solvent' if:",
        "options": [
          "It has enough cash on hand to meet all deposit withdrawals at once.",
          "The value of its assets is greater than the value of its liabilities.",
          "It can borrow unlimited funds from the central bank.",
          "It never has to write off a bad loan."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Solvency is a long-term concept. A bank is solvent if its total assets exceed its total liabilities, meaning it has positive net worth. A bank can be illiquid (short on cash) but still solvent. Insolvency occurs when liabilities exceed assets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the required reserve ratio is 20%, and a bank has $100 million in checkable deposits and $25 million in reserves, how much are its excess reserves?",
        "options": [
          "$5 million",
          "$20 million",
          "$25 million",
          "$125 million"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Required Reserves = Checkable Deposits * Reserve Ratio = $100 million * 0.20 = $20 million. The bank has $25 million in actual reserves. Excess Reserves = Actual Reserves - Required Reserves = $25M - $20M = $5 million."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The central bank's ability to control the money supply is most directly limited by:",
        "options": [
          "The spending decisions of the legislative branch.",
          "The lending behavior of commercial banks and the public's preference for holding cash.",
          "The exchange rate with other currencies.",
          "The global price of gold."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The central bank controls the monetary base, but the broader money supply (M1, M2) is determined by the money multiplier, which depends on banks' willingness to hold excess reserves and the public's decision to hold money as currency versus deposits. These behaviors can change and are not perfectly controlled by the central bank."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main purpose of raising the reserve requirement by a central bank is to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase the lending capacity of commercial banks.",
          "Reduce the money multiplier and contract the money supply.",
          "Provide banks with more excess reserves.",
          "Stimulate economic growth and investment."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A higher reserve requirement means banks must hold a larger fraction of their deposits as reserves, leaving less available for lending. This reduces the money multiplier, slowing the process of multiple deposit creation and contracting the money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a financial panic, a 'bank run' occurs because depositors:",
        "options": [
          "Fear the bank may become insolvent and rush to withdraw their funds.",
          "Believe the bank is offering interest rates that are too high.",
          "Want to move their money to earn a lower rate of return.",
          "Are required by law to withdraw a portion of their deposits."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A bank run is a crisis of confidence. If depositors believe a bank might fail (become insolvent), they will all try to withdraw their money simultaneously. Since banks operate on a fractional reserve system, they cannot satisfy all withdrawals at once, potentially turning the fear of insolvency into a reality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Taylor Rule' is a guideline that suggests how a central bank should:",
        "options": [
          "Set the reserve requirement for commercial banks.",
          "Adjust its interest rate target based on inflation and the output gap.",
          "Manage the government's fiscal policy.",
          "Determine the optimal size of its balance sheet."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Taylor Rule is a proposed formula that prescribes how a central bank should alter its nominal interest rate target in response to changes in inflation and economic output (the output gap). It provides a systematic, rule-based approach to monetary policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary reason central banks aim for independence from the political process is to:",
        "options": [
          "Avoid public scrutiny of their actions.",
          "Enable them to make decisions based on long-term economic goals rather than short-term political cycles.",
          "Prevent the government from ever being able to borrow money.",
          "Allow them to set fiscal policy as well as monetary policy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Central bank independence is designed to insulate monetary policy from political pressure. This helps prevent politicians from pressuring the central bank to engage in overly expansionary policy before an election, which could lead to inflation. It allows policymakers to focus on long-term price stability and sustainable growth."

To advance, focus on the specific calculations (money multiplier, excess reserves), the distinctions between different central bank tools (open market operations, discount rate, reserve requirements), and the more complex concepts like QE and the Taylor Rule.",
        "50": "A fair start. You know the basic roles of commercial and central banks. Focus on solidifying your understanding of how the money multiplier works, the specific tools of the Fed (especially open market operations), and the precise definitions of key terms like the monetary base and the federal funds rate.",
        "0": "Start with the core concepts: Commercial banks take deposits and make loans. The central bank (like the Federal Reserve) controls the money supply and acts as a bank for banks. Its main jobs are to promote maximum employment and stable prices."
