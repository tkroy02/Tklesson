    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key distinction between short run and long run in production is that:",
        "options": [
          "Short run has fixed technology, long run has changing technology",
          "Short run has at least one fixed input, long run has all inputs variable",
          "Short run deals with small firms, long run with large firms",
          "Short run has constant costs, long run has variable costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The fundamental difference is that in the short run, at least one factor of production is fixed (usually capital or plant size), while in the long run, all factors can be varied."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is typically a fixed input in the short run for a manufacturing company?",
        "options": [
          "Raw materials",
          "Labor hours",
          "Factory building size",
          "Electricity usage"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Factory building size is usually fixed in the short run because it takes time and significant investment to expand or reduce physical plant capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is typically a variable input in the short run?",

          "Factory building",
          "Specialized machinery",
          "Number of production workers",
          "Patent rights"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The number of production workers can usually be adjusted relatively quickly through hiring or layoffs, making it a variable input in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of diminishing marginal returns applies specifically to:",

          "The long run only",
          "The short run only",
          "Both short run and long run",
          "Neither time period"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns occurs in the short run when additional units of a variable input are added to fixed inputs, eventually yielding smaller incremental output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, firms can adjust:",
        "options": [

          "Only capital inputs",
          "All factors of production",
          "Only technology"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The long run is defined as the period where all factors of production become variable - firms can change their plant size, equipment, workforce, and all other inputs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Returns to scale analysis applies to:",
        "options": [
          "The short run only",
          "The long run only",
          "Both short run and long run",
          "Only very large corporations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Returns to scale examines what happens to output when all inputs are changed proportionally, which is only possible in the long run when all inputs are variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The length of the short run varies by industry because:",
        "options": [
          "Government regulations differ",
          "The time needed to adjust fixed inputs differs",
          "All industries have the same short run length",
          "Consumer demand patterns vary"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The short run duration depends on how quickly a firm can adjust its fixed inputs. For some industries (restaurants), it might be months; for others (airlines), it could be years."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which decision is typically a long-run decision for a business?",
        "options": [
          "Hiring temporary workers for holiday season",
          "Ordering more raw materials",
          "Building a new factory",
          "Scheduling overtime for current employees"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Building a new factory involves changing the scale of operations and represents a long-run decision because it changes the firm's fixed capital inputs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which decision is typically a short-run decision?",

          "Increasing the work shifts from two to three",
          "Relocating corporate headquarters"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increasing work shifts uses the existing factory more intensively without changing the fixed plant size, making it a short-run adjustment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, if demand increases, a firm can increase output by:",

          "Developing new technology",
          "Merging with competitors"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the short run, with fixed plant size, firms can only increase output by using existing facilities more intensively - adding shifts, hiring more workers, or using more raw materials."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main constraint firms face in the short run is:",
        "options": [
          "Limited consumer demand",
          "Fixed factors of production",
          "Government regulations",
          "International competition"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The defining characteristic of the short run is the presence of fixed factors that limit how quickly and efficiently output can be expanded."

          "Market structure concept only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economies of scale occur when increasing all inputs leads to more than proportional output increases, which can only be analyzed in the long run when all inputs are variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm experiencing diminishing marginal returns is operating in the:",

          "Long run",
          "Short run",
          "Very long run",
          "Immediate run"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns specifically occur in the short run when variable inputs are added to fixed inputs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'very long run' refers to periods where:",
        "options": [
          "Only labor can be adjusted",
          "Technology can change",
          "All inputs are fixed",
          "Only capital can be adjusted"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The very long run considers periods long enough for technological change to occur, allowing production functions themselves to change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor is most likely to be fixed in the short run for an airline?",

          "Number of flight attendants",
          "Fuel purchases",
          "Fleet of aircraft",
          "Food and beverage supplies"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An airline's fleet of aircraft represents major capital investment that cannot be quickly adjusted, making it a fixed input in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, a firm can achieve its optimal:",
        "options": [
          "Production level given current plant size",
          "Scale of operation for any output level",
          "Only for current output levels",
          "Labor to capital ratio only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, firms can adjust all inputs to achieve the most efficient scale of operation for whatever output level they choose to produce."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The planning horizon for business decisions is closely related to:",
        "options": [

          "Only current profit levels",
          "Government fiscal policy",
          "Consumer price indices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Business planning horizons correspond to these time periods - operational decisions (short run) versus strategic investment decisions (long run)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about fixed inputs is correct?",
        "options": [
          "They never change",
          "They can be varied in the long run",
          "They are always more expensive than variable inputs",
          "They include only physical capital"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fixed inputs are those that cannot be changed in the short run but can be adjusted in the long run when firms have time to make major changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main advantage of the long-run perspective is that firms can:",
        "options": [
          "Ignore costs",
          "Achieve the most efficient input combination",
          "Set any price they want",
          "Avoid competition"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, firms can adjust all inputs to find the most efficient production method and scale for their desired output level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental insight from distinguishing short run from long run is that:",
        "options": [
          "Firms face different constraints and opportunities over different time horizons",
          "All decisions should be made for the long run",
          "Short-run decisions don't matter",
          "Time doesn't affect production decisions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Understanding the time dimension helps explain why firms make different types of decisions and face different constraints depending on their planning horizon."
