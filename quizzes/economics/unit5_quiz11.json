    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In economics, utility is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The usefulness of a good or service",
          "The satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming a good or service",
          "The price a consumer is willing to pay",
          "The total number of goods consumed"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Utility is a measure of the satisfaction or happiness a consumer gets from consuming a good or service, which is subjective and varies from person to person."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of diminishing marginal utility states that:",
        "options": [
          "As consumption increases, total utility decreases",
          "As consumption increases, the additional utility from each extra unit tends to decline",
          "Utility can always be measured precisely in utils",
          "Marginal utility is always negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As a person consumes more of a good, the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) gained from consuming one more unit eventually decreases, holding consumption of other goods constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Total utility is maximized when:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal utility is maximized",
          "Marginal utility is zero",
          "The budget is fully spent, regardless of utility",
          "Average utility is highest"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If marginal utility is positive, consuming more increases total utility. When marginal utility falls to zero, consuming more does not change total utility. If it becomes negative, total utility falls. Thus, total utility is maximized where MU = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An indifference curve represents:",
        "options": [
          "All combinations of goods that cost the same amount",
          "All combinations of goods that yield the same level of utility to the consumer",
          "The path of increasing income",
          "The relationship between price and quantity demanded"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An indifference curve shows all the different bundles of two goods between which a consumer is indifferent, meaning they provide the same level of satisfaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The rate at which the market allows exchange of one good for another",
          "The rate at which a consumer is willing to substitute one good for another while maintaining the same level of utility",
          "The ratio of the prices of two goods",
          "The slope of the budget constraint"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The MRS is the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve. It shows how much of good Y a consumer is willing to give up to get one more unit of good X without changing their overall satisfaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A budget constraint line shows:",
        "options": [
          "All combinations of goods that yield the same utility",
          "All combinations of goods that a consumer can afford given their income and the prices of the goods",
          "The consumer's preferred consumption bundle",
          "The rate of substitution between two goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The budget constraint represents the boundary of the consumer's opportunity set. It shows the maximum attainable combinations of two goods that can be purchased with a given income and fixed prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The slope of the budget constraint is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "The marginal rate of substitution (MRS)",
          "The ratio of the marginal utilities of the two goods",
          "The negative of the ratio of the prices of the two goods (-Px/Py)",
          "The level of consumer income"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The slope of the budget line is -Px/Py. It represents the rate at which the market allows the consumer to trade one good for the other. To get more of good X, you must give up Px/Py units of good Y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The consumer equilibrium, or the optimal consumption bundle, is found where:",
        "options": [
          "The budget constraint is tangent to the highest attainable indifference curve",
          "Total utility is minimized",
          "The marginal utility of both goods is zero",
          "The consumer spends all income on one good"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the point of tangency, the slope of the indifference curve (MRS) equals the slope of the budget line (Px/Py). This condition (MRS = Px/Py) ensures the consumer is achieving the highest possible satisfaction given their budget."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the consumer's optimal choice, the marginal utility per dollar spent is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximized for the good with the lowest price",
          "Equal for all goods consumed",
          "Minimized to save money",
          "Greater for necessities than for luxuries"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The equilibrium condition MRS = Px/Py can be rearranged to MUx/Px = MUy/Py. This 'equal marginal principle' states that the consumer maximizes utility when the last dollar spent on each good yields the same amount of marginal utility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in consumer income will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift the budget constraint parallel outward",
          "Pivot the budget constraint inward",
          "Change the slope of the budget constraint",
          "Rotate the indifference curves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An increase in income, with prices constant, allows the consumer to buy more of both goods. This is represented by a parallel outward shift of the budget line, as its slope (-Px/Py) remains unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of good X decreases, the budget constraint will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift parallel outward",
          "Pivot outward on the X-axis intercept",
          "Pivot inward on the X-axis intercept",
          "Become steeper"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A decrease in the price of good X means the consumer can now buy more of good X if they spend all their income on it. The Y-intercept remains the same, but the X-intercept moves outward, causing the budget line to pivot outward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The income effect of a price change refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The change in consumption resulting from a change in purchasing power",
          "The change in consumption resulting from the good becoming relatively cheaper",
          "The shift in the budget constraint due to a change in income",
          "The change in utility from a price decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The income effect is the change in the quantity demanded of a good due to the effective change in the consumer's purchasing power (real income) caused by the price change, holding relative prices constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The substitution effect of a price change refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The change in consumption resulting from a change in purchasing power",
          "The change in consumption resulting from the good becoming relatively cheaper compared to other goods",
          "The shift in the indifference curve",
          "The change in total utility from consuming more"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The substitution effect is the change in consumption resulting from a change in the relative price of the good, which encourages the consumer to substitute toward the now relatively cheaper good, holding utility constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a normal good, an increase in income leads to:",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in quantity demanded",
          "An increase in quantity demanded",
          "No change in quantity demanded",
          "An unpredictable change in demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A normal good is one for which demand increases when consumer income increases. Most goods are normal goods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An inferior good is one for which:",
        "options": [
          "Demand increases as income increases",
          "Demand decreases as income increases",
          "The substitution effect is always positive",
          "It has no close substitutes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An inferior good is one for which demand decreases when income rises, as consumers switch to more desirable alternatives (e.g., switching from instant coffee to fresh-brewed coffee as income rises)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Indifference curves are typically drawn as downward-sloping and convex to the origin because of:",
        "options": [
          "The law of demand",
          "The law of diminishing marginal utility",
          "The law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution",
          "The shape of the budget constraint"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Convexity implies that the MRS decreases as you move down along the curve. A consumer is willing to give up less of good Y for another unit of good X as they have more X and less Y. This reflects the diminishing marginal utility of consuming more of a single good."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two goods are perfect substitutes, their indifference curves are:",
        "options": [
          "Right-angled",
          "Straight, downward-sloping lines",
          "Upward-sloping",
          "Circular"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For perfect substitutes (like two brands of bottled water), the consumer is willing to swap one good for the other at a constant rate. This results in a constant MRS and straight-line indifference curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two goods are perfect complements, their indifference curves are:",
        "options": [
          "Straight, downward-sloping lines",
          "Right-angled (L-shaped)",
          "Curved and convex",
          "Vertical lines"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfect complements are goods that are consumed together in fixed proportions (like left shoes and right shoes). The indifference curves are L-shaped, as having more of only one good without the other provides no extra utility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'utils' measurement of utility is associated with which concept?",
        "options": [
          "Ordinal utility",
          "Cardinal utility",
          "Revealed preference",
          "Marginal rate of substitution"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cardinal utility is the idea that utility can be measured and quantified in absolute units (like 'utils'). Modern microeconomics primarily uses ordinal utility, which only requires that consumers can rank bundles, not assign numerical values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental goal of consumer theory is to:",
        "options": [
          "Prove that consumers are always rational",
          "Predict how consumers will respond to changes in prices and income",
          "Calculate the exact utility a consumer receives",
          "Show that all goods are substitutes"
        ],
        "explanation": "Consumer theory provides a model for understanding and predicting consumer choices. By analyzing preferences (indifference curves) and constraints (budget line), we can predict how quantity demanded changes with price (the demand curve) and income."
