    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Diseconomies of scale occur when:",
        "options": [
          "Long-run average costs decrease as output increases",
          "Long-run average costs increase as output increases",
          "Short-run marginal costs decrease",
          "Fixed costs become variable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diseconomies of scale exist when increasing the scale of operation leads to higher long-run average costs, representing inefficiencies that emerge at very large scales."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary cause of managerial diseconomies of scale is:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As organizations grow, communication channels lengthen, information gets distorted, and coordination becomes more complex and costly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'span of control' problem refers to:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Span of control describes how many subordinates one manager can effectively oversee. As firms grow, management layers multiply, creating bureaucracy and slowing decision-making."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'principal-agent problem' becomes more severe in large firms because:",
        "options": [
          "Owners (principals) can closely monitor all employees (agents)",
          "There's perfect alignment between owner and employee goals",

        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "Small firms are always most efficient"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The U-shape shows that costs first decrease (economies of scale) then increase (diseconomies of scale), indicating an optimal size where average cost is minimized."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which strategy can help large firms combat diseconomies of scale?",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main difference between diminishing returns and diseconomies of scale is that:",
        "options": [
          "Diminishing returns is short-run, diseconomies are long-run",
          "They are identical concepts",
          "Only diminishing returns affects costs",
          "Diseconomies only apply to small firms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diminishing returns occurs in the short run with fixed inputs, while diseconomies of scale are long-run phenomena when all inputs can be varied but coordination fails."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental lesson about firm size is that:",
        "options": [
          "Bigger is always better",
          "Smaller is always better",
          "There's an optimal size balancing scale advantages against coordination costs",
          "Size doesn't affect efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Firms face a trade-off: scale brings cost advantages but also coordination challenges. The optimal size balances these competing forces to minimize long-run average costs."
