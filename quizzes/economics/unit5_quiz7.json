          "Marginal"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, all factors of production can be varied, so all costs become variable costs. There are no fixed costs in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long-run average cost (LRAC) curve shows:",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The LRAC curve is often described as:",

          "Long-run average cost is minimized",
          "Marginal cost equals average cost",
          "The firm should shut down"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MES is the smallest output level at which long-run average cost is minimized. Below this scale, the firm experiences diseconomies of small scale."

          "Cost savings from specialized labor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Technical economies come from the physical properties of production - larger machines are often more efficient, and the 'cube-square rule' makes larger containers more cost-effective."

          "Average variable cost curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The LRAC is called the planning curve because it shows the cost possibilities a firm faces when planning its optimal scale of operation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a firm is experiencing economies of scale, its long-run average cost curve is:",

          "Upward sloping",
          "Horizontal",
          "Vertical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A downward-sloping LRAC indicates that average costs decrease as output increases, which characterizes economies of scale."

          "Only very large corporations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Returns to scale analysis examines what happens to output when all inputs are changed proportionally, which is only possible in the long run when all inputs are variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm's LRAC curve is L-shaped, this suggests:",

          "Constant economies of scale at all output levels",
          "Economies of scale followed by constant returns to scale",

          "No efficient scale of production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An L-shaped LRAC indicates economies of scale at low output levels, followed by constant returns to scale at higher output levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Managerial diseconomies of scale occur because:",
        "options": [
          "Managers become more efficient with larger firms",
          "Larger organizations require more complex coordination and communication",
          "Managers' salaries decrease with firm size",
          "Management becomes overspecialized"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As organizations grow, communication channels lengthen, decision-making becomes slower, and coordination problems increase, leading to higher costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental difference between diminishing returns and diseconomies of scale is that:",
        "options": [
          "Diminishing returns is a short-run concept, diseconomies of scale is long-run",
          "They are the same concept",
          "Diminishing returns applies to all inputs, diseconomies to only one input",
          "Only diminishing returns affects costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns occurs in the short run when variable inputs are added to fixed inputs. Diseconomies of scale occurs in the long run when all inputs are increased proportionally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm operating at its minimum efficient scale is:",
        "options": [
          "Producing at the lowest possible average cost given its current plant size",
          "Producing at the absolute lowest possible average cost achievable",
          "Always profit-maximizing",
          "Experiencing diseconomies of scale"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At MES, the firm achieves the lowest possible long-run average cost - it has chosen the optimal plant size and is producing at the most efficient scale."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main strategic implication of long-run cost analysis is that firms should:",

          "Choose their optimal scale of operation based on expected output",
          "Always operate at maximum capacity",
          "Focus only on short-run costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Long-run cost analysis helps firms plan their optimal scale of operation by choosing plant sizes that minimize average costs for their expected output levels."
