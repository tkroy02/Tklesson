      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market structure has the largest number of firms?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition is characterized by a very large number of small firms, each so small relative to the market that they cannot influence the market price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which market structure do firms have the most market power?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A monopoly has the most market power as it is the sole seller of a product with no close substitutes, giving it significant control over price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Product differentiation is a key characteristic of:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition only",
          "Monopolistic competition only",
          "Both monopolistic competition and oligopoly",
          "All market structures"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Product differentiation is central to monopolistic competition and is also common in oligopoly, where firms often differentiate their products to gain competitive advantage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which market structure are firms price takers?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, firms are price takers because each firm is too small to affect the market price and must accept the price determined by market supply and demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The kinked demand curve model is associated with:",

          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The kinked demand curve model explains price rigidity in oligopoly markets, where firms may not follow price changes by competitors due to strategic interdependence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market structure has significant barriers to entry?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition only",
          "Monopoly and oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition only",
          "All market structures except perfect competition"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopoly and oligopoly typically have significant barriers to entry (legal, technological, or strategic) that prevent new firms from entering the market easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In perfect competition, the demand curve faced by an individual firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Downward sloping",
          "Upward sloping",
          "Perfectly elastic (horizontal)",
          "Perfectly inelastic (vertical)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, each firm faces a perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand curve because it can sell all it wants at the market price but nothing at a higher price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market structure is characterized by mutual interdependence among firms?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In oligopoly, firms are mutually interdependent - each firm's decisions about price, output, and advertising affect other firms in the market, leading to strategic behavior."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Long-run economic profits are most likely to occur in:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Both monopoly and oligopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Monopoly and oligopoly can sustain long-run economic profits due to barriers to entry that prevent new competitors from entering and competing away those profits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, firms maximize profits where:",
        "options": [
          "$MR = MC$ and $P = ATC$",
          "$MR = MC$ and $P > MC$",
          "$P = MC$ and $MR > MC$",
          "$P = ATC$ and $MR = ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Like all profit-maximizing firms, monopolistic competitors produce where $MR = MC$, but due to product differentiation, they face downward-sloping demand curves so $P > MC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The market structure with the most advertising is typically:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "Oligopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolistic competition features extensive advertising as firms try to differentiate their products and build brand loyalty in markets with many competitors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which market structure do firms produce at the minimum point of their ATC curve in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, free entry and exit force firms to produce at the minimum point of their ATC curve in the long run, achieving productive efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A market with only a few large firms dominating the industry describes:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Oligopoly is characterized by a market dominated by a few large firms that control most of the market share."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market structure achieves both productive and allocative efficiency in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only perfect competition achieves both productive efficiency (production at minimum ATC) and allocative efficiency ($P = MC$) in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cartels are most likely to form in which market structure?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cartels (formal agreements among firms to fix prices or output) are most likely in oligopoly, where a few firms can coordinate to act like a monopoly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, long-run equilibrium occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "Firms earn economic profits",
          "Firms incur losses",
          "Firms earn normal profits ($P = ATC$)",
          "$P = MC$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In monopolistic competition, free entry and exit lead to zero economic profit in the long run, with firms earning only normal profit where $P = ATC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural monopoly exists when:",
        "options": [
          "The government grants exclusive rights",
          "One firm can supply the entire market at lower cost than multiple firms",
          "Firms collude to set prices",
          "There are no close substitutes for the product"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A natural monopoly occurs when economies of scale are so extensive that one firm can supply the entire market at a lower average cost than could multiple firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market structure has the most elastic demand curve for individual firms?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition has perfectly elastic demand (infinite elasticity) for individual firms, while other market structures face downward-sloping, less elastic demand curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Non-price competition is most common in:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition and monopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition and oligopoly",
          "Perfect competition only",
          "Monopoly only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Non-price competition (advertising, product differentiation, service quality) is prominent in monopolistic competition and oligopoly, where firms compete on factors other than price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main difference between perfect competition and monopolistic competition is:",
        "options": [
          "Number of firms",
          "Barriers to entry",
          "Product differentiation",
          "Profit maximization rule"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While both have many firms and easy entry/exit, the key difference is product differentiation - homogeneous products in perfect competition vs. differentiated products in monopolistic competition."
