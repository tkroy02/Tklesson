        "question": "Which of the following would cause the entire demand curve for coffee to shift to the right?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the price of coffee",
          "An increase in the price of coffee",

          "A decrease in the price of tea"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An increase in consumer income shifts the demand curve for normal goods to the right. A change in coffee's own price causes movement along the curve, not a shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If coffee and tea are substitutes, an increase in the price of tea will:",

        "options": [
          "A change in demand involves movement along the curve, while a change in quantity demanded shifts the curve",
