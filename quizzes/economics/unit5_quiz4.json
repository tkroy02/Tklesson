      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fixed costs are costs that:",
        "options": [
          "Vary with the level of output",
          "Do not vary with the level of output",
          "Are always zero in the long run",
          "Only include raw material costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fixed costs are expenses that do not change with the quantity of output produced in the short run, such as rent, salaries, and equipment payments."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Variable costs are costs that:",
        "options": [
          "Remain constant regardless of output",
          "Change with the level of output",
          "Are only incurred in the long run",
          "Include only capital costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Variable costs change directly with the quantity of output produced, such as raw materials, hourly labor, and utilities for production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Total cost is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "Fixed cost minus variable cost",
          "Fixed cost plus variable cost",
          "Variable cost divided by output",
          "Fixed cost multiplied by output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total Cost (TC) = Fixed Cost (FC) + Variable Cost (VC). This represents the sum of all costs incurred in production."

          "Electricity for machinery"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Factory rent must be paid regardless of how much is produced, making it a fixed cost in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is typically a variable cost?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Raw material usage increases directly with production levels, making it a classic variable cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, if a firm produces zero output:",
        "options": [
          "Total cost is zero",
          "Variable cost is zero but fixed cost is positive",
          "Both fixed and variable costs are zero",
          "Fixed cost is zero but variable cost is positive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When output is zero, variable costs are zero (no materials or production labor needed), but fixed costs must still be paid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Average fixed cost (AFC) is calculated as:",

          "Fixed cost plus variable cost"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "AFC = Total Fixed Cost / Quantity. AFC always decreases as output increases because fixed costs are spread over more units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Average variable cost (AVC) is calculated as:",

          "Total fixed cost divided by quantity",
          "Total variable cost divided by quantity",
          "Change in variable cost divided by change in quantity",
          "Variable cost minus fixed cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AVC = Total Variable Cost / Quantity. This measures variable cost per unit of output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Marginal cost (MC) is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The total cost of producing one unit",
          "The additional cost of producing one more unit",
          "The average cost of all units produced",
          "The fixed cost per unit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Marginal Cost = Change in Total Cost / Change in Quantity. It measures the cost of producing one additional unit."

          "When MC < AVC, AVC is increasing",
          "MC always equals AVC",
          "MC and AVC are unrelated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When marginal cost is below average variable cost, it pulls the average down, so AVC is decreasing. When MC is above AVC, AVC is increasing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Average total cost (ATC) is calculated as:",
        "options": [

          "TC / Quantity",
          "Both A and B",
          "MC × Quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "ATC = TC / Q = (FC + VC) / Q = AFC + AVC. Both formulas are mathematically equivalent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sunk costs are:",
        "options": [
          "Costs that can be recovered if production stops",
          "Costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered",
          "Costs that vary with output",
          "Future costs of production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sunk costs are past expenditures that cannot be recovered and should not affect current economic decisions."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run:",
        "options": [

          "All costs are variable",
          "Only variable costs exist",
          "Only fixed costs exist"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, all factors of production can be varied, so all costs become variable costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The typical shape of the average total cost curve is:",

          "Always downward sloping",
          "Always upward sloping",
          "Horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ATC curve is U-shaped due to initially falling average fixed costs and eventually rising average variable costs due to diminishing returns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When marginal cost is below average total cost:",
        "options": [
          "ATC is increasing",
          "ATC is decreasing",
          "ATC is at its minimum",
          "ATC equals MC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When MC is below ATC, it pulls the average down, so ATC is decreasing. ATC reaches its minimum where MC = ATC."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Explicit costs are:",
        "options": [

          "Costs that cannot be measured"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Explicit costs are direct, out-of-pocket monetary payments for resources used in production."

          "Opportunity costs of using owned resources",
          "Costs that appear on financial statements",
          "Variable costs only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Implicit costs represent the opportunity costs of using self-owned resources in production rather than renting them out or using them elsewhere."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic profit differs from accounting profit because economic profit:",
        "options": [
          "Includes only explicit costs",
          "Subtracts both explicit and implicit costs",
          "Ignores opportunity costs",
          "Is always larger than accounting profit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic profit = Total Revenue - (Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs), while accounting profit only subtracts explicit costs."
      },
      {

          "Accounting profit",
          "Normal profit",
          "Supernormal profit"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Normal profit occurs when total revenue equals total costs (including implicit opportunity costs), representing the minimum return needed to keep resources in their current use."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental purpose of cost analysis is to help firms:",
        "options": [
          "Maximize revenue regardless of cost",
          "Minimize costs for any given level of output",
          "Ignore fixed costs in decision making",
          "Focus only on variable costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cost analysis helps firms understand their cost structure to make efficient production decisions and minimize costs for their chosen output level."
