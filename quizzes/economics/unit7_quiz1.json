    "subject": "Economics",
    "topic": "Labor Demand, Derived Demand, Marginal Revenue Product, Factor Markets",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for labor is described as a 'derived demand' because:",
        "options": [
          "It is determined by government regulations",
          "It depends on the demand for the products that labor produces",
          "It is derived from workers' preferences",
          "It comes from international labor markets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Labor demand is derived from the demand for the final goods and services that workers help produce. Firms don't hire labor for its own sake, but for what it can produce."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The marginal revenue product of labor (MRP) is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal product × Price of output",
          "Total product ÷ Number of workers",
          "Wage rate × Hours worked",
          "Total revenue ÷ Total workers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$MRP_L = MP_L \\times P$ where $MP_L$ is the marginal product of labor and $P$ is the price of output. For imperfect competitors, $MRP_L = MP_L \\times MR$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit-maximizing firm will hire workers up to the point where:",
        "options": [
          "Wage = Average product",
          "Wage = Marginal revenue product",
          "Total revenue is maximized",
          "Average cost is minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Firms hire additional workers as long as the MRP (additional revenue from one more worker) exceeds or equals the wage (additional cost of one more worker)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the marginal revenue product of labor exceeds the wage rate, a firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Hire more workers",
          "Hire fewer workers",
          "Keep the same number of workers",
          "Reduce wages"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $MRP > W$, the additional worker brings in more revenue than they cost, so hiring more workers increases profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of diminishing marginal returns states that:",
        "options": [
          "As more labor is hired, total output always decreases",
          "As more labor is hired, marginal product eventually decreases",
          "Workers become less productive over time",
          "Technology improvements always offset labor productivity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Holding other inputs constant, adding more workers eventually leads to smaller increases in output (diminishing marginal product)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfectly competitive firm in both product and labor markets, the labor demand curve is:",
        "options": [
          "The same as the marginal revenue product curve",
          "The average product curve",
          "Perfectly elastic at the market wage",
          "The total product curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $P = MR$ in perfect competition, $MRP_L = MP_L \\times P$, and the firm hires where $W = MRP_L$, making MRP the labor demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the price of the firm's output will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift the labor demand curve leftward",
          "Shift the labor demand curve rightward",
          "Cause movement along the labor demand curve",
          "Have no effect on labor demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher output price increases MRP at each employment level, shifting the labor demand curve rightward and increasing the quantity of labor demanded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Technological improvements that increase labor productivity will:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease demand for labor",
          "Increase demand for labor",
          "Have no effect on labor demand",
          "Only affect capital demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity increases marginal product, which increases MRP and thus labor demand at each wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The market demand for labor is derived by:",
        "options": [
          "Summing individual firms' labor demand curves horizontally",
          "Averaging all firms' wage rates",
          "Multiplying marginal product by population",
          "Following government labor policies"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The market labor demand curve is the horizontal summation of all individual firms' labor demand (MRP) curves at each wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopoly in the product market, the MRP curve:",
        "options": [
          "Lies above the value of marginal product curve",
          "Lies below the value of marginal product curve",
          "Is the same as the value of marginal product curve",
          "Is perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a monopoly, $MR < P$, so $MRP_L = MP_L \\times MR < MP_L \\times P = VMP_L$, where VMP is the value of marginal product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is a price maker in the product market but a price taker in the labor market, it will hire where:",
        "options": [
          "$W = MP_L \\times P$",
          "$W = MP_L \\times MR$",
          "$W = AP_L \\times P$",
          "$W = TP_L \\div L$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since $MR < P$ for price makers, the firm hires where wage equals $MP_L \\times MR$ (MRP), not $MP_L \\times P$ (VMP)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the wage rate causes:",
        "options": [
          "A rightward shift in labor demand",
          "A leftward shift in labor demand",
          "Movement along the labor demand curve",
          "No change in labor employment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A wage change causes movement along the labor demand curve, while factors like technology or output price cause shifts of the curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The elasticity of labor demand measures:",
        "options": [
          "How responsive quantity demanded is to wage changes",
          "How fast wages increase over time",
          "The slope of the production function",
          "Worker satisfaction with wages"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Labor demand elasticity = % change in quantity demanded ÷ % change in wage. It indicates how sensitive employment is to wage changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Labor demand is generally more elastic when:",
        "options": [
          "Labor costs are a small share of total costs",
          "It is difficult to substitute other inputs for labor",
          "The demand for the final product is elastic",
          "Workers have specialized skills"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When product demand is elastic, small price increases cause large output decreases, making labor demand more responsive to wage changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Hicks-Marshall laws, labor demand is more elastic when:",
        "options": [
          "The elasticity of substitution between inputs is low",
          "The supply of other inputs is inelastic",
          "The elasticity of product demand is high",
          "Labor is essential to production"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Hicks-Marshall laws state labor demand elasticity is higher when: (1) product demand is elastic, (2) substitution with other inputs is easy, (3) supply of other inputs is elastic, and (4) labor's share of costs is large."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of capital decreases and capital and labor are substitutes, the demand for labor will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase due to the output effect",
          "Decrease due to the substitution effect",
          "Definitely increase overall",
          "Definitely decrease overall"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The substitution effect (firms substitute toward cheaper capital) reduces labor demand, while the output effect (lower costs increase output) may increase it. The net effect is ambiguous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The value of marginal product (VMP) differs from marginal revenue product (MRP) when:",
        "options": [
          "The firm is a price taker in the labor market",
          "The firm is a price taker in the product market",
          "The firm has market power in the product market",
          "Workers are unionized"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$VMP = MP_L \\times P$ while $MRP = MP_L \\times MR$. They differ when the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve ($MR < P$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm's short-run labor demand curve is downward sloping because of:",
        "options": [
          "Diminishing marginal product of labor",
          "Increasing returns to scale",
          "Rising wage rates",
          "Worker preferences"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As more labor is hired with fixed capital, MP declines, causing MRP to decline and creating a downward-sloping labor demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, when all inputs are variable, the labor demand curve:",
        "options": [
          "Becomes perfectly elastic",
          "Becomes perfectly inelastic",
          "Is generally more elastic than in the short run",
          "Is generally less elastic than in the short run"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Long-run labor demand is more elastic because firms can adjust all inputs, making substitution between labor and capital easier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental principle underlying labor demand is that firms hire workers:",
        "options": [
          "Until total product is maximized",
          "As long as the additional revenue exceeds additional cost",
          "Based solely on worker qualifications",
          "According to government quotas"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Firms are profit-maximizers who hire additional workers as long as MRP ≥ wage, following the marginal decision rule."
