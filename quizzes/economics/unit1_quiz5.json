    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Opportunity cost is best defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The monetary price paid for a good or service",
          "The value of the next best alternative forgone when making a choice",
          "The total cost of all alternatives considered",
          "The difference between price and cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that must be given up when making a choice. It represents what you sacrifice, not what you pay."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about opportunity cost is TRUE?",
        "options": [
          "Opportunity cost only applies to monetary decisions",
          "Opportunity cost exists even when choices are free",
          "Opportunity cost can be completely eliminated through planning",
          "Opportunity cost is always measurable in dollars"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost exists whenever a choice is made, even for free activities, because time and other resources are limited. Choosing one free activity means giving up another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You have 100 dollars and can either buy a video game or concert tickets. You choose the concert. What is your opportunity cost?",
        "options": [
          "100 dollars",
          "The concert tickets",
          "The video game you didn't buy",
          "Both the game and the concert"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The opportunity cost is the video game—the next best alternative you gave up. The 100 dollars is the monetary cost, not the opportunity cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student can study for economics (expected grade improvement: 10 points) or mathematics (expected grade improvement: 8 points) during a free hour. She chooses economics. What is the opportunity cost?",
        "options": [
          "10 points in economics",
          "8 points in mathematics",
          "18 points total",
          "2 points difference"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The opportunity cost is the 8-point improvement in mathematics that she gave up by choosing to study economics instead."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario has the LOWEST opportunity cost?",
        "options": [
          "Choosing between two equally valuable options",
          "Choosing between one highly valuable and one low-value option",
          "Having no alternatives available",
          "Having many equally attractive alternatives"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When choosing between one high-value and one low-value option, the opportunity cost (giving up the low-value option) is minimal. The best scenario is when the forgone alternative has little value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A factory can produce either 100 chairs or 50 tables with its resources. If it produces chairs, what is the opportunity cost of ONE chair?",

          "0.5 tables",
          "2 tables",
          "50 tables"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If 100 chairs cost 50 tables total, then each chair costs $50 \\div 100 = 0.5$ tables. The opportunity cost per unit is found by dividing forgone output by chosen output."

          "Future costs not yet incurred"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Implicit costs represent the opportunity costs of using resources you already own, such as your own time or property, rather than selling or renting them."

          "The profit of her business"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The implicit cost is the 60,000 dollar salary she gives up by working for herself instead of accepting the next best employment opportunity."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sunk costs are:",
        "options": [
          "Past costs that should influence future decisions",
          "Past costs that cannot be recovered and should not influence decisions",
          "Future costs that are uncertain",
          "Opportunity costs of current choices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sunk costs are costs already incurred that cannot be recovered. Rational decision-making ignores sunk costs and focuses only on future costs and benefits."

          "All money spent on entertainment this year"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The 500 dollars is a sunk cost. The rational choice compares going sick versus selling for 200 dollars and resting, ignoring the unrecoverable past expense."

          "Production becomes more efficient"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increasing opportunity cost occurs when resources are not perfectly adaptable. Producing more units requires sacrificing increasingly larger amounts of the alternative good."

          "It eliminates the need for cost-benefit analysis"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is fundamental because scarcity forces choices. Every choice involves trade-offs—selecting one option means giving up others. This is the essence of economic decision-making."
