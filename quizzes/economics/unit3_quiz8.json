    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Market equilibrium occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Quantity demanded equals quantity supplied",
          "Price is at its maximum possible level",
          "There is either a shortage or surplus",
          "Government sets the price"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium is the price-quantity combination where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, with no inherent tendency for price to change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the equilibrium price:",
        "options": [
          "There is a surplus of goods",
          "There is a shortage of goods",
          "The market clears with no unsold inventory",
          "Producers are forced to reduce production"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, the quantity producers want to sell exactly matches the quantity consumers want to buy - the market clears with no excess supply or demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the market price is above the equilibrium price, there will be:",
        "options": [
          "A shortage (excess demand)",
          "A surplus (excess supply)",
          "Market equilibrium",
          "No effect on quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When price is above equilibrium, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, creating a surplus (excess supply)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the market price is below the equilibrium price, there will be:",
        "options": [
          "A shortage (excess demand)",
          "A surplus (excess supply)",
          "Market equilibrium",
          "Increased production"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When price is below equilibrium, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, creating a shortage (excess demand)."

          "Prices to rise",
          "Prices to fall",
          "Demand to increase automatically",
          "Supply to decrease automatically"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A surplus creates downward pressure on prices as sellers compete to sell their excess inventory, moving the market toward equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When there is a shortage in a market, we would expect:",

          "Prices to rise",
          "Prices to fall",
          "Supply to increase automatically",
          "Demand to decrease automatically"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A shortage creates upward pressure on prices as buyers compete for limited goods, moving the market toward equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The equilibrium price is also called the market-clearing price because:",
        "options": [
          "It clears all products from store shelves",
          "It eliminates all consumer demand",
          "It matches quantity supplied with quantity demanded",
          "It maximizes government revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The market-clearing price ensures that the quantity producers want to sell equals the quantity consumers want to buy, with no leftover inventory or unsatisfied demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If both demand and supply increase simultaneously, what happens to equilibrium price and quantity?",
        "options": [
          "Price increases, quantity increases",
          "Price decreases, quantity increases",
          "Price is ambiguous, quantity increases",
          "Price increases, quantity is ambiguous"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When both curves shift right, quantity definitely increases, but the effect on price depends on the relative magnitude of the shifts - price could rise, fall, or stay the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand increases while supply remains constant, what happens to equilibrium price and quantity?",

          "Price decreases, quantity decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased demand with unchanged supply creates a shortage at the original price, leading to both higher equilibrium price and higher equilibrium quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If supply increases while demand remains constant, what happens to equilibrium price and quantity?",

          "Price is ambiguous, quantity increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both changes put downward pressure on price, so price definitely decreases. The effect on quantity is ambiguous - it depends on the relative magnitude of the shifts."

          "The market naturally returns to equilibrium after disturbances",
          "Government intervention is required to maintain balance",
          "Supply always equals demand regardless of price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a stable equilibrium, market forces automatically push prices back toward equilibrium if they are disturbed - shortages cause price increases, surpluses cause price decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a market is in equilibrium and demand increases, the initial result will be:",

          "A surplus at the original price",
          "A shortage at the original price",
          "No change in the market",
          "Immediate price decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the original equilibrium price, increased demand creates a shortage because quantity demanded now exceeds quantity supplied."

          "Are set by government planning committees",
          "Always remain constant over time",
          "Eliminate the need for market information"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Market prices coordinate the decentralized decisions of millions of buyers and sellers, providing signals about scarcity and value without central planning."
      },

        "explanation": "When both curves shift left, quantity definitely decreases, but the effect on price depends on the relative magnitude of the shifts - price could rise, fall, or stay the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a competitive market, the adjustment from shortage to equilibrium occurs through:",
        "options": [
          "Government price controls",
          "Voluntary producer output reductions",
          "Price increases that reduce quantity demanded and increase quantity supplied",
          "Rationing by sellers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Shortages create competitive bidding that drives prices up, which simultaneously reduces quantity demanded and increases quantity supplied until equilibrium is restored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The rationing function of prices refers to how prices:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Prices ration scarce goods by allocating them to buyers who value them most (as shown by their willingness to pay) and can afford them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a market has a surplus, the movement toward equilibrium involves:",
        "options": [
          "Price increases that eliminate the surplus",
          "Price decreases that eliminate the surplus",
          "Government purchasing the excess supply",
          "Producers increasing production further"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Surpluses create competitive pressure that drives prices down, which simultaneously increases quantity demanded and decreases quantity supplied until equilibrium is restored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental insight of market equilibrium is that:",
        "options": [
          "Government must always set prices",
          "Markets tend toward balance through price adjustments",
          "Equilibrium is rarely achieved in real markets",
          "Prices should never change once set"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Market equilibrium demonstrates how competitive markets naturally tend toward balance through the price mechanism, coordinating billions of individual decisions without central direction."
