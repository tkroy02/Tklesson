    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopsony in labor markets occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "There is one seller of labor and many buyers",
          "There is one buyer of labor and many sellers",
          "There are many buyers and sellers of labor",
          "The government controls all hiring"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopsony is a market structure with a single buyer (employer) facing many sellers (workers), giving the employer significant market power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monopsony labor market, the marginal factor cost (MFC) curve lies:",
        "options": [
          "Below the labor supply curve",
          "Above the labor supply curve",
          "On top of the labor supply curve",
          "Unrelated to the labor supply curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MFC > wage because to hire additional workers, the monopsonist must raise wages for all workers, not just the marginal ones."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit-maximizing monopsonist hires workers up to the point where:",
        "options": [
          "Wage = MRP",
          "MFC = MRP",
          "Wage = MFC",
          "MRP = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The monopsonist maximizes profit where marginal factor cost equals marginal revenue product (MFC = MRP), then pays the wage indicated by the labor supply curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a competitive labor market, a monopsony results in:",
        "options": [
          "Higher wages and higher employment",
          "Lower wages and lower employment",
          "Higher wages but lower employment",
          "Lower wages but higher employment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopsony leads to both lower wages and lower employment compared to the competitive equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the monopsonist's profit-maximizing employment level, the wage paid is:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to MRP",
          "Less than MRP",
          "Greater than MRP",
          "Unrelated to MRP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since MFC > wage and the firm hires where MFC = MRP, it follows that wage < MRP at the optimal employment level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss in monopsony represents:",
        "options": [
          "The transfer from workers to the employer",
          "The lost gains from trade from reduced employment",
          "The administrative costs of monopsony power",
          "The difference between wage and MRP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the reduction in total economic surplus because employment is restricted below the competitive level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A minimum wage set appropriately in a monopsony market can:",
        "options": [
          "Only reduce employment",
          "Increase both wages and employment",
          "Have no effect on the market",
          "Only benefit the employer"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A minimum wage can force the monopsonist to pay a higher wage while also increasing employment by making the MFC constant up to that wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Oligopsony refers to a labor market with:",
        "options": [
          "One employer",
          "A few dominant employers",
          "Many small employers",
          "No employers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Oligopsony is a market structure where a few large buyers (employers) dominate hiring, giving them collective market power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Real-world examples of monopsony power often occur in:",
        "options": [
          "Large cities with diverse employers",
          "Company towns or specialized occupations",
          "Highly competitive service industries",
          "Government-regulated minimum wage markets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopsony characteristics appear in company towns, certain professional sports, nursing markets, and specialized occupations with few employers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The elasticity of labor supply facing an employer affects monopsony power because:",
        "options": [
          "More elastic supply reduces monopsony power",
          "More elastic supply increases monopsony power",
          "Elasticity has no effect on monopsony power",
          "Only demand elasticity matters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When labor supply is more elastic, workers are more responsive to wage differences, making it harder for employers to exercise monopsony power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monopsony labor market, the supply curve represents:",
        "options": [
          "The marginal factor cost curve",
          "The average cost of labor",
          "The relationship between wage and quantity supplied",
          "The employer's demand for workers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The supply curve shows the wage required to attract each additional worker, while the MFC curve accounts for the cost of raising wages for all workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Lerner Index for monopsony power measures:",
        "options": [
          "(MRP - Wage) / Wage",
          "(Wage - MFC) / Wage",
          "(MRP - MFC) / MRP",
          "(Supply elasticity) / (Demand elasticity)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The monopsony power index = (MRP - Wage) / Wage, indicating the degree to which wages are depressed below workers' marginal revenue product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factors that can create monopsony power include:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect worker mobility between jobs",
          "Many employers in a local market",
          "High worker relocation costs",
          "Strong labor unions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "High moving costs, specialized skills, geographic isolation, and search frictions can all reduce worker mobility and create monopsony power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monopsony market, if the minimum wage is set at the competitive equilibrium level:",
        "options": [
          "Employment will decrease below monopsony level",
          "Employment will increase to competitive level",
          "Wages will fall below competitive level",
          "The employer will gain more power"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Setting the minimum wage at the competitive level can eliminate the deadweight loss of monopsony, bringing employment up to the efficient competitive level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'dynamic monopsony' concept accounts for:",
        "options": [
          "Monopsony power that changes over time",
          "Only static labor markets",
          "Perfect competition in all periods",
          "Government monopsony only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dynamic monopsony considers how turnover costs, search frictions, and wage policies affect employer power over time, not just in static analysis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to perfect competition, worker surplus in monopsony is:",
        "options": [
          "Higher",
          "Lower",
          "The same",
          "Impossible to determine"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Worker surplus is reduced in monopsony because both wages and employment are lower than in competitive markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Monopsony power can be mitigated by:",
        "options": [
          "Reducing worker mobility further",
          "Increasing employer concentration",
          "Improving job search technology",
          "Eliminating minimum wages"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Better job matching, reduced search costs, and improved worker mobility all reduce employers' monopsony power by increasing labor supply elasticity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monopsony labor market, the employer's surplus is:",
        "options": [
          "The area below the wage and above the supply curve",
          "The area above the wage and below the MRP curve",
          "The entire area under the MRP curve",
          "The difference between MFC and wage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Employer surplus in monopsony is the area above the wage line and below the MRP curve, representing the difference between workers' productivity and their wages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'efficiency wage' model in monopsony suggests that employers might pay above the profit-maximizing wage to:",
        "options": [
          "Reduce turnover and increase productivity",
          "Comply with minimum wage laws",
          "Eliminate all worker surplus",
          "Maximize short-term profits only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even monopsonists might pay efficiency wages to reduce turnover costs, increase worker effort, or attract better applicants, despite their market power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Modern research suggests monopsony power may be more common than previously thought due to:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect labor market competition",
          "Job search frictions and employer concentration",
          "Complete worker information and mobility",
          "The absence of any market imperfections"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Recent evidence suggests search frictions, limited information, and employer concentration give many employers some degree of monopsony power, even in seemingly competitive markets."
