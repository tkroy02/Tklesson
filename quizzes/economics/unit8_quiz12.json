        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The standard sequence is: Start with GDP, adjust to get National Income, then Personal Income, and finally Disposable Personal Income."

        ],
        "answer": "B",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Social insurance taxes are subtracted when calculating Personal Income from National Income because they represent compensation that doesn't reach individuals as disposable income."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Savings = $80,000 - $68,000 = $12,000. Savings Rate = ($12,000 ÷ $80,000) × 100% = 15%."
