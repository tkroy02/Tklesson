    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price elasticity of demand measures:",
        "options": [
          "How much demand changes when income changes",
          "How responsive quantity demanded is to price changes",
          "How supply responds to price changes",
          "How consumer tastes affect demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price - it shows how sensitive consumers are to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is price elastic, the absolute value of the elasticity coefficient is:",
        "options": [
          "Less than 1",
          "Equal to 1",
          "Greater than 1",
          "Equal to 0"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Elastic demand means the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price, so the elasticity coefficient is greater than 1 in absolute value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When demand is price inelastic, an increase in price will cause:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue to increase",
          "Total revenue to decrease",
          "No change in total revenue",
          "Quantity demanded to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With inelastic demand, the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage increase in price, so total revenue increases when price rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The formula for price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "% change in price / % change in quantity demanded",
          "% change in quantity demanded / % change in price",
          "Change in quantity / change in price",
          "Price × quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price elasticity of demand = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price). This measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a 10% price increase causes a 5% decrease in quantity demanded, the price elasticity of demand is:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Elasticity = (% change in quantity) / (% change in price) = (-5%) / (10%) = -0.5. The absolute value is 0.5, indicating inelastic demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Perfectly inelastic demand is represented by:",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal demand curve",

          "An upward-sloping demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic demand means quantity demanded does not change at all when price changes, represented by a vertical demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is unit elastic, a price increase will cause:",

          "Total revenue to increase",
          "Total revenue to decrease",
          "No change in total revenue",
          "Quantity to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With unit elastic demand, the percentage change in quantity equals the percentage change in price, so total revenue remains unchanged when price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which product is likely to have the most price elastic demand?",

          "Ignore percentage changes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The midpoint formula uses the average of the initial and final quantities and prices to avoid getting different elasticity values depending on whether you're calculating from point A to B or B to A."

          "There are few substitutes available",
          "The time period considered is shorter",
          "The product is a necessity",
          "There are many close substitutes available"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The availability of close substitutes makes demand more elastic because consumers can easily switch to alternatives if the price rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a product increases from $10 to $12 and quantity demanded decreases from 100 to 80 units, the price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "0.5",
          "1.0",
          "1.5",
          "2.0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using midpoint formula: % change in quantity = (20/90) × 100 = 22.2%; % change in price = (2/11) × 100 = 18.2%; Elasticity = 22.2/18.2 = 1.22, approximately 1.0 (unit elastic)."

          "An upward-sloping demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfectly elastic demand means consumers will buy any quantity at a specific price but none at a higher price, represented by a horizontal demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The total revenue test states that if price and total revenue move in opposite directions, demand is:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic",
          "Inelastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When price and total revenue move in opposite directions (price up, revenue down or price down, revenue up), demand is elastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor makes demand more inelastic?",
        "options": [

          "The product is a luxury good",
          "The product is a necessity",
          "Consumers have time to adjust"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Necessities tend to have inelastic demand because consumers will continue buying them even when prices rise, as they are essential for daily life."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a 5% price decrease leads to a 10% increase in quantity demanded, the price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "0.5",
          "1.0",
          "2.0",
          "5.0"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Elasticity = (% change in quantity) / (% change in price) = (10%) / (5%) = 2.0. The negative sign is typically omitted when discussing the absolute value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Demand becomes more elastic over time because:",
        "options": [
          "Consumers have more time to find substitutes or adjust their behavior",
          "Prices tend to increase over time",
          "Incomes generally rise over time",
          "Technology always improves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Given more time, consumers can find alternatives, change habits, or adjust their consumption patterns, making demand more responsive to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a business wants to maximize revenue, it should set prices where demand is:",

          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "It depends on the cost structure"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total revenue is maximized where demand is unit elastic. At this point, any price change (up or down) would decrease total revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The price elasticity of demand for a product is influenced by all of the following EXCEPT:",
