    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The terms of trade refer to:",
        "options": [
          "The legal agreements between trading countries",
          "The ratio at which two goods are exchanged internationally",
          "The transportation costs of international trade",
          "The quality standards for traded goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Terms of trade is the ratio at which one country's goods exchange for another country's goods - for example, how many units of wheat trade for one unit of cloth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For trade to benefit both countries, the terms of trade must lie:",
        "options": [
          "Below both countries' opportunity costs",
          "Above both countries' opportunity costs",
          "Between the two countries' opportunity costs",
          "At exactly one country's opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The terms of trade must be between the two countries' domestic opportunity costs. Each country imports goods cheaper than their domestic cost and exports at favorable rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country A: 1 car = 2 trucks domestically. Country B: 1 car = 4 trucks domestically. Mutually beneficial terms of trade for cars would be:",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The terms of trade must be between 2 and 4 trucks per car. At 3 trucks per car, Country A gets more trucks for its cars than domestically (3 vs 2), and Country B gets cars cheaper than domestically (3 trucks vs 4 trucks)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the terms of trade move in a country's favor, it means:",
        "options": [
          "It gets more imports per unit of exports",
          "It gets fewer imports per unit of exports",
          "Its opportunity costs have increased",
          "It has lost comparative advantage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Favorable movement in terms of trade means a country receives more imports for each unit of exports it sells abroad."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "At 1 computer = 9 phones, Country X gets more phones for its computers than domestically (9 vs 5), but Country Y pays more for computers than domestically (9 phones vs 8 phones), so only Country X benefits."

          "Remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Improved terms of trade mean the country gets more imports for its exports, allowing it to consume more imported goods without increasing exports - this rotates the consumption possibilities frontier outward for imported goods."

        "explanation": "Country A gains 0.5 sugar per coffee (2.5 - 2.0), while Country B gains 0.5 sugar per coffee (3.0 - 2.5). Actually, both gain 0.5 sugar equivalent per coffee traded. Let me reconsider: Country B saves 0.5 sugar per coffee imported, while Country A gains 0.5 sugar per coffee exported. The gains appear equal in this symmetric case."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The distribution of gains from trade depends on:",
        "options": [

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The closer the terms of trade are to a country's domestic opportunity cost, the smaller that country's gains from trade. The country whose domestic cost is farther from the actual terms of trade gains more."

          "Has no influence on terms of trade",
          "Always gets unfavorable terms",
          "Eliminates its opportunity costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Small countries are typically 'price takers' in world markets - they have little influence on terms of trade and must accept world prices determined by larger trading partners."

        "question": "If a country's terms of trade index rises from 100 to 110, this means:",
        "options": [
          "It must export more to buy the same imports",
          "It can buy more imports with the same exports",
          "Its opportunity costs have increased",
          "It has lost comparative advantage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A rising terms of trade index (above 100) means export prices are rising relative to import prices, so the country can purchase more imports with the same quantity of exports."

          "Their comparative advantage is disappearing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Many developing countries face declining terms of trade as global demand for primary products grows more slowly than demand for manufactured goods, and technological progress reduces demand for raw materials."

          "They must be identical to domestic opportunity costs",
          "They allow consumption beyond domestic production possibilities",
          "They eliminate all gains from trade",
          "They are determined solely by absolute advantage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Through international trade at mutually beneficial terms of trade, countries can consume combinations of goods that would be unattainable if they relied solely on domestic production, effectively consuming outside their production possibilities frontier."
