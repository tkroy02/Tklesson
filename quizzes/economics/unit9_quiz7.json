          "The money supply decreases rapidly"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Demand-pull inflation happens when total spending in the economy grows faster than the economy's productive capacity, creating upward pressure on prices."

          "Government price controls"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Built-in inflation occurs through adaptive expectations where workers demand higher wages to compensate for expected inflation, and businesses raise prices to cover higher labor costs, creating a continuous cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The quantity theory of money suggests that inflation is primarily caused by:",

          "Deflationary pressures"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The wage-price spiral describes how rising wages push up costs (cost-push), leading to higher prices, which then lead to demands for even higher wages (built-in), creating a self-reinforcing cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which monetary policy action could cause demand-pull inflation?",

          "Expected inflation gets built into wage and price setting",
          "Inflation expectations don't affect actual inflation",
          "Only unexpected inflation matters for unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, developed by Milton Friedman, shows that expected inflation gets incorporated into wage and price decisions, affecting the actual inflation rate."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A significant minimum wage increase raises production costs across many industries, forcing businesses to raise prices - classic cost-push inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The natural rate hypothesis suggests that attempts to push unemployment below its natural rate will cause:",

          "Sustainable economic growth",
          "Deflationary pressures"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The natural rate hypothesis states that trying to maintain unemployment below the natural rate through expansionary policies only causes accelerating inflation without creating permanent employment gains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor could contribute to both demand-pull and cost-push inflation?",

          "Strict price controls on essential goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Currency depreciation makes imports more expensive (cost-push) while making exports cheaper, potentially increasing foreign demand for domestic goods (demand-pull)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'output gap' concept relates to inflation because:",
        "options": [
          "Positive output gaps (actual output > potential) create inflationary pressure",
          "Negative output gaps always cause hyperinflation",
          "Output gaps have no relationship to inflation",
          "Only negative output gaps affect inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A positive output gap occurs when the economy is producing above its potential, creating excess demand that typically leads to demand-pull inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, most economists believe that:",

          "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon",
          "Cost-push factors determine the long-run inflation rate",
          "Demand-pull factors have no effect on inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Milton Friedman's famous statement that 'inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon' reflects the consensus that sustained inflation requires money supply growth."
