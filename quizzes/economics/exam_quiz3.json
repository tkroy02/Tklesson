        "question": "If the amount of the commodity purchased remains unchanged when the price of another commodity changes, the cross elasticity of demand between them will be:",
        "options": ["Positive", "Negative", "Zero", "One"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cross elasticity = 0 means the goods are unrelated (change in price of one does not affect demand for the other)."
