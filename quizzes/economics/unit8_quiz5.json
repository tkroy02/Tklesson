      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "GDP is primarily designed to measure:",

          "Income distribution equality",
          "Environmental sustainability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period, typically one year."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'final goods' approach in GDP calculation avoids:",
        "options": [
          "Double counting intermediate products",
          "Measuring consumption spending",
          "Including government services",
          "Counting investment spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By counting only final goods and services, GDP avoids double counting that would occur if we included the value of intermediate products used in production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which transaction would be included in US GDP?",

          "Is included only if taxes are paid on it"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Illegal activities are excluded from GDP, even if they involve market transactions, because they are not reported in official economic statistics."

        "question": "When a homemaker performs household services:",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Government spending in GDP includes:",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a US company operates a factory in Mexico, the output:",
        "options": [
          "Counts in US GDP but not Mexican GDP",
          "Counts in Mexican GDP but not US GDP",
          "Counts in both countries' GDP",
          "Is excluded from both countries' GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP is based on geographic location. The factory's output counts in Mexican GDP because it's produced in Mexico, regardless of the company's nationality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The value of a newly constructed house:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "New residential construction is counted as investment spending in GDP because it creates capital that will provide housing services over many years."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intermediate goods are excluded because their value is already included in the final goods they help produce. Counting both would overstate total production."
      },
      {

        "question": "Which of the following is included in GDP?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The real estate agent's commission is payment for a current service. Used home sales, unpaid work, and rent (which is already included in housing services) are handled differently."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net exports (X - M) are negative when imports exceed exports, meaning the country is consuming more from abroad than it is selling to other countries."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The underground economy refers to economic activity that:",
        "options": [
          "Is fully reported in GDP statistics",
          "Is legal but unreported to avoid taxes",
          "Only includes illegal activities",
          "Is measured separately from GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The underground economy includes both illegal activities and legal activities that are not reported to avoid taxes or regulations, and is largely excluded from official GDP."

          "Environmental quality improves without market transactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reconstruction spending after disasters counts in GDP, while population changes, shifts to non-market production, and non-market environmental improvements don't directly affect GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'value added' by a firm is calculated as:",

          "Its profit before taxes",
          "The wages it pays to employees"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Value added = Sales revenue - Cost of intermediate goods purchased from other firms. This measures the firm's contribution to total output."

          "Net exports"

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between GDP and GNP is:",
        "options": [
          "GDP includes foreign factor income, GNP excludes it",
          "GNP includes net foreign factor income, GDP excludes it",
          "They are identical measures",
          "Only GDP includes government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "Has no international debt"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Negative net exports (trade deficit) means the country is importing more than it exports, indicating it's consuming more goods and services than it's producing domestically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'base year' in real GDP calculation is used to:",

          "Calculate inflation rates only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base year provides constant prices that allow real GDP to measure changes in physical output over time, eliminating the effects of price changes."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about GDP is correct?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
