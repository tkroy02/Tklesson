    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a perfectly competitive firm can earn:",
        "options": [
          "Only normal profits",
          "Only economic profits",
          "Economic profits, normal profits, or economic losses",
          "Only economic losses"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Due to fixed inputs and temporary market conditions, firms in perfect competition can experience economic profits, normal profits (zero economic profit), or economic losses in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm will earn economic profit in the short run when:",
        "options": [
          "$P > ATC$ at the profit-maximizing output",
          "$P = ATC$ at the profit-maximizing output",
          "$P < ATC$ at the profit-maximizing output",
          "$P > AVC$ at any output level"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Economic profit exists when total revenue exceeds total cost, which occurs when price exceeds average total cost at the output where $MR = MC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a perfectly competitive firm is producing where $P = ATC$, the firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Earning economic profit",
          "Earning normal profit (zero economic profit)",
          "Incurring economic loss",
          "At the shutdown point"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When $P = ATC$, total revenue equals total cost, so the firm earns zero economic profit (normal profit only), covering all costs including opportunity costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a firm should continue operating even with losses if:",
        "options": [
          "$P > ATC$",
          "$P > AVC$",
          "$P < AVC$",
          "$TR > TC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $P > AVC$, the firm covers its variable costs and contributes something toward fixed costs, which must be paid regardless of production level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The shutdown point occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$P = AVC$ at its minimum point",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$TR = TC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the shutdown point, $P = min(AVC)$. Below this price, the firm cannot cover variable costs and minimizes losses by shutting down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $P < AVC$ at all output levels, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production",
          "Continue operating to cover fixed costs",
          "Shut down immediately",
          "Produce where $MR = MC$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When price falls below minimum AVC, the firm cannot cover variable costs and should shut down to limit losses to just fixed costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm's loss is minimized in the short run by:",
        "options": [
          "Producing where $MR = MC$ as long as $P > AVC$",
          "Shutting down regardless of price",
          "Producing at maximum capacity",
          "Producing where $P = ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $P < ATC$ but $P > AVC$, the firm minimizes losses by producing where $MR = MC$, covering variable costs and contributing to fixed costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm shuts down in the short run, its loss equals:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Total variable cost",
          "Total fixed cost",
          "Total cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When shut down, the firm has no revenue and no variable costs, so loss equals total fixed cost, which must be paid regardless of production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A temporary increase in market demand can cause perfectly competitive firms to:",
        "options": [
          "Earn economic profits in the short run",
          "Immediately earn normal profits",
          "Incur losses",
          "Exit the industry"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased demand raises market price, allowing firms to earn economic profits in the short run until new entry occurs in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run supply curve of a perfectly competitive firm is:",
        "options": [
          "The entire $MC$ curve",
          "The $MC$ curve above the $ATC$ curve",
          "The $MC$ curve above the $AVC$ curve",
          "The $ATC$ curve above minimum point"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Firms will only supply output if $P \\geq AVC$, so the supply curve is the portion of the $MC$ curve above the minimum AVC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is producing where $P = \\$10$, $ATC = \\$12$, and $AVC = \\$8$, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Shut down immediately",
          "Continue operating in the short run",
          "Increase production",
          "Decrease price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since $P > AVC$ ($10 > 8$) but $P < ATC$ ($10 < 12$), the firm should continue operating to cover variable costs and contribute to fixed costs, minimizing losses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic loss occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "$TR < TC$",
          "$TR < TVC$",
          "$P < AVC$",
          "$MR < MC$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Economic loss means total revenue is less than total cost, including both explicit and implicit costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a firm's fixed costs are:",
        "options": [
          "Avoidable if the firm shuts down",
          "Sunk costs that must be paid regardless of output",
          "Equal to variable costs at optimal output",
          "Always greater than total revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fixed costs are sunk in the short run - they must be paid even if the firm produces zero output, which is why the shutdown decision depends only on variable costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If market price falls below minimum ATC but remains above minimum AVC, in the short run:",
        "options": [
          "Firms will exit immediately",
          "Firms will earn economic profits",
          "Firms will minimize losses by continuing production",
          "Firms should shut down"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Firms will produce where $MR = MC$ to cover variable costs and contribute to fixed costs, minimizing their losses until long-run adjustments can occur."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between ATC and AVC represents:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost",
          "Average fixed cost",
          "Economic profit",
          "Total fixed cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$ATC - AVC = AFC$. This relationship helps explain why firms can operate at a loss in the short run as long as they cover AVC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A temporary cost increase that affects only some firms in an industry will cause:",
        "options": [
          "All firms to shut down",
          "Affected firms to earn economic profits",
          "Affected firms to potentially incur short-run losses",
          "Immediate industry exit"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Firms facing higher costs may incur losses in the short run, while other firms continue normally. In the long run, affected firms may exit if costs remain high."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a firm is operating at a loss but continues production, it is contributing to fixed costs by an amount equal to:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue",
          "$(P - AVC) \\times Q$",
          "Total variable cost",
          "Marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The contribution to fixed costs is $(P - AVC) \\times Q$, which represents the amount by which total revenue exceeds total variable cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In perfect competition, short-run economic profits or losses are temporary because:",
        "options": [
          "Prices always return to ATC",
          "Firms can immediately adjust all inputs",
          "Entry and exit will occur in the long run",
          "Demand is always perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Free entry and exit ensure that economic profits attract new firms (driving price down) and losses cause firms to exit (driving price up), returning to normal profit in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm's total fixed costs are $\\$1000$ and it can make a contribution to fixed costs of $\\$600$ by operating, its loss from operating is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\$1000$",
          "$\\$600$",
          "$\\$400$",
          "$\\$1600$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Loss = Fixed costs - Contribution to fixed costs = $1000 - 600 = 400$. This is better than shutting down, which would mean a $1000 loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run equilibrium for a competitive industry occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "All firms earn zero economic profit",
          "Market supply equals market demand",
          "Each firm produces where $MR = MC$",
          "Both B and C"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Short-run equilibrium requires both market-level equilibrium (supply = demand) and firm-level profit maximization (each firm producing where $MR = MC$)."
