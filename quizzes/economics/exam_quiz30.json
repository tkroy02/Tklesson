        "question": "For an inferior good, the income elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": ["Positive", "Zero", "Negative", "Infinite"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inferior goods have a negative income elasticity—demand decreases as consumer income rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Average revenue curve is also known as the:",
        "options": ["Profit curve", "Demand curve", "Average cost curve", "Indifference curve"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Average revenue (AR) = total revenue / quantity sold = price per unit. Since price is determined by demand, the AR curve is the demand curve facing the firm."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The variable cost of a firm varies in direct proportion to the:",
        "options": [
          "Volume of its output",
          "Extent of its profit",
          "Volume of its sale",
          "Number of its customers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Variable costs (e.g., raw materials, labor for production) change directly with the level of output."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Law of variable proportion is concerned with:",

          "Long run production function",
          "Laws of returns to scale",
          "Short-run production function",
          "Market structure"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The law of variable proportions (law of diminishing returns) analyzes how output changes when one variable input is increased while others are fixed—a short‑run phenomenon."
