    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point on the PPF represents:",
        "options": [
          "Productive inefficiency",
          "Allocative efficiency",
          "Productive efficiency",
          "Economic growth"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Points on the PPF represent productive efficiency - the economy is using all available resources and technology to maximize total output. It may or may not be allocatively efficient."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point inside the PPF represents:",
        "options": [
          "Productive efficiency",
          "Both productive and allocative efficiency",
          "Productive inefficiency",
          "Optimal resource allocation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Points inside the PPF indicate productive inefficiency - resources are either unemployed or not used in their most productive ways, so more of at least one good could be produced without sacrificing any of the other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Allocative efficiency occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "The economy is producing on the PPF",
          "The economy is producing the combination of goods that society values most",
          "All resources are fully employed",
          "Technology is used to its maximum potential"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency means producing the specific combination of goods and services that best matches society's preferences and needs. It's about producing the 'right things' from society's perspective."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy can be productively efficient but allocatively inefficient if:",
        "options": [
          "It produces inside its PPF",
          "It produces on its PPF but at the wrong point for society's preferences",
          "It has unemployed resources",
          "It experiences economic growth"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Productive efficiency means being on the PPF (using resources fully and effectively). Allocative inefficiency means being at the wrong point on the PPF - not producing the mix of goods that society most desires."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which situation represents both productive and allocative efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "Producing on the PPF at society's most preferred point",
          "Producing inside the PPF with some unemployment",
          "Producing on the PPF but not at society's preferred combination",
          "Producing outside the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both productive efficiency (on PPF) and allocative efficiency (producing what society wants most) are achieved only when the economy produces the optimal combination of goods while fully utilizing resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy has high unemployment during a recession, it is experiencing:",
        "options": [
          "Allocative inefficiency",
          "Productive inefficiency",
          "Both productive and allocative efficiency",
          "Optimal resource allocation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "High unemployment means resources (labor) are not being fully used, placing the economy inside its PPF. This represents productive inefficiency, regardless of whether the output mix is what society wants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A society values education highly but produces mostly military goods while on its PPF. This represents:",
        "options": [
          "Productive efficiency only",
          "Allocative efficiency only",
          "Both productive and allocative efficiency",
          "Neither type of efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Being on the PPF means productive efficiency. However, producing a mix that doesn't match society's preferences (too much military, not enough education) means allocative inefficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Moving from inside the PPF to on the PPF represents an improvement in:",
        "options": [
          "Allocative efficiency",
          "Productive efficiency",
          "Both types of efficiency",
          "Neither type of efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Moving from inside to on the PPF improves productive efficiency by eliminating waste and unemployment. It doesn't necessarily improve allocative efficiency unless it also moves toward society's preferred output mix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'optimal' point on a PPF is where:",
        "options": [
          "Production of both goods is equal",
          "Marginal benefit equals marginal cost for the last unit produced",
          "Total production is maximized",
          "Opportunity cost is minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The optimal point occurs where marginal benefit (the additional satisfaction from one more unit) equals marginal cost (the opportunity cost of producing that unit). This ensures allocative efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the marginal benefit of producing more education exceeds its marginal cost, society should:",
        "options": [
          "Produce less education",
          "Produce more education",
          "Keep production unchanged",
          "Move inside the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When MB > MC, the additional benefit of producing more education is greater than what is sacrificed. Society can gain by reallocating resources toward education until MB = MC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A market economy achieves allocative efficiency primarily through:",
        "options": [
          "Government planning",
          "Consumer sovereignty and price signals",
          "Centralized decision making",
          "Random resource allocation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In market economies, consumer preferences (sovereignty) expressed through buying decisions and price signals guide producers to allocate resources toward what society values most."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would move an economy from productive inefficiency to productive efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "Eliminating unemployment",
          "Improving technology",
          "Discovering new resources",
          "Changing consumer preferences"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Eliminating unemployment moves the economy from inside to on the PPF, achieving productive efficiency. The other options shift the entire PPF outward (growth) rather than moving to the frontier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a factory uses outdated technology that wastes raw materials, this represents:",
        "options": [
          "Allocative inefficiency",
          "Productive inefficiency",
          "Both types of inefficiency",
          "Optimal resource use"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Wasting resources through outdated technology means the economy isn't producing as much as it could with available resources, placing it inside the PPF - productive inefficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point of allocative efficiency on the PPF is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "The lowest possible opportunity cost",
          "The highest possible total output",
          "The combination that maximizes society's well-being",
          "Equal production of both goods"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency is about maximizing social welfare by producing the combination of goods that provides the greatest satisfaction given available resources, not necessarily maximizing total output or equalizing production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an economy experiences economic growth (PPF shifts outward), the new optimal point is determined by:",
        "options": [
          "The same combination as before growth",
          "Society's changing preferences and new production possibilities",
          "Only the new maximum production levels",
          "Government mandates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With a larger PPF, the new optimal point depends on both society's preferences (which may change over time) and the new production possibilities created by growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumers suddenly value healthcare more highly than before, the allocatively efficient point on the PPF will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift toward more healthcare production",
          "Shift toward less healthcare production",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Move inside the PPF"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When society values healthcare more, the marginal benefit of healthcare increases. The optimal point moves along the PPF toward more healthcare production (and less of other goods) to restore MB = MC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A command economy that produces on its PPF but ignores consumer preferences is achieving:",
        "options": [
          "Both productive and allocative efficiency",
          "Productive efficiency only",
          "Allocative efficiency only",
          "Neither type of efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Producing on the PPF means productive efficiency. However, ignoring consumer preferences means the output mix likely doesn't match what society wants, resulting in allocative inefficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between productive and allocative efficiency is that productive efficiency concerns ______ while allocative efficiency concerns ______.",
        "options": [
          "What to produce; how to produce",
          "How to produce; what to produce",
          "For whom to produce; what to produce",
          "How to produce; for whom to produce"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Productive efficiency is about 'how to produce' - using resources in the most technically efficient way. Allocative efficiency is about 'what to produce' - choosing the right mix of goods and services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy is producing the 'wrong' goods from society's perspective, it could improve welfare by:",
        "options": [
          "Moving along the PPF to a different point",
          "Moving from on the PPF to inside the PPF",
          "Increasing total production of all goods",
          "Decreasing technology"
        ],
        "explanation": "Moving along the PPF to a point that better matches society's preferences improves allocative efficiency and social welfare, even though total output (measured in physical units) remains the same.",
        "answer": "A"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of economic efficiency includes:",
        "options": [
          "Only productive efficiency",
          "Only allocative efficiency",
          "Both productive and allocative efficiency",
          "Neither productive nor allocative efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economic efficiency requires both productive efficiency (no waste, on PPF) and allocative efficiency (producing what society wants most). An economy must achieve both to be considered fully economically efficient."
