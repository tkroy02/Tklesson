    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When demand increases and supply remains constant, the new equilibrium will have:",
        "options": [
          "Higher price and lower quantity",
          "Higher price and higher quantity",
          "Lower price and higher quantity",
          "Lower price and lower quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased demand creates a shortage at the original price, leading to price increases that stimulate more production, resulting in both higher equilibrium price and quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When supply increases and demand remains constant, the new equilibrium will have:",
        "options": [
          "Higher price and lower quantity",
          "Higher price and higher quantity",
          "Lower price and higher quantity",
          "Lower price and lower quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increased supply creates a surplus at the original price, leading to price decreases that stimulate more consumption, resulting in lower equilibrium price but higher quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If both demand and supply increase simultaneously, what happens to equilibrium quantity?",
        "options": [
          "Quantity definitely increases",
          "Quantity definitely decreases",
          "Quantity may increase or decrease",
          "Quantity remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When both curves shift right, the combined effect always increases equilibrium quantity, as both changes push quantity in the same direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If both demand and supply increase simultaneously, what happens to equilibrium price?",
        "options": [
          "Price definitely increases",
          "Price definitely decreases",
          "Price may increase, decrease, or stay the same",
          "Price remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The effect on price is ambiguous - increased demand pushes price up, while increased supply pushes price down. The net effect depends on the relative magnitude of the shifts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand decreases and supply increases simultaneously, what happens to equilibrium price?",

          "Price definitely decreases",
          "Price may increase or decrease",
          "Price remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both changes put downward pressure on price, so equilibrium price definitely decreases regardless of the magnitude of the shifts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'cobweb model' in economics describes:",

          "The internet's effect on market prices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cobweb model shows how markets with production time lags (like agriculture) can experience price oscillations as producers respond to previous period's prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run versus long run, supply curves are typically:",
        "options": [
          "More elastic in the short run",
          "More elastic in the long run",
          "Equally elastic in both periods",
          "Perfectly inelastic in the long run"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Supply is more elastic in the long run because producers have more time to adjust their production capacity, technology, and resource allocation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumer tastes shift toward electric vehicles and away from gasoline cars, the long-run equilibrium adjustment will include:",

          "Gasoline car manufacturers immediately going bankrupt",
          "Electric vehicle prices falling as production scales up",
          "No change in either market",
          "Government mandating electric vehicle production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, increased demand for electric vehicles will lead to expanded production capacity, economies of scale, and likely lower prices as supply becomes more elastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a market experiences a permanent increase in demand, the initial price increase is typically:",
        "options": [
          "Smaller than the long-run price change",
          "Larger than the long-run price change",
          "Exactly equal to the long-run price change",
          "Unrelated to the long-run price change"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Initial price spikes are often larger because short-run supply is inelastic. As time passes and supply becomes more elastic, prices typically moderate from their initial peaks."
      },

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tatonnement (French for 'groping') describes how markets feel their way toward equilibrium through successive price adjustments in response to shortages and surpluses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If technological improvement reduces production costs, the long-run market adjustment typically involves:",
        "options": [

          "Lower prices and higher output",
          "No change in price or output",
          "Industry consolidation only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Technology improvements shift supply rightward, leading to lower equilibrium prices and higher equilibrium quantities as production becomes more efficient."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In agricultural markets, the 'hog cycle' demonstrates how:",
        "options": [
          "Prices and production can oscillate due to biological production lags",
          "Government controls always stabilize markets",

          "Technology eliminates all market fluctuations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hog cycle shows how production decisions based on current prices lead to oversupply or shortages later due to the time required for breeding and raising animals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When input prices increase permanently, the long-run market adjustment includes:",
        "options": [
          "Some producers exiting the market",
          "All producers immediately failing",
          "No change in the number of producers",
          "Government bailing out all producers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Permanently higher costs make some marginal producers unprofitable, leading them to exit the market, reducing supply and helping prices adjust upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between momentary, short-run, and long-run equilibrium depends primarily on:",
        "options": [
          "The ability of producers to adjust their production levels",
          "Consumer income levels",
          "Government regulation intensity",
          "International trade patterns"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The time dimension of equilibrium relates to how quickly producers can adjust their output - momentary (no adjustment), short-run (some adjustment), long-run (full adjustment)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a market experiences both increased demand and increased supply, but demand increases more than supply, equilibrium:",
        "options": [
          "Price increases and quantity increases",
          "Price decreases and quantity increases",
          "Price increases and quantity decreases",
          "Price decreases and quantity decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When demand shifts right more than supply shifts right, the demand-side pressure dominates, leading to higher equilibrium price along with the increased quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In markets with easy entry and exit, long-run supply tends to be:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "More elastic than short-run supply"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Easy entry and exit make long-run supply more elastic because new firms can enter when prices are high and existing firms can exit when prices are low."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'adjustment path' to a new equilibrium refers to:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The adjustment path describes the dynamic process of how prices and quantities change over time as markets respond to disturbances and move toward new equilibrium positions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumer income decreases during a recession, and the good is a normal good, the new equilibrium will have:",

          "Higher price and lower quantity",
          "Lower price and higher quantity",
          "Higher price and higher quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For normal goods, decreased income reduces demand, shifting the demand curve leftward, leading to both lower equilibrium price and quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In auction markets, equilibrium is reached through:",

          "Sequential bidding that reveals consumer valuations",
          "Producer cost calculations",
          "Historical price patterns"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Auctions quickly reach equilibrium through competitive bidding that reveals the highest valuations and matches buyers with sellers at market-clearing prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key insight about dynamic market equilibrium is that:",
        "options": [
          "Markets are always in equilibrium",
          "Markets continuously adjust to changing conditions",
          "Equilibrium is a theoretical concept with no real-world relevance",
          "Government must guide all market adjustments"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Dynamic equilibrium emphasizes that markets are constantly adjusting to new information, changing conditions, and disturbances, rather than being static or perfectly balanced at every moment."
