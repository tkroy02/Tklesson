          "Supply is fixed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The law of supply states that, all else equal, as the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied also rises."

        "question": "In a free market economy, price is determined by:",
        "options": ["Government", "Producer", "Consumer", "Demand and supply"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In a free market, prices are determined by the interaction of demand and supply forces without government intervention."

          "Price is highest"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Market equilibrium is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, so there is no pressure for price to change."

        "question": "Net addition to total utility when one more unit is consumed is:",
        "options": ["AU", "MU", "MC", "TU"],
        "answer": "B",

        "question": "Which of the following is the reason for law of demand:",
        "options": ["Price effect", "Backlash effect", "Income effect", "Real balance effect"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The income effect explains that as price falls, real income rises, leading to higher quantity demanded."

        "question": "When there are only few sellers of the commodity, the market is called:",
        "options": ["Monopoly", "Duopoly", "Oligopoly", "Monopsony"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Oligopoly is a market structure characterized by a small number of sellers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the supply curve of the commodity is having a positive slope, a rise in the price of the commodity, results in:",
        "options": [
          "Increase in supply",
          "Increase in quantity supplied",
          "Decrease in supply",
          "Decrease in quantity supplied"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A movement along the supply curve due to price change is called a change in quantity supplied (not a shift in supply)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From the position of stable equilibrium, the market supply of a commodity decreases, while the market demand remains unchanged, then:",
        "options": [
          "Equilibrium price falls",
          "Equilibrium quantity rises",
          "Both equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity decreases",
          "Equilibrium price rises, but equilibrium quantity falls"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Decrease in supply with unchanged demand leads to higher price and lower quantity at the new equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Elasticity of supply for a positively sloped straight line supply curve that intersects the price axis is:",

        ],
        "answer": "C",

          "None of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, products are homogeneous, so advertising is unnecessary and absent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "--- cost can never become zero.",
        "options": [

        "question": "If a positively sloped linear supply curve crosses the quantity axis, the elasticity of supply is:",
        "options": [
          "Inelastic",
          "Elastic",
          "Unitary elastic",
          "Perfectly elastic"
