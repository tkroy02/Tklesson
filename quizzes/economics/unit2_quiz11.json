        "question": "Country A can produce 10 cars or 5 computers. What is Country A's opportunity cost of producing 1 computer?",
        "options": [
          "0.5 cars",
          "2 cars",
          "5 cars",
          "10 cars"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Country A: 5 computers = 10 cars, so 1 computer = 10/5 = 2 cars. The opportunity cost of 1 computer is 2 cars."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
