    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries saw increased government spending and decreased consumption. In the circular flow model, this represents:",
        "options": [
          "Increased leakages and decreased injections",
          "Increased injections (G) and decreased consumption leakage",
          "No net effect on economic activity",
          "Only affecting the foreign sector"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Government spending is an injection, while reduced consumption represents decreased leakage through savings. The net effect depends on the magnitude of these changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country transitioning to remote work might see changes in GDP measurement because:",
        "options": [
          "Home office expenses become business investment",
          "Commuting costs decrease, affecting consumption patterns",
          "The line between workplace and home production blurs",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Remote work affects multiple GDP components: home office setup as investment, reduced commuting costs affecting services consumption, and blurred boundaries between market and non-market production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'sharing economy' (Airbnb, Uber) creates measurement challenges for national income because:",
        "options": [
          "It converts non-market activities into market transactions",
          "All sharing economy activities are illegal",
          "It only affects developing countries",
          "These services are counted in government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Platforms like Airbnb convert spare room rental (previously non-market) into market transactions, while Uber converts personal car use into commercial activity, creating measurement and classification issues."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's digital services grow rapidly but are offered for free to consumers, this likely:",
        "options": [
          "Increases measured GDP significantly",
          "Has no effect on GDP measurement",
          "Understates actual economic welfare improvements",
          "Only affects investment spending"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Free digital services (social media, search engines) create consumer surplus and welfare gains that aren't captured in GDP since there's no market transaction, representing a growing limitation of traditional national accounting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In calculating real GDP during periods of rapid technological change, the chain-weighting method helps address:",
        "options": [
          "The problem of new products and quality improvements",
          "Only price changes for existing goods",
          "International exchange rate fluctuations",
          "Government statistical errors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chain-weighting updates price weights annually, better capturing the economic importance of new products and quality improvements that fixed-weight methods might miss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country with strong environmental regulations might show slower GDP growth but higher:",
        "options": [
          "Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)",
          "Stock market performance",
          "Government debt levels",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Environmental regulations may slow measured GDP growth by increasing business costs, but GPI would account for environmental benefits that GDP ignores, potentially showing better overall progress."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The rise of platform-mediated work (gig economy) affects national income accounting by:",

          "Creating new categories of factor payments",
          "Blurring the distinction between employees and entrepreneurs",
          "Making all workers government employees",
          "Eliminating the need for income measurement"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gig workers are often classified as independent contractors rather than employees, affecting how their income is categorized and measured in national accounts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During supply chain disruptions, inventory investment in GDP calculations typically:",
        "options": [
          "Becomes highly volatile and potentially negative",
          "Remains constant regardless of economic conditions",
          "Is excluded from GDP measurement",
          "Only affects government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Supply chain disruptions cause businesses to draw down inventories (negative inventory investment) or build up excess stocks, creating volatility in the investment component of GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'wellbeing budget' adopted by New Zealand represents a shift toward:",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an economy with high income inequality, GDP per capita may:",
        "options": [
          "Accurately reflect typical living standards",
          "Overstate the economic well-being of most citizens",
          "Understate average consumption levels",
          "Have no relationship to welfare distribution"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP per capita is an average that can be skewed by high incomes at the top. In unequal societies, median income or distribution-adjusted measures better reflect typical living standards."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The treatment of research and development spending in national accounts has evolved to:",
        "options": [

          "Classify it as investment rather than intermediate expense",
          "Count it only in government spending",
          "Include it only for manufacturing firms"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Modern national accounts now treat R&D as investment (creating intangible capital) rather than intermediate consumption, better capturing the knowledge economy's contribution to growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country experiencing both inflation and economic growth will show:",

          "Nominal GDP growing faster than real GDP",
          "Identical growth rates for both measures",
          "No reliable relationship between the measures"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "During periods with both inflation and real growth, nominal GDP grows faster than real GDP because it incorporates both price increases and quantity increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'digital divide' in internet access affects national welfare measures by:",
        "options": [
          "Creating inequality in access to digital economy benefits",
          "Having no impact on economic measurement",
          "Only affecting stock market valuations",
          "Making GDP calculations more accurate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unequal access to digital technologies creates disparities in economic opportunities and welfare that aren't captured by aggregate GDP but affect distributional measures and inclusive growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In measuring the healthcare sector's contribution to GDP during a pandemic:",
        "options": [
          "Increased health spending always indicates improved welfare",
          "Pandemic-related health costs may increase GDP without improving welfare",
          "All health expenditures are excluded from GDP",
          "Only preventive care counts in national income"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pandemic-related health spending (testing, treatment, PPE) increases GDP but represents defensive expenditure to address a health crisis rather than pure welfare improvement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The circular flow model helps explain why stimulus payments during recessions:",
        "options": [
          "Are pure leakages from the economy",
          "Can boost consumption and maintain economic activity",
          "Have no effect on aggregate demand",
          "Only benefit the financial sector"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Stimulus payments inject money into the circular flow, increasing household consumption (C) and helping maintain economic activity when other components (I, X) might be declining."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country with an aging population may see changes in national income patterns because:",
        "options": [
          "Healthcare spending increases as a GDP component",
          "The ratio of workers to retirees affects income generation",
          "Savings patterns and investment change",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Aging populations affect multiple aspects: increased health spending (changing GDP composition), fewer workers per retiree (affecting income generation), and different savings/investment patterns as people dissave in retirement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The treatment of homeowner-occupied housing in national accounts illustrates:",
        "options": [
          "How non-market activities are imputed in GDP",
          "Why all housing should be excluded from economic measures",
          "That only rental properties have economic value",
          "The limitation of including any housing in GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homeowner-occupied housing services are imputed in GDP (owners are considered renting to themselves), demonstrating how national accounts estimate the value of non-market production that would otherwise be market transactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the transition to renewable energy, GDP might initially:",
        "options": [

          "Be unaffected by energy source changes",
          "Only reflect fossil fuel consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Building renewable energy infrastructure (solar farms, wind turbines, grid upgrades) represents investment spending that increases GDP, though the long-term welfare benefits include environmental improvements not captured in GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'productivity paradox' in the digital age refers to how:",
        "options": [
          "GDP growth has accelerated with every technological innovation",
          "Massive IT investments haven't always translated into measured productivity growth",
          "All digital services are perfectly captured in GDP",
          "Traditional industries show no productivity gains"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Despite huge investments in information technology, measured productivity growth has sometimes been disappointing, possibly due to measurement challenges with digital services and quality improvements."
