      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is a condition for the existence of a monopoly?",
        "options": [
          "Big size",
          "Exists in many countries",
          "Absence of government taxes",
          "No close substitute"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A monopoly exists when a single firm produces a product with no close substitutes, giving it market power."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price elasticity of demand for normal goods is always:",
        "options": ["Positive", "Negative", "Constant", "Greater than 1"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price elasticity of demand is negative for all goods (normal and inferior) because of the inverse price‑quantity relationship, though we often refer to its absolute value."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the demand for a commodity is inelastic, an increase in its price will cause the total expenditure of the consumers of the commodity to:",
        "options": [
          "Remain the same",
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Be unaffected by the change"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When demand is inelastic, the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage increase in price, so total expenditure (price × quantity) rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which one of the following is the condition of equilibrium for the monopolist?",
        "options": [
          "MR = MC",
          "MC = AR",
          "MR = MC = Price",
          "AC = AR"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monopolist maximizes profit by producing where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). Unlike perfect competition, price is greater than MR and MC."
