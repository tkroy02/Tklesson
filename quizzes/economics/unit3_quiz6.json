        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A supply schedule is:",
        "options": [
          "A graph showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a standard supply curve graph, which variable is plotted on the horizontal axis?",
        "options": [
          "Price",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider this supply schedule: At $5, quantity supplied is 100 units; at $10, quantity supplied is 300 units. What does this demonstrate?",
        "options": [
          "The law of demand",
          "The law of supply",
          "A change in supply",
          "Market equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This shows the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied - as price increases from $5 to $10, quantity supplied increases from 100 to 300 units, illustrating the law of supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When plotting a supply curve from a supply schedule, the curve typically:",

          "Is perfectly horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Supply curves slope upward from left to right, reflecting the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied - higher prices correspond to higher quantities supplied."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Market supply is found by summing the quantities supplied by all individual producers at each price point - this is called horizontal summation of individual supply curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a supply curve shifts to the right, this indicates:",

          "A decrease in supply at every price",
          "An increase in supply at every price",
          "A movement along the supply curve",
          "A change in the good's price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A rightward shift of the supply curve means that at every price level, producers are willing to supply more quantity than before - this represents an increase in supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a supply curve graph, a change in the good's own price causes:",

          "Movement along the supply curve",
          "A rotation of the supply curve",
          "A change in the curve's slope"
        ],

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Between $25 (700 units) and $30 (900 units), quantity increases by 200 units for a $5 price increase. To reach 800 units (100 more than 700), price would be $25 + ($5/200 × 100) = $25 + $2.50 = $27.50."

        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "Become steeper",
          "Become flatter"
        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "Decreased supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A steeper supply curve indicates less price elasticity - quantity supplied is less responsive to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a supply curve graph, the area above the supply curve but below the market price represents:",
