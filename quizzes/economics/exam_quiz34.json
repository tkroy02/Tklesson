        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a fixed input?",
        "options": ["Raw materials", "Casual workers", "Equipment", "Inventory"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Equipment (machinery, buildings) is typically a fixed input in the short run—its quantity cannot be changed quickly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If regardless of changes in its price, the quantity demanded of a commodity remains unchanged, then the demand curve for the commodity will be:",
        "options": ["Horizontal", "Vertical", "Positively sloped", "Negatively sloped"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Quantity demanded constant despite price changes means perfectly inelastic demand, which is represented by a vertical demand curve."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfect competition in the market:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal revenue curve always slopes upward",
          "Marginal revenue curve always slopes downward",
          "Marginal revenue is always equal to average revenue",
          "Marginal revenue is always less than average revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, each firm faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price, so P = AR = MR (marginal revenue equals average revenue)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The budget line is also known as the:",

          "Consumption possibility line"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The budget line (or budget constraint) shows all combinations of goods a consumer can afford given income and prices—hence 'consumption possibility line'."
