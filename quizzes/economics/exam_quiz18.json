    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a market is initially in equilibrium and supply is a vertical line, what happens when the downward-sloping demand curve shifts to the right?",
        "options": [
          "Price rises, quantity unchanged",
          "Price rises, quantity rises",
          "Price unchanged, quantity rises",
          "Price falls, quantity unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertical supply curve means quantity supplied is fixed. A rightward shift in demand increases price, but quantity remains unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is inelastic, an increase in price will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase quantity demanded",
          "Increase total revenue",
          "Decrease total revenue",
          "Leave total revenue unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When demand is inelastic, the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is less than the percentage increase in price, so total revenue (price × quantity) rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following pairs of commodities is an example of substitutes?",
        "options": [
          "Tea and sugar",
          "Tea and coffee",
          "Pen and ink",
          "Shirt and trousers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Substitutes are goods that can replace each other in consumption. Tea and coffee are classic substitutes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an assumption of the law of demand?",
        "options": [
          "Price of the commodity should not change",
          "Quantity demanded should not change",
          "Prices of substitutes should not change",
          "Demand curve must be linear"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The law of demand holds ceteris paribus—other factors like prices of related goods (substitutes and complements) are assumed constant."
