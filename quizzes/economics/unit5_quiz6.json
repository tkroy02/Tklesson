    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, the typical shape of the marginal cost (MC) curve is:",
        "options": [
          "U-shaped",
          "Always downward sloping",
          "Always horizontal",
          "Perfectly vertical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The MC curve is U-shaped due to initially increasing marginal returns followed by diminishing marginal returns as more variable inputs are added to fixed inputs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The average fixed cost (AFC) curve always:",
        "options": [
          "Slopes upward",
          "Is U-shaped",
          "Slopes downward",
          "Is horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "AFC always slopes downward because fixed costs are spread over more units as output increases, making AFC continuously decrease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The average variable cost (AVC) curve is typically:",
        "options": [
          "U-shaped",
          "Always decreasing",
          "Always increasing",
          "Horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "AVC is U-shaped due to initially increasing then diminishing returns - it falls initially due to specialization, then rises due to diminishing marginal returns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The average total cost (ATC) curve is U-shaped because:",
        "options": [
          "It combines the constantly falling AFC and the U-shaped AVC",
          "Fixed costs increase with output",
          "Variable costs decrease continuously",
          "Marginal cost is always constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ATC = AFC + AVC. AFC always falls, while AVC is U-shaped. Initially, falling AFC dominates, but eventually rising AVC causes ATC to turn upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The marginal cost curve intersects both the AVC and ATC curves at their:",
        "options": [
          "Maximum points",
          "Minimum points",
          "Points of inflection",
          "Starting points"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MC intersects both AVC and ATC at their minimum points. When MC is below the average, it pulls the average down; when above, it pulls the average up."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When MC is less than ATC:",
        "options": [
          "ATC is increasing",
          "ATC is decreasing",
          "ATC is at its minimum",
          "ATC equals MC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When marginal cost is below average total cost, each additional unit costs less than the average, pulling the average down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The vertical distance between the ATC and AVC curves represents:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost",
          "Average fixed cost",
          "Total fixed cost",
          "Variable cost per unit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "ATC - AVC = AFC, so the vertical distance between these curves at any output level equals the average fixed cost at that output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As output increases, the distance between ATC and AVC curves:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Remains constant",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The distance decreases because AFC decreases as output increases, since fixed costs are spread over more units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The minimum point of the AVC curve occurs at a ______ output level than the minimum point of the ATC curve.",
        "options": [
          "Higher",
          "Lower",
          "Same",
          "Unrelated"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AVC reaches its minimum before ATC because ATC includes AFC, which is still falling and delaying ATC's upward turn."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the MC curve is rising but still below the ATC curve:",
        "options": [
          "ATC is rising",
          "ATC is falling",
          "ATC is constant",
          "AVC is negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Even when MC is rising, as long as it remains below ATC, ATC continues to fall because each additional unit still costs less than the current average."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between production functions and cost curves is that:",
        "options": [
          "They are unrelated concepts",
          "The shape of cost curves reflects the productivity of inputs",
          "Cost curves determine production functions",
          "Only long-run costs relate to production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The shape of short-run cost curves directly reflects the underlying production function - initially increasing then diminishing marginal returns create the U-shaped cost curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the MC curve is horizontal, this suggests:",
        "options": [
          "Constant marginal returns",
          "Increasing marginal returns",
          "Diminishing marginal returns",
          "Negative marginal returns"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A horizontal MC curve indicates constant marginal cost, which occurs when there are constant marginal returns to the variable input."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The AVC curve reaches its minimum where:",
        "options": [
          "MC = ATC",
          "MC = AVC",
          "MC = AFC",
          "AVC = ATC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AVC reaches its minimum at the point where MC = AVC, following the mathematical relationship between marginal and average values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When all cost curves are plotted together, which curve is typically the highest?",
        "options": [
          "MC",
          "AVC",
          "ATC",
          "AFC"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "ATC is typically the highest curve since ATC = AVC + AFC, and it lies above both AVC and AFC curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The gap between ATC and AVC is largest:",
        "options": [
          "At very high output levels",
          "At very low output levels",
          "At the output where ATC is minimized",
          "When MC is at its minimum"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The gap is largest at low output levels because AFC is highest when fixed costs are spread over few units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the MC curve shifts upward, what happens to the ATC and AVC curves?",
        "options": [
          "Only ATC shifts up",
          "Only AVC shifts up",
          "Both ATC and AVC shift up",
          "Neither curve shifts"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An upward shift in MC (due to higher variable costs) causes both AVC and ATC to shift upward, though ATC shifts by a smaller amount due to the influence of fixed costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The point where ATC is minimized represents:",
        "options": [
          "The most technologically efficient output level",
          "The profit-maximizing output level",
          "The output where average product is maximized",
          "The shutdown point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The minimum ATC represents the most efficient scale of operation from a cost perspective, where average cost per unit is lowest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the MC curve is below the AVC curve:",
        "options": [
          "AVC is increasing",
          "AVC is decreasing",
          "AVC is at its minimum",
          "AVC is constant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When MC is below AVC, each additional unit costs less than the current average variable cost, pulling AVC downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between the cost curves demonstrates that:",
        "options": [
          "All costs are independent of each other",
          "Marginal cost determines the behavior of average costs",
          "Fixed costs determine variable costs",
          "Average costs determine marginal costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The mathematical relationship shows that marginal cost determines whether average costs are rising or falling - when MC is below the average, the average falls; when above, the average rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental insight from short-run cost curve analysis is that:",
        "options": [
          "Costs are always constant",
          "The relationship between costs and output follows predictable patterns due to fixed constraints",
          "Only variable costs matter for decision making",
          "Cost curves have no practical application"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Short-run cost curves demonstrate systematic relationships between costs and output that result from the fixed constraints firms face in the short run, guiding production and pricing decisions."
