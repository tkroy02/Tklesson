      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A demand schedule is:",
        "options": [
          "A graph showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded",
          "A table showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded",
          "A list of consumer preferences for different products",
          "A producer's production plan at different price levels"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a specific time period."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a standard demand curve graph, which variable is plotted on the vertical axis?",
        "options": [
          "Quantity demanded",
          "Price",
          "Consumer income",
          "Time"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In economics, price is always plotted on the vertical (y) axis and quantity on the horizontal (x) axis, following the mathematical convention where the dependent variable (quantity demanded) responds to the independent variable (price)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider this demand schedule: At $10, quantity demanded is 100 units; at $8, quantity demanded is 150 units. What does this demonstrate?",
        "options": [
          "The law of supply",
          "The law of demand",
          "A change in demand",
          "Market equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This shows the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded - as price decreases from $10 to $8, quantity demanded increases from 100 to 150 units, illustrating the law of demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When plotting a demand curve from a demand schedule, the curve typically:",

          "Taking the highest individual demand at each price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Market demand is found by summing the quantities demanded by all individual consumers at each price point - this is called horizontal summation of individual demand curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a demand curve shifts to the right, this indicates:",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in demand at every price",
          "An increase in demand at every price",
          "A movement along the demand curve",
          "A change in the good's price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A rightward shift of the demand curve means that at every price level, consumers are willing to buy more quantity than before - this represents an increase in demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a demand curve graph, a change in the good's own price causes:",

          "$4.50",
          "$5.50"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Between $4 (300 units) and $3 (400 units), quantity increases by 100 units for a $1 price decrease. To reach 350 units (50 more than 300), price would be $4 - $0.50 = $3.50."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumer income increases and the good is a normal good, the demand curve will:",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Each point on a demand curve represents a specific price and the corresponding quantity that consumers are willing to purchase at that price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a complementary good increases, the demand curve for the main good will:",

          "Become steeper",
          "Not be affected"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the price of a complement rises, demand for both goods decreases because they are consumed together, shifting the demand curve to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A demand curve that becomes flatter indicates:",

          "Increased demand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A flatter demand curve indicates greater price elasticity - quantity demanded is more responsive to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a demand curve graph, the area under the curve but above the market price represents:",

          "Producer surplus",
          "Consumer surplus",
          "Total revenue",
          "Economic profit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay (shown by the demand curve) and what they actually pay, represented by the area under the demand curve but above the market price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If population growth increases the number of buyers in a market, the market demand curve will:",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A demand schedule for pizza shows: $15 - 50 slices; $12 - 80 slices; $9 - 110 slices. What is the quantity demanded at $10?",
        "options": [
          "60 slices",
          "95 slices",
          "100 slices",
          "120 slices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Between $12 (80 slices) and $9 (110 slices), quantity increases by 30 slices for a $3 price decrease. At $10 ($2 decrease from $12), quantity = 80 + (30/3 × 2) = 80 + 20 = 100 slices? Wait, let's recalculate: From $12 to $9 is $3 decrease for 30 slice increase = 10 slices per $1. From $12 to $10 is $2 decrease, so 20 slice increase: 80 + 20 = 100 slices. The correct answer should be 100 slices."

          "Become steeper",
          "Become flatter"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Decreased consumer preference means people are willing to buy fewer gasoline cars at each price, shifting the demand curve to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main purpose of graphing demand schedules is to:",
