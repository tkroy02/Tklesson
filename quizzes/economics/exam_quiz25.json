      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rightward shift of the demand curve indicates:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease in demand",
          "Increase in demand",
          "Contraction of demand",
          "Expansion of demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A rightward shift means that at each price, consumers are willing to buy more—an increase in demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is perfectly inelastic, the demand curve is:",
        "options": ["Horizontal", "Downward sloping", "Vertical", "Upward sloping"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic demand means quantity demanded does not change at all when price changes, so the demand curve is vertical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the shape of the demand curve faced by a firm under perfect competition?",
        "options": [
          "Horizontal",
          "Vertical",
          "Positively sloped",
          "Negatively sloped"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A perfectly competitive firm is a price taker; it can sell any quantity at the market price, so its demand curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The equilibrium price for good X is $20. If the government places a ceiling of $10, what would this result in?",
        "options": ["A shortage", "A surplus", "A black market", "No effect on the market"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling below equilibrium ($10 < $20) creates excess demand (quantity demanded > quantity supplied), leading to a shortage."
