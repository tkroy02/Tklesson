      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated by:",
        "options": [
          "Surveying businesses about their production costs",
          "Tracking prices of a fixed basket of consumer goods and services",
          "Measuring changes in stock market prices",
          "Averaging all prices in the economy equally"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "CPI measures the average change over time in prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The formula for CPI in a given year is:",
        "options": [
          "(Cost of basket in current year / Cost of basket in base year) × 100",
          "(Cost of basket in base year / Cost of basket in current year) × 100",
          "(Current year prices / Base year prices) × 100",
          "Only food and energy prices divided by 100"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CPI = (Cost of Market Basket in Current Year / Cost of Market Basket in Base Year) × 100. The base year CPI is always 100."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the cost of the market basket was $500 in the base year and $600 in the current year, the CPI is:",
        "options": [
          "83.3",
          "100",
          "120",
          "600"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "CPI = ($600 / $500) × 100 = 1.2 × 100 = 120. This means prices are 20% higher than in the base year."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The inflation rate using CPI is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "[(CPI current year - CPI previous year) / CPI previous year] × 100%",
          "(CPI current year / CPI previous year) × 100%",
          "CPI current year - CPI previous year",
          "Only for food and energy prices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inflation Rate = [(CPI current year - CPI previous year) / CPI previous year] × 100%. This gives the percentage increase in prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If CPI was 240 last year and 252 this year, the inflation rate is:",
        "options": [
          "12%",
          "5%",
          "4.8%",
          "95.2%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inflation Rate = [(252 - 240) / 240] × 100% = (12/240) × 100% = 0.05 × 100% = 5%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'market basket' for CPI includes categories such as:",

          "Medical care"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Housing costs (shelter, utilities, furnishings) typically account for about one-third of the CPI market basket, making it the largest component."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Core CPI excludes which volatile categories?",
        "options": [

          "Medical care and education",
          "Apparel and recreation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Core CPI excludes food and energy prices because they are highly volatile and can mask the underlying inflation trend."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The substitution bias in CPI occurs because:",
        "options": [
          "Consumers don't change their buying patterns when prices change",
          "The fixed basket doesn't account for consumers switching to cheaper alternatives",
          "Prices are measured incorrectly",
          "The base year changes too frequently"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Substitution bias overstates inflation because CPI uses a fixed basket, but in reality consumers substitute toward cheaper goods when prices rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Chained CPI (C-CPI-U) attempts to correct for:",
        "options": [
          "Only quality improvements",
          "Substitution bias by using changing weights",
          "Geographic price differences",
          "New product introduction"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Chained CPI accounts for consumer substitution between categories by updating expenditure weights more frequently, providing a better measure of cost-of-living changes."

          "International commodity prices",
          "Government purchasing costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "PPI tracks the average change over time in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. It's often a leading indicator of consumer inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If your nominal income increases by 4% and inflation is 3%, your real income:",
        "options": [
          "Increases by 7%",
          "Increases by 1%",
          "Decreases by 1%",
          "Decreases by 7%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Real Income Change ≈ Nominal Income Change - Inflation Rate = 4% - 3% = 1% increase in purchasing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The GDP deflator differs from CPI because it:",
        "options": [
          "Uses a fixed basket of goods",
          "Includes all goods and services in GDP",
          "Only measures consumer prices",
          "Exports investment goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP deflator measures prices of all domestically produced final goods and services (C+I+G+X-M), while CPI measures only consumer purchases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'quality adjustment' problem in CPI refers to:",
        "options": [
          "Products becoming cheaper but lower quality",
          "Difficulty measuring quality improvements in products",
          "Consumers preferring higher quality goods",
          "Manufacturers reducing quality to cut costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Quality adjustment is challenging because if a product improves but its price stays the same, the real price has actually decreased, but this is hard to measure accurately."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index differs from CPI in that it:",
        "options": [
          "Uses a fixed basket like CPI",
          "Uses changing expenditure patterns and includes more services",
          "Only measures durable goods prices",
          "Excludes healthcare costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "PCE uses changing expenditure patterns and includes a broader range of expenditures, particularly services. The Federal Reserve prefers PCE for inflation targeting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the CPI overstates true inflation by 1% annually, this is problematic for:",
        "options": [
          "Only academic economists",
          "Cost-of-living adjustments and inflation-indexed contracts",
          "Short-term price comparisons only",
          "International trade calculations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "CPI overstatement affects Social Security COLAs, tax brackets, union contracts, and other inflation-indexed arrangements, potentially costing governments and businesses billions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'new product bias' in CPI occurs because:",
        "options": [
          "New products are immediately included in the basket",
          "There's a lag before new products enter the CPI basket",
          "Consumers don't buy new products",
          "New products are always more expensive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "New product bias means CPI may not immediately include innovative products that often provide better value, causing measured inflation to overstate true cost increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'outlet substitution bias' refers to consumers:",

          "Purchasing online instead of in stores"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Outlet substitution bias occurs when consumers shift to lower-priced stores (discount retailers, warehouse clubs) but CPI continues to sample from traditional outlets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which organization is primarily responsible for calculating CPI in the United States?",

          "Treasury Department"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), part of the Department of Labor, calculates and publishes the CPI monthly."
