    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Oligopoly is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "Many small firms selling identical products",
          "A single firm dominating the market",
          "A few large firms dominating the market",
          "Many firms selling differentiated products"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Oligopoly features a market dominated by a few large firms that control most of the market share and are mutually interdependent in their decisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key characteristic that distinguishes oligopoly from other market structures is:",
        "options": [
          "Product differentiation",
          "Barriers to entry",
          "Mutual interdependence among firms",
          "Profit maximization behavior"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In oligopoly, each firm's decisions about price, output, and strategy directly affect other firms in the market, leading to strategic behavior and game theory applications."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A formal agreement among firms to fix prices or divide markets is called:",
        "options": [
          "Price leadership",
          "A cartel",
          "Predatory pricing",
          "Product differentiation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A cartel is a formal organization of producers that agree to coordinate prices and production to maximize joint profits, acting like a multi-plant monopoly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The kinked demand curve model explains:",
        "options": [
          "Why oligopolists always collude",
          "Price rigidity in oligopoly markets",
          "How firms achieve productive efficiency",
          "Why barriers to entry exist"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The kinked demand curve suggests that oligopolists face different elasticities above and below the current price, leading to price stability as firms are reluctant to change prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the kinked demand curve model, if one firm raises its price:",
        "options": [
          "Other firms will match the price increase",
          "Other firms will not match the price increase",
          "All firms will lower their prices",
          "New firms will enter the market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a firm raises price, competitors don't follow, so the firm loses significant market share (elastic demand above current price)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the kinked demand curve model, if one firm lowers its price:",
        "options": [
          "Other firms will not match the price decrease",
          "Other firms will match the price decrease",
          "All firms will raise their prices",
          "The government will intervene"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a firm lowers price, competitors match to avoid losing market share, leading to little gain in quantity sold (inelastic demand below current price)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Prisoner's Dilemma in game theory demonstrates why:",
        "options": [
          "Collusion is always stable",
          "Firms naturally cooperate without agreements",
          "Individual rationality can lead to collectively worse outcomes",
          "Oligopolists always earn economic profits"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Prisoner's Dilemma shows that when each party acts in their own self-interest, the outcome is worse for all parties than if they had cooperated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a duopoly (two-firm market), the Nash equilibrium occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Both firms collude successfully",
          "Each firm chooses its best strategy given the other's strategy",
          "One firm dominates the market completely",
          "Prices are set at competitive levels"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A Nash equilibrium exists when each firm's chosen strategy is optimal given the strategy chosen by the other firm, with no incentive to unilaterally deviate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price leadership occurs when:",

          "One firm sets prices and others follow",
          "The government sets prices for the industry",
          "Prices are determined by auction"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In price leadership, a dominant firm sets the price and other firms in the industry follow that price to maintain market stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A contestable market is one where:",

          "Only one firm can exist profitably",
          "All firms earn zero economic profit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In contestable markets, the threat of potential entry (even if no actual entry occurs) can force oligopolists to behave more competitively."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) measures:",

          "Consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "HHI is calculated by summing the squares of the market shares of all firms, with higher values indicating greater market concentration."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Predatory pricing involves:",
        "options": [
          "Setting prices below cost to drive out competitors",
          "Colluding with competitors to fix prices",
          "Charging different prices to different customers",
          "Matching competitors' price increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Predatory pricing is setting prices very low (often below cost) to eliminate competitors, then raising prices once competition is reduced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In oligopoly, non-price competition often takes the form of:",
        "options": [
          "Secret price cuts",
          "Advertising and product development",
          "Output restrictions",
          "Price fixing agreements"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Oligopolists frequently compete through advertising, product differentiation, and innovation rather than price competition, which can lead to destructive price wars."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main reason cartels are often unstable is:",
        "options": [

          "Members have incentive to cheat on agreements",
          "They always lead to losses for all firms",
          "Consumers refuse to buy from cartel members"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cartel members have strong incentives to secretly lower prices or increase output to gain market share, undermining the cartel agreement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In game theory, a dominant strategy is one that:",
        "options": [
          "Is best regardless of what other players do",
          "Is only best if other players cooperate",
          "Leads to the highest possible profit",
          "All players must follow"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dominant strategy yields the best outcome for a player no matter what strategies other players choose."

          "Barriers to entry",
          "Product homogeneity",
          "Price-taking behavior"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Barriers to entry such as economies of scale, control of resources, or strategic behavior prevent new firms from entering and competing away economic profits."

          "Quantity",
          "Advertising",
          "Product quality"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the Cournot model, firms choose quantities simultaneously, and the market price is determined by the total quantity supplied."

          "Public utilities"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Automobile manufacturing, commercial airlines, and telecommunications are classic oligopolies with a few dominant firms and significant barriers to entry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental challenge in analyzing oligopoly is that:",
        "options": [
          "Firms don't maximize profits",
          "There's no single model that fits all situations",
          "Barriers to entry don't exist",
          "Firms always cooperate perfectly"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Oligopoly behavior depends heavily on specific market conditions, firm strategies, and expectations, requiring multiple models (game theory, kinked demand, etc.) for analysis."
