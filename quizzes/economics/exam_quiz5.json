        "question": "Which of the following is not part of Macroeconomics?",
        "options": [
          "National Income",
          "Balance of Payment Equilibrium",
          "Inflation",
          "Monopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Monopoly is a microeconomic topic—it deals with individual market structures. Macroeconomics studies economy-wide aggregates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Excess demand occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Price is high",
          "Supply exceeds demand",
          "Demand exceeds supply",
          "Market clears"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Excess demand means quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied at the current price (a shortage)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive market has:",
        "options": [
          "One seller and many buyers",
          "Few sellers and many buyers",
          "Many buyers and sellers",
          "Many sellers and one buyer"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition is characterized by many buyers and many sellers, so no single participant can influence the market price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Microeconomics doesn’t deal with:",
        "options": [

          "Determination of factor prices",
          "Price determination of commodities",
          "General equilibrium analysis"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "General equilibrium analysis studies how all markets in an economy interact and reach simultaneous equilibrium. Though sometimes considered part of microeconomic theory, it is broader and often treated separately; but given options, the others are clearly micro topics while general equilibrium is a more advanced integration of micro and macro ideas. Standard intro courses often exclude it from basic microeconomics."

        "options": ["MC", "TC", "AFC", "ATC"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average Cost (AC) = Average Variable Cost (AVC) + Average Fixed Cost (AFC)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The horizontal supply curve parallel to quantity axis represents",

          "Inelastic supply",
          "Perfectly elastic supply",
          "Perfectly inelastic supply"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A horizontal supply curve means producers are willing to supply any quantity at a constant price—perfectly elastic supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When output is zero, variable cost is ---",
        "options": ["Maximum", "Minimum", "Infinity", "Zero"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Variable costs vary with output. At zero output, variable cost is zero."

          "Changes in cost of production",
          "Change in technology",
          "Change in price of related products"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A change in quantity supplied refers to movement along the supply curve due to a change in the product's own price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At prices above the equilibrium price",
        "options": [
          "Quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded",
          "Quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied",
          "There is shortage",
          "All of the above is possible"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When price is above equilibrium, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, leading to a surplus."

        "question": "When MC cuts AC, AC is at its ---",
        "options": ["Maximum", "Minimum", "Zero", "Negative"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Marginal cost (MC) intersects average cost (AC) at the minimum point of AC."
      },

          "Decrease in equilibrium price and increase in equilibrium quantity",
          "Both equilibrium price and quantity rises"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Increase in demand with unchanged supply leads to higher equilibrium price and higher equilibrium quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "There is no distinction between firm and industry in",
        "options": [

          "Monopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "Oligopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "Increase in equilibrium price and decrease in equilibrium quantity",
          "Both equilibrium price and quantity falls"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Decrease in demand with unchanged supply leads to lower equilibrium price and lower equilibrium quantity."

        "options": ["Rises", "Falls", "Maximum", "Minimum"],
        "answer": "A",
