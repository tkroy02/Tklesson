        "question": "Which of the following is not part of Macroeconomics?",
        "options": [
          "National Income",
          "Balance of Payment Equilibrium",
          "Inflation",
          "Monopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Monopoly is a microeconomic topic—it deals with individual market structures. Macroeconomics studies economy-wide aggregates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Excess demand occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Price is high",
          "Supply exceeds demand",
          "Demand exceeds supply",
          "Market clears"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Excess demand means quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied at the current price (a shortage)."

          "Few sellers and many buyers",
          "Many buyers and sellers",
          "Many sellers and one buyer"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfect competition is characterized by many buyers and many sellers, so no single participant can influence the market price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Microeconomics doesn’t deal with:",
        "options": [
          "The study of individual economic units",
          "Determination of factor prices",
          "Price determination of commodities",
          "General equilibrium analysis"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "General equilibrium analysis studies how all markets in an economy interact and reach simultaneous equilibrium. Though sometimes considered part of microeconomic theory, it is broader and often treated separately; but given options, the others are clearly micro topics while general equilibrium is a more advanced integration of micro and macro ideas. Standard intro courses often exclude it from basic microeconomics."
