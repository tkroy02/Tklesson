    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When we add the government sector to the circular flow model, which new flow is introduced?",
        "options": [
          "Taxes and government spending",
          "Only international trade",
          "Household savings only",
          "Firm investment only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The government sector introduces taxes (leakages) and government spending (injections) into the circular flow, affecting both households and firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expanded circular flow with government, taxes paid by households represent:",
        "options": [
          "An injection into the spending stream",
          "A leakage from the spending stream",
          "Neither leakage nor injection",
          "Direct government production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Taxes are leakages because they remove purchasing power from households and firms, reducing the amount available for private consumption and investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Government purchases of goods and services in the circular flow are considered:",
        "options": [
          "Leakages that reduce economic activity",
          "Injections that increase economic activity",
          "Neutral flows with no economic impact",
          "Part of household consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Government spending on goods and services injects money back into the circular flow by creating demand for products and generating income for producers."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transfer payments from government to households:",
        "options": [
          "Are included in government purchases in GDP",
          "Are not payments for current production",
          "Represent government production of goods",
          "Are considered business investment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transfer payments (Social Security, unemployment benefits) redistribute income but don't represent payment for current production, so they're not included in government purchases in GDP calculation."
      },

          "Household savings"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Exports are injections because foreign spending on domestic goods brings money into the domestic economy, increasing aggregate demand."

          "Part of domestic investment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Imports are leakages because domestic spending on foreign goods sends money out of the domestic economy, reducing the circular flow of domestic income."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The three leakages that remove spending from the circular flow are: savings by households, taxes paid to government, and spending on imports."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the circular flow to be in equilibrium with all sectors:",
        "options": [

          "Are unrelated to domestic income"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Net exports can be positive (trade surplus), negative (trade deficit), or zero (balanced trade), affecting whether the foreign sector adds to or subtracts from domestic spending."

          "No international trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When domestic savings exceed investment (S > I), the excess savings often flow abroad, typically accompanied by a trade surplus as the country exports more than it imports."
