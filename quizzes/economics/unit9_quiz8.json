          "Savers holding cash"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Borrowers benefit because they repay loans with money that has less purchasing power. Lenders receive repayment in devalued currency."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The redistribution effect of inflation occurs because:",
        "options": [
          "All prices and incomes rise at the same rate",
          "Different prices and incomes adjust at different rates",
          "The government automatically increases all benefits",
          "Inflation affects everyone equally"
        ],

        "explanation": "When all prices are rising, it becomes difficult to distinguish between general inflation and changes in relative prices that signal shifts in supply and demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'inflation tax' refers to:",
        "options": [

          "Taxes on businesses that raise prices too quickly"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The inflation tax is the loss of purchasing power suffered by holders of cash and fixed-value assets when prices rise. Governments benefit because they can print money to finance spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During moderate, anticipated inflation, which effect is minimized?",

          "All effects are minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When inflation is anticipated, people can adjust contracts and expectations, reducing arbitrary redistribution. However, menu costs and shoe leather costs still occur."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hyperinflation is particularly damaging because it:",

          "Governments always index tax brackets to inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bracket creep occurs when inflation pushes nominal incomes into higher tax brackets even though real income may not have increased, creating an unintended tax increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'flight from money' during high inflation refers to:",

          "The effect on international competitiveness"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When inflation makes price signals less clear, resources may be misallocated, reducing the economy's productive efficiency and potential output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Countries with high inflation typically experience:",

          "Capital flight and reduced foreign investment",
          "Increased domestic savings rates",
          "Lower import costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "Savers holding cash"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Debtors benefit because they repay loans with money that has less purchasing power, effectively reducing their real debt burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'resource misallocation' cost of inflation occurs because:",

          "Inflation has no effect on resource allocation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inflation causes resources to be diverted from productive activities to inflation-avoidance activities (financial management, frequent price changes), reducing overall economic efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During deflation, the real burden of debt:",

          "Increases",
          "Remains unchanged",
          "Becomes irrelevant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deflation increases the real burden of debt because borrowers must repay with money that has greater purchasing power, making debt more expensive in real terms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Most central banks target low, stable inflation because:",
        "options": [
          "Zero inflation is optimal for economic growth",
          "It minimizes the costs of inflation while avoiding deflation risks",
          "High inflation stimulates economic activity",
          "Inflation has no economic costs at low levels"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Low, stable inflation (typically 2%) minimizes the costs of inflation while providing a buffer against deflation, which can be even more damaging to economic stability."
