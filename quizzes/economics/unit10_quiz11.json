    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is 0.75, what is the value of the simple spending multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "0.25",
          "1.33",
          "4",
          "5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The simple spending multiplier (k) is calculated as 1 / (1 - MPC) = 1 / (1 - 0.75) = 1 / 0.25 = 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "With an MPC of 0.8, a $100 billion increase in government spending will ultimately increase equilibrium real GDP by:",
        "options": [
          "$80 billion",
          "$100 billion",
          "$500 billion",
          "$125 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "First, find the multiplier: k = 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 5. Then, multiply the initial spending by the multiplier: $100 billion * 5 = $500 billion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The formula for the simple tax multiplier is:",
        "options": [
          "1 / MPS",
          "-MPC / MPS",
          "1 / (1 - MPC)",
          "MPS / MPC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The tax multiplier is -MPC / (1 - MPC) or -MPC / MPS. The negative sign indicates that an increase in taxes reduces GDP, and a decrease in taxes increases GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the MPC is 0.6, a $50 billion tax cut will increase equilibrium real GDP by:",

          "$30 billion",
          "$75 billion",
          "$50 billion",
          "$125 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, find the tax multiplier: -MPC / MPS = -0.6 / 0.4 = -1.5. Then, multiply the tax cut by the multiplier. A tax cut is a negative change in T, so: -$50 billion * -1.5 = +$75 billion."

          "A $10 trillion recessionary gap",
          "A $9.5 trillion inflationary gap"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Output Gap = Current Output - Potential Output = $9.5T - $10T = -$0.5T. A negative output gap, where current output is below potential, is a recessionary gap."

          "1",
          "MPC",
          "1 / MPS"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When government spending and taxes are increased by the same amount, the net effect on aggregate demand is positive and equal to the initial change in spending. The balanced budget multiplier is 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$0",
          "$200 billion",
          "$2,000 billion",
          "$20 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Use the balanced budget multiplier, which is 1. The net change in GDP is equal to the initial change in government spending. So, $200 billion * 1 = $200 billion. The high MPC affects the individual multipliers, but they cancel out in this specific case."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an economy with no taxes or foreign trade, if the MPC is 0.5, what is the spending multiplier? If autonomous consumption increases by $100, what is the total change in GDP?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Multiplier k = 1 / (1 - 0.5) = 2. Total change in GDP = Change in Autonomous Spending * k = $100 * 2 = $200."

          "$120 billion",
          "$300 billion",
          "$750 billion",
          "$75 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, find the multiplier: k = 1 / MPS = 1 / 0.4 = 2.5. To find the required change in G, rearrange the formula: ΔG = Desired ΔGDP / k = $300 billion / 2.5 = $120 billion."

          "$200 billion",
          "$300 billion",
          "$750 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, find the MPC: MPC = 1 - MPS = 0.6. Then, the tax multiplier = -MPC / MPS = -0.6 / 0.4 = -1.5. To close a recessionary gap, we need a tax cut (a negative ΔT). Rearrange: ΔT = Desired ΔGDP / Tax Multiplier = $300 billion / -1.5 = -$200 billion. The size of the tax cut is $200 billion."

          "4",
          "3.57",
          "2.5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The complex multiplier with a proportional tax is 1 / [1 - MPC(1 - t)]. Here, t=0.1. So, multiplier = 1 / [1 - 0.8(1 - 0.1)] = 1 / [1 - 0.8(0.9)] = 1 / [1 - 0.72] = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57."

          "1 / (0.7)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In an open economy, the multiplier is 1 / (MPS + MPM). MPS = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3. MPM = 0.15. So, the multiplier is 1 / (0.3 + 0.15) = 1 / 0.45 ≈ 2.22."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total change in GDP is ΔG * k = $50B * 4 = $200B. The initial change is in G. The induced change in Consumption is the total change in GDP minus the initial government spending: $200B - $50B = $150B."
