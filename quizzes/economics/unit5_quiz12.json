    "subject": "Economics",
    "topic": "Utility Functions, Marginal Utility, Budget Calculations, Indifference Curves",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a consumer's utility function is $U(X,Y) = 2X + 3Y$, what is the marginal utility of good X?",
        "options": [
          "$2$",
          "$3$",
          "$2X$",
          "$3Y$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Marginal utility is the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to that good. $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial X} = 2$, so the marginal utility of X is constant at $2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer has 100 dollars to spend. Good X costs 10 dollars and good Y costs 5 dollars. What is the maximum quantity of good Y they can buy?",
        "options": [
          "10 units",
          "20 units",
          "50 units",
          "100 units"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Maximum $Y = \\frac{\\text{Income}}{P_Y} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20$ units. This is the Y-intercept of the budget constraint."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the utility function $U(X,Y) = X^2Y$, what is the marginal utility of Y when $X=2$ and $Y=3$?",
        "options": [
          "$4$",
          "$6$",
          "$12$",
          "$18$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$MU_Y = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial Y} = X^2$. When $X=2$, $MU_Y = 2^2 = 4$. The marginal utility of Y depends only on the quantity of X consumed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of good X is 4 dollars and the price of good Y is 2 dollars, what is the slope of the budget constraint?",
        "options": [
          "$-2$",
          "$-0.5$",
          "$-4$",
          "$-1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope of budget constraint = $-\\frac{P_X}{P_Y} = -\\frac{4}{2} = -2$. This means to get 1 more unit of X, you must give up 2 units of Y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer's MRS is 3 (willing to give up 3Y for 1X). If $P_X = 6$ dollars and $P_Y = 2$ dollars, what should the consumer do?",
        "options": [
          "Buy more X and less Y",
          "Buy more Y and less X",
          "Maintain current consumption bundle",
          "Spend all money on X"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$MRS = 3$ and $\\frac{P_X}{P_Y} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$. Since $MRS = \\frac{P_X}{P_Y}$, the consumer is already at the optimal bundle where the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If total utility is increasing at a decreasing rate, then marginal utility is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive and increasing",
          "Positive and decreasing",
          "Negative",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When total utility increases at a decreasing rate, the additions to utility (marginal utility) are positive but getting smaller with each additional unit consumed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer has utility function $U(X,Y) = \\min(2X, 3Y)$. If they consume 4 units of X and 6 units of Y, what is their total utility?",
        "options": [
          "$8$",
          "$12$",
          "$18$",
          "$24$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For perfect complements $U = \\min(2X, 3Y)$. $2X = 8$, $3Y = 18$. Take the minimum: $\\min(8, 18) = 8$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If income increases from 200 dollars to 300 dollars while prices remain constant, the budget constraint will:",
        "options": [
          "Pivot outward on the X-axis",
          "Pivot outward on the Y-axis",
          "Shift parallel outward",
          "Become steeper"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With prices unchanged, an income increase causes a parallel outward shift of the budget constraint, as the intercepts on both axes increase proportionally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the MRS for utility function $U(X,Y) = X^{0.5}Y^{0.5}$ at point $(4,9)$:",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{2}{3}$",
          "$\\frac{3}{2}$",
          "$\\frac{4}{9}$",
          "$\\frac{9}{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$MRS = \\frac{MU_X}{MU_Y} = \\frac{0.5X^{-0.5}Y^{0.5}}{0.5X^{0.5}Y^{-0.5}} = \\frac{Y}{X}$. At $(4,9)$, $MRS = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25$ or $\\frac{9}{4}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\frac{MU_X}{P_X} > \\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$, a utility-maximizing consumer should:",
        "options": [
          "Buy more X and less Y",
          "Buy more Y and less X",
          "Buy equal amounts of X and Y",
          "Stop consuming both goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $\\frac{MU_X}{P_X} > \\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$, the last dollar spent on X gives more utility than the last dollar spent on Y. To maximize utility, reallocate spending toward X and away from Y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For $U(X,Y) = XY$, with $P_X = 2$ dollars, $P_Y = 3$ dollars, and $I = 60$ dollars, what is the optimal consumption of X?",
        "options": [
          "10 units",
          "15 units",
          "20 units",
          "30 units"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For Cobb-Douglas $U=XY$, the optimal condition is: $P_XX = P_YY$ and $P_XX + P_YY = I$. So $2X = 3Y$ and $2X + 3Y = 60$. Substituting: $2X + 2X = 60$, so $4X=60$, $X=15$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When total utility is maximized, marginal utility is:",

          "Maximized",
          "Minimized",
          "Zero",
          "Negative"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total utility is maximized when consuming one more unit provides no additional satisfaction, meaning marginal utility equals zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer's budget is 180 dollars. If they buy 12 units of X at 10 dollars each, how much money remains for good Y priced at 5 dollars?",
        "options": [
          "60 dollars",
          "120 dollars",
          "30 dollars",
          "90 dollars"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Money spent on $X = 12 \\times 10 = 120$ dollars. Money remaining = $180 - 120 = 60$ dollars. This can buy $\\frac{60}{5} = 12$ units of Y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For perfect substitutes $U(X,Y) = 2X + Y$ with $P_X = 4$ dollars, $P_Y = 2$ dollars, $I = 40$ dollars, what is the optimal bundle?",
        "options": [
          "$(0X, 20Y)$",
          "$(10X, 0Y)$",
          "$(5X, 10Y)$",
          "Any bundle on budget line"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Compare $\\frac{MU_X}{P_X} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5$ vs $\\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$. They are equal, so all bundles on the budget line give the same utility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of good X decreases, the substitution effect causes the consumer to:",
        "options": [
          "Buy more X because real income increased",
          "Buy more X because it's relatively cheaper",
          "Buy less X to maintain same utility level",
          "Buy more of both goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The substitution effect isolates the impact of the change in relative prices, holding utility constant. When $P_X$ falls, X becomes relatively cheaper compared to Y, so consumers substitute toward X."

          "92 dollars"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cost = $(5 \\times 6) + (8 \\times 4) = 30 + 32 = 62$ dollars."

          "Decreases as X increases",
          "Is always zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Convex indifference curves exhibit diminishing MRS. As you consume more X and less Y, you become less willing to give up Y for additional X, so MRS decreases."
