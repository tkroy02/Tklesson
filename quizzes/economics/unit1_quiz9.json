        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Positive economics is best defined as:",
        "options": [
          "Economics that focuses only on good outcomes",

          "Optimistic economic forecasts",
          "Economics that supports government intervention"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Positive economics involves objective, testable statements about economic facts and relationships—what is, was, or will be—without value judgments."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement is an example of positive economics?",
        "options": [
          "The government should raise the minimum wage",
          "Unemployment is too high and must be reduced",
          "When minimum wage increases by 10 percent, teen employment falls by 2 percent",
          "Income inequality is unfair and should be eliminated"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is positive because it states a testable relationship between variables without making value judgments about whether the outcome is good or bad."
      },

        "question": "Which statement is an example of normative economics?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is normative because it prescribes what the government 'should' do, reflecting a value judgment about priorities."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key difference between positive and normative economics is:",

          "Positive studies macro; normative studies micro"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Positive economics is descriptive and testable (what is), while normative economics is prescriptive and value-based (what ought to be)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which word most clearly signals a normative economic statement?",

          "Will"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Words like 'should,' 'ought to,' 'must,' 'fair,' or 'unfair' typically signal normative statements containing value judgments."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The statement 'Raising interest rates will reduce inflation' is:",

          "Both positive and normative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is positive because it predicts a cause-and-effect relationship that can be tested empirically, without saying whether we should raise rates."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The statement 'The government ought to provide healthcare for all citizens' is:",

          "Positive if supported by data"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is normative because 'ought to' signals a value judgment about what policy should be adopted based on beliefs about fairness or rights."

        "question": "Which statement can be tested and potentially proven false?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Positive statements like this can be tested with data and potentially falsified, unlike normative statements which are based on values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economists may disagree about positive economics because:",

          "Positive statements cannot be tested",
          "Economics is entirely subjective"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Even with positive economics, economists can disagree due to different interpretations of data, different models, or incomplete information—not value differences."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economists may disagree about normative economics because:",

          "Neither positive nor normative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is purely positive—it reports measurable data without making value judgments about whether the change is good or bad."

          "Neither type of statement"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is normative because it contains value judgments ('unacceptable,' 'must') about what should be done, not just describing what is."

        "question": "Which statement properly separates positive from normative analysis?",

          "They cannot be separated"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The first statement describes a testable relationship (positive); the second makes a value judgment about policy quality (normative)."

        "question": "Good economic analysis typically requires:",
        "options": [
          "Only positive economics",
          "Only normative economics",
          "Both positive analysis (understanding consequences) and normative judgments (choosing goals)",
          "Neither type—only mathematical models"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Effective policy requires positive analysis to understand consequences and normative judgments to choose among alternatives based on values and goals."

          "Neither type of analysis"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is positive analysis—measuring and reporting the effect without judging whether minimum wage increases are good or bad policy."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A policymaker saying 'Despite the employment effects, we should raise minimum wage because it's the right thing to do' is making a:",

          "Testable hypothesis",
          "Scientific conclusion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is normative—acknowledging the facts (employment effects) but making a value-based judgment about what 'should' be done."

        "question": "The statement 'Free trade increases total national income but may harm some workers' is:",

        "question": "Why is the positive-normative distinction important in economics?",
        "options": [
          "It allows economists to avoid all disagreements",
          "It helps separate factual analysis from value-based policy recommendations",
          "It proves that economics is entirely objective",
          "It eliminates the need for data"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The distinction helps clarify when disagreements are about facts (positive—potentially resolvable with data) versus values (normative—reflecting different priorities)."
