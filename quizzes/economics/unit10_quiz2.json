        "question": "The largest source of revenue for the federal government is typically:",
        "options": [
          "Corporate income taxes",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In most developed economies, including the United States, individual income taxes and payroll taxes (which fund Social Security and Medicare) collectively constitute the primary source of federal government revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the three possible states of a government's budget?",
        "options": [
          "Surplus, Deficit, Balanced",
          "Inflationary, Deflationary, Stable",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A budget is in surplus when revenues exceed expenditures, in deficit when expenditures exceed revenues, and balanced when revenues equal expenditures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A progressive tax system is one where:",
        "options": [
          "The tax rate decreases as income increases",
          "The tax rate is the same for all income levels",
          "The tax rate increases as income increases",
          "Only the poorest citizens pay taxes"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a progressive tax system, the average tax rate rises with income. This is based on the ability-to-pay principle, aiming to place a higher burden on those with greater financial resources (e.g., the U.S. federal income tax)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mandatory (or non-discretionary) spending refers to government expenditures that:",
        "options": [
          "Are determined by ongoing government contracts",
          "Are automatically determined by existing laws without annual approval",

          "Are considered optional by the legislature"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Mandatory spending is required by law. It includes entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, where spending is based on eligibility criteria and benefit formulas set in permanent legislation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between the national debt and a budget deficit is that the deficit is:",
        "options": [
          "The total amount owed, while the debt is the annual shortfall",
          "The annual shortfall, while the debt is the total accumulation of past deficits",
          "A flow variable, while the debt is also a flow variable",
          "A stock variable, while the debt is a flow variable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A budget deficit is a flow variable measured over a year (like water flowing into a bathtub). The national debt is a stock variable—the total amount of money the government owes at a point in time (like the water level in the bathtub)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Discretionary spending in the federal budget is primarily allocated to:",

          "Unemployment insurance payments"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Discretionary spending is funding that is approved by Congress and the President through annual appropriations acts. It includes spending on defense, education, infrastructure, and scientific research."

          "Takes the same percentage of income from all groups",
          "Takes a larger percentage of income from high-income groups",
          "Only taxes corporations and not individuals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A regressive tax imposes a higher effective tax rate on low-income earners. Sales taxes are often considered regressive because lower-income households spend a larger proportion of their income on taxable goods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'fiscal year'?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A fiscal year (FY) is a one-year period that governments use for accounting and budgeting purposes. For example, the U.S. federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30."

          "A value-added tax (VAT)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A direct tax is levied directly on an individual or organization and cannot be shifted to another party. The individual income tax and corporate income tax are prime examples."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transfer payments are government expenditures that:",

        ],
        "answer": "C",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cyclically adjusted budget balance attempts to measure what the budget balance would be if:",
        "options": [
          "The economy was at the peak of the business cycle",
          "The economy was at the trough of the business cycle",

          "There were no mandatory spending programs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Also known as the full-employment budget balance, it removes the automatic effects of the business cycle on revenues and expenditures. This helps assess whether fiscal policy is inherently expansionary or contractionary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which category of spending is often the most difficult for the government to reduce in the short term due to legal obligations?",
        "options": [
          "Discretionary spending on infrastructure",
          "Defense spending",

          "The property tax",
          "A national sales tax",
          "The estate tax"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An indirect tax is levied on one entity (like a business) but is ultimately paid by another (the consumer). Sales taxes, excise taxes, and Value-Added Taxes (VAT) are indirect taxes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'crowding out' effect suggests that persistent government budget deficits can lead to:",

          "Lower interest rates and more private investment",
          "Higher interest rates and reduced private investment",
          "An increase in the nation's exports",
          "A decrease in the national debt"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To finance a deficit, the government borrows money, increasing the demand for loanable funds. This can drive up interest rates, making it more expensive for businesses to borrow and invest, thus 'crowding out' private investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of a capital budget?",

          "To track the daily cash flow of the government"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A capital budget is used to finance long-lived assets like roads, bridges, and public buildings. These investments provide benefits over many years, so it is often considered prudent to finance them with long-term debt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A proportional tax (flat tax) system is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "A tax rate that increases with income",
          "A tax rate that decreases with income",
          "A constant tax rate for all income levels",
          "No taxes for low-income earners"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a proportional or flat tax system, all taxpayers pay the same percentage of their income in taxes, regardless of their income level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'automatic stabilizer' refers to:",
        "options": [
          "Discretionary tax cuts passed by Congress during a recession",
          "Government spending programs that require annual approval",
          "Elements of the budget that dampen economic cycles without new legislation",
          "The Federal Reserve's control over interest rates"
        ],
        "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers are built-in features of the budget that automatically increase spending or decrease taxes when the economy slows, and do the reverse when the economy expands. Examples include the progressive income tax and unemployment benefits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a consequence of a government continuously running a large budget deficit?",
        "options": [
          "A rapid reduction in the national debt",
          "Increased national savings",
          "The need for increased borrowing, leading to a larger national debt",
          "Guaranteed long-term economic growth"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since a deficit means spending more than is collected in revenue, the government must borrow to cover the gap. This borrowing adds to the total accumulated national debt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In government budget planning, the 'balanced budget multiplier' suggests that if the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, the overall effect on GDP is:",
        "options": [
          "Strongly negative",
          "Zero",
          "Strongly positive",
          "Slightly positive"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The balanced budget multiplier is generally equal to 1. The increase in government spending injects money directly into the economy, while the tax increase reduces disposable income. However, since people save a portion of their income, the net effect is a modest increase in aggregate demand and GDP."
