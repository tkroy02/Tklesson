          "Subsidy to producers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling sets a legal maximum price that sellers can charge for a good or service, typically set below the market equilibrium price."

          "Increased supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, creating a shortage (excess demand)."
      },

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The minimum wage is an example of a:",

        "question": "When a price ceiling creates a shortage, non-price rationing mechanisms often include:",
        "options": [
          "Waiting lists, queues, and black markets",
          "Automatic price increases",
          "Increased production",
          "Government production mandates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When prices cannot rise to allocate scarce goods, alternative rationing methods emerge such as first-come-first-served, waiting lists, and illegal black markets."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A subsidy is a government payment that:",

          "Always creates shortages",
          "Only benefits consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A subsidy is a government payment that reduces the cost of production for suppliers or the price paid by consumers, encouraging increased production or consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A per-unit subsidy to producers shifts the supply curve:",

          "Becomes flatter"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A subsidy reduces producers' costs, making them willing to supply more at each price level, which shifts the supply curve to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main unintended consequence of rent control is often:",

          "Taxes on food production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Agricultural price supports usually set price floors above equilibrium, requiring government purchase and storage of surplus production to maintain the supported price."

        "question": "A subsidy creates a 'wedge' between:",

          "Fixed and variable costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A subsidy creates a difference between the price consumers pay (lower) and the price producers receive (higher), with the government covering the difference."

        "question": "The deadweight loss from a price control represents:",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A non-binding price control is one that:",
        "options": [
          "Always creates shortages or surpluses",
          "Is set at the equilibrium price",
          "Has no effect on the market outcome",
          "Is enforced by severe penalties"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A non-binding price control is set either above the equilibrium (for ceiling) or below equilibrium (for floor), so it doesn't affect the market price or quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the government provides subsidies for college education, the likely effect is:",

          "Higher tuition prices and fewer students attending",
          "Lower effective prices and more students attending"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Education subsidies reduce the effective price for students, increasing quantity demanded while potentially allowing colleges to raise stated tuition prices."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price controls are often justified as helping low-income consumers but typically:",

          "Benefit all consumers equally",
          "Create benefits for some but costs for others",
          "Have no distributional effects",
          "Only help producers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While price controls may help some consumers who obtain the good, they create shortages that leave other consumers unable to buy it, and often reduce quality and future supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The economic efficiency argument against price controls is that they:",
        "options": [
          "Always benefit producers",
          "Prevent markets from reaching equilibrium",
          "Increase government revenue",
          "Stimulate economic growth"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price controls interfere with the market's price mechanism, preventing the efficient allocation of resources and creating shortages or surpluses."

          "Becomes steeper",
          "Becomes flatter"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A subsidy to consumers increases their purchasing power, making them willing to buy more at each price level, shifting the demand curve to the right."

          "Automatic removal of the controls"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, price controls discourage investment in maintenance, innovation, and capacity expansion, leading to quality declines and reduced future supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental economic problem with price controls is that they:",
        "options": [
          "Prevent prices from performing their rationing and signaling functions",
          "Are always set at the wrong level",
          "Benefit only wealthy consumers",
          "Increase government bureaucracy unnecessarily"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price controls interfere with the essential functions of prices: rationing scarce goods to those who value them most and signaling relative scarcity to guide production decisions."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: Price ceilings create shortages; Price floors create surpluses; Subsidies shift supply or demand curves; All create efficiency losses.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that price controls interfere with market equilibrium - ceilings create shortages, floors create surpluses, and both reduce economic efficiency."
