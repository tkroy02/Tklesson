    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The defining characteristic of a monopoly is:",
        "options": [
          "Many sellers offering similar products",
          "A single seller with no close substitutes",
          "A few large firms dominating the market",
          "Many sellers with differentiated products"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A monopoly exists when there is only one seller of a product with no close substitutes, giving the firm significant market power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopolist, the relationship between price and marginal revenue is:",
        "options": [
          "$P = MR$",
          "$P > MR$",
          "$P < MR$",
          "$P = \\frac{1}{MR}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because monopolists face downward-sloping demand curves, to sell more units they must lower price on all units, making marginal revenue less than price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist maximizes profit by producing where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = MC$",
          "$MR = MC$",
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$MR = ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Like all profit-maximizing firms, monopolists produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, but they then charge the highest price the market will bear for that quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the profit-maximizing output for a monopolist:",
        "options": [
          "$P = MC$",
          "$P > MC$",
          "$P < MC$",
          "$P = ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since $MR < P$ and the firm produces where $MR = MC$, it follows that at the optimal output, $P > MC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a barrier to entry that can create monopolies?",
        "options": [
          "Economies of scale",
          "Government licenses or patents",
          "Control of essential resources",
          "Perfect information in the market"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Perfect information is characteristic of competitive markets, not monopolies. Barriers to entry include economies of scale, legal protection, and resource control."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural monopoly exists when:",
        "options": [
          "The government grants exclusive rights",
          "One firm can supply the entire market at lower cost than multiple firms",
          "Firms collude to set prices",
          "There are no close substitutes for the product"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A natural monopoly occurs when economies of scale are so extensive that one firm can supply the entire market at a lower average cost than could multiple firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to perfect competition, a monopoly typically produces:",
        "options": [
          "More output at a lower price",
          "Less output at a higher price",
          "The same output at the same price",
          "More output at a higher price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolists restrict output and charge higher prices than would prevail under perfect competition to maximize their profits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss in monopoly results from:",
        "options": [
          "The transfer of consumer surplus to producer surplus",
          "The reduction in total economic surplus compared to perfect competition",
          "The monopolist's economic profit",
          "The fixed costs of production"
        ],
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss represents the reduction in total economic surplus (consumer + producer surplus) that occurs because the monopoly produces less than the socially optimal quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist will never operate in the:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic portion of the demand curve",
          "Inelastic portion of the demand curve",
          "Unit elastic portion of the demand curve",
          "Region where MR is positive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A profit-maximizing monopolist will always produce where demand is elastic ($|E_d| > 1$) because in the inelastic region, marginal revenue is negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between a monopolist's marginal revenue and price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "$MR = P$",
          "$MR = P(1 - \\frac{1}{|E_d|})$",
          "$MR = \\frac{P}{|E_d|}$",
          "$MR = P \\times |E_d|$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This formula shows that $MR = P$ when $|E_d| = \\infty$ (perfect competition), and $MR < P$ when demand is less than perfectly elastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist is earning economic profits in the short run, in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "New firms will enter and compete away the profits",
          "The monopolist will continue earning economic profits",
          "The government will force price reductions",
          "The monopolist will voluntarily lower prices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Due to barriers to entry, monopolists can maintain economic profits in the long run, unlike perfectly competitive firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price discrimination occurs when a firm:",
        "options": [
          "Charges different prices to different customers for the same product",
          "Charges the same price to all customers",
          "Lowers prices to drive out competitors",
          "Sets prices equal to marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price discrimination involves charging different prices to different consumers for the same product based on their willingness to pay."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For perfect price discrimination to be possible, the monopolist must:",
        "options": [
          "Have identical costs for all units",
          "Prevent resale among customers",
          "Face perfectly elastic demand",
          "Operate in the inelastic portion of demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To practice perfect price discrimination, the monopolist must be able to prevent arbitrage (resale) among customers and identify each customer's willingness to pay."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under perfect price discrimination, consumer surplus is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximized",
          "Minimized to zero",
          "Equal to producer surplus",
          "The same as under single-price monopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With perfect price discrimination, the monopolist captures all consumer surplus, charging each consumer exactly their maximum willingness to pay."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main source of inefficiency in monopoly is that:",
        "options": [
          "Firms earn economic profits",
          "$P > MC$ at the profit-maximizing output",
          "Resources are allocated inefficiently",
          "Both B and C"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The fundamental inefficiency is that $P > MC$, indicating that the value to consumers exceeds the cost of production, leading to underproduction and deadweight loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist's supply curve:",
        "options": [
          "Is the portion of MC above AVC",
          "Is the entire MC curve",
          "Does not exist",
          "Is the same as the demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Unlike perfect competition, a monopolist does not have a well-defined supply curve because there's no unique relationship between price and quantity supplied."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist faces a linear demand curve, the marginal revenue curve:",
        "options": [
          "Has the same intercept and twice the slope",
          "Has the same slope and half the intercept",
          "Is identical to the demand curve",
          "Is horizontal at the market price"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a linear demand curve $P = a - bQ$, the marginal revenue curve is $MR = a - 2bQ$ - same vertical intercept but twice the slope."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Regulation of natural monopolies often involves setting price equal to:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost",
          "Average total cost",
          "Average variable cost",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Regulators often use average cost pricing for natural monopolies, allowing them to cover all costs including normal profit but not earn economic profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Lerner Index measures:",
        "options": [
          "Total market concentration",
          "The degree of monopoly power",
          "Price elasticity of demand",
          "Economies of scale"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Lerner Index $L = \\frac{P - MC}{P}$ measures monopoly power, ranging from 0 (perfect competition) to 1 (maximum monopoly power)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to perfect competition, monopoly results in:",
        "options": [
          "Higher consumer surplus and lower producer surplus",
          "Lower consumer surplus and higher producer surplus",
          "Higher both consumer and producer surplus",
          "Lower both consumer and producer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopoly transfers some consumer surplus to producer surplus (through higher prices) and creates deadweight loss, reducing total economic surplus."

        "70": "Good work! You understand the basics but review the MR-MC rule for monopolists, barriers to entry, and the welfare implications.",
        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: why $MR < P$ for monopolists, how they maximize profit, and the comparison with perfect competition.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that monopolists are single sellers who maximize profit where $MR = MC$ but charge $P > MC$, creating deadweight loss."
