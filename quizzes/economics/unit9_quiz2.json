    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Frictional unemployment results from:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Frictional unemployment occurs naturally as people transition between jobs, enter the workforce, or re-enter after absences. It's short-term and inevitable in a dynamic economy."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Structural unemployment is caused by:",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Structural unemployment arises from fundamental economic changes like technological advancement, globalization, or industry decline that make some workers' skills obsolete."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cyclical unemployment is directly related to:",

          "Seasonal unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Some frictional unemployment is healthy as it indicates workers are seeking better job matches and the economy is dynamic. Zero frictional unemployment would suggest labor market rigidity."

        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "A minimum wage increase above equilibrium level"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "More generous unemployment benefits can lengthen job search time as workers can afford to be more selective, increasing frictional unemployment."
