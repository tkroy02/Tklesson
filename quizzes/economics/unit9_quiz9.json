      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The original Phillips Curve showed an inverse relationship between:",
        "options": [
          "Inflation and interest rates",
          "Inflation and unemployment",
          "Money supply and prices",
          "Government spending and taxes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A.W. Phillips' original 1958 study found an inverse relationship between wage inflation and unemployment in the UK - lower unemployment was associated with higher wage growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run Phillips Curve suggests that policymakers can:",
        "options": [
          "Permanently reduce unemployment by accepting higher inflation",
          "Achieve both low inflation and low unemployment simultaneously",
          "Trade off higher inflation for lower unemployment temporarily",
          "Ignore the relationship between inflation and unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The short-run Phillips Curve suggests a temporary trade-off where expansionary policies can reduce unemployment by accepting higher inflation, but only until expectations adjust."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The natural rate hypothesis states that in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "The Phillips Curve is downward sloping",
          "There is a permanent trade-off between inflation and unemployment",
          "The Phillips Curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment",
          "Unemployment can be zero with sufficient inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The natural rate hypothesis, developed by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, states that the long-run Phillips Curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment - there's no permanent inflation-unemployment trade-off."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The expectations-augmented Phillips Curve includes:",
        "options": [
          "Only actual inflation",
          "Actual inflation and expected inflation",
          "Only unemployment rates",
          "Government policy variables only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The expectations-augmented Phillips Curve shows that inflation depends on both expected inflation and the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate: π = πᵉ - β(u - uⁿ)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Adaptive expectations in the Phillips Curve model mean that people:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly predict future inflation",
          "Base expectations solely on recent inflation experience",
          "Never change their inflation expectations",
          "Use complex economic models to forecast inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With adaptive expectations, people form expectations based on recent past inflation, gradually adjusting their expectations as new data becomes available."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The sacrifice ratio measures:",
        "options": [
          "The percentage point increase in inflation needed to reduce unemployment by 1%",
          "The percentage point increase in unemployment needed to reduce inflation by 1%",
          "The trade-off between government spending and taxes",
          "The cost of unemployment benefits as a percentage of GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The sacrifice ratio measures the cumulative percentage point-years of excess unemployment needed to reduce inflation by 1 percentage point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the 1970s stagflation period, the Phillips Curve relationship:",
        "options": [
          "Became stronger and more predictable",
          "Broke down as both inflation and unemployment rose",
          "Proved the permanent trade-off theory correct",
          "Showed that unemployment could be zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The 1970s stagflation (high inflation and high unemployment simultaneously) contradicted the original Phillips Curve and supported the natural rate hypothesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Rational expectations theory suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "People make systematic forecasting errors",
          "People use all available information efficiently",
          "Expectations adjust very slowly to new information",
          "Only economists can form accurate expectations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rational expectations theory assumes people use all available information efficiently and don't make systematic errors in forecasting, making anticipated policy changes ineffective."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is:",
        "options": [
          "The unemployment rate when inflation is zero",
          "The unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation",
          "The minimum possible unemployment rate",
          "The average unemployment rate over a business cycle"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "NAIRU is the unemployment rate at which inflation does not accelerate - it's essentially equivalent to the natural rate of unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the public has rational expectations and policy is anticipated, attempts to reduce unemployment below the natural rate will:",
        "options": [
          "Succeed permanently",
          "Cause immediate inflation without reducing unemployment",
          "Have no effect on inflation",
          "Reduce both inflation and unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With rational expectations and anticipated policy, workers and firms immediately adjust prices and wages, causing inflation to rise without any temporary reduction in unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long-run Phillips Curve is vertical because:",
        "options": [
          "Inflation always equals expected inflation in the long run",
          "Unemployment is always constant in the long run",
          "The natural rate of unemployment changes with inflation",
          "Government policy can permanently control unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the long run, actual inflation equals expected inflation (π = πᵉ), so the Phillips Curve equation becomes u = uⁿ regardless of the inflation rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which policy would cause movement along the short-run Phillips Curve?",
        "options": [
          "A permanent increase in the natural rate of unemployment",
          "An unexpected expansionary monetary policy",
          "A change in inflation expectations",
          "Structural reforms to labor markets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unexpected expansionary policy causes movement along the short-run Phillips Curve, temporarily reducing unemployment while increasing inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A supply shock (like an oil price increase) would cause:",
        "options": [
          "Movement along the Phillips Curve",
          "A shift of the Phillips Curve",
          "No change in the Phillips Curve relationship",
          "The Phillips Curve to become horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Supply shocks shift the Phillips Curve outward, worsening the trade-off by increasing both inflation and unemployment at any given point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The credibility of central bank policy affects the Phillips Curve because:",
        "options": [
          "It doesn't influence inflation expectations",
          "Credible anti-inflation policy reduces the sacrifice ratio",
          "Only actual policy actions matter, not credibility",
          "Credibility makes the long-run curve horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a central bank has high credibility, inflation expectations adjust quickly, reducing the unemployment cost (sacrifice ratio) of disinflation policies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'accelerationist hypothesis' suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "Inflation accelerates automatically over time",
          "Keeping unemployment below the natural rate requires accelerating inflation",
          "Unemployment accelerates when inflation is high",
          "Economic growth accelerates with moderate inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The accelerationist hypothesis states that maintaining unemployment below the natural rate requires continually increasing inflation (accelerating inflation) to stay ahead of rising expectations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor could cause the long-run Phillips Curve to shift?",
        "options": [
          "Temporary demand shocks",
          "Changes in the natural rate of unemployment",
          "Short-term monetary policy changes",
          "Cyclical fluctuations in unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The long-run Phillips Curve shifts when the natural rate of unemployment changes due to demographic shifts, labor market institutions, or structural factors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the new Keynesian Phillips Curve, inflation depends on:",
        "options": [
          "Only past inflation",
          "Expected future inflation and real marginal costs",
          "Only current unemployment rates",
          "Government budget deficits"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The new Keynesian Phillips Curve derives from microfoundations and shows inflation depends on expected future inflation and the output gap (related to real marginal costs)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Lucas critique' argues that:",
        "options": [
          "Phillips Curve relationships are stable over time",
          "Economic relationships change when policies change",
          "Inflation and unemployment are unrelated",
          "Only adaptive expectations matter for policy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Lucas critique states that estimated economic relationships (like the Phillips Curve) may change when policy regimes change because people adjust their behavior based on expectations of policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During disinflation, the short-run Phillips Curve:",
        "options": [
          "Shifts inward immediately",
          "Shifts outward temporarily",
          "Becomes horizontal",
          "Doesn't change position"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "During disinflation, the short-run Phillips Curve shifts outward temporarily as the economy experiences higher unemployment while inflation expectations adjust downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The modern view of the Phillips Curve emphasizes that:",
        "options": [
          "There is a permanent inflation-unemployment trade-off",
          "The trade-off exists only in the short run with sticky prices",
          "Inflation and unemployment are completely independent",
          "Only supply factors determine both inflation and unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Modern macroeconomics, incorporating price stickiness and expectations, recognizes a short-run trade-off due to nominal rigidities, but no long-run trade-off."
