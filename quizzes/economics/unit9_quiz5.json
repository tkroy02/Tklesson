        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inflation Rate = [(Current Price Level - Previous Price Level) / Previous Price Level] × 100%. This measures the percentage increase in prices over time."
      },

          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The GDP deflator differs from the CPI because it:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The quantity theory (MV = PY) states that inflation results when money supply growth exceeds real output growth, making it fundamentally a monetary phenomenon."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Most central banks target 2-3% inflation as it provides a buffer against deflation, allows for relative price adjustments, and supports economic growth while remaining predictable."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: the definition of inflation, how to calculate inflation rates, and the differences between various price indices.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember that inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level, measured by indices like CPI and PPI, with different causes and economic effects."
