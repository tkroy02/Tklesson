    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental rule for profit maximization for any firm is to produce where:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue is maximized",
          "Marginal revenue equals marginal cost",
          "Average cost is minimized",
          "Price equals average variable cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "All profit-maximizing firms, regardless of market structure, should produce where $MR = MC$. This ensures that the last unit produced adds as much to revenue as it does to cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is producing where $MR > MC$, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production to increase profit",
          "Decrease production to increase profit",
          "Shut down immediately",
          "Keep production unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $MR > MC$, producing an additional unit adds more to revenue than to cost, so increasing production will increase total profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is producing where $MR < MC$, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production",
          "Decrease production to increase profit",
          "Shut down immediately",
          "Keep production unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When $MR < MC$, the last unit produced cost more than it brought in revenue, so decreasing production will increase total profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfectly competitive firm, the profit-maximizing condition $MR = MC$ is equivalent to:",
        "options": [
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$P = AVC$",
          "$TR = TC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, $MR = P$ because firms are price takers. Therefore, $MR = MC$ simplifies to $P = MC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm should continue operating in the short run as long as:",
        "options": [
          "Price is greater than average total cost",
          "Price is greater than average variable cost",
          "Total revenue is greater than total cost",
          "Marginal revenue is positive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the short run, a firm should operate if $P > AVC$, because it can cover variable costs and contribute something toward fixed costs, which are sunk."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The shutdown point occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$P = AVC$ at the minimum of AVC",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$MR = MC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The shutdown point is where $P = min(AVC)$. Below this price, the firm cannot cover its variable costs and should shut down to minimize losses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic profit is maximized when:",
        "options": [
          "The difference between total revenue and total cost is greatest",
          "Marginal revenue is maximized",
          "Average cost is minimized",
          "Price is highest"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Economic profit = $TR - TC$. This difference is maximized at the output where $MR = MC$, which is the profit-maximizing level of production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is earning zero economic profit, it means:",
        "options": [
          "The firm should shut down",
          "The firm is earning normal profit",
          "The firm is incurring losses",
          "The firm is not covering variable costs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Zero economic profit means the firm is earning exactly normal profit - enough to cover all costs including the opportunity cost of resources employed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopoly, at the profit-maximizing output:",
        "options": [
          "$P = MC$",
          "$P > MC$",
          "$P < MC$",
          "$P = ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolists produce where $MR = MC$, but since they face downward-sloping demand curves, $MR < P$, so at the profit-maximizing output, $P > MC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The break-even point for a firm occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = AVC$",
          "$P = ATC$",
          "$P = MC$",
          "$MR = MC$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The break-even point is where economic profit is zero, which occurs when $P = ATC$ (or $TR = TC$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When marginal cost is rising and equals marginal revenue:",
        "options": [
          "Profit is necessarily positive",
          "Profit is maximized or loss is minimized",
          "The firm should always shut down",
          "Average cost is minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The $MR = MC$ rule identifies the output level that either maximizes profit (if $P > ATC$) or minimizes loss (if $P < ATC$ but $P > AVC$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm should never produce where:",
        "options": [
          "$MR = MC$",
          "$P < AVC$",
          "$P < ATC$",
          "Economic profit is zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $P < AVC$, the firm cannot cover its variable costs and should shut down immediately to minimize losses (fixed costs are sunk in the short run)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, a perfectly competitive firm will produce where:",
        "options": [
          "$P = MC = ATC$",
          "$P = MC > ATC$",
          "$P = MC < ATC$",
          "$P > MC = ATC$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, $P = MC$ (profit maximization) and $P = ATC$ (zero economic profit), so $P = MC = ATC$ at the minimum of ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm's total revenue exceeds its total variable cost but is less than its total cost, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Shut down immediately",
          "Continue operating in the short run",
          "Expand production",
          "Increase price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $TR > TVC$ but $TR < TC$, the firm is incurring losses but can cover variable costs and contribute to fixed costs, so it should continue operating in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The profit-maximizing rule $MR = MC$ applies:",
        "options": [
          "Only to perfectly competitive firms",
          "Only to monopolies",
          "To all profit-maximizing firms",
          "Only in the long run"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The $MR = MC$ rule is universal and applies to all profit-maximizing firms regardless of market structure or time period."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a firm is maximizing profit, the slope of the total revenue curve equals:",
        "options": [
          "The slope of the total cost curve",
          "The slope of the average cost curve",
          "Zero",
          "The slope of the demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The slope of TR is MR, the slope of TC is MC. When $MR = MC$, the slopes are equal, and the vertical distance between TR and TC (profit) is maximized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm will earn economic profits when:",

          "$P > ATC$ at the profit-maximizing output",
          "$P = ATC$ at the profit-maximizing output",
          "$P < ATC$ at the profit-maximizing output",
          "$MR > MC$ at the profit-maximizing output"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Economic profit exists when total revenue exceeds total cost, which occurs when $P > ATC$ at the output where $MR = MC$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between marginal revenue and price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "$MR = P$ when demand is elastic",
          "$MR = P(1 - \\frac{1}{|E_d|})$",
          "$MR = P$ when demand is inelastic",
          "$MR = \\frac{P}{|E_d|}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The formula $MR = P(1 - \\frac{1}{|E_d|})$ shows that marginal revenue is positive when demand is elastic ($|E_d| > 1$), zero when demand is unit elastic ($|E_d| = 1$), and negative when demand is inelastic ($|E_d| < 1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm should never operate where marginal revenue is negative because:",
        "options": [
          "It would always lose money",
          "Total revenue would be decreasing",
          "Marginal cost would be negative",
          "Price would be too high"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When $MR < 0$, producing additional units decreases total revenue. A profit-maximizing firm would reduce output to where $MR \\geq 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key insight of marginal analysis is that optimal decisions are made by:",

          "Comparing total benefits and total costs",
          "Comparing average benefits and average costs",
          "Comparing additional benefits and additional costs",
          "Maximizing total revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Marginal analysis focuses on the additional (marginal) benefits and additional (marginal) costs of decisions. The $MR = MC$ rule is a prime example of marginal analysis."
