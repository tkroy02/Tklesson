        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "A tax on gasoline has a greater deadweight loss in the short run than in the long run and a tax on alcohol generates a smaller deadweight loss than a tax on luxury watches.",
          "A tax on gasoline has a greater deadweight loss in the long run than in the short run and a tax on alcohol generates a larger deadweight loss than a tax on luxury watches."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gasoline demand is more elastic in the long run → larger DWL. Alcohol demand is more inelastic than luxury watches → smaller DWL for alcohol tax."
