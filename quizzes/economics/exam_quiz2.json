        "question": "Let a firm employs 5 labourers and produces 120 units of output. When 6 labourers are employed the firm produces 136 units of output. Then the marginal product is ---",
        "options": ["120", "136", "6", "16"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Marginal Product (MP) = ΔTotal Product / ΔLabour = (136 - 120) / (6 - 5) = 16."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm produces 200 units of commodity X by employing 10 workers and 240 units of the same commodity by employing 12 workers. Then the Average Product of the worker is ---",
        "options": ["200", "240", "20", "40"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average Product (AP) = Total Product / Number of Workers = 240 / 12 = 20."

        "options": ["Increase", "Decrease", "Variation", "None of the above"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the law of demand, quantity demanded increases when price decreases, ceteris paribus."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When total utility is maximum, marginal utility is:",
        "options": ["Maximum", "One", "Zero", "Infinite"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When total utility is at its maximum, marginal utility (the additional utility from consuming one more unit) is zero."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For complementary goods, the cross elasticity of demand:",
        "options": ["Positive", "Negative", "Zero", "None"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Complementary goods have negative cross elasticity because an increase in price of one leads to a decrease in demand for the other."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Relation between price of a commodity and demand for another commodity is measured by:",
        "options": ["Price elasticity", "Income elasticity", "Cross elasticity", "Elasticity of substitution"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cross elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in price of another good."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When TU falls, MU is:",
        "options": ["Rises", "Zero", "Positive", "Negative"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When total utility (TU) falls, marginal utility (MU) is negative, meaning additional consumption reduces overall satisfaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When Q = f (P), the elasticity coefficient is measured by:",
        "options": ["ΔQ / ΔP / P / Q", "ΔP / ΔQ * Q / P", "ΔQ / ΔP * P / Q", "ΔP / ΔQ / Q / P"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Price elasticity of demand = (ΔQ/ΔP) × (P/Q), where Q is quantity and P is price."

        "options": ["Negative", "Positive", "Zero", "Unity"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For inferior goods, demand decreases as income increases, resulting in a negative income elasticity."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods have income elasticity greater than 1, meaning demand increases more than proportionally to income."
