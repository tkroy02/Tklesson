    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary determinant of labor supply?",
        "options": [
          "The wage rate",
          "Population size and demographics",
          "Non-labor income",
          "Worker productivity"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Worker productivity affects labor demand (MRP), not labor supply. The wage rate causes movement along the supply curve, while the other factors shift the curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in population would cause the labor supply curve to:",

          "Become steeper",
          "Become backward-bending"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More people in the population generally means more potential workers, increasing labor supply at each wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Higher non-labor income (such as investment returns) typically causes:",
        "options": [
          "Increased labor supply",
          "Decreased labor supply",
          "No change in labor supply",
          "More inelastic labor supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With higher non-labor income, people can maintain their standard of living with less work, reducing labor supply (income effect)."
      },

          "Have no effect on labor supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As more people reach retirement age, the labor force participation rate declines, reducing aggregate labor supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Immigration typically affects labor supply by:",

          "Affecting only labor demand",
          "Having no economic impact"

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Labor force participation rate = (Labor Force ÷ Working-Age Population) × 100%, indicating the proportion of people actively engaged in the labor market."

          "Have ambiguous effects"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If work becomes more enjoyable or less strenuous, the disutility of work decreases, making people willing to supply more labor at given wage rates."
