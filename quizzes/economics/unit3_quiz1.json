    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of demand states that, all other factors being equal:",
        "options": [
          "As price increases, quantity demanded increases",
          "As price increases, quantity demanded decreases",
          "Price and quantity demanded have no relationship",
          "Demand remains constant regardless of price changes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The law of demand describes the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded - when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded falls, and vice versa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A demand curve typically slopes downward because:",
        "options": [
          "Producers are willing to sell more at higher prices",
          "Higher prices reduce consumers' purchasing power and willingness to buy",
          "Government regulations require downward-sloping curves",
          "Supply curves always slope upward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The downward slope reflects both the substitution effect (consumers switch to alternatives as price rises) and income effect (higher prices reduce real purchasing power)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause a movement along the demand curve for coffee?",
        "options": [
          "A change in consumer income",
          "A change in the price of coffee",
          "A change in the price of tea (a substitute)",
          "A change in consumer preferences"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A change in the good's own price causes movement along the demand curve. Changes in other factors (income, prices of related goods, tastes) shift the entire demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of smartphones decreases from $800 to $600, what happens to quantity demanded?",
        "options": [
          "Quantity demanded decreases",
          "Quantity demanded increases",
          "Demand decreases",
          "Demand increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the law of demand, a price decrease leads to an increase in quantity demanded. This is movement along the demand curve, not a shift of the demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The substitution effect occurs when:",
        "options": [

          "Consumers switch to alternatives when a good's price rises",
          "Producers substitute cheaper inputs when costs rise",
          "Government substitutes one tax for another"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The substitution effect describes how consumers replace more expensive goods with cheaper alternatives when prices change, contributing to the law of demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The income effect refers to how:",
        "options": [

          "Income changes affect demand for normal goods",
          "Producers' incomes affect supply decisions",
          "National income affects economic growth"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The income effect describes how price changes alter consumers' real income (purchasing power), affecting their ability to buy goods and contributing to the law of demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumers expect prices to rise significantly in the future, current demand will:",

          "Increase demand",
          "Decrease demand",
          "Not affect demand",
          "Make the demand curve steeper"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Normal goods are those for which demand increases when income rises. The demand curve shifts to the right."
      },

          "No relationship with income"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inferior goods are those for which demand decreases when income rises, as consumers switch to higher-quality alternatives."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Changes in income, tastes, prices of related goods, expectations, or number of buyers shift the entire demand curve. Changes in the good's own price cause movement along the curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the number of buyers in a market increases, the market demand curve will:",

          "Shift to the right",
          "Become steeper",
          "Become flatter"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More buyers means more potential purchases at each price, increasing overall demand and shifting the demand curve to the right."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of 'diminishing marginal utility' helps explain the law of demand because:",
        "options": [
          "It shows why consumers buy more at lower prices",
          "It demonstrates why supply curves slope upward",
          "It explains producer pricing decisions",
          "It relates to production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal utility means each additional unit provides less satisfaction, so consumers are only willing to buy more units at lower prices, contributing to the downward-sloping demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of movie tickets increases from $12 to $15, and quantity demanded decreases from 1,000 to 800 tickets, this demonstrates:",
