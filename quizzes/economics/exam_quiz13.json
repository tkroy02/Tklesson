        "question": "Which of the following is Microeconomics concerned with?",
        "options": [
          "The size of national output",
          "The level of employment",
          "Changes in general level of prices",
          "Raising the price of Hortons’ coffee"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Microeconomics studies individual markets and decisions, such as pricing for a specific firm's product (e.g., Horton’s coffee)."

        "question": "Other things being equal, if a good has more substitutes, its price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": ["Larger", "Smaller", "Zero", "Unity"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More substitutes mean consumers can easily switch if price rises, making demand more elastic (larger elasticity in absolute value)."

          "Rectangular hyperbola"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "AFC = TFC / Q. Since total fixed cost is constant, AFC continually declines as output rises, forming a rectangular hyperbola (area under curve = TFC)."
