        "question": "Cross price elasticity of demand (XED) measures:",
        "options": [
          "How quantity demanded responds to price changes of the same good",
          "How quantity demanded responds to price changes of a related good",
          "How quantity demanded responds to income changes",
          "How supply responds to price changes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross price elasticity measures the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good divided by the percentage change in price of another related good."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The formula for cross price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "% change in quantity of good A / % change in price of good A",
          "% change in quantity of good A / % change in price of good B",

          "% change in quantity of good A / % change in income"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "XED = (% change in quantity demanded of good A) / (% change in price of good B)"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If XED is positive, the two goods are:",
        "options": [
          "Complements",
          "Substitutes",
          "Unrelated",
          "Inferior goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Positive XED indicates substitute goods - when the price of one increases, demand for the other increases as consumers switch to the alternative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If XED is negative, the two goods are:",

          "Luxury goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Negative XED indicates complementary goods - when the price of one increases, demand for both decreases because they are consumed together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of coffee increases by 10% and demand for tea increases by 15%, the XED between tea and coffee is:",

          "0.67"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "XED = (% change in quantity of tea) / (% change in price of coffee) = 15% / 10% = 1.5. Positive value confirms they are substitutes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If XED = 0, the two goods are:",

          "Unrelated",
          "Always consumed together"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Zero XED indicates unrelated goods - changes in the price of one good have no effect on demand for the other."

          "Production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The absolute value of XED shows the strength of the relationship - higher values indicate stronger substitute or complement relationships."
      },

          "Bus travel and train travel"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Hot dogs and hot dog buns are complements - when the price of one increases, demand for both decreases because they are consumed together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If XED between two goods is +0.8, they are:",
        "options": [
          "Weak substitutes",
          "Strong substitutes",
          "Weak complements",
          "Strong complements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Positive XED of 0.8 indicates substitute goods, but the relatively low value suggests they are weak substitutes rather than perfect substitutes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Businesses use cross price elasticity information to:",
        "options": [
          "Set prices independently of competitors",

          "-1.67",
          "1.67"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "XED = (% change in quantity of popcorn) / (% change in price of tickets) = 9% / (-15%) = -0.6. Negative value confirms they are complements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Perfect substitutes would have XED approaching:",
        "options": [

          "Zero",
          "Positive infinity",
          "One"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfect substitutes have very high positive XED - consumers completely switch from one to the other when relative prices change."

          "Decreases",
          "Remains unchanged",
          "Becomes more elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For complements, price increase in one good reduces demand for both goods because they are consumed together."
      },

          "Strongly positive",
          "Zero",
          "Always exactly 1"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Different brands of the same product are close substitutes, so they have strongly positive cross price elasticity."
      },

          "Strong complements"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Negative XED of -2.5 indicates strong complements - the goods are highly dependent on each other in consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When analyzing market competition, businesses look for products with:",

          "High positive XED with their product",
          "High negative XED with their product",
          "Zero XED with their product",
          "Negative income elasticity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High positive XED identifies close competitors - products that consumers view as substitutes for the business's product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of electric cars decreases and demand for gasoline decreases, the XED between gasoline and electric cars is:",

          "Negative (complements)",
          "Zero (unrelated)",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electric cars and gasoline cars are substitutes. When electric car prices fall, consumers switch from gasoline cars, reducing gasoline demand - positive XED."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main value of cross price elasticity analysis is that it:",

          "Shows how goods are interrelated in consumer decision-making",
          "Determines absolute price levels",
          "Measures production efficiency",
          "Calculates consumer income"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "XED reveals how products are connected in consumers' minds - whether they view them as substitutes, complements, or unrelated - which is crucial for strategic planning."
