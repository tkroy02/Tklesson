      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A binding minimum wage is one that is set:",
        "options": [
          "Below the equilibrium wage",
          "At the equilibrium wage",
          "Above the equilibrium wage",
          "At any level the government chooses"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A minimum wage is binding (has actual effects) only when set above the market-clearing equilibrium wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a competitive labor market, a binding minimum wage typically causes:",
        "options": [
          "Increased employment",
          "Decreased employment",
          "No change in employment",
          "Higher wages for all workers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In competitive markets, a binding minimum wage reduces employment because it raises the cost of labor above some workers' marginal revenue product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main argument FOR minimum wages is that they:",
        "options": [
          "Increase employment for low-skilled workers",
          "Reduce poverty by raising incomes for low-wage workers",
          "Automatically increase all workers' productivity",
          "Eliminate the need for other social programs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Proponents argue minimum wages help reduce poverty by ensuring workers earn a living wage, particularly benefiting low-income households."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main argument AGAINST minimum wages is that they:",
        "options": [
          "Reduce employment opportunities for low-skilled workers",
          "Are always too low to help workers",
          "Have no economic effects",
          "Only benefit employers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Opponents argue that by raising labor costs, minimum wages reduce employment, particularly for youth, minorities, and low-skilled workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopsony labor markets, a carefully set minimum wage can:",
        "options": [
          "Only reduce employment",
          "Increase both wages and employment",
          "Have no effect on the market",
          "Only benefit the employer"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In monopsony, a minimum wage set at the competitive level can force the employer to pay higher wages while also increasing employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'ripple effect' of minimum wages refers to:",

          "Increased international trade"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ripple effect occurs when employers raise wages for workers earning just above the new minimum to maintain wage differentials and morale."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Recent empirical research on minimum wage effects suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "Employment effects are always large and negative",
          "Employment effects are often small or negligible",
          "Minimum wages always increase employment",
          "There is no reliable evidence either way"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Many recent studies, particularly Card and Krueger's work, find small or statistically insignificant employment effects from moderate minimum wage increases."

          "Moving operations overseas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher minimum wages may encourage employers to substitute capital (automation) for low-skilled labor or hire fewer but more skilled workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'scale effect' of minimum wages refers to:",

          "Government scaling back regulations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The scale effect occurs when higher labor costs lead to higher prices, reduced consumer demand, and consequently lower output and employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'living wage' is typically defined as:",
        "options": [

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit) is often proposed as an alternative to minimum wages because it:",
        "options": [
          "Directly raises wages for all workers",
          "Subsidizes low-income workers without affecting employment",
          "Is paid for by employers rather than taxpayers",
          "Only benefits high-income workers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The EITC supplements wages through the tax system without raising employers' labor costs, potentially avoiding negative employment effects."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Teenage unemployment rates tend to be more sensitive to minimum wage increases because:",

          "Teenagers often have lower skills and less experience",
          "Teenagers work in protected industries",
          "Teenagers are not affected by minimum wages"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Teenagers typically have lower skills and less work experience, making their marginal revenue product more likely to fall below higher minimum wages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'efficiency wage' argument suggests that higher minimum wages might:",
        "options": [
          "Reduce worker effort and increase turnover",
          "Increase worker productivity through better motivation",
          "Have no effect on worker behavior",
          "Only affect worker health insurance"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher wages could increase productivity by improving worker morale, reducing turnover, and attracting better applicants, potentially offsetting higher labor costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "International comparisons show that countries with higher minimum wages typically have:",
        "options": [
          "Identical employment rates to low-minimum wage countries",
          "Systematically higher unemployment rates",
          "More variation in outcomes based on other labor market institutions",
          "No relationship with poverty rates"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The effects of minimum wages depend on other factors like union density, social benefits, and labor market flexibility, making cross-country comparisons complex."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'search and matching' model suggests minimum wages might:",
        "options": [
          "Improve job matching quality",
          "Make job search completely unnecessary",
          "Have no effect on labor market efficiency",
          "Only benefit employers in hiring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher wages might improve job matching by making workers more selective and reducing turnover, though they may also increase search duration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The compliance cost of minimum wages refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The cost to employers of following the law",
          "The savings to employers from lower wages",

          "Reduce corporate profits",
          "Affect international competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Target efficiency measures what proportion of minimum wage benefits go to low-income households rather than secondary earners in middle-class families."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, minimum wages might have different effects because:",

          "Employers cannot adjust their production methods",
          "Employers can substitute capital and change business models",
          "Worker skills remain completely unchanged",
          "Consumer demand is fixed"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
