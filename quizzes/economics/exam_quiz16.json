      {

        "question": "The cost of one thing in terms of the alternative given up is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Production cost",
          "Physical cost",
          "Money cost",
          "Opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the value of the next‑best alternative forgone when making a decision."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When equilibrium price rises but equilibrium quantity remains unchanged, the cause is:",
        "options": [
          "Supply and demand both increase equally",
          "Supply and demand both decrease equally",
          "Supply decreases and demand increases",
          "Supply increases and demand decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A decrease in supply (left shift) raises price, while an increase in demand (right shift) also raises price—if they shift so that quantity stays the same, price increases with unchanged quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is unitary elastic, a 25% increase in price will result in:",
        "options": [
          "25% change in total revenue",
          "No change in quantity demanded",
          "1% decrease in quantity demanded",
          "25% decrease in quantity demanded"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "With unitary elasticity (Ed = −1), the percentage change in quantity demanded equals the percentage change in price in opposite direction, so a 25% price increase causes a 25% decrease in quantity demanded."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Contraction of demand is the result of:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease in the number of consumers",
          "Increase in the price of the commodity concerned",
          "Increase in the prices of other goods",
          "Decrease in the income of purchasers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Contraction of demand refers to a reduction in quantity demanded due to a rise in the good’s own price (movement along the demand curve)."
