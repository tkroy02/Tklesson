      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of diminishing marginal returns states that:",
        "options": [
          "As more of a variable input is added to fixed inputs, marginal product will eventually decrease",
          "Total output always decreases when more inputs are used",
          "Average product always decreases from the first unit",
          "Marginal product increases indefinitely with more inputs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The law states that as successive units of a variable input are added to fixed inputs, beyond some point the marginal product of the variable input will decline."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Diminishing marginal returns occurs in the:",
        "options": [
          "Long run only",
          "Short run only",
          "Both short run and long run",
          "Very long run only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns is specifically a short-run phenomenon that occurs when variable inputs are added to fixed inputs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The point where diminishing marginal returns begins is where:",
        "options": [
          "Total product starts decreasing",
          "Marginal product starts decreasing",
          "Average product starts decreasing",
          "Total product reaches its maximum"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns begins at the point where marginal product reaches its maximum and starts to decline."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Initially, marginal product may increase due to:",
        "options": [
          "Specialization and division of labor",
          "The law of diminishing returns",
          "Decreasing returns to scale",
          "Fixed input constraints"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initially, adding variable inputs to fixed inputs can lead to increasing marginal returns due to better utilization of fixed inputs and specialization benefits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the 5th worker adds 10 units of output and the 6th worker adds 8 units, the marginal product of the 6th worker is:",

          "Increasing",
          "Decreasing",
          "Constant",
          "Negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The marginal product decreased from 10 to 8 units, indicating diminishing marginal returns has set in."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When marginal product is negative:",
        "options": [
          "Total product is increasing",
          "Total product is decreasing",
          "Average product is increasing",
          "The firm is making losses"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When marginal product is negative, each additional unit of input actually reduces total output, so total product is decreasing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main cause of diminishing marginal returns is:",
        "options": [
          "Poor worker quality",
          "The fixed constraint on other inputs",
          "High input prices",
          "Government regulations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing returns occurs because fixed inputs eventually become overcrowded or overutilized as more variable inputs are added."
      },

          "MP < AP and MP < 0",
          "MP = AP and MP = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Stage I, marginal product is greater than average product and both are positive, meaning average product is increasing."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Stage III of production:",
        "options": [

          "MP is positive but decreasing",
          "MP is negative",
          "MP equals AP"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stage III is characterized by negative marginal product - adding more variable inputs actually reduces total output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rational producer will never operate in Stage III because:",

          "Adding more inputs reduces total output",
          "Prices are too low",
          "Competition is too intense"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Stage III, marginal product is negative, meaning the firm could produce more output by using fewer inputs - this is economically irrational."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When MP = AP:",
        "options": [
          "AP is at its minimum",
          "AP is at its maximum",
          "MP is at its maximum",
          "TP is at its maximum"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When marginal product equals average product, average product is at its maximum point."
      },

          "Decreasing",
          "Increasing",
          "Constant",
          "Negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When total product increases at an increasing rate, the additional output from each new unit (marginal product) must be increasing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of diminishing returns explains why short-run marginal cost curves are:",
        "options": [
          "U-shaped",
          "Always downward sloping",
          "Always horizontal",
          "Always vertical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns causes marginal cost to eventually increase, creating the upward-sloping portion of the U-shaped marginal cost curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario best illustrates diminishing marginal returns?",
        "options": [
          "A factory doubles all inputs and output more than doubles",
          "A restaurant adds more cooks to a fixed kitchen size and each additional cook adds less additional output",
          "A farm expands by buying adjacent land and increases production proportionally",
          "A company invests in new technology that makes workers more productive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This shows variable inputs (cooks) being added to fixed inputs (kitchen size), with each additional cook contributing less additional output - classic diminishing returns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a factory is experiencing diminishing marginal returns, hiring one more worker will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase output by more than the previous worker did",
          "Increase output by less than the previous worker did",
          "Decrease total output",
          "Have no effect on output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Under diminishing marginal returns, each additional worker adds less to total output than the previous worker did."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The point of diminishing returns is reached when:",
        "options": [

          "Fixed costs begin to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The law of diminishing marginal returns begins exactly when marginal product starts to decline from its peak."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In agricultural production, diminishing returns might occur because:",
        "options": [
          "Farmers become less skilled over time",
          "Additional workers on fixed land have less space and resources to work with",
          "Weather patterns become less favorable",
          "Crop prices decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "On fixed land, additional workers eventually have less space, tools, and resources per worker, leading to diminishing marginal returns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm should stop increasing its variable input when:",

          "The value of marginal product equals the input price"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The profit-maximizing rule is to hire inputs until the value of marginal product (MP × output price) equals the input price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between marginal product and average product is such that:",
        "options": [
          "MP always exceeds AP",
          "AP always exceeds MP",
          "When MP exceeds AP, AP is rising",
          "When MP exceeds AP, AP is falling"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When marginal product is above average product, it pulls the average up, so average product is increasing. When MP is below AP, AP is decreasing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental economic significance of diminishing marginal returns is that it:",
        "options": [
          "Explains why resources are scarce",
          "Creates the upward-sloping portion of cost curves",
          "Causes all production to eventually stop",
          "Makes technology improvements unnecessary"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns is the fundamental reason why marginal cost eventually increases in the short run, creating upward-sloping supply curves and explaining many cost patterns."
