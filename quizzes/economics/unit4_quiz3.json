    "subject": "Economics",
    "topic": "Factors Influencing Price Elasticity, Substitutability, Necessity, Time Horizon",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor is the most important determinant of price elasticity of demand?",
        "options": [
          "Availability of close substitutes",
          "Consumer income levels",
          "Production costs",
          "Government regulations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The availability of close substitutes is the primary determinant of PED. When many substitutes exist, demand becomes more elastic as consumers can easily switch to alternatives."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Demand for necessities tends to be:",
        "options": [
          "Highly elastic",
          "Highly inelastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Necessities have inelastic demand because consumers continue buying them even when prices rise, as they are essential for daily life."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As the proportion of income spent on a good increases, demand becomes:",
        "options": [
          "More elastic",
          "More inelastic",
          "Unchanged",
          "Perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a good takes up a larger portion of the budget, consumers are more price-sensitive because price changes have a significant impact on their overall purchasing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Demand becomes more elastic over longer time periods because:",
        "options": [
          "Prices always decrease over time",
          "Consumers have more time to find substitutes and adjust behavior",
          "Incomes automatically increase over time",
          "Technology always improves"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Given more time, consumers can research alternatives, change habits, or adjust their consumption patterns, making demand more responsive to price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which product would likely have the most inelastic demand?",

          "Restaurant meals"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Table salt has highly inelastic demand because it's a necessity, has few substitutes, and represents a tiny fraction of most consumers' budgets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Luxury goods typically have:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic demand",
          "Inelastic demand",
          "Unit elastic demand",
          "Perfectly inelastic demand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods have elastic demand because they are not essential, and consumers can easily postpone or forego purchases when prices rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for a specific brand of gasoline is more elastic than the demand for gasoline in general because:",
        "options": [
          "Brand loyalty doesn't exist",
          "There are many close substitutes (other brands)",
          "Gasoline is a luxury good",
          "All gasoline is identical"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While gasoline overall has inelastic demand, specific brands face elastic demand because consumers can easily switch to competing stations offering similar products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor would make demand for a product more inelastic?",
        "options": [
          "The product has many close substitutes",
          "The product is a small part of the consumer's budget",
          "Consumers have ample time to adjust",
          "The product is considered a luxury"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a product represents a small portion of the budget, consumers are less price-sensitive, making demand more inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Addictive goods like cigarettes often have inelastic demand because:",

          "They are always cheap",
          "Government regulates their prices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Addiction reduces price sensitivity because consumers have strong habitual consumption patterns and find it difficult to reduce consumption even when prices rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for emergency medical services is highly inelastic because:",

          "It's a necessity with no close substitutes in emergencies",
          "Prices are always low"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In emergency situations, medical services become necessities with no viable substitutes, making demand extremely inelastic regardless of price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a product becomes more narrowly defined, its demand becomes:",
        "options": [
          "More elastic",
          "More inelastic",
          "Unchanged",
          "Perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Narrowly defined products (specific brands) have more elastic demand because there are more close substitutes available compared to broadly defined product categories."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about time and elasticity is correct?",
        "options": [
          "Demand is always more elastic in the short run",
          "Demand is always more elastic in the long run",
          "Time has no effect on elasticity",
          "Elasticity is constant over time"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Demand becomes more elastic over longer time periods as consumers have more opportunities to adjust their behavior, find substitutes, or change consumption patterns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for insulin for diabetics is highly inelastic due to:",

          "Availability of many substitutes",
          "Its classification as a luxury good",
          "Being a necessity with no close substitutes",
          "Low production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Insulin is essential for diabetics' survival and has no close substitutes, making demand extremely inelastic regardless of price changes."
      },

          "The range of available substitute products",
          "The width of store shelves",
          "Consumer income ranges",
          "Price variation over time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A wider bandwidth of substitutes (more available alternatives) makes demand more elastic because consumers have more options if prices change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Goods that represent a large portion of consumer budgets tend to have:",
