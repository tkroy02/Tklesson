        "question": "When demand is price elastic, an increase in price will cause total revenue to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Become unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With elastic demand, the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage increase in price, so total revenue decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When demand is price inelastic, a decrease in price will cause total revenue to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "First increase then decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With inelastic demand, the percentage increase in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage decrease in price, so total revenue decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Total revenue is maximized when price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "Greater than 1",
          "Less than 1",
          "Equal to 1",
          "Equal to 0"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At unit elasticity (PED = 1), total revenue is maximized because any price change (increase or decrease) would reduce total revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a business raises its price and total revenue increases, we know that demand is:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic",
          "Inelastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When price and total revenue move in the same direction (both increase), demand is inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'total revenue test' states that if price and total revenue move in opposite directions, demand is:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic",
          "Inelastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When price and total revenue move in opposite directions (price up, revenue down or price down, revenue up), demand is elastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If PED = -0.8 and a business increases price by 10%, what happens to total revenue?",
        "options": [
          "Increases by 2%",
          "Decreases by 2%",
          "Increases by 8%",
          "Decreases by 8%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With inelastic demand (0.8), a 10% price increase causes an 8% quantity decrease. Revenue change ≈ 10% - 8% = 2% increase. (Exactly: 1.10 × 0.92 = 1.012 = 1.2% increase)"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When demand is perfectly inelastic, a price increase will cause total revenue to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase proportionally with the price increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "First increase then decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With perfectly inelastic demand, quantity doesn't change, so total revenue changes by exactly the same percentage as the price change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a business wants to increase total revenue and knows demand is elastic, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Raise prices",
          "Lower prices",
          "Keep prices unchanged",
          "Eliminate the product"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With elastic demand, lowering prices increases total revenue because the percentage increase in quantity is greater than the percentage decrease in price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the midpoint of a linear demand curve, price elasticity is:",
        "options": [
          "Greater than 1",
          "Less than 1",
          "Equal to 1",
          "Equal to 0"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "On a linear demand curve, the midpoint is where price elasticity equals 1 (unit elastic) and total revenue is maximized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If total revenue remains constant when price changes, demand must be:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic",
          "Inelastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When total revenue doesn't change with price changes, demand is unit elastic (PED = 1)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On the elastic portion of a demand curve (above the midpoint), a price decrease will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase total revenue",
          "Decrease total revenue",
          "Not affect total revenue",
          "Make demand more elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On the elastic portion of the curve, price and total revenue move in opposite directions, so lowering price increases total revenue."

          "Increase total revenue",
          "Decrease total revenue",
          "Not affect total revenue",
          "Make demand more inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On the inelastic portion of the curve, price and total revenue move in the same direction, so raising price increases total revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If PED = -2.0 and a business decreases price by 5%, what happens to total revenue?",
        "options": [
          "Increases by 5%",
          "Decreases by 5%",
          "Increases by 10%",
          "Decreases by 10%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With elastic demand (2.0), a 5% price decrease causes a 10% quantity increase. Revenue change ≈ -5% + 10% = 5% increase. (Exactly: 0.95 × 1.10 = 1.045 = 4.5% increase)"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A business should never operate where demand is:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic",
          "Inelastic",
          "On the inelastic portion if it can move toward unit elasticity",
          "Perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Businesses should avoid the inelastic portion if possible because they can increase total revenue by raising prices toward the unit elastic point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When demand is unit elastic, a 8% price increase will cause:",
        "options": [
          "An 8% decrease in quantity and no change in total revenue",
          "A 4% decrease in quantity and increased total revenue",
          "A 12% decrease in quantity and decreased total revenue",
          "No change in quantity and increased total revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With unit elasticity, the percentage change in quantity equals the percentage change in price, so total revenue remains unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between price elasticity and total revenue is important for:",
        "options": [
          "Setting profit-maximizing prices",
          "Determining production costs only",
          "Government tax policy only",
          "International trade decisions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Understanding how price changes affect total revenue helps businesses set prices that maximize revenue, which is the first step toward profit maximization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a business is currently operating where demand is inelastic, to increase total revenue it should:",
        "options": [
          "Lower prices",
          "Raise prices",
          "Keep prices unchanged",
          "Increase advertising"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "On the inelastic portion of demand, raising prices increases total revenue because the percentage decrease in quantity is smaller than the percentage increase in price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a linear demand curve, total revenue is represented by:",
        "options": [
          "A straight line",
          "An inverted U-shape (parabola)",
          "A horizontal line",
          "A vertical line"
        ],
        "explanation": "Total revenue forms an inverted U-shaped curve (parabola) with linear demand, reaching its maximum at the unit elastic point.",
        "answer": "B"

          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When price and total revenue move in the same direction (both decrease), demand is inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental business implication of price elasticity is that:",
        "options": [
          "Higher prices always increase revenue",
          "Lower prices always increase revenue",
          "The optimal pricing strategy depends on elasticity",
          "Elasticity doesn't affect pricing decisions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The relationship between price elasticity and total revenue shows that the best pricing strategy depends on whether demand is elastic or inelastic at the current price point."
