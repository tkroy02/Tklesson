    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Income elasticity of demand (YED) measures:",
        "options": [
          "How quantity demanded responds to price changes",
          "How quantity demanded responds to income changes",
          "How supply responds to price changes",
          "How demand responds to advertising"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in consumer income."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The formula for income elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "% change in quantity demanded / % change in price",
          "% change in quantity demanded / % change in income",
          "% change in price / % change in income",
          "Change in quantity / change in income"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "YED = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in income). This measures how responsive consumer demand is to changes in their income."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A good with positive income elasticity is called:",
        "options": [
          "An inferior good",
          "A normal good",
          "A luxury good",
          "A necessity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Normal goods have positive income elasticity - demand increases when income increases, and decreases when income decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If YED = -0.5, the good is:",

          "An inferior good",
          "A luxury good",
          "A necessity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Negative income elasticity indicates an inferior good - demand decreases when income increases, as consumers switch to better alternatives."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Luxury goods are characterized by income elasticity:",

          "Less than 0",
          "Equal to 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods have income elasticity greater than 1, meaning demand increases more than proportionally to income increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Necessities typically have income elasticity:",
        "options": [

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Necessities have income elasticity between 0 and 1 - demand increases with income but less than proportionally."

          "1.00",
          "1.50",
          "2.50"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "YED = (% change in quantity) / (% change in income) = 15% / 10% = 1.5"
      },

          "Designer clothing",
          "Fine dining",
          "Generic brand groceries",
          "International travel"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Generic brand groceries are inferior goods - as income rises, consumers switch to name brands, decreasing demand for generics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A good with YED = 0.3 would be classified as:",

          "An inferior good",
          "A luxury good",
          "A normal necessity",
          "A perfectly elastic good"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "YED between 0 and 1 indicates a normal necessity - demand increases with income but less than proportionally."

          "Remains unchanged",
          "Becomes more elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When incomes fall during recessions, consumers switch from normal goods to cheaper inferior alternatives, increasing demand for inferior goods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If YED = 2.5, a 10% increase in income will cause quantity demanded to:",

          "Decrease by 25%",
          "Decrease by 4%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "YED = %ΔQ / %ΔY → 2.5 = %ΔQ / 10% → %ΔQ = 2.5 × 10% = 25% increase"

          "Public transportation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Sports cars are luxury goods with high income elasticity - demand increases significantly as income rises."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The classification of a good as normal or inferior can change:",
        "options": [
          "Never - it's fixed for each good",
          "Only with government regulation",
          "As consumer incomes and preferences evolve over time",
          "Only during economic crises"
        ],
        "explanation": "What consumers consider normal vs inferior can change with economic development, technology, and social trends. For example, mobile phones transitioned from luxury to necessity.",

          "2.0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "YED = (% change in quantity) / (% change in income) = (-4%) / (-8%) = 0.5. Positive YED indicates a normal good."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A good can be normal for some consumers and inferior for others because:",
        "options": [
          "The government sets different classifications",
          "Income elasticity depends on individual income levels and preferences",
          "All goods are inherently normal",
          "Price elasticity overrides income effects"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A good's classification depends on individual circumstances. For example, bus transportation might be inferior for middle-income consumers but normal for very low-income consumers."

          "No change in demand",
          "Slightly increased demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods have YED > 1, so during economic expansions with rising incomes, demand grows faster than income."

          "Decrease by 6.25%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "YED = %ΔQ / %ΔY → -0.8 = %ΔQ / 5% → %ΔQ = -0.8 × 5% = -4% decrease"

          "Calculate consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Understanding income elasticity helps businesses anticipate how demand will change during economic expansions or recessions and plan their production and inventory accordingly."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A good with zero income elasticity means:",
        "options": [
          "Demand decreases when income increases",
          "Demand increases when income increases",
          "Demand is unaffected by income changes",
          "The good is always a luxury"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Zero income elasticity means quantity demanded does not change at all when income changes - the good is income-insensitive."

        "50": "A fair start. Focus on: Positive YED = normal good; Negative YED = inferior good; YED > 1 = luxury; 0 < YED < 1 = necessity.",
