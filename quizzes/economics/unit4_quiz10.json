    "topic": "Advanced Elasticity Applications, Tax Incidence, Market Analysis, Strategic Pricing",
    "duration": 35,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The burden of a tax falls more heavily on consumers when:",
        "options": [
          "Demand is elastic and supply is inelastic",
          "Demand is inelastic and supply is elastic",
          "Both demand and supply are elastic",
          "Both demand and supply are inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When demand is inelastic, consumers are less responsive to price changes and bear more of the tax burden. When supply is elastic, producers can more easily reduce output to avoid the tax."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the formula for tax incidence, the proportion borne by consumers is:",
        "options": [
          "Es / (Ed + Es)",
          "Ed / (Ed + Es)",
          "(Ed + Es) / Ed",
          "(Ed + Es) / Es"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Consumer's share of tax = Es / (Ed + Es), where Es is price elasticity of supply and Ed is absolute value of price elasticity of demand. The more inelastic side bears more of the burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are luxury taxes often ineffective at generating revenue?",
        "options": [
          "Luxury goods have elastic demand, so consumption decreases significantly",
          "Rich people don't pay taxes",
          "Luxury goods are tax-exempt",
          "Production costs increase to offset the tax"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods typically have elastic demand because they are discretionary purchases. When taxed, consumers significantly reduce consumption, limiting revenue generation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In peak-load pricing, prices are higher during peak periods because:",
        "options": [
          "Demand is more inelastic during peak times",
          "Production costs are lower during peak times",
          "Companies want to discourage all usage",
          "Government requires peak pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During peak periods, demand becomes more inelastic as consumers have fewer alternatives and more urgent needs, allowing suppliers to charge higher prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Lerner Index measures monopoly power using the formula:",
        "options": [
          "(P - MC) / P = 1 / |Ed|",
          "P / MC = |Ed|",
          "(P - MC) × Q = Total Revenue",
          "MC / P = 1 / |Ed|"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Lerner Index (P - MC)/P = 1/|Ed| shows that monopoly power is inversely related to price elasticity of demand. More inelastic demand allows greater price markup over marginal cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do companies use versioning (different product versions at different prices)?",
        "options": [
          "To confuse customers",
          "To segment markets based on different demand elasticities",
          "Production requires multiple versions",
          "Government regulation requires variety"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Versioning allows price discrimination by creating product tiers that appeal to different customer segments with varying price sensitivities and demand elasticities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In two-part pricing (entry fee + usage fee), the entry fee captures:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost",
          "Consumer surplus from inframarginal units",
          "Only the wealthiest customers",
          "Production fixed costs only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The entry fee is designed to capture consumer surplus, while the usage fee is set at marginal cost. This works best when demand is relatively homogeneous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Ramsey Pricing Rule' suggests that to maximize social welfare while covering fixed costs:",
        "options": [
          "All prices should be equal",
          "Price-cost margins should be inversely proportional to demand elasticity",
          "Prices should always equal marginal cost",
          "The government should set all prices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ramsey Pricing states that to minimize deadweight loss while covering fixed costs, the percentage markup over marginal cost should be higher for goods with more inelastic demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In bundling strategies, mixed bundling is most effective when:",
        "options": [
          "All consumers have identical preferences",
          "Consumer valuations are negatively correlated",
          "Products are perfect complements",
          "Demand is perfectly elastic for all goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Mixed bundling works best when consumers have negatively correlated valuations - some value product A highly but not B, while others value B highly but not A. This allows capturing more consumer surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Alchian-Allen effect' explains why:",
        "options": [
          "Shipping costs increase consumption of higher-quality goods",
          "Taxes always reduce consumption",
          "Elasticity decreases over time",
          "Monopolies always charge high prices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Alchian-Allen effect states that adding a fixed cost (like shipping) to both high and low-quality goods makes consumers relatively more likely to choose the higher-quality option, as the quality premium becomes relatively cheaper."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In strategic trade policy, export subsidies can be beneficial when:",
        "options": [
          "Foreign demand is elastic",
          "Domestic firms face inelastic supply",
          "Foreign demand is inelastic and domestic firms have market power",
          "All countries subsidize equally"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When domestic firms have market power and face inelastic foreign demand, export subsidies can help them capture more foreign market share and profits that may exceed subsidy costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Hotelling's Lemma' in elasticity application shows that:",
        "options": [
          "A firm's supply function is related to its profit function",
          "All demand is unit elastic",
          "Tax incidence is always equal",
          "Monopoly always reduces social welfare"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hotelling's Lemma states that a competitive firm's supply function can be derived by differentiating its profit function with respect to price, showing the relationship between profitability and supply elasticity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In health economics, moral hazard occurs because health insurance makes medical care demand:",
        "options": [
          "More elastic",
          "More inelastic",
          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Unaffected by insurance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Health insurance reduces the out-of-pocket cost to consumers, making healthcare demand more elastic and leading to overconsumption (moral hazard)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Rothschild Index' measures:",
        "options": [
          "The elasticity of demand for a firm relative to market elasticity",
          "Tax burden distribution",
          "Income inequality",
          "Price discrimination effectiveness"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Rothschild Index = |Edf|/|Edm|, where Edf is firm's demand elasticity and Edm is market demand elasticity. It measures a firm's market power - values closer to 1 indicate more competitive markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In environmental economics, Pigouvian taxes are set equal to:",
        "options": [
          "The marginal external cost",
          "The average production cost",
          "The price elasticity of demand",
          "The consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pigouvian taxes should equal the marginal external cost of negative externalities. The effectiveness depends on the elasticity of demand for the polluting activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Stone-Geary utility function' is used to model:",
        "options": [
          "Demand with subsistence requirements",
          "Perfectly elastic supply",
          "Constant elasticity demand",
          "Tax incidence only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Stone-Geary function models demand where consumers have subsistence requirements (inelastic demand up to a point) and discretionary spending (more elastic demand beyond that point)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In industrial organization, the 'elasticity of substitution' between factors of production affects:",
        "options": [
          "How easily firms can adjust their input mix when factor prices change",
          "Consumer demand patterns only",
          "Government tax policy",
          "International exchange rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The elasticity of substitution measures how easily firms can substitute between capital and labor when relative factor prices change, affecting production flexibility and supply elasticity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Marshall-Lerner condition' determines when currency depreciation will:",
        "options": [
          "Improve the trade balance",
          "Worsen inflation",
          "Increase domestic consumption",
          "Reduce government debt"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Marshall-Lerner condition states that currency depreciation will improve the trade balance if the sum of import and export demand elasticities exceeds 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In real options theory, the value of flexibility in investment decisions increases when:",
        "options": [
          "Demand is more elastic and uncertain",
          "Demand is perfectly inelastic",
          "Prices are fixed by government",
          "All costs are variable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When demand is elastic and uncertain, the ability to adjust production levels (operational flexibility) becomes more valuable, as firms can respond optimally to changing market conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The key insight from advanced elasticity applications is that:",
        "options": [
          "Elasticity concepts are only theoretical",
          "Understanding elasticity enables sophisticated market analysis and strategy",
          "All markets have the same elasticity properties",
          "Elasticity doesn't affect real business decisions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Advanced elasticity applications demonstrate how understanding price sensitivity enables sophisticated analysis of tax policy, market power, strategic pricing, and regulatory impacts across diverse economic contexts."
