      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the temperature of a 1kg block of ice while it is actively melting at 0°C?",
        "options": [
          "It stays constant at 0°C until all ice has melted.",
          "It increases steadily as heat is absorbed.",
          "It decreases due to the cooling effect of the water.",
          "It fluctuates depending on the heat source."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During a phase change, the heat energy added goes into breaking intermolecular bonds (potential energy) rather than increasing molecular speed (kinetic energy/temperature)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much energy is required to melt 2.0 kg of ice at 0°C? (Lf = 3.34 x 10^5 J/kg)",
        "options": [
          "6.68 x 10^5 J",

          "4.52 x 10^6 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using Q = mLf: Q = (2.0 kg)(3.34 x 10^5 J/kg) = 6.68 x 10^5 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Latent Heat of Vaporization (Lv) for water significantly higher than the Latent Heat of Fusion (Lf)?",
        "options": [
          "It takes more energy to fully separate molecules into a gas than to loosen them into a liquid.",
          "Gases are always hotter than liquids.",
          "Water molecules are heavier in the gas phase.",
          "Steam has a higher specific heat capacity than ice."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vaporization requires breaking all remaining intermolecular attractions to turn the liquid into a gas, which is more energy-intensive than slightly shifting a lattice to melt it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much energy is needed to turn 0.5 kg of liquid water at 100°C into steam at 100°C? (Lv = 2.26 x 10^6 J/kg)",
        "options": [
          "1.13 x 10^6 J",
          "2.26 x 10^6 J",
          "4.52 x 10^6 J",
          "5.65 x 10^5 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Q = mLv = (0.5 kg)(2.26 x 10^6 J/kg) = 1.13 x 10^6 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1.0 kg block of ice at -10°C is heated until it becomes water at 10°C. How many distinct energy calculations are required to find the total heat added?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "1",
          "2",
          "4"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Calculation 1: Heat ice from -10 to 0 (mcΔT). Calculation 2: Melt ice (mLf). Calculation 3: Heat water from 0 to 10 (mcΔT)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes 'Condensation' in terms of energy?",
        "options": [
          "Energy is released by the substance (Exothermic).",
          "Energy is absorbed by the substance (Endothermic).",
          "No energy is exchanged during condensation.",
          "The substance gains temperature while condensing."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condensation is the reverse of vaporization. Since energy is required to vaporize, that same energy is released back to the environment when the gas turns back into a liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 334,000 J of energy is removed from 1.0 kg of liquid water at 0°C, what is the final state of the substance?",
        "options": [
          "Solid ice at 0°C",
          "Liquid water at -10°C",
          "Solid ice at -80°C",
          "A mixture of half ice and half water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Removing exactly Lf (3.34 x 10^5 J) results in a complete phase change from liquid to solid without decreasing the temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a heating curve (Temperature vs. Time), what does a horizontal line represent?",
        "options": [
          "A phase change where temperature is constant.",
          "A period where no heat is being added.",
          "A state where the substance is cooling down.",
          "The substance is changing temperature rapidly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The horizontal segments (plateaus) indicate that the added heat is going into a phase change rather than increasing the temperature."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the unit for Latent Heat (L)?",

          "J/kg·°C",
          "J",
          "W/kg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Latent heat is energy per unit mass required for a phase change, so it is expressed in Joules per kilogram (J/kg)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the total energy to turn 0.1 kg of ice at 0°C into water at 20°C. (Lf = 3.34x10^5, c = 4184)",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Step 1 (Melting): 0.1 * 334,000 = 33,400 J. Step 2 (Heating): 0.1 * 4184 * 20 = 8,368 J. Total = 33,400 + 8,368 = 41,768 J."
