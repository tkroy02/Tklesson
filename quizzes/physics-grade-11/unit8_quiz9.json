      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A string of length L is fixed at both ends. If it is vibrating in its third harmonic, how many antinodes are present in the standing wave pattern?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "2",
          "4",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the number of antinodes (vibrating loops) corresponds exactly to the harmonic number (n)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical wave pulses with positive amplitudes of 3 cm and 5 cm meet at a single point. What is the resulting displacement at the moment of maximum overlap?",
        "options": [
          "8 cm",
          "2 cm",
          "4 cm",
          "15 cm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Principle of Superposition, when two pulses with the same sign overlap, their amplitudes add together: 3 cm + 5 cm = 8 cm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following conditions must be met to produce a stable standing wave pattern on a string?",
        "options": [
          "Two waves of the same frequency and amplitude must travel in opposite directions.",
          "Two waves of different frequencies must travel in the same direction.",
          "A single wave must travel through a vacuum without any boundaries.",
          "The medium must be changing density constantly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standing waves are formed by the interference of an incident wave and its reflected wave, which have identical frequency and amplitude but opposite directions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a string of length L fixed at both ends, what is the wavelength of the second harmonic (n=2)?",
        "options": [
          "L",
          "2L",
          "0.5L",
          "1.5L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The second harmonic contains two loops, which equals one full wavelength. Therefore, the length of the string L equals the wavelength λ."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two sound sources are out of phase by 180°, and a listener is exactly the same distance from both, what will the listener hear?",
        "options": [
          "Nothing (silence)",
          "A sound twice as loud as a single source",
          "A sound with double the frequency",
          "A consistent beat pattern"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the sources are 180° out of phase and the path difference is zero, a crest from one source always meets a trough from the other, resulting in total destructive interference."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A standing wave on a string has 4 nodes in total, including the two fixed ends. Which harmonic is the string vibrating in?",
        "options": [
          "Third harmonic",
          "Fourth harmonic",
          "Second harmonic",
          "First harmonic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The number of nodes is always n + 1, where n is the harmonic number. If there are 4 nodes, it is the 3rd harmonic (n=3)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When two waves undergo destructive interference, what happens to the energy of the waves at the point of cancellation?",
        "options": [
          "It is redistributed to other areas, such as antinodes.",
          "It is converted into matter.",
          "It is permanently lost from the system.",
          "It is stored as potential energy at the node."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy cannot be destroyed. In interference patterns, the energy is redistributed from the nodes to the antinodes where constructive interference occurs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of a standing wave on a fixed string is doubled, what happens to the number of antinodes?",
        "options": [
          "The number of antinodes doubles.",
          "The number of antinodes stays the same.",
          "The number of antinodes is halved.",
          "The number of antinodes increases by one."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since frequency is proportional to the harmonic number (f_n = n * f_1), doubling the frequency doubles n, which represents the number of antinodes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two pulses travel toward each other. Pulse A has an amplitude of +4 m and Pulse B has an amplitude of -6 m. What is the displacement at the instant they fully overlap?",
        "options": [
          "-2 m",
          "10 m",
          "+2 m",
          "0 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding the displacements vectorially: +4 m + (-6 m) = -2 m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the third harmonic of a standing wave on a string, how much of a wavelength is contained within the length of the string?",
        "options": [
          "1.5 wavelengths",
          "3.0 wavelengths",
          "0.75 wavelengths",
          "1.0 wavelength"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The third harmonic consists of 3 half-wavelength loops. 3 * (λ/2) = 1.5λ."
