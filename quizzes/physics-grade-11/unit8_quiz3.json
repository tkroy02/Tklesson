      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass of 0.5 kg is attached to a spring with a stiffness (k) of 200 N/m. What is the period of oscillation?",
        "options": [
          "0.31 s",
          "3.14 s",
          "0.10 s",
          "0.62 s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using T = 2π√(m/k): T = 2π√(0.5/200) = 2π√(0.0025) = 2π(0.05) ≈ 0.314 s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring is compressed by 0.1 m by a force of 10 N. What is the elastic potential energy stored in the spring?",

          "5.0 J",
          "0.1 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, find k using F = kx: 10 = k(0.1) → k = 100 N/m. Then, Ep = 1/2 kx² = 0.5(100)(0.1)² = 0.5(100)(0.01) = 0.5 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "10 Hz"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Frequency (f) is cycles per second: f = 40 cycles / 10 s = 4.0 Hz."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system has a total mechanical energy of 4.0 J. If the mass is 2.0 kg, what is its maximum speed (vmax) as it passes through equilibrium?",

          "1.4 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, Etot = Ek = 1/2 mv². So, 4.0 = 0.5(2.0)v² → 4.0 = 1.0v² → v = √4 = 2.0 m/s."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An oscillator with an amplitude of 0.2 m and a spring constant of 50 N/m is halfway to its amplitude (x = 0.1 m). What is its elastic potential energy at this point?",

          "It must be reduced to 1/4 of its original value.",
          "It must be doubled.",
          "It must be halved.",
          "It must be quadrupled."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "f is proportional to 1/√m. To double f, √m must be halved, which means m must be 1/4 of its original value."

          "32 N/m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Max Ek = Total Energy = 1/2 kA². 2.0 = 0.5(k)(0.5)² → 2.0 = 0.125k → k = 2.0 / 0.125 = 16 N/m."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ep(max) = 1/2 kA². Since energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude, (2A)² results in 4 times the energy."

          "4.00 kg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "T = 2π√(m/k) → T² = 4π²(m/k) → m = (T²k) / 4π². m = (2² * 10) / (4 * 3.14²) ≈ 40 / 39.4 ≈ 1.01 kg."
