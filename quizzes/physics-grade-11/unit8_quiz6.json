      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a defining characteristic of a mechanical wave that distinguishes it from an electromagnetic wave?",
        "options": [
          "It requires a physical medium to transport energy.",
          "It can travel at the speed of light in a vacuum.",
          "It transfers matter from the source to the receiver.",
          "Its speed is independent of the properties of the medium."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mechanical waves (like sound or water waves) require particles to vibrate. Electromagnetic waves can travel through the vacuum of space."

          "25 m/s",
          "4 m/s",
          "0.25 m/s",
          "250 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the wave equation v = fλ: v = 10 Hz * 2.5 m = 25 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a longitudinal wave, the distance between two consecutive compressions is known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Wavelength",
          "Amplitude",
          "Period",
          "Frequency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wavelength is the distance between any two identical successive points on a wave, such as compression to compression or crest to crest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sound wave has a speed of 340 m/s in air. If the period of the wave is 0.02 s, what is its wavelength?",
        "options": [
          "6.8 m",
          "17,000 m",
          "0.0058 m",
          "340 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, find frequency: f = 1/T = 1/0.02 = 50 Hz. Then use λ = v/f: λ = 340 / 50 = 6.8 m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a wave's speed when it moves from a thin string into a thicker, denser string under the same tension?",
        "options": [
          "The wave speed decreases.",
          "The wave speed increases.",
          "The wave speed remains constant.",
          "The wave speed depends on the frequency of the source."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In strings, v = √(T/μ). Increasing the linear density (μ) increases the inertia of the medium, which slows down the wave speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of a wave is increased by a factor of 3 while the wave speed remains constant, how does the wavelength change?",
        "options": [
          "It is reduced to 1/3 of its original value.",
          "It triples.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It increases by a factor of 9."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because v = fλ, frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional. Tripling the frequency results in the wavelength being cut to one-third."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A water wave has a wavelength of 0.5 m and a speed of 2.0 m/s. What is the frequency of this wave?",

          "4.0 Hz",
          "1.0 Hz",
          "0.25 Hz",
          "2.5 Hz"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using f = v/λ: f = 2.0 / 0.5 = 4.0 Hz."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a transverse wave, the maximum positive displacement from the equilibrium position is called the:",

          "Trough",
          "Wavelength",
          "Rarefaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The crest is the peak or highest point of a transverse wave; the trough is the lowest point."

          "Wavelength"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pitch is the subjective perception of frequency. High frequency sound is perceived as high pitch."

          "3600 Hz"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Frequency is oscillations per second. 60 oscillations / 60 seconds = 1.0 Hz."
