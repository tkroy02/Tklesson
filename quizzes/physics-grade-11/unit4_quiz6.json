        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Decrease because gravity is weaker.",

          "$0\\text{ kg}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Mass is constant regardless of location. It remains $5\\text{ kg}$."

        "answer": "C",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$W = mg$. At fixed location, $g$ constant, so doubling mass doubles weight."

          "Its mass is $20\\text{ kg}$ and its weight is $0\\text{ N}$.",
          "It has no inertia because it is weightless."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mass is intrinsic ($20\\text{ kg}$). Weight (gravitational force) is nearly $0$ in deep space."

          "Mass is measured in newtons; weight in kilograms",
          "Mass is constant; weight depends on location",

          "Both change with location"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Mass is intrinsic and constant. Weight = $mg$ depends on local gravity."
