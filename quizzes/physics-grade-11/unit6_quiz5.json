      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is floating at the interface between a layer of oil (density 800 kg/m³) and water (density 1000 kg/m³). If the object is exactly half-submerged in the oil and half-submerged in the water, what is the density of the object?",
        "options": [
          "900 kg/m³",
          "1800 kg/m³",
          "800 kg/m³",
          "1000 kg/m³"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total buoyant force is the sum of the forces from both fluids. Since the volumes displaced in each are equal, the object's density is the simple average of the two fluid densities: (800 + 1000) / 2 = 900 kg/m³."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of wood floats in a bucket of water. If the entire bucket is placed in an elevator that begins to accelerate upward at 2 m/s², what happens to the portion of the wood submerged in the water?",
        "options": [
          "It remains the same",
          "It sinks deeper",
          "It rises higher",
          "The wood sinks to the bottom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Upward acceleration increases the effective gravitational field (g + a). This increases both the weight of the block and the pressure gradient (buoyant force) by the same factor, so the equilibrium position remains unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A boat carrying a large, heavy rock is floating in a small swimming pool. If the rock is thrown overboard and sinks to the bottom of the pool, what happens to the overall water level of the pool?",
        "options": [
          "The water level falls",
          "The water level rises",
          "The water level stays the same",
          "The water level depends on the rock's shape"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While in the boat, the rock displaces a volume of water equal to its weight. Once it sinks, it only displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume. Since the rock is denser than water, its volume is less than the volume of water equivalent to its weight."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A helium balloon is tethered to the floor of a sealed car. When the car accelerates forward, in which direction does the balloon tilt relative to the car?",
        "options": [
          "It tilts forward",
          "It tilts backward",
          "It stays vertical",
          "It moves toward the ceiling only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Forward acceleration causes air to accumulate at the back of the car, creating a pressure gradient. The lighter helium balloon is pushed toward the lower pressure region at the front, similar to how it 'floats' away from the higher pressure at the ground."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Imagine a hole is drilled through an object, but the object still floats. How does the percentage of the object's volume submerged change compared to before the hole was drilled?",
        "options": [
          "It remains the same",
          "It increases",
          "It decreases",
          "The object will now sink"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Removing material reduces total mass and total volume by the same percentage. Since density is mass/volume, the average density of the object remains constant, keeping the submerged ratio (ρ_obj / ρ_fluid) the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An iron anchor is submerged in the ocean. As it is lowered to a depth of 1000 meters, why does the buoyant force remain nearly constant despite the massive increase in pressure?",
        "options": [
          "Water is nearly incompressible, so its density does not change",
          "The force of gravity decreases at that depth",
          "The anchor becomes denser due to pressure",
          "Pressure and buoyancy are unrelated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Buoyancy (Fb = ρVg) depends on fluid density and displaced volume. Because water is nearly incompressible, its density (ρ) remains constant regardless of the depth/pressure, and the anchor's volume (V) remains constant as well."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ice cube floats in a glass of water with a layer of oil poured on top, covering the part of the ice that was in the air. As the ice melts, what happens to the level of the oil's top surface?",
        "options": [
          "It falls",
          "It rises",
          "It stays the same",
          "It depends on the type of oil"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When floating at the interface, the ice is partially supported by the oil. The volume of water produced by the melted ice is less than the total volume of oil and water it displaced while solid, causing the oil level to drop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason that a concrete ship can float, even though the density of concrete is much higher than that of water?",
        "options": [
          "The average density of the ship (including air) is less than water",
          "Surface tension holds the ship up",
          "The concrete used is a special low-density type",
          "Water pressure pushes harder on concrete than on wood"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Buoyancy applies to the total volume displaced by the outer hull. By making the ship hollow and filled with air, the average density of the total system (concrete + air) becomes lower than that of water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person stands on a scale at the bottom of a pool while wearing a heavy diving belt. If they take a deep breath and expand their chest, what happens to the scale reading?",
        "options": [
          "The reading decreases",
          "The reading increases",
          "The reading stays exactly the same",
          "The reading becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expanding the chest increases the body's volume while keeping mass relatively constant. This increases the volume of water displaced, increasing the upward buoyant force and reducing the downward force on the scale."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it easier for a person to float in the Dead Sea than in a freshwater swimming pool?",
        "options": [
          "The saltwater has a higher density, so less body volume must be submerged",
          "There is less gravity near the Dead Sea",
          "The salt reduces the person's mass",
          "Saltwater creates a magnetic field that pushes upward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Saltwater is much denser than freshwater. Since the submerged volume ratio is ρ_obj / ρ_fluid, a larger ρ_fluid results in a smaller submerged volume required to balance the person's weight."
