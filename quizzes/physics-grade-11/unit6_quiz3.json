    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object has a volume of 0.05 m³. When it is completely submerged in water (density = 1000 kg/m³), what is the buoyant force acting on it? (Use g = 9.8 m/s²)",
        "options": [
          "49 N",
          "490 N",
          "50 N",
          "980 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Buoyant force $F_B = \\rho_{fluid} \\cdot V_{submerged} \\cdot g$. Here, $F_B = 1000 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 9.8 = 490\\text{ N}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.0 kg block is weighted using a spring scale while submerged in water. If the scale reads 15 N, what is the magnitude of the buoyant force acting on the block? (Use g = 10 m/s² for weight)",
        "options": [
          "5 N",
          "15 N",
          "20 N",
          "35 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True weight $W = m \\cdot g = 2.0 \\cdot 10 = 20\\text{ N}$. Apparent weight $W_{app} = W - F_B$. Therefore, $15 = 20 - F_B$, which means $F_B = 5\\text{ N}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wooden block with a density of 700 kg/m³ floats in water (1000 kg/m³). What fraction of the block's volume is submerged?",

          "30%",
          "50%",
          "70%",
          "100%"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a floating object, the fraction submerged is given by $\\rho_{object} / \\rho_{fluid}$. So, $700 / 1000 = 0.7$ or $70\\%$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$F_B = W_{air} - W_{water} = 25 - 22 = 3\\text{ N}$. Since $F_B = \\rho \\cdot V \\cdot g$, then $3 = 1000 \\cdot V \\cdot 10$. $V = 3 / 10000 = 0.0003\\text{ m³}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density of object = (Fraction submerged) $\\cdot$ (Density of fluid). $\\rho_{obj} = 0.25 \\cdot 1200 = 300\\text{ kg/m³}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 500 cm³ object is placed in a fluid. If the buoyant force is 4.0 N, and the object is fully submerged, what is the density of the fluid? (Use g = 10 m/s²)",

          "1200 kg/m³"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, convert volume to m³: $500\\text{ cm³} = 0.0005\\text{ m³}$. $F_B = \\rho \\cdot V \\cdot g \\rightarrow 4.0 = \\rho \\cdot 0.0005 \\cdot 10$. $\\rho = 4.0 / 0.005 = 800\\text{ kg/m³}$."

          "5000 kg",
          "Not enough information"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a floating object, Weight = Buoyant Force. If it displaces 5000 N of water, the buoyant force is 5000 N, so the weight of the boat is 5000 N. Mass = Weight / g = $5000 / 10 = 500\\text{ kg}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Volume of object $V = m / \\rho_{obj} = 5 / 2500 = 0.002\\text{ m³}$. $F_B = \\rho_{oil} \\cdot V \\cdot g = 800 \\cdot 0.002 \\cdot 10 = 16\\text{ N}$."

          "It becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $F_B = \\rho \\cdot V \\cdot g$, and none of these variables (density, submerged volume, or gravity) change with depth, the buoyant force remains constant."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balloon is filled with 10 m³ of helium (density 0.18 kg/m³). The surrounding air has a density of 1.29 kg/m³. What is the net upward force (lifting force) ignoring the balloon's skin? (g = 9.8 m/s²)",
