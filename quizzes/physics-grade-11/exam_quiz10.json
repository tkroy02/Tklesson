        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The observed frequency is lower than the source frequency, which indicates the source is moving away from the observer. Using the Doppler formula $f' = f\\left(\\frac{v}{v + v_s}\\right)$, we have $470 = 500\\left(\\frac{340}{340 + v_s}\\right)$. Solving: $470/500 = 340/(340 + v_s) \\Rightarrow 0.94 = 340/(340 + v_s) \\Rightarrow 340 + v_s = 340/0.94 \\approx 361.7 \\Rightarrow v_s \\approx 21.7\\,\\text{m/s}$."
