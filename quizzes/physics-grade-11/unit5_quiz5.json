      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform 2.00 kg picture frame is hung by two vertical wires attached to the top corners. If the frame is in static equilibrium, what is the tension in each wire?",
        "options": [
          "9.80 N",
          "19.6 N",
          "4.90 N",
          "39.2 N",
          "1.00 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total weight Fg = mg = 2.00 kg * 9.80 m/s² = 19.6 N. In vertical equilibrium, ΣFy = 0. Since there are two vertical wires, 2T = 19.6 N. Therefore, T = 9.80 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 10.0 kg uniform plank is 4.00 m long and supported by two scales at the very ends. If a 5.00 kg cat sits exactly in the middle of the plank, what is the reading on each scale?",
        "options": [
          "73.5 N",
          "147 N",
          "49.0 N",
          "98.0 N",
          "15.0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total mass = 15.0 kg. Total weight = 15.0 * 9.80 = 147 N. Since the load is perfectly centered, the weight is shared equally: 147 / 2 = 73.5 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is in 'Static Equilibrium' only when which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "ΣF = 0 and Στ = 0",
          "ΣF = 0 only",
          "Στ = 0 only",
          "The object is moving at constant velocity",
          "The object is at the center of the Earth"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Static equilibrium requires both translational equilibrium (net force is zero) and rotational equilibrium (net torque is zero)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 50.0 N sign is held by a horizontal beam. A diagonal cable attached to the end of the beam exerts a horizontal force of 30.0 N toward the wall. What horizontal force must the wall hinge exert on the beam?",
        "options": [
          "30.0 N away from the wall",
          "30.0 N toward the wall",
          "50.0 N upward",
          "80.0 N away from the wall",
          "0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For horizontal equilibrium, ΣFx = 0. If the cable pulls 30 N toward the wall, the hinge must push 30 N away from the wall to balance it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1.50 kg shelf is supported by two brackets, A and B. If the center of mass of the shelf is 0.20 m from bracket A and 0.80 m from bracket B, which bracket exerts a greater upward force?",
        "options": [
          "Bracket A",
          "Bracket B",
          "They exert equal force",
          "Bracket B exerts 4 times more force",
          "Neither exerts force"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The support closer to the center of mass must exert a greater force to satisfy the torque equilibrium relative to the other support."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5.00 kg uniform beam is 2.00 m long. It is pivoted at the left end. What upward vertical force must be applied at the right end to keep it horizontal?",
        "options": [
          "24.5 N",
          "49.0 N",
          "9.80 N",
          "5.00 N",
          "12.3 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weight (49N) acts at the center (1.0m from pivot). τ_cw = 49N * 1.0m = 49 Nm. To balance, τ_ccw must be 49 Nm. F * 2.0m = 49 Nm. F = 24.5 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A picture is hung by a wire forming an inverted 'V'. If the angle between the two wire segments is increased (making it flatter), what happens to the tension in the wire?",
        "options": [
          "It increases",
          "It decreases",
          "It stays the same",
          "It drops to zero",
          "It equals the weight"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertical component of tension must support the weight. As the wire gets flatter, a much larger total tension is required to maintain that same vertical component."

        "question": "A 12.0 kg ladder leans against a frictionless wall. What force prevents the bottom of the ladder from sliding outward?",
        "options": [
          "Static friction from the ground",
          "Normal force from the wall",
          "Gravity",
          "Tension",
          "Kinetic friction from the wall"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The wall pushes horizontally on the top of the ladder. To maintain ΣFx = 0, static friction at the ground must push in the opposite horizontal direction."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform meter stick (1.00 m) is balanced at the 50 cm mark. If a 100 g mass is placed at the 10 cm mark, where must a 200 g mass be placed to maintain balance?",

          "90 cm mark"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Left torque: 100g * 40cm (distance from pivot) = 4000 g·cm. Right torque: 200g * d = 4000. d = 20cm from pivot. 50cm + 20cm = 70cm mark."

          "9.8 N·m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weight of book = 2.0 * 9.8 = 19.6 N. Torque = F * r = 19.6 N * 0.70 m = 13.72 N·m."
