    "subject": "Physics",
    "topic": "Thermodynamics",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method of heat transfer involves the movement of energy through a vacuum without the need for particles?",
        "options": [
          "Conduction",
          "Convection",
          "Radiation",
          "Advection"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Radiation travels via electromagnetic waves (infrared), which do not require any medium to propagate, allowing energy to move through empty space."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a metal spoon feel colder than a wooden spoon when both have been sitting in the same 20°C room?",
        "options": [
          "The metal spoon is actually at a lower temperature.",
          "Metal is a better thermal conductor and removes heat from your skin faster.",
          "Wood contains more thermal energy per gram than metal.",
          "Metal reflects the cold air toward your hand."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since both are in thermal equilibrium with the room, they are at the same temperature. Metal feels colder because its high conductivity allows it to draw heat away from your hand rapidly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a pot of water being heated on a stove, the movement of hotter, less dense water upward is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "Conduction",
          "Convection",
          "Radiation",
          "Specific Heat"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Convection is the transfer of heat through the bulk movement of fluid (liquid or gas) particles driven by density differences."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Heat transfer by conduction is most effective in which state of matter?",
        "options": [
          "Solids",
          "Liquids",
          "Gases",
          "Plasmas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In solids, especially metals, particles are packed closely together, allowing for efficient energy transfer through frequent molecular collisions and free electron movement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the primary reason that double-paned windows are good insulators?",
        "options": [
          "Glass is the best thermal conductor.",
          "The gap between panes traps air, which is a very poor conductor.",
          "Two layers of glass block all ultraviolet radiation.",
          "The vacuum between the panes increases convection."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Air is a poor thermal conductor. By trapping a thin layer of air between panes, the window significantly reduces heat loss through conduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You feel the warmth of a space heater on your face immediately when it is turned on, even if the air is still cold. This is due to:",
        "options": [
          "Convection",
          "Radiation",
          "Conduction",
          "Evaporation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Radiation travels at the speed of light in straight lines. It reaches your skin instantly without needing to heat the air in between."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which surface would be the most efficient at emitting thermal radiation?",
        "options": [
          "A shiny, polished chrome bumper",
          "A smooth, white painted wall",
          "A matte, black engine block",
          "A transparent glass window"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Good absorbers of radiation are also good emitters. Matte black surfaces absorb and radiate infrared energy much more effectively than shiny or light-colored surfaces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does hot air rise and cool air sink?",
        "options": [
          "Hot air molecules are lighter in mass.",
          "Hot air expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding cool air.",
          "Cool air molecules are repelled by the ground.",
          "Radiation pushes hot air upward."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As air heats, the molecules move faster and spread out. This increased volume for the same mass results in lower density, causing it to rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vacuum flask (Thermos) minimizes heat transfer by convection and conduction primarily through which feature?",
        "options": [
          "A silver coating on the inner glass.",
          "A thick plastic outer shell.",
          "An evacuated space (vacuum) between two walls.",
          "A tight-fitting rubber stopper."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Conduction and convection require a medium (matter) to transfer energy. A vacuum contains no particles, effectively stopping both methods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Birds fluff their feathers during winter primarily to reduce heat loss via which method?",
        "options": [
          "Radiation",
          "Conduction",
          "Convection",
          "Sublimation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fluffing feathers traps a layer of air against the bird's body. Since air is a poor conductor, it acts as an insulating barrier to keep body heat in."
