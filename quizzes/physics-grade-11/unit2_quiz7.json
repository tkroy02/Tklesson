        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion. Both start with zero vertical velocity and same height, so they hit simultaneously."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Straight line position-time means constant velocity, so acceleration is zero. Acceleration-time graph is a horizontal line on the x-axis (at a=0)."
