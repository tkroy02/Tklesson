      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $0.50\\ \\text{kg}$ ball is dropped from rest. Air resistance exerts a constant upward force of $0.5\\ \\text{N}$. What is the ball's acceleration just after release?",
        "options": [
          "$8.8\\ \\text{m/s}^2$ downward",
          "$9.8\\ \\text{m/s}^2$ downward",

          "$7.8\\ \\text{m/s}^2$ downward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weight $= mg = 4.9\\ \\text{N}$ down. Net force $= 4.9 - 0.5 = 4.4\\ \\text{N}$ down. Acceleration $a = F_{\\text{net}}/m = 4.4/0.50 = 8.8\\ \\text{m/s}^2$ down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A skydiver reaches terminal velocity when the force of air resistance equals her weight. If her mass is $70\\ \\text{kg}$, what is the air resistance force at terminal velocity?",
        "options": [
          "$686\\ \\text{N}$ upward",
          "$70\\ \\text{N}$ upward",
          "$9.8\\ \\text{N}$ upward",
          "$0\\ \\text{N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At terminal velocity, net force $= 0$, so air resistance $=$ weight $= mg = 70 \\times 9.8 = 686\\ \\text{N}$ upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2.0\\ \\text{kg}$ projectile is launched upward at $40\\ \\text{m/s}$. If air resistance exerts a constant $1.0\\ \\text{N}$ force downward during its entire flight, how much lower does it go compared to the no-air-resistance case?",

          "The same height"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without air: $\\Delta y = 40^2/(2\\times9.8) \\approx 81.63\\ \\text{m}$. With air: effective $a = (mg+1.0)/m = 10.3\\ \\text{m/s}^2$, $\\Delta y = 40^2/(2\\times10.3) \\approx 77.67\\ \\text{m}$. Difference $\\approx 4.0\\ \\text{m}$."

          "$500\\ \\text{N}$ backward",
          "$0\\ \\text{N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constant speed $\\Rightarrow$ net force $=0$. So air resistance force $=$ engine force $= 2000\\ \\text{N}$ backward."

          "$1.96\\ \\text{N}$ upward",
          "$0.20\\ \\text{N}$ upward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Terminal velocity means constant velocity $\\Rightarrow$ acceleration $=0 \\Rightarrow$ net force $=0$ by Newton's first law."

        "question": "A $60\\ \\text{kg}$ cyclist rides at constant $10\\ \\text{m/s}$ on level ground. If air resistance is the only opposing force and is measured to be $80\\ \\text{N}$, what power is she producing?",

          "$980\\ \\text{W}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constant speed $\\Rightarrow$ her forward force $=$ air resistance $=80\\ \\text{N}$. Power $= F \\times v = 80 \\times 10 = 800\\ \\text{W}$."

          "$1.0\\ \\text{N}$ upward"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net force $= m a = 5.0 \\times 8.0 = 40\\ \\text{N}$ down. Weight $= 49\\ \\text{N}$ down. So $49 - F_{\\text{air}} = 40 \\Rightarrow F_{\\text{air}} = 9.0\\ \\text{N}$ up."

          "Cannot determine without initial speed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Air resistance adds to gravity, increasing downward acceleration, so it doesn't go as high as in vacuum."
