      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A simple pendulum has a length of 0.98 m on Earth (g = 9.8 m/s²). What is its period of oscillation?",
        "options": [
          "2.0 seconds",
          "1.0 second",
          "6.28 seconds",
          "0.63 seconds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using T = 2π√(L/g): T = 2π√(0.98/9.8) = 2π√(0.1) ≈ 2(3.14)(0.316) ≈ 2.0 s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the length of a simple pendulum is quadrupled (4L), what happens to its period of oscillation?",
        "options": [
          "The period doubles.",
          "The period quadruples.",
          "The period remains the same.",
          "The period is halved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period is proportional to the square root of the length (T ∝ √L). Since √4 = 2, the period increases by a factor of 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass-spring system has a frequency of 2.0 Hz. If the mass is doubled and the spring constant is halved, what is the new frequency?",
        "options": [
          "1.0 Hz",
          "2.0 Hz",
          "0.5 Hz",
          "4.0 Hz"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Frequency f ∝ √(k/m). If k becomes k/2 and m becomes 2m, the term inside the root becomes (k/2)/2m = k/4m. √(1/4) = 1/2, so the frequency is halved to 1.0 Hz."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An astronaut takes a pendulum clock to a planet where gravity is four times stronger than Earth (4g). How does the period change?",
        "options": [
          "The period is halved.",
          "The period doubles.",
          "The period is reduced to 1/4 of the original.",
          "The period remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period is inversely proportional to the square root of gravity (T ∝ 1/√g). Since √4 = 2, the period becomes 1/2 of its original value."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.0 kg mass oscillates on a spring with k = 50 N/m and an amplitude of 0.1 m. What is the maximum kinetic energy of the system?",
        "options": [
          "0.25 J",
          "0.50 J",
          "0.05 J",
          "5.0 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Max Ek = Total Energy = 1/2 kA². Ek = 0.5 * 50 * (0.1)² = 25 * 0.01 = 0.25 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring has a stiffness of 400 N/m. How much mass must be attached for the system to have a period of exactly 1.0 second? (Use π² ≈ 10)",
        "options": [
          "10 kg",
          "40 kg",
          "1 kg",
          "100 kg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rearranging T = 2π√(m/k) to m = (T²k) / 4π². m = (1² * 400) / (4 * 10) = 400 / 40 = 10 kg."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an SHM system, if the amplitude is doubled, how does the maximum velocity (vmax) change?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles.",
          "It increases by a factor of 4.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It increases by √2."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "vmax = ωA. Since angular frequency (ω) is independent of amplitude, doubling A directly doubles the maximum velocity."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pendulum bob is replaced with one that is twice as heavy. What is the effect on the period of the pendulum?",

          "The period doubles.",

          "The period increases by √2."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formula T = 2π√(L/g) contains no mass variable. The period of a simple pendulum is independent of the mass of the bob."

          "4.0 Hz",
          "1.25 Hz"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Frequency is the reciprocal of period: f = 1/T = 1/0.4 = 2.5 Hz."
