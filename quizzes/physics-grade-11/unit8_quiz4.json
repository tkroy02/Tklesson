        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The equilibrium position is the rest position of the medium when no wave is present. Waves oscillate around this line."

          "It depends on the wavelength"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A higher amplitude means the wave disturbs the medium more, which requires and carries more energy."

          "It depends on the frequency."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "As a wave travels, its energy spreads out. This causes the amplitude to gradually get smaller, a process called damping."
