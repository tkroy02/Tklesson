    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5.00 kg mass is placed 2.00 m to the left of a pivot. Where should a 10.0 kg mass be placed to the right to balance the system?",
        "options": ["1.00 m", "2.00 m", "4.00 m", "0.50 m", "1.50 m"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For equilibrium, CCW torque = CW torque. (m1 × g × d1) = (m2 × g × d2). The 'g' cancels out: 5.00 kg × 2.00 m = 10.0 kg × d2. 10.0 = 10.0 × d2. d2 = 1.00 m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the torque produced by a 20.0 N force applied perpendicularly to a wrench at a distance of 0.25 m from the bolt?",
        "options": ["5.00 N·m", "80.0 N·m", "4.00 N·m", "20.25 N·m", "0.0125 N·m"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torque (τ) = Force (F) × lever arm (r). τ = 20.0 N × 0.25 m = 5.00 N·m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform log of length 4.00 m is balanced at its center. A 15.0 kg child sits on the left end (2.00 m from pivot). A second child sits 1.50 m to the right of the pivot to balance it. What is the mass of the second child?",
        "options": ["20.0 kg", "11.25 kg", "30.0 kg", "15.0 kg", "22.5 kg"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CCW Torque = CW Torque. 15.0 kg × 2.00 m = m2 × 1.50 m. 30.0 = 1.50 × m2. m2 = 30.0 / 1.50 = 20.0 kg."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.00 m long lever has a pivot at the far left end. A 50.0 N force pushes upward at the far right end. What is the torque about the pivot?",
        "options": ["100 N·m (CCW)", "100 N·m (CW)", "25.0 N·m (CCW)", "50.0 N·m (CW)", "0 N·m"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "τ = F × r. τ = 50.0 N × 2.00 m = 100 N·m. Since the force is upward on the right side of the pivot, it rotates the lever counter-clockwise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two masses are balanced on a lever. If the mass on the right is doubled, what must happen to its distance from the pivot to maintain balance?",
        "options": [
          "It must be halved",
          "It must be doubled",
          "It must stay the same",
          "It must be squared",
          "It must be reduced by 9.8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since τ = F × d, if Force (mass) is multiplied by 2, the distance must be divided by 2 to keep the product constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 10.0 kg uniform plank is 4.00 m long. If the pivot is placed exactly at the 1.00 m mark from the left end, what downward force must be applied at the left end to keep the plank horizontal?",
        "options": ["98.0 N", "49.0 N", "10.0 N", "196 N", "39.2 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": " The plank's weight (10kg × 9.8) acts at its center (2m mark). The distance from pivot (1m mark) to center is 1m. CW Torque from plank = 98N × 1m = 98 N·m. To balance, Force_left × 1m = 98 N·m. Force = 98.0 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person uses a 1.50 m long crowbar. They apply a force of 200 N at the end. If the pivot is 0.10 m from the load, what is the torque applied to the crowbar by the person?",
        "options": ["280 N·m", "300 N·m", "20.0 N·m", "180 N·m", "2000 N·m"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The person is at the far end, so their distance from the pivot is 1.50 m - 0.10 m = 1.40 m. Torque = 200 N × 1.40 m = 280 N·m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes 'Rotational Equilibrium'?",
        "options": [
          "The sum of all torques is zero",
          "The object is not moving at all",
          "The sum of all forces is zero",
          "The object is moving at a constant tangential speed",
          "The pivot is located at the center of mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Translational equilibrium means net Force is zero. Rotational equilibrium specifically means the net Torque is zero."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 60.0 kg person stands 2.00 m from the pivot of a seesaw. A 40.0 kg person stands on the other side. How far must the 40.0 kg person stand from the pivot to balance?",
        "options": ["3.00 m", "1.33 m", "2.00 m", "1.50 m", "4.00 m"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "m1d1 = m2d2 → 60.0 × 2.00 = 40.0 × d2. 120 = 40d2. d2 = 3.00 m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a force is applied directly through the pivot point (r = 0), what is the resulting torque?",
        "options": ["0 N·m", "Maximum torque", "It depends on the mass", "9.8 N·m", "Infinite torque"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torque is the product of force and lever arm distance. If the distance (r) is zero, the torque is zero, regardless of the force magnitude."
