        "question": "Why does a barometer use mercury (ρ = 13,600 kg/m³) instead of water to measure atmospheric pressure?",
        "options": [
          "Mercury is cheaper than water.",
          "Mercury does not evaporate.",
          "Water would require a tube over 10 meters high to measure 1 atm.",
          "Mercury's pressure does not change with depth."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since P = ρgh, a fluid with a lower density (water) requires a much larger height (h) to produce the same pressure as the atmosphere. Mercury's high density allows the device to be a manageable size (760 mm)."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The additional pressure from 10m of water is P = 1000 * 10 * 10 = 100,000 Pa (100 kPa). New Pressure = 300 kPa + 100 kPa = 400 kPa."
