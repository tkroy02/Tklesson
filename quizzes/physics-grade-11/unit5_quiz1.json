        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Method 1: Arc length for θ = π/2 rad is s = rθ = 50.0 m × (π/2) ≈ 78.54 m. Tangential speed v = s/t = 78.54 m / 5.00 s ≈ 15.7 m/s. Method 2: Angular speed ω = θ/t = (π/2 rad) / 5.00 s ≈ 0.314 rad/s. Then v = ωr = 0.314 rad/s × 50.0 m ≈ 15.7 m/s."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Use rotational kinematics: ω² = ω₀² + 2αθ. ω₀ = 0, α = 2.00 rad/s², θ = 100 rad. ω² = 0 + 2 × 2.00 × 100 = 400. Therefore, ω = √400 = 20.0 rad/s."
