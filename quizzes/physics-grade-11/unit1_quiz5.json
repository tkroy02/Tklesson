      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Express the number 93,000,000 (Earth-Sun distance in miles) in scientific notation.",

          "9.3 × 10⁶"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Move the decimal 7 places to the left: 93,000,000 → 9.3 × 10⁷. The coefficient must be between 1 and 10."
      },

          "4",
          "5"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Leading zeros (0.00) are not significant. The digits 3, 4, and the trailing zero after 4 are significant → 3 sig figs."

          "13.5 × 10¹¹"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Multiply coefficients: 4.5 × 3.0 = 13.5. Add exponents: 10⁶ × 10⁴ = 10¹⁰. 13.5 × 10¹⁰ needs adjustment: 13.5 = 1.35 × 10¹, so 1.35 × 10¹¹."

          "3.0 × 10⁴"
        ],
        "answer": "B",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "12.5 (3 sig figs) × 3.2 (2 sig figs) = 40.0. The result should have 2 sig figs, so 40. cm² (the decimal indicates 2 sig figs) or 4.0 × 10¹ cm²."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "12.34 + 5.6 + 0.789 = 18.729. The fewest decimal places is 1 (from 5.6), so round to 18.7 m."

          "Precision means closeness to true value",
          "Accuracy means consistency of measurements",
          "High precision guarantees high accuracy",
          "Accuracy means closeness to true value; precision means consistency"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the true value. Precision is how close repeated measurements are to each other."

          "Accuracy",
          "Precision",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The ± value represents the uncertainty, indicating the range within which the true value likely lies (between 12.29 and 12.39 cm)."

          "1020, ambiguous"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "1.020 × 10³ = 1020. In scientific notation, all digits in the coefficient are significant: 1, 0, 2, 0 → 4 sig figs. Without the decimal in standard form, trailing zeros are ambiguous, but scientific notation preserves the precision."
