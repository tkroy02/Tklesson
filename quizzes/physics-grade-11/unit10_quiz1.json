    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two positive charges are placed on the x-axis. Charge A is at the origin, and Charge B is at x = 10 cm. In which region could a third positive charge experience a net force of zero?",
        "options": [
          "Between the two charges (0 < x < 10 cm).",
          "To the left of the origin (x < 0).",
          "To the right of Charge B (x > 10 cm).",
          "Nowhere on the x-axis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Between two like charges, the force vectors from each charge point in opposite directions, allowing for a point of cancellation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the distance from a point charge is tripled, how does the magnitude of the electric field change?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases to 1/9 of its original value.",
          "It decreases to 1/3 of its original value.",
          "It triples.",
          "It increases by a factor of 9."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "E = kQ/r². Since E is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, (3r)² results in 1/9 the field strength."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An electron is moved against the direction of an electric field. What happens to its electric potential energy?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since an electron is negative, the field exerts a force in the opposite direction of the field lines. Moving it against the field is 'uphill' for the electron, increasing its potential energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equivalent capacitance of two 10 μF capacitors connected in series?",
        "options": [
          "5 μF",
          "20 μF",
          "10 μF",
          "100 μF"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For series capacitors: 1/Ceq = 1/C1 + 1/C2. 1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10, so Ceq = 10/2 = 5 μF."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a series circuit, which quantity remains the same across all components?",
        "options": [
          "Current",
          "Voltage",
          "Resistance",
          "Power"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a single-path (series) circuit, the rate of charge flow (current) must be identical at every point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using Kirchhoff's Loop Rule, the sum of all potential differences around any closed loop must equal:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "The total current",
          "The total resistance",
          "The battery voltage squared"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Loop Rule is a statement of the Conservation of Energy; all energy supplied by the source must be dissipated by the components."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Magnetic field lines outside of a bar magnet are directed:",
        "options": [
          "From North to South.",
          "From South to North.",
          "Radially outward in all directions.",
          "In concentric circles parallel to the magnet."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By convention, magnetic field lines exit the North pole and enter the South pole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A proton moves North in a magnetic field directed into the page. What is the direction of the magnetic force?",
        "options": [
          "West",
          "East",
          "South",
          "Out of the page"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using RHR: Thumb (velocity) North, Fingers (Field) Into Page, Palm (Force) faces West."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.5 m wire carrying 2 A of current is placed parallel to a 1.0 T magnetic field. What is the force on the wire?",
        "options": [
          "0 N",
          "1.0 N",
          "0.5 N",
          "0.25 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F = BIL sin(θ). If the wire is parallel to the field, θ = 0°. Since sin(0°) = 0, the force is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two parallel wires carry current in the same direction. What is the nature of the magnetic force between them?",
        "options": [
          "Attractive",
