      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "topic": "9.1 Coulomb's Law - Vector View",
        "question": "Two positive charges are placed on the x-axis. Charge A is at the origin, and Charge B is at x = 10 cm. In which region could a third positive charge experience a net force of zero?",
        "options": [
          "Between the two charges (0 < x < 10 cm).",
          "To the left of the origin (x < 0).",
          "To the right of Charge B (x > 10 cm).",
          "Nowhere on the x-axis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Between two like charges, the force vectors from each charge point in opposite directions, allowing for a point of cancellation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "topic": "9.2 Electric Field",
        "question": "If the distance from a point charge is tripled, how does the magnitude of the electric field change?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases to 1/9 of its original value.",
          "It decreases to 1/3 of its original value.",
          "It triples.",
          "It increases by a factor of 9."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "E = kQ/r². Since E is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, (3r)² results in 1/9 the field strength."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "topic": "9.3 Electric Potential Energy and Voltage",
        "question": "An electron is moved against the direction of an electric field. What happens to its electric potential energy?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since an electron is negative, the field exerts a force in the opposite direction of the field lines. Moving it against the field is 'uphill' for the electron, increasing its potential energy."

          "10 μF",
          "100 μF"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For series capacitors: 1/Ceq = 1/C1 + 1/C2. 1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10, so Ceq = 10/2 = 5 μF."

          "Voltage",
          "Resistance",
          "Power"

          "The total resistance",
          "The battery voltage squared"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Loop Rule is a statement of the Conservation of Energy; all energy supplied by the source must be dissipated by the components."

          "From South to North.",
          "Radially outward in all directions.",
          "In concentric circles parallel to the magnet."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By convention, magnetic field lines exit the North pole and enter the South pole."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F = BIL sin(θ). If the wire is parallel to the field, θ = 0°. Since sin(0°) = 0, the force is zero."
