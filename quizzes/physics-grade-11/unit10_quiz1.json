    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Coulomb's Law, what happens to the electrostatic force between two point charges if the distance between them is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "The force is reduced to one-fourth of its original value.",
          "The force is halved.",
          "The force is doubled.",
          "The force remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Coulomb's Law follows an inverse-square relationship (F ∝ 1/r²). Doubling the distance (2r) results in a force reduction of 2², which is 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two charges have the same sign (both positive or both negative), the force between them is:",
        "options": [
          "Repulsive",
          "Attractive",
          "Zero",
          "Neutral"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct unit for the Coulomb constant (k)?",
        "options": [
          "N·m²/C²",
          "C²/(N·m²)",
          "N·m/C",
          "Joules/Coulomb"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rearranging Coulomb's Law (k = Fr²/q₁q₂) gives units of Newtons times meters squared divided by Coulombs squared."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the magnitude of one of the two charges is tripled while the distance remains constant, what happens to the electrostatic force?",
        "options": [
          "The force triples.",
          "The force increases by nine times.",
          "The force is reduced by one-third.",
          "The force remains unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrostatic force is directly proportional to the product of the charges (F ∝ q₁q₂). Tripling one charge triples the total force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a vacuum, the electrostatic force between two charges is F. If the same charges are placed in a medium with a high dielectric constant, the force will:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease",
          "Increase",
          "Remain the same",
          "Drop to zero immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dielectric medium polarizes and opposes the electric field, thereby reducing the net force between the charges."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Coulomb's Law is most accurate when applied to:",
        "options": [
          "Point charges at rest",
          "Large moving metal plates",
          "Charges moving at relativistic speeds",
          "Neutral atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The law is a principle of electrostatics, specifically designed for stationary point charges where the size of the object is negligible compared to the distance."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a fundamental difference between Newton's Law of Gravitation and Coulomb's Law?",
        "options": [
          "Electrostatic forces can be both attractive and repulsive, while gravitational forces are only attractive.",
          "Only Newton's Law follows an inverse-square relationship.",
          "Coulomb's Law only applies over very short distances.",
          "Gravity is much stronger than the electrostatic force."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass is always positive (only attractive), but charge can be positive or negative (attractive or repulsive)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two charges q1 and q2 are separated by distance r. If both charges are doubled and the distance is also doubled, the new force is:",
        "options": [
          "The same as the original force.",
          "Four times the original force.",
          "One-fourth the original force.",
          "Half the original force."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The numerator (q₁q₂) increases by 4 (2*2) and the denominator (r²) increases by 4 (2²). The ratio remains unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The direction of the electrostatic force acting on a charge is always:",
        "options": [
          "Along the line joining the centers of the two charges.",
          "Perpendicular to the line joining the two charges.",
          "In a circular path around the larger charge.",
          "Always toward the larger charge regardless of sign."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electrostatic force is a central force, meaning it acts along the axis connecting the two point charges."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a negative value for the calculated electrostatic force typically represent in standard physics conventions?",
        "options": [
          "An attractive force.",
          "A repulsive force.",
          "The force is acting in the 'down' direction.",
          "The force is weaker than gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative force value results when q₁ and q₂ have opposite signs, which physically signifies attraction."
