    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the magnitude of the electric field at a point 0.50 m away from a +2.0 μC point charge?",
        "options": [
          "7.2 x 10^4 N/C",
          "3.6 x 10^4 N/C",
          "1.4 x 10^5 N/C",
          "7.2 x 10^3 N/C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using E = kq/r²: (9e9 * 2e-6) / (0.5)² = 18000 / 0.25 = 72,000 N/C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A test charge of +3.0 x 10^-9 C experiences a force of 6.0 x 10^-4 N to the right. What is the electric field at that location?",
        "options": [
          "2.0 x 10^5 N/C to the right",
          "2.0 x 10^5 N/C to the left",
          "5.0 x 10^-6 N/C to the right",
          "1.8 x 10^-12 N/C to the right"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "E = F/q. 6.0e-4 / 3.0e-9 = 2.0e5 N/C. Since the test charge is positive, the field is in the same direction as the force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the electric field at a distance r from a point charge is E, what is the electric field at a distance 2r?",
        "options": [
          "E/4",
          "E/2",
          "2E",
          "4E"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electric field follows an inverse-square law (E ∝ 1/r²). Doubling the distance (2r) reduces the field by 2², which is 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An electron is placed in a uniform electric field of 500 N/C directed upward. What is the magnitude and direction of the force on the electron? (e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C)",
        "options": [
          "8.0 x 10^-17 N downward",
          "8.0 x 10^-17 N upward",
          "3.1 x 10^21 N downward",
          "0.5 x 10^-19 N upward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F = qE. (1.6e-19 * 500) = 8.0e-17 N. Because the electron is negative, the force is opposite to the field direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two equal but opposite charges +q and -q are separated by a distance d. What is the net electric field at the exact midpoint between them?",
        "options": [
          "8kq/d² toward the negative charge",
          "0 N/C",
          "4kq/d² toward the negative charge",
          "2kq/d² toward the positive charge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the midpoint (r = d/2), both fields point toward the negative charge. Total E = kq/(d/2)² + kq/(d/2)² = 4kq/d² + 4kq/d² = 8kq/d²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point charge Q produces an electric field of 100 N/C at point P. If the charge is replaced by 2Q and the distance to P is halved, what is the new electric field?",
        "options": [
          "800 N/C",
          "400 N/C",
          "200 N/C",
          "50 /C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "E' = E * (Q_factor / r_factor²) = 100 * (2 / 0.5²) = 100 * (2 / 0.25) = 800 N/C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the acceleration of a proton (m = 1.67 x 10^-27 kg) in a uniform electric field of 2.0 x 10^4 N/C?",

          "5.2 x 10^11 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F = qE = 3.2e-15 N. a = F/m = 3.2e-15 / 1.67e-27 ≈ 1.9e12 m/s²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two point charges, q1 = +5.0 μC and q2 = +5.0 μC, are 1.0 m apart. What is the electric field at a point 0.5 m above the midpoint?",
        "options": [
          "1.3 x 10^5 N/C upward",
          "2.5 x 10^5 N/C upward",
          "0 N/C",
          "3.6 x 10^5 N/C downward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "r = sqrt(0.5² + 0.5²) = 0.707 m. E_y = 2 * (kq/r²) * sin(45°) = 2 * (9e9 * 5e-6 / 0.5) * 0.707 ≈ 1.27e5 N/C."

          "Perpendicular to the surface.",
          "Parallel to the surface.",
          "Zero.",
          "Independent of the shape of the conductor."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In electrostatic equilibrium, any parallel component of the field would cause charges to move. Thus, the field must be perpendicular to the surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a uniform electric field between parallel plates, if the distance is halved while voltage remains constant, the field strength will:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Be halved.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Quadruple."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "E = V/d. If d is halved (d/2), then E becomes 2V/d, which is double the original field."
