          "Inch"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The meter (m) is the SI base unit for length. Centimeter and kilometer are derived from it, and inch is non-SI."

          "Day"
        ],
        "answer": "C",

          "Kilogram"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton (N) is a derived unit: 1 N = 1 kg·m/s². Meter, second, and kilogram are base units."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vernier caliper can measure lengths accurately up to:",
        "options": [
          "1 m",
          "0.1 cm",
          "0.01 cm",
          "1 mm"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The least count of a typical vernier caliper is 0.01 cm (0.1 mm). 0.01 cm = 0.1 mm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The least count of a screw gauge is usually of the order of:",

          "1 cm",
          "1 mm",
          "0.01 mm",
          "0.1 mm"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A typical screw gauge (micrometer) has a least count of 0.01 mm or 0.001 cm."

          "Mass",
          "Length",
          "Force",
          "Time"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Force is a derived quantity (mass × acceleration). Mass, length, and time are fundamental quantities."
      },

          "Meter scale",
          "Micrometer screw gauge",
          "Spring balance",
          "Stopwatch"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Micrometer screw gauge measures small lengths (like wire diameter) with precision up to 0.01 mm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the recorded value is 24.5 and the true value is 25.0, what is the percentage error?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Absolute error = |24.5 - 25.0| = 0.5. Percentage error = (0.5/25.0) × 100 = 2.0%."
      },
      {

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Absolute error = |29 - 30| = 1. Percentage error = (1/30) × 100 = 3.33% ≈ 3.3%."
