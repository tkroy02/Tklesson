    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The First Law of Thermodynamics is essentially a statement of which universal principle?",
        "options": [
          "Conservation of Energy",
          "Conservation of Momentum",
          "The Law of Inertia",
          "Conservation of Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The First Law ($ \Delta U = Q - W $) states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred as heat or transformed into work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 500 J of heat is added to a gas and the gas does 200 J of work on its surroundings, what is the change in internal energy (ΔU)?",
        "options": [
          "300 J",
          "700 J",
          "-300 J",
          "500 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $ \Delta U = Q - W $: $ \Delta U = 500\text{ J} - 200\text{ J} = 300\text{ J} $."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A gas is compressed by an external force, doing 150 J of work ON the gas. At the same time, 100 J of heat is released by the gas. What is ΔU?",
        "options": [
          "50 J",
          "250 J",
          "-50 J",
          "-250 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat released means $ Q = -100 $. Work done *on* the gas means $ W = -150 $. $ \Delta U = (-100) - (-150) = 50\text{ J} $."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A gas expands from a volume of 0.02 m³ to 0.05 m³ at a constant pressure of 100,000 Pa. How much work is done by the gas?",
        "options": [
          "3,000 J",
          "5,000 J",
          "2,000 J",
          "7,000 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work $ W = P\Delta V $. $ W = 100,000 \times (0.05 - 0.02) = 100,000 \times 0.03 = 3,000\text{ J} $."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an 'Isochoric' process, the volume of the gas remains constant. How much work is done by the gas in this process?",
        "options": [
          "0 J",
          "Infinity",
          "Equal to the heat added",
          "Equal to the pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $ \Delta V = 0 $, the formula $ W = P\Delta V $ results in zero work. All heat added goes directly into changing internal energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system undergoes a process where the internal energy decreases by 400 J while 200 J of work is done ON the system. How much heat was exchanged?",
        "options": [
          "600 J was removed",
          "600 J was added",
          "200 J was removed",
          "200 J was added"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": " $ \Delta U = -400 $, $ W = -200 $. From $ -400 = Q - (-200) $, we get $ -400 = Q + 200 $, so $ Q = -600\text{ J} $."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a negative value for Work (W) signify in the standard First Law equation (ΔU = Q - W)?",
        "options": [
          "Work is being done ON the system by the surroundings.",
          "The system is expanding.",
          "The temperature is increasing.",
          "Work is being done BY the system on the surroundings."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By convention, $ W $ is positive when the system does work (expansion) and negative when work is done on the system (compression)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During an 'Adiabatic' process, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (Q = 0). If a gas does work during an adiabatic expansion, what happens to its temperature?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases.",
          "It increases.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $ \Delta U = -W $, if the gas does work ($ W $ is positive), $ \Delta U $ must be negative. Since internal energy is proportional to temperature, the temperature drops."

          "-50,000 J",
          "50,000 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$ W = P\Delta V $. $ \Delta V = -0.004 $. $ W = 200,000 \times (-0.004) = -800\text{ J} $."
      },

          "ΔU = Q",
          "ΔU = 0",
          "ΔU = W"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an insulated system, $ Q = 0 $. Therefore, $ \Delta U = 0 - W $, or $ \Delta U = -W $. If $ W $ is negative (work on system), $ \Delta U $ is positive."
