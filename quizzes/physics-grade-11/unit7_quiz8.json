        "options": ["Turning into steam (Vaporization)", "Warming the liquid water", "Both require the same energy", "Warming the ice phase"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vaporization requires significantly more energy. Warming 1 kg of water by 100°C requires ~418,400 J, while vaporizing it requires 2,260,000 J."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two steps: 1) Condensation: 0.1 kg × 2,260,000 J/kg = 226,000 J released. 2) Cooling: 0.1 kg × 4184 J/kg·°C × 50°C = 20,920 J released. Total = 246,920 J."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, melt the ice: requires 1.0 kg × 334,000 J/kg = 334,000 J. Remaining energy = 66,000 J. This warms the water: Q = mcΔT → 66,000 J = 1.0 kg × 4184 J/kg·°C × ΔT → ΔT ≈ 15.8°C. Final state is liquid water at ~15.8°C."

          "Create new atoms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy to melt ice: 1 kg × 334,000 J/kg = 334,000 J. This energy comes from the metal: 0.5 kg × c × 300°C = 334,000 J. Solving: c = 334,000 / 150 ≈ 2227 J/kg·°C."
