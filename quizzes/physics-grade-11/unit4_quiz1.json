        "question": "A 5.0 kg cart moves at a constant velocity of 4.0 m/s. What is its momentum?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Momentum p = m × v = 5.0 kg × 4.0 m/s = 20 kg·m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A constant net force of 10 N acts on a 2.0 kg object for 5.0 seconds. What is the impulse delivered to the object?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Impulse J = F × Δt = 10 N × 5.0 s = 50 N·s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball of mass 0.50 kg initially moving at 6.0 m/s is brought to rest by a constant force over 2.0 seconds. What is the change in momentum?",
        "options": ["-3.0 kg·m/s", "0 kg·m/s", "+3.0 kg·m/s", "+12 kg·m/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Change in momentum Δp = m(v_f - v_i) = 0.50 kg × (0 - 6.0) m/s = -3.0 kg·m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hockey puck (0.17 kg) experiences a change in momentum of 8.5 kg·m/s over 0.25 seconds. What average force acted on it?",
        "options": ["2.1 N", "34 N", "50 N", "21 N"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Average force F_avg = Δp / Δt = 8.5 kg·m/s / 0.25 s = 34 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two objects have the same kinetic energy. Object A has twice the mass of Object B. How does the magnitude of momentum of A compare to B?",
        "options": ["\\(p_A = p_B\\)", "\\(p_A = 2p_B\\)", "\\(p_A = \\sqrt{2} p_B\\)", "\\(p_A = p_B / 2\\)"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From KE = p²/(2m), equal KE and m_A = 2m_B gives p_A²/(4m_B) = p_B²/(2m_B) ⇒ p_A² = 2p_B² ⇒ p_A = √2 p_B."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.10 kg stone strikes a wall at 20 m/s perpendicularly and rebounds with 15 m/s. What is the magnitude of its change in momentum?",
        "options": ["0.5 kg·m/s", "1.0 kg·m/s", "2.0 kg·m/s", "3.5 kg·m/s"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Take toward wall as positive. Δp = m(v_f - v_i) = 0.10 kg × (-15 - 20) m/s = -3.5 kg·m/s. Magnitude is 3.5 kg·m/s."

        "question": "A 4.0 kg object initially at rest receives an impulse of 32 N·s. What is its final speed?",
        "options": ["2.0 m/s", "8.0 m/s", "16 m/s", "128 m/s"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Impulse = change in momentum. J = m v_f since initial p = 0. So v_f = J/m = 32 N·s / 4.0 kg = 8.0 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1200 kg car traveling east at 10 m/s turns north and continues at 10 m/s. What is the magnitude of its change in momentum?",
        "options": ["0 kg·m/s", "12,000 kg·m/s", "6,000 kg·m/s", "17,000 kg·m/s"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "p_i = (12000, 0) kg·m/s; p_f = (0, 12000) kg·m/s. Δp = (-12000, 12000). Magnitude = √(12000² + 12000²) ≈ 16970 ≈ 17000 kg·m/s."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A truck and a car have the same momentum. If they are both stopped by the same constant braking force, which stops in a shorter distance?",
        "options": ["The truck", "The car", "Same distance", "Need more information"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stopping distance d = v²/(2a) = (p/m)² / (2F/m) = p²/(2mF). For same p and F, d ∝ 1/m. Larger mass (truck) has smaller d."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.20 kg ball hits a wall horizontally at 8.0 m/s and rebounds at 6.0 m/s at 30° from the wall. Impact lasts 0.04 s. What is the average force magnitude? (Consider only perpendicular momentum change.)",
        "options": ["20 N", "35 N", "50 N", "70 N"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Perpendicular: v_i⊥ = -8.0 m/s, v_f⊥ = +6.0 cos30° ≈ +5.196 m/s. Δp⊥ = 0.20 × (5.196 - (-8.0)) ≈ 2.639 kg·m/s. F_avg = Δp⊥/Δt ≈ 2.639/0.04 ≈ 66 N ≈ 70 N (nearest option)."
