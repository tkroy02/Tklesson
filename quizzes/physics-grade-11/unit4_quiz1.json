    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A force is BEST defined as:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "A scalar quantity measured in joules",
          "A push or pull",
          "The rate of change of velocity",
          "Mass times acceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A force is fundamentally a push or pull. Mass times acceleration is Newton's second law, not the definition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Force is a vector quantity because it has:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Only magnitude",
          "Only direction",
          "Both magnitude and direction",
          "Neither magnitude nor direction"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Vector quantities have both magnitude and direction. Force is a vector."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The SI unit of force is the newton (N). One newton equals:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "1 kg·m/s",
          "1 kg·m/s²",
          "1 m/s²",
          "1 kg"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $F = ma$, 1 N = 1 kg × 1 m/s² = 1 kg·m/s²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is a contact force?",

          "Magnetic force",
          "Electric force"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Normal force requires surfaces to be in contact. Gravity, magnetic, and electric forces act at a distance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is a field force (acts at a distance)?",

          "Friction",
          "Tension",
          "Normal force",
          "Weight (gravity)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Weight (gravity) acts at a distance without physical contact. Friction, tension, and normal force are contact forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The normal force ($N$) is:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Parallel to the surface",
          "Perpendicular to the surface",
          "Always equal to weight",
          "A type of friction"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Normal force is always perpendicular to the contact surface. It is not necessarily equal to weight."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Friction force ($f_k$) acts:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Perpendicular to the surface",
          "Parallel to the surface",
          "Along the direction of motion",
          "Only when objects are at rest"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Friction acts parallel to the surfaces in contact, opposing relative motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Tension force ($T$) in a rope always:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Pushes along the rope",
          "Pulls along the rope",
          "Acts perpendicular to the rope",
          "Equals the object's weight"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tension is a pulling force transmitted along a rope, always directed away from the object."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a book resting on a table, the FBD shows TWO forces:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Friction and tension",
          "Normal force and applied force",
          "Weight and normal force",
          "Centripetal force and gravity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Book at rest: weight downward, normal force upward. No friction, tension, or applied force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A box slides right at constant speed on rough floor. Free-Body-Diagram shows:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Net force in the rightward direction",
          "Applied force (right) = friction (left)",
          "Only friction acting (left)",
          "No horizontal forces indicated"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant speed → zero acceleration → net force = 0. Applied force to right equals friction to left."
