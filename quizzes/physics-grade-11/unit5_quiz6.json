      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a car on a flat curve, if the radius of the turn is cut in half but the speed remains the same, the friction required to keep the car on the road:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Is cut in half.",
          "Doubles.",
          "Quadruples.",
          "Stays the same."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$f_s = mv^2/r$, so $f_s \\propto 1/r$. Halving radius doubles required friction."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.1 kg ball on a string is whirled in a horizontal circle. If the string can only withstand 10 N of tension before breaking, what is the maximum speed it can have at a radius of 1 m?",

          "0.1 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$T = mv^2/r$ ⇒ $10 = 0.1v^2$ ⇒ $v^2 = 100$ ⇒ $v = 10$ m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2000 kg truck and a 1000 kg car take the same flat turn at the same speed. How does the required $\\mu_s$ for the truck compare to the car?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "The truck needs twice the $\\mu_s$.",
          "The truck needs half the $\\mu_s$.",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\mu_s = v^2/(rg)$ is independent of mass, so they need the same $\\mu_s$."

        "question": "Centrifugal force is:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "A real force acting outward in circular motion",

        "question": "A 1200 kg car rounds a flat curve of radius 50 meters at a speed of 20 meters per second. What minimum coefficient of static friction is required between the tires and road to prevent skidding? (Use $g = 9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$)",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\mu_s = v^2/(rg) = 400/(50 \\times 9.8) = 400/490 = 0.816 \\approx 0.82$."

          "The vertical component ($F_N \\cos\\theta$)",
          "The total normal force ($F_N$)",
          "The horizontal component ($F_N \\sin\\theta$)",
          "The normal force does not provide centripetal acceleration."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The horizontal component $F_N \\sin\\theta$ points toward the center and provides centripetal force."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a car exceeds the 'ideal speed' on a banked curve, in which direction must static friction act to keep the car from sliding?",
        "image": "",

          "Up the incline (away from the center)",
          "Down the incline (toward the center)",
          "Vertically upward",
          "Tangent to the direction of motion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Above ideal speed, car tends to slide up incline, so friction acts down incline (toward center)."

          "The coin moves toward the center.",
          "The coin remains stationary due to inertia.",

          "The friction coefficient increases to compensate."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Beyond this limit, friction is insufficient to provide needed centripetal force, so coin slips outward."

          "$9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$",

          "Zero.",
          "It depends on the bank angle."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
