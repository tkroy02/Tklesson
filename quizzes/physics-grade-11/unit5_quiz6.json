      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1500 kg car rounds a flat, unbanked curve with a radius of 50.0 m. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.800, what is the maximum speed the car can have without slipping?",
        "options": ["19.8 m/s", "14.0 m/s", "24.5 m/s", "39.2 m/s", "10.5 m/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On a flat curve, friction provides centripetal force: μmg = mv²/r. Solving for v: v = √(μgr) = √(0.800 * 9.80 * 50.0) = √392 ≈ 19.8 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car rounds a curve of radius R at speed V. If the radius is doubled but the speed remains the same, how does the required friction force change?",
        "options": [
          "It is halved",
          "It is doubled",
          "It is quartered",
          "It remains the same",
          "It is four times greater"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F_c = mv²/r. Since r is in the denominator, doubling the radius (2r) while keeping m and v constant results in half the required centripetal force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'ideal' banking angle for a curve with a radius of 120 m designed for a speed of 25.0 m/s so that no friction is required?",
        "options": ["28.0°", "15.0°", "32.5°", "20.2°", "45.0°"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an ideally banked curve: tan(θ) = v² / (rg). tan(θ) = (25.0²) / (120 * 9.80) = 625 / 1176 ≈ 0.531. θ = arctan(0.531) ≈ 28.0°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a banked curve, which component of the Normal Force (Fn) provides the centripetal acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "The horizontal component (Fn·sinθ)",
          "The vertical component (Fn·cosθ)",
          "The total Normal Force",
          "The component parallel to the slope",
          "There is no Normal Force component"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertical component of Fn balances gravity, while the horizontal component (pointing toward the center of the circle) provides the centripetal force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car is traveling on a flat road. If the road becomes icy and the coefficient of friction is reduced by half, the maximum safe turning speed is reduced by a factor of:",
        "options": ["√2", "2", "4", "√0.5", "No change"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since v = √(μgr), the velocity is proportional to the square root of the coefficient of friction. If μ is halved, v is reduced by 1/√2 (approx. 0.707)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1000 kg race car rounds a curve of radius 80.0 m banked at 15.0°. At what speed can it travel without needing any sideways friction?",
        "options": ["14.5 m/s", "21.0 m/s", "10.2 m/s", "18.4 m/s", "7.50 m/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "v = √(rg·tanθ). v = √(80.0 * 9.80 * tan(15°)) = √(784 * 0.2679) ≈ √210.0 ≈ 14.5 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it dangerous for a truck with a high center of mass to round a curve at high speed compared to a low-profile car?",
        "options": [
          "The truck is more likely to tip over due to torque",
          "The truck has more mass and thus needs less friction",
          "The truck's centripetal acceleration is higher",
          "Gravity acts more strongly on the truck",
          "The radius of the turn effectively decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A high center of mass creates a larger lever arm for the centrifugal 'force' (inertia) to exert a torque, potentially causing the vehicle to rotate (roll) outward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An engineer is designing a highway exit. If the design speed is doubled, how must the radius change to keep the same banking angle?",
        "options": ["It must be 4 times larger", "It must be 2 times larger", "It must be halved", "It must be 4 times smaller", "No change is needed"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "tanθ = v²/rg. If v is doubled (2v), v² becomes 4v². To keep tanθ constant, r must also increase by a factor of 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'Wall of Death' carnival ride, a motorcycle drives on a vertical wall. What force provides the Normal Force required for centripetal motion?",
        "options": [
          "The friction between tires and wall",
          "The weight of the motorcycle",
          "The speed of the motorcycle",
          "The push from the wall against the tires",
          "Tension in the frame"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Normal force (push from the wall) is the centripetal force. Friction points upward to balance gravity, preventing the bike from sliding down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a car travels too fast on an ideally banked curve (exceeding the design speed), in which direction will it tend to slide?",
        "options": ["Up the bank (outward)", "Down the bank (inward)", "Straight forward", "It won't slide", "Toward the center"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At speeds higher than the design speed, the horizontal component of the normal force is insufficient. The car's inertia causes it to move toward a larger radius (up the bank)."
