    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What was the primary objective of the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887?",
        "options": [
          "To detect the relative motion of the Earth through the luminiferous ether.",
          "To prove that light is a longitudinal pressure wave.",
          "To determine the exact mass of a photon.",
          "To observe the photoelectric effect for the first time."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The experiment aimed to measure the 'ether wind' expected as the Earth moved through a stationary medium that supposedly carried light waves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In 19th-century physics, what was the 'luminiferous ether'?",
        "options": [
          "A hypothetical medium through which light waves were thought to propagate.",
          "The gases that make up the Earth's upper atmosphere.",
          "A type of fuel used to power early light bulbs.",
          "The electromagnetic field produced by a permanent magnet."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Physicists assumed that since sound and water waves require a medium, light must also require a 'fabric' to travel through a vacuum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How did the Michelson interferometer attempt to detect the ether?",
        "options": [
          "By splitting a light beam into two perpendicular paths and looking for an interference shift.",
          "By measuring the weight of light in a vacuum chamber.",
          "By observing the change in color of light as it passed through water.",
          "By timing how long it took light to travel to the moon."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The device looked for phase differences between two beams that traveled different directions relative to the Earth's motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is meant by the 'null result' of the Michelson-Morley experiment?",
        "options": [
          "No significant shift in interference fringes was observed despite rotating the apparatus.",
          "The light source failed to produce any visible beams.",
          "The mathematical equations used equaled zero.",
          "The experiment was canceled due to lack of funding."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The expected 'fringe shift' due to the Earth's motion through the ether was absent, contradicting classical predictions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the ether existed, what should have happened when the interferometer was rotated by 90°?",
        "options": [
          "The interference pattern should have shifted slightly.",
          "The light should have changed from red to blue.",
          "The mirrors should have shattered due to wind pressure.",
          "The light beams should have merged into a single point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rotating the device would change which arm was aligned with the 'ether wind,' altering the travel time and shifting the fringes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why was the experiment performed on a massive stone slab floating in mercury?",
        "options": [
          "To eliminate vibrations and allow for smooth rotation.",
          "Because mercury is the only liquid ether cannot penetrate.",
          "To keep the light beams cool during observation.",
          "To conduct electricity through the base of the apparatus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The interferometer was so sensitive that even footsteps could ruin the pattern; the mercury pool provided stability and friction-less rotation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following was a major implication of the Michelson-Morley null result?",
        "options": [
          "The speed of light is constant in all inertial frames of reference.",
          "The Earth does not actually move around the Sun.",
          "Light cannot travel through a vacuum.",
          "Gravity is caused by the pressure of the ether."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the Earth's motion didn't change the measured speed, it suggested light speed does not depend on the observer's motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How did Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity resolve the conflict raised by this experiment?",
        "options": [
          "By postulating that light requires no medium and its speed is invariant.",
          "By proving that the ether is dragged along with the Earth.",
          "By showing that the interferometer arms were expanding.",
          "By calculating that the speed of light is infinite."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Einstein discarded the ether entirely and proposed that 'c' is a universal constant for all observers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Michelson-Morley experiment is called 'the most famous failed experiment.' Why is it considered a success?",
        "options": [
          "It disproved a fundamental incorrect assumption, paving the way for modern physics.",
          "It was the first experiment to cost over a million dollars.",
          "It successfully measured the ether wind at night.",
          "It resulted in the first Nobel Prize for a US scientist."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By proving the ether didn't exist, it forced physicists to rethink space and time, leading directly to Relativity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the interferometer, what is the role of the half-silvered mirror (beam splitter)?",
        "options": [
          "To divide the incident light into two separate paths at right angles.",
          "To filter out all colors of light except for yellow.",
          "To increase the speed of the light beam.",
          "To absorb the ether wind."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It allows half the light to pass through and reflects the other half, creating the two 'legs' of the experiment."
