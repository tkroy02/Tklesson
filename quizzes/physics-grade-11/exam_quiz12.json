        "explanation": "The observer hears a higher frequency ($440 > 400$), which means the source is approaching. Using the Doppler formula for a moving source approaching a stationary observer: $f' = f\\left(\\frac{v}{v - v_s}\\right)$. Plugging in: $440 = 400\\left(\\frac{340}{340 - v_s}\\right)$. Solving: $440/400 = 340/(340 - v_s) \\Rightarrow 1.1 = 340/(340 - v_s) \\Rightarrow 340 - v_s = 340/1.1 \\approx 309.1 \\Rightarrow v_s \\approx 30.9\\,\\text{m/s}$."
