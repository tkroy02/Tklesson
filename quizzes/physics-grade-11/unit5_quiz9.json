      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid cylinder (I = 0.5 mr²) of mass 2.0 kg and radius 0.1 m rotates at 10 rad/s. What is its rotational kinetic energy?",
        "options": ["0.5 J", "1.0 J", "2.0 J", "5.0 J", "10.0 J"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "I = 0.5 * 2.0 * (0.1)² = 0.01 kg·m². K_rot = 0.5 * I * ω² = 0.5 * 0.01 * 10² = 0.5 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wheel requires 50 J of work to be done on it to reach an angular velocity of 5.0 rad/s from rest. What is the moment of inertia of the wheel?",
        "options": ["4.0 kg·m²", "2.0 kg·m²", "10.0 kg·m²", "25.0 kg·m²", "0.5 kg·m²"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work = ΔK_rot. 50 = 0.5 * I * (5.0)². 50 = 12.5 * I. I = 50 / 12.5 = 4.0 kg·m²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is rolling without slipping, its total kinetic energy is the sum of:",
        "options": [
          "Translational and Rotational kinetic energy",
          "Translational and Potential energy",
          "Rotational and Gravitational energy",
          "Centripetal and Tangential energy",
          "Momentum and Torque"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rolling involves both the motion of the center of mass (translational) and the spinning about the center (rotational)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A constant torque of 20 N·m is applied to a wheel as it rotates through 3.0 radians. How much work is done on the wheel?",
        "options": ["60 J", "6.67 J", "23 J", "120 J", "17 J"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work (W) = Torque (τ) * Angular Displacement (θ). W = 20 * 3.0 = 60 J."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hoop and a disk of same mass and radius are released from rest at the top of an incline. Which has more rotational kinetic energy at the bottom?",
        "options": [
          "The hoop",
          "The disk",
          "Both have the same",
          "The one with the higher velocity",
          "Neither has rotational energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hoop has a larger moment of inertia (I = mr² vs I = 0.5mr²), meaning a larger fraction of its initial potential energy is converted to rotational energy compared to the disk."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the angular velocity of a spinning fly-wheel is tripled, by what factor does its rotational kinetic energy increase?",
        "options": ["9", "3", "6", "27", "1.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "K_rot is proportional to ω². (3ω)² = 9ω²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object has a moment of inertia of 2.0 kg·m² and a rotational kinetic energy of 100 J. What is its angular momentum?",
        "options": ["20 kg·m²/s", "10 kg·m²/s", "40 kg·m²/s", "200 kg·m²/s", "50 kg·m²/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "K_rot = L² / (2I). 100 = L² / (2 * 2.0) → 100 = L² / 4 → L² = 400 → L = 20 kg·m²/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the rotational kinetic energy of a figure skater if she pulls her arms in, decreasing her moment of inertia by half while conserving angular momentum?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles",
          "It is halved",
          "It stays the same",
          "It increases by 4",
          "It decreases by 4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "L is constant. K_rot = L²/(2I). If I becomes I/2, K_rot becomes L²/(2*(I/2)), which is 2 * (L²/2I). Work done by her muscles increases the energy."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sphere rolling at 5 m/s has a translational kinetic energy of 50 J. If its rotational energy is 20 J, what is its total kinetic energy?",
        "options": ["70 J", "30 J", "100 J", "50 J", "10 J"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total K = K_trans + K_rot = 50 J + 20 J = 70 J."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work = Torque (N·m) * angle (unitless radians). Thus, 1 J = 1 N·m."
