          "5.6 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$v_b^2 = v_t^2 + 4gr = 16 + 40 = 56$, $v_b = \\sqrt{56} = 7.48 \\approx 7.5$ m/s."

        ],

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Weight $\\propto 1/r^2$, so doubling distance reduces weight to $1/4$."
