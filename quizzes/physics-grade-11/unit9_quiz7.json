    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary function of a capacitor?",
        "options": [
          "To store electric charge and electrical potential energy.",
          "To increase the total current in a circuit.",
          "To convert electrical energy into heat.",
          "To generate a constant voltage like a battery."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capacitors store energy within an electric field created between two conductive plates. Unlike resistors, they do not dissipate energy as heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor if the area of the plates is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "The capacitance doubles.",
          "The capacitance is halved.",
          "The capacitance quadruples.",
          "The capacitance remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capacitance (C) is directly proportional to the plate area (A). Doubling the area provides more space for charge accumulation, thus doubling the capacitance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the distance between the plates of a capacitor is increased, the capacitance will:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease.",
          "Increase.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Become zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capacitance is inversely proportional to the separation distance (d). Increasing the distance weakens the electric field for a given voltage, reducing the capacity to store charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Farad (F) is the SI unit for capacitance. One Farad is equivalent to:",
        "options": [
          "1 Coulomb per Volt (C/V)",
          "1 Joule per Coulomb (J/C)",
          "1 Newton per Coulomb (N/C)",
          "1 Volt-Ampere (V·A)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Based on the formula C = Q/V, one Farad represents the ability to store one Coulomb of charge per one Volt of potential difference."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of inserting a dielectric (insulating material) between capacitor plates?",
        "options": [
          "To increase the capacitance of the device.",
          "To allow current to flow between the plates.",
          "To decrease the voltage limit of the capacitor.",
          "To reduce the physical size of the plates."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dielectrics polarize in an electric field, creating an opposing field that reduces the overall potential difference for a given charge, effectively increasing capacitance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Once a capacitor is fully charged and remains connected to a DC battery, the current in the circuit is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero.",
          "At its maximum value.",
          "Constantly increasing.",
          "Alternating back and forth."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the potential difference across the capacitor equals the battery voltage, equilibrium is reached and no further charge flows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A dielectric constant (κ) is always:",
        "options": [
          "Greater than or equal to 1.",
          "Less than 1.",
          "Measured in Farads.",
          "Equal to the charge stored."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The dielectric constant is a dimensionless ratio of C_material / C_vacuum. Since vacuum is 1 and other insulators increase capacitance, it is always ≥ 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the energy in a capacitor actually stored?",
        "options": [
          "In the electric field between the plates.",
          "Inside the metal of the plates.",
          "In the battery that charged it.",
          "In the wires connecting the circuit."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy is stored in the organization of the electric field within the gap between the plates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a capacitor is disconnected from a battery and then the plates are pulled further apart, what happens to the charge (Q) on the plates?",
        "options": [
          "It remains the same.",
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to the Law of Conservation of Charge, if there is no conductive path for electrons to leave, the total charge remains constant despite physical movements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical change would result in a DECREASE in capacitance?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing the area of the plates.",
          "Decreasing the distance between the plates.",
          "Inserting a material with a high dielectric constant.",
          "Increasing the voltage of the battery."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reducing the area (A) reduces the 'room' available for charge, decreasing capacitance. Note that changing voltage does not change the physical capacitance value."
