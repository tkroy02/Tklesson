    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical positive charges 'q' exert a force 'F' on each other. If the charge of one is doubled and the distance between them is doubled, what is the new force?",
        "options": [
          "0.5 F",
          "F",
          "2 F",
          "0.25 F"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F = k(q1*q2)/r². Doubling one charge (2q) and doubling distance (2r)² results in 2/4 = 0.5 of the original force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding the electric field inside a hollow conductor in electrostatic equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "The electric field is zero.",
          "The electric field is uniform and non-zero.",
          "The electric field depends on the amount of charge on the outside.",
          "The electric field is strongest at the center."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Gauss's Law and the properties of conductors, all excess charge resides on the surface, making the internal electric field zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much work is required to move a 2.0 C charge through a potential difference of 12 V?",
        "options": [
          "24 J",
          "6 J",
          "0.16 J",
          "14 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work (W) = qV. Therefore, 2.0 C * 12 V = 24 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A capacitor is charged and then disconnected from the battery. If the plates are then pulled further apart, what happens to the voltage across the plates?",
        "options": [
          "The voltage increases.",
          "The voltage decreases.",
          "The voltage remains the same.",
          "The voltage drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since Q is constant (disconnected) and C decreases (d increases), V must increase to satisfy V = Q/C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A circuit consists of a battery and two resistors in parallel. If a third resistor is added in parallel, what happens to the total current leaving the battery?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "The voltage of the battery decreases instead."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding a resistor in parallel reduces the equivalent resistance of the circuit, which increases the total current drawn from the source."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a complex circuit, a junction has 5A and 3A entering it. If there is only one exit path, what is the current in that path?",
        "options": [
          "8 A",
          "2 A",
          "4 A",
          "15 A"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kirchhoff's Junction Rule states current in = current out. 5A + 3A = 8A."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the shape of the magnetic field lines around a long, straight current-carrying wire?",
        "options": [
          "Concentric circles.",
          "Straight lines pointing away from the wire.",
          "Straight lines pointing toward the wire.",
          "Hyperbolic curves."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the first Right-Hand Rule, the magnetic field forms closed circular loops centered on the wire."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An alpha particle (positive) enters a magnetic field and follows a circular path. If an electron enters the same field with the same velocity, how will its path differ?",
        "options": [
          "It will curve in the opposite direction with a smaller radius.",
          "It will curve in the opposite direction with a larger radius.",
          "It will curve in the same direction with a smaller radius.",
          "It will move in a straight line."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The opposite charge sign reverses the direction of the force (RHR). The smaller mass of the electron results in a much smaller radius (r = mv/qB)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wire experiences a magnetic force 'F'. If the current is doubled and the magnetic field strength is tripled, what is the new force?",
        "options": [
          "6 F",
          "5 F",
          "1.5 F",
          "2 F"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F = BIL. Doubling I (2I) and tripling B (3B) results in a factor of 2 * 3 = 6."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Ammeter",
          "Voltmeter",
          "Ohmmeter",
          "Galvanometer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ammeters have very low resistance and must be in series to capture the full flow of charge."
