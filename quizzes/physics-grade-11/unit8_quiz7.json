    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on the provided graph, how many complete wavelengths are shown between point O and point J?",
        "image": "images/11wave.png",
        "options": [
          "2.0 wavelengths",
          "1.75 wavelengths",
          "1.5 wavelengths",
          "2.5 wavelengths"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The wave completes one full cycle at point W and a second full cycle at point J, where the displacement returns to zero after the second trough."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which distance on the Y-axis represents the amplitude of the wave?",
        "image": "images/11wave.png",
        "options": [
          "The distance from O to Q",
          "The distance from Q to S",
          "The distance from O to T",
          "The distance from S to V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amplitude is defined as the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position (the X-axis). This is represented by the vertical distance O-Q (or O-S in magnitude)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following points are currently at their maximum downward acceleration?",

        "options": [
          "T and X",
          "V and Z",
          "U and Y",
          "O and W"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In SHM/Waves, acceleration is greatest at maximum displacement but in the opposite direction. At the crests (T and X), the restoring force and acceleration are at their maximum magnitude pointing downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the total horizontal distance from O to J is 20 meters, what is the wavelength of this wave?",

        "options": [
          "10 meters",
          "20 meters",
          "5 meters",
          "40 meters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since there are 2 full wavelengths between O and J, the wavelength (λ) is the total distance divided by the number of cycles: 20m / 2 = 10m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair of points are exactly 180 degrees (or π radians) out of phase?",

          "T and V",
          "T and X",
          "O and W",
          "U and Y"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Points are 180° out of phase when they are at opposite displacements. T is a crest and V is a trough."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the point V represent on this transverse wave?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A trough is the point of maximum negative displacement on a transverse wave."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If this wave is moving to the right, what will be the immediate motion of the particle currently at point U?",

          "Moving upward",
          "Moving downward",
          "Moving to the right",
          "Remaining stationary"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the wave moves right, the crest to the left of U (Point T) will move toward U, causing the particle at U to move upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "T and X"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium positions are where the displacement y = 0. These are the points where the wave crosses the X-axis."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The distance between point T and point X is equal to:",
