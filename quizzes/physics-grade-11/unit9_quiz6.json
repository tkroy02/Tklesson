      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system consists of three +2.0 μC charges placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle with sides of 0.50 m. What is the total electric potential energy of the system?",
        "options": [
          "0.216 J",
          "0.072 J",
          "0.144 J",
          "0.432 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total energy is the sum of energy for each unique pair. There are 3 pairs. Each pair interaction is U = kq²/r = (9e9 * 4e-12) / 0.5 = 0.072 J. Total = 3 * 0.072 = 0.216 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a positive charge is released from rest in a uniform electric field, it will move toward a region of:",
        "options": [
          "Lower electric potential and lower potential energy.",
          "Higher electric potential and higher potential energy.",
          "Lower electric potential but higher potential energy.",
          "Zero electric field."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Positive charges spontaneously move from high to low potential. Since U = qV, moving to a lower V results in a lower U for a positive charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An alpha particle (charge +2e, mass 6.64 x 10^-27 kg) is accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 2.0 x 10^6 V. What is its final kinetic energy in Joules?",
        "options": [
          "6.4 x 10^-13 J",
          "3.2 x 10^-13 J",
          "4.0 x 10^6 J",
          "1.3 x 10^-15 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "K = qΔV. An alpha particle has charge 2e = 3.2e-19 C. Thus, K = (3.2e-19) * (2.0e6) = 6.4e-13 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two points, A and B, are in a uniform electric field of 250 N/C. Point B is 0.20 m downstream from A. What is the potential difference Vb - Va?",

          "-50 V",
          "+50 V",
          "-1250 V",
          "0 V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔV = -Ed. Since the move is in the direction of the field, potential drops: -(250 N/C * 0.20 m) = -50 V."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the electric potential energy of a system of two opposite charges as they are pulled further apart?",
        "options": [
          "It increases (becomes less negative).",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It becomes zero immediately."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Opposite charges have negative potential energy. As they separate, U moves from a large negative value toward zero, which is a mathematical increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A +5.0 nC charge is moved from a point where the potential is 20 V to a point where the potential is 80 V. What is the change in its potential energy?",
        "options": [
          "3.0 x 10^-7 J",
          "4.0 x 10^-7 J",
          "300 J",
          "-3.0 x 10^-7 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔU = qΔV = (5.0e-9 C) * (80 V - 20 V) = 5.0e-9 * 60 = 3.0e-7 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical charges +Q are separated by distance d. If a third charge -Q is placed at the midpoint, the total potential energy is:",
        "options": [
          "-3kQ²/d",
          "-4kQ²/d",
          "0 J",
          "-kQ²/d"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Interaction of (Q, Q) = kQ²/d. Interactions of (Q, -Q) at distance d/2 = -2kQ²/d each. Total = kQ²/d - 2kQ²/d - 2kQ²/d = -3kQ²/d."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Inside a hollow isolated conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric potential is:",
        "options": [
          "Constant and equal to the potential at the surface.",
          "Zero.",
          "Highest at the center.",
          "Decreasing toward the center."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since E = 0 inside, no work is done moving a charge from the surface to the center, meaning the potential must be constant throughout the volume."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.0 kg object with a charge of +0.5 C moves from 100 V to 20 V. What is its change in speed? (No other forces).",

          "It increases by 6.3 m/s.",
          "It increases by 40 m/s.",
          "It decreases by 6.3 m/s.",
          "It increases by 8.9 m/s."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔK = -qΔV = -(0.5 * -80) = 40 J. 1/2 mv² = 40 -> 1/2 (2)v² = 40 -> v = sqrt(40) ≈ 6.32 m/s."
