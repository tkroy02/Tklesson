        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "400 W = 0.4 kW. Daily energy = 0.4 kW × 5 h = 2.0 kWh."

        "options": ["17.5 kWh", "12.0 kWh", "22.4 kWh", "30.0 kWh"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heater: 1.5 kW × 3 = 4.5 kWh. Bulb: 0.1 kW × 10 = 1.0 kWh. Fridge: 0.5 kW × 24 = 12.0 kWh. Total = 4.5 + 1.0 + 12.0 = 17.5 kWh."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wind turbine rated at 2.0 MW operates at 40% capacity over a full day. How many kWh does it generate in 24 hours?",
        "options": ["19,200 kWh", "9,600 kWh", "48,000 kWh", "2,000 kWh"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average power = 0.40 × 2000 kW = 800 kW. Daily energy = 800 kW × 24 h = 19,200 kWh."

        "question": "A 70 kg student climbs stairs rising 4.0 m in 5.2 s. What is the student's average power output in watts?",
        "options": ["≈ 528 W", "≈ 274 W", "≈ 137 W", "≈ 1056 W"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work = mgh = 70 × 9.8 × 4.0 = 2744 J. Power = Work/time = 2744 J / 5.2 s ≈ 528 W."

        "question": "A diesel generator is 35% efficient and needs to produce 15 kWh of electrical energy. Diesel has an energy density of 38 MJ/L. How many liters are consumed?",
        "options": ["≈ 4.06 L", "≈ 2.84 L", "≈ 6.32 L", "≈ 11.4 L"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "15 kWh = 54 MJ. Thermal energy needed = 54 / 0.35 ≈ 154.3 MJ. Diesel volume = 154.3 / 38 ≈ 4.06 L."
