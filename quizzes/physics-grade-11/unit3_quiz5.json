        "question": "A ball is launched horizontally from a cliff with speed $v_0$. Ignoring air resistance, which statement about its initial motion is most accurate?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "It has no velocity at launch but immediately starts accelerating downward.",
          "It has only horizontal velocity at launch and no vertical velocity component.",
          "It has both horizontal and vertical velocity components at launch.",
          "It has only vertical velocity at launch but gains horizontal velocity later."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Horizontal launch means initial velocity is purely horizontal; vertical velocity starts at zero."

        "question": "A student claims: 'If I double the horizontal launch speed from a given height, the time of flight will double.' Which statement best evaluates this claim?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "The claim is correct because the projectile covers twice the distance in the same time.",
          "The claim is incorrect because time of flight depends only on vertical motion.",
          "The claim is correct only if air resistance is very large.",
