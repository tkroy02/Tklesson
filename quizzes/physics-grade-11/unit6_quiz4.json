    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid cube is floating in a container of liquid. If the density of the cube is exactly 75% of the density of the liquid, what portion of the cube's volume is visible above the surface?",
        "options": [
          "25%",
          "75%",
          "100%",
          "0%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the object's density is 0.75 times the fluid's density, 75% is submerged, leaving the remaining 25% above the surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is weighed in air and then weighed while completely submerged in water. If the weight in air is 10 N and the apparent weight in water is 6 N, what is the magnitude of the buoyant force?",
        "options": [
          "16 N",
          "6 N",
          "4 N",
          "10 N"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The buoyant force is the difference between the weight in air and the apparent weight in the fluid (10 N - 6 N = 4 N)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two spheres of the same volume, one made of lead and one made of aluminum, are both fully submerged in a tank of oil. Which statement regarding the buoyant force (Fb) is correct?",
        "options": [
          "Fb is greater on the lead sphere",
          "Fb is greater on the aluminum sphere",
          "Fb is the same for both spheres",
          "Fb is zero for both because they are solids"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since both spheres have the same volume and are fully submerged, they displace the same weight of oil. Buoyant force depends on the volume of fluid displaced, not the mass of the object."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A boat moves from a freshwater lake into the saltwater of the ocean. Saltwater is denser than freshwater. How does the buoyant force acting on the boat change?",
        "options": [
          "It increases",
          "It decreases",
          "It remains the same",
          "It becomes double"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a floating object, the buoyant force must always equal the object's weight. Because the boat's weight doesn't change, the buoyant force remains the same; the boat simply sits higher in the denser saltwater."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is 'neutrally buoyant' in a liquid, what does this imply about the object's density (ρ_obj) relative to the liquid's density (ρ_liq)?",
        "options": [
          "ρ_obj > ρ_liq",
          "ρ_obj < ρ_liq",
          "ρ_obj = ρ_liq",
          "ρ_obj = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Neutral buoyancy occurs when the weight of the object and the buoyant force are equal, which happens when their densities match exactly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An irregularly shaped piece of metal with a volume of 0.002 m³ is submerged in water (density = 1000 kg/m³). Calculate the buoyant force acting on it using g = 9.8 m/s².",
        "options": [
          "19.6 N",
          "1.96 N",
          "20 N",
          "196 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Applying Fb = ρ * V * g, we get 1000 kg/m³ * 0.002 m³ * 9.8 m/s² = 19.6 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyant force on a submerged object is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "The weight of the object itself",
          "The weight of the fluid displaced by the object",
          "The mass of the fluid displaced by the object",
          "The density of the fluid multiplied by the object's mass"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is the fundamental definition of Archimedes' Principle: the upward force equals the weight of the fluid that the object pushes out of the way."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5 kg wooden log is floating in a pond. What is the magnitude of the buoyant force acting on the log? (Use g = 9.8 m/s²)",
        "options": [
          "5 N",
          "49 N",
          "0 N",
          "9.8 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a floating object, the buoyant force equals the gravitational weight (m * g), which is 5 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 49 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the buoyant force on a stone as it sinks deeper and deeper into a lake (assuming the water density is uniform)?",
        "options": [
          "It increases because pressure increases",
          "It decreases because the stone moves further from the surface",
          "It remains constant",
          "It fluctuates based on the stone's speed"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since the volume of the stone and the density of the water do not change with depth, the weight of the displaced water remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balloon is filled with a gas that is less dense than the surrounding air. Why does it rise?",
        "options": [
          "The buoyant force is greater than the gravitational force",
          "The gas inside has no mass",
          "The air pressure above the balloon is higher than below it",
          "Magnetic repulsion from the Earth's surface"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the displaced air weighs more than the gas inside the balloon, the net force is directed upward, causing it to rise."
