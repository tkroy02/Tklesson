        "question": "A 2.0 m long wire carries a current of 5.0 A through a 0.40 T magnetic field. If the wire is perpendicular to the field, what is the magnitude of the magnetic force?",
        "options": [
          "4.0 N",
          "0.4 N",
          "20 N",
          "1.0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using F = BIL: (0.40 T) * (5.0 A) * (2.0 m) = 4.0 N."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A horizontal wire carries a current toward the right. It is placed in a magnetic field directed into the page. What is the direction of the magnetic force on the wire?",
        "options": [
          "Toward the top of the page.",
          "Toward the bottom of the page.",
          "Into the page.",
          "Toward the left."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the RHR: Thumb points right (current), fingers point into the page (field). The palm faces the top of the page (force)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under which orientation will a current-carrying wire experience the MAXIMUM magnetic force?",
        "options": [
          "The wire is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines.",
          "The wire is parallel to the magnetic field lines.",
          "The wire is at a 45° angle to the field lines.",
          "The wire is curved into a circle."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maximum force occurs when the wire is perpendicular (90°) because sin(90°) = 1. If parallel (0°), the force is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the current through a wire is doubled and the external magnetic field is halved, what happens to the force on the wire?",
        "options": [
          "The force remains the same.",
          "The force doubles.",
          "The force is quadrupled.",
          "The force is halved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since F ∝ BIL, doubling current (2I) and halving the field (0.5B) results in 2 * 0.5 = 1, keeping the force constant."

          "0.025 T",
          "36 T",
          "1.2 T"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "B = F / (IL). First, convert 15 cm to 0.15 m. B = 3.0 N / (8.0 A * 0.15 m) = 3.0 / 1.2 = 2.5 T."

        "question": "Two parallel wires carry current in the SAME direction. What is the nature of the magnetic force between them?",
        "options": [
          "They attract each other.",
          "They repel each other.",
          "There is no force between them.",
          "They twist to become perpendicular."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wires with parallel currents attract; wires with anti-parallel (opposite) currents repel."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vertical wire carries current downward. If the magnetic field is directed toward the East, what is the direction of the force?",

          "South",
          "North",
          "West",
          "Upward"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using RHR: Thumb points Down, fingers point Right (East). The palm points toward you, which corresponds to South."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The force on a wire is 10 N when it is perpendicular to a field. What is the force if the wire is rotated to an angle of 30° to the field?",

          "5.0 N",
          "8.66 N",

          "0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F = F_max * sin(θ). 10 N * sin(30°) = 10 * 0.5 = 5.0 N."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wire of length L carries current I. If it is formed into a coil with N turns, the total force on the coil in a uniform field is:",
        "options": [
          "Proportional to the number of turns N.",
          "Independent of the number of turns.",
          "Inversely proportional to N.",
          "Always zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each turn adds another length of wire L into the field, so total force = N * BIL."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which device primarily relies on the magnetic force acting on a current-carrying wire to function?",
