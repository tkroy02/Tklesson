        "question": "When adding vectors graphically using the head-to-tail method, the resultant vector is drawn from:",
        "options": [
          "Head of first to head of last",
          "Tail of first to tail of last",
          "Tail of first to head of last",
          "Head of first to tail of last"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the head-to-tail method, you place vectors sequentially, then draw the resultant from the tail of the first to the head of the last."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Forces in the same direction add directly: 5 N + 12 N = 17 N east."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two forces act on an object: 8 N north and 6 N south. The resultant force is:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For perpendicular vectors, R = √(A² + B²) = √(6² + 8²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10 units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hiker walks 10 km east, then 10 km south. The direction of the resultant displacement is:",

          "Two 5 N forces at 180° to each other"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Same direction gives maximum addition: 5 + 5 = 10 N. Perpendicular gives √(25+25) = 7.07 N. Opposite gives 0 N."
