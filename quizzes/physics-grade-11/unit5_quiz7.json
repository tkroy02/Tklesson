      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 4.00 kg picture is hung by two wires. Each wire makes an angle of 30.0° with the horizontal. What is the tension in each wire?",
        "options": ["39.2 N", "19.6 N", "22.6 N", "78.4 N", "11.3 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total weight = 4.00 * 9.80 = 39.2 N. Each wire supports half the weight vertically (19.6 N). Using Ty = T sin(θ): 19.6 = T sin(30°). T = 19.6 / 0.5 = 39.2 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 10.0 kg sign is supported by two cables. If the angle between the cables and the ceiling is increased (made closer to vertical), what happens to the tension in the cables?",
        "options": [
          "Tension decreases",
          "Tension increases",
          "Tension stays the same",
          "Tension becomes zero",
          "Tension equals weight"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the angle with the horizontal increases toward 90°, sin(θ) increases. Since T = (mg/2) / sin(θ), a larger denominator results in a smaller tension."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 20.0 kg mass is suspended by two ropes. Rope 1 is at 45° to the horizontal and Rope 2 is at 45° to the horizontal. What is the total vertical force provided by the ropes?",
        "options": ["196 N", "98.0 N", "138 N", "277 N", "392 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In vertical equilibrium, the sum of upward forces must equal the weight. Fg = 20.0 * 9.80 = 196 N. Therefore, the ropes must provide exactly 196 N of upward force combined."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A clothesline is pulled almost perfectly horizontal. When a heavy wet shirt is hung in the middle, why is it impossible for the line to remain perfectly horizontal?",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal string has no vertical component to balance weight",
          "The tension would have to be infinite",
          "The shirt increases the mass of the Earth",
          "Gravity only acts on vertical strings",
          "A and B are both correct"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "If θ = 0°, sin(0) = 0. To support any weight, T = (mg/2) / sin(θ). As θ approaches 0, T approaches infinity. There must be some 'sag' to provide a vertical component."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5.00 kg light fixture is held by two wires. Wire A is at 60° to the horizontal and Wire B is at 30° to the horizontal. Which wire is under greater tension?",
        "options": [
          "Wire A (steeper)",
          "Wire B (shallower)",
          "Tensions are equal",
          "Wire B, because it is longer",
          "It depends on the length of the wires"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In asymmetric setups, the steeper wire (the one closer to vertical) carries more of the load. This is confirmed by solving the simultaneous ΣFx and ΣFy equations."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 50.0 N crate is held by two ropes. Rope 1 pulls at 40.0° above the horizontal to the left. Rope 2 pulls horizontally to the right. What is the tension in Rope 1?",
        "options": ["77.8 N", "50.0 N", "65.3 N", "32.1 N", "42.0 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only Rope 1 has a vertical component. T1 sin(40°) = 50.0 N. T1 = 50.0 / sin(40°) = 50.0 / 0.6428 ≈ 77.8 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Referring to the previous question, what is the tension in Rope 2 (the horizontal rope)?",
        "options": ["59.6 N", "77.8 N", "50.0 N", "38.5 N", "0 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For horizontal equilibrium, T2 = T1 cos(40°). T2 = 77.8 * cos(40°) = 77.8 * 0.766 ≈ 59.6 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A traffic light (mass m) is suspended by two wires at equal angles θ to the horizontal. What is the tension in each wire?",
        "options": [
          "mg / (2 sinθ)",
          "mg / sinθ",
          "mg cosθ",
          "2mg / sinθ",
          "mg / (2 cosθ)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "2T sinθ = mg is the sum of vertical forces. Solving for T gives mg / (2 sinθ)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a symmetric system with two wires at 45°, if the tension in each wire is 100 N, what is the mass of the object being held?",
        "options": ["14.4 kg", "20.4 kg", "10.2 kg", "7.20 kg", "100 kg"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "mg = 2T sin(45°) = 2 * 100 * 0.707 = 141.4 N. m = 141.4 / 9.80 ≈ 14.4 kg."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is held by two wires and one wire is cut, what happens to the instantaneous vertical acceleration of the object?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes non-zero (directed downward)",
          "It remains zero",
          "It becomes non-zero (directed upward)",
          "It depends on the remaining angle",
          "The object rotates but does not fall"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cutting a wire breaks the equilibrium (ΣF is no longer 0). Gravity will exceed the upward component of the remaining tension, causing downward acceleration."
