      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which term describes energy that is specifically in the process of moving from a high-temperature object to a low-temperature object?",
        "options": [
          "Thermal Energy",
          "Temperature",
          "Heat",
          "Internal Energy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Heat is defined as energy in transit. Once the energy is 'inside' the object, we call it thermal or internal energy."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "K = °C + 273.15. Therefore, 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you have 100 grams of water at 20°C and 200 grams of water at 20°C, which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "The 200g sample has a higher temperature.",
          "The 200g sample has more thermal energy.",
          "Both samples have the same heat.",
          "The 100g sample has more kinetic energy per molecule."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "They have the same temperature (average energy), but the larger mass has more total thermal energy."

          "37°C",
          "15°C",
          "100°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "°C = (°F - 32) * 5/9. (68 - 32) = 36. 36 * 5/9 = 20°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is there a theoretical upper limit to temperature?",
        "options": [
          "No, energy can be added infinitely.",
          "Yes, it is the boiling point of the densest element.",
          "Yes, the Planck Temperature (approx. 10³² K).",
          "Yes, it is the temperature of the surface of the Sun."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While there is no practical limit we can reach, the Planck Temperature is the theoretical limit where the laws of physics as we understand them cease to function."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what temperature are the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales numericaly equal?",

          "32",
          "-40"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Plugging -40 into the formula: (-40 * 9/5) + 32 = -72 + 32 = -40."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A scientist measures a sample at 0 K. What is the state of molecular motion at this temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Molecules are moving at their maximum speed.",
          "Molecules are vibrating slightly.",
          "Molecules have reached their minimum possible motion.",
          "Molecules have disappeared."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Absolute zero is the point where translational kinetic energy is at its absolute minimum (theoretically zero)."

        "question": "Which of these is a measure of the 'intensity' of heat, rather than the 'quantity' of heat?",
        "options": [
          "Thermal Energy",
          "Joule",
          "Temperature",
          "Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Temperature measures intensity (how fast particles move); thermal energy measures quantity (how much total energy is present)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the temperature of a substance if you double its thermal energy but also double its mass?",
        "options": [
          "The temperature doubles.",
          "The temperature is halved.",
          "The temperature remains the same.",
          "The temperature quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since temperature is average energy per particle, doubling both the energy and the number of particles leaves the average unchanged."
