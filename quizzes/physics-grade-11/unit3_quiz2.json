        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Initial PE = mgh = 2 × 10 × 15 = 300 J. Final PE after bounce = 2 × 10 × 9 = 180 J. Energy lost as heat = 300 − 180 = 120 J."

        "question": "A simple pendulum of mass 0.2 kg is pulled aside so its bob is 0.8 m above its lowest point. It is released, and at the lowest point its speed is 3 m/s instead of the ideal 4 m/s. How much energy was lost as heat due to air resistance? (Use g = 10 m/s²)",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Initial PE = mgh = 0.2 × 10 × 0.8 = 1.6 J. Actual KE = 0.5 × 0.2 × 3² = 0.9 J. Heat loss = 1.6 − 0.9 = 0.7 J."

          "0 J, because speed is constant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At constant speed, friction = 40 N opposite motion. Work against friction = 40 × 5 = 200 J. This energy is dissipated as heat."
