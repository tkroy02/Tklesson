    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a head-on elastic collision between two identical billiard balls where one is initially at rest, what happens after the collision?",
        "options": [
          "They both move forward at half the initial speed",
          "The moving ball stops, and the stationary ball moves with the initial velocity of the first",
          "Both balls come to a complete stop",
          "The first ball bounces backward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a 1D elastic collision of equal masses, the striking ball stops, and the struck ball moves forward with the striker's original velocity. This results from conservation of momentum and kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person standing on a frictionless ice surface throws a heavy ball forward. What happens to the person?",
        "options": [
          "They move forward with the ball",
          "They remain stationary",
          "They fall down but do not move horizontally",
          "They move backward"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Momentum is conserved in the isolated system. To give the ball forward momentum, the person must gain an equal amount of backward momentum, causing them to move backward on the frictionless ice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the velocity of an object, what happens to its momentum?",
        "options": [
          "It stays the same",
          "It increases by a factor of √2",
          "It doubles",
          "It quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Momentum p = m*v. If velocity v doubles (and mass m is constant), momentum p also doubles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy and momentum of an object would have the same magnitude if:",
        "options": [
          "its velocity is 2 m/s",
          "its velocity is 4 m/s",
          "its mass is 2 kg",
          "its mass is 4 kg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kinetic energy (in joules) is KE = ½mv². Momentum (in kg·m/s) is p = mv. For them to have the same numerical magnitude: ½mv² = mv → ½v = 1 → v = 2 m/s. This holds regardless of mass (provided m ≠ 0)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An egg dropped onto a tiled floor breaks, but an egg dropped from the same height onto a pillow does not. Why?",
        "options": [
          "The floor exerts a greater impulse",
          "The pillow increases the time of impact, reducing the force",
          "The pillow reduces the impulse",
          "The pillow absorbs the momentum"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The change in momentum (impulse) is the same in both cases (same mass, same velocity change). The pillow increases the stopping time (Δt). Since Impulse = F_avg * Δt, a larger Δt results in a smaller average force (F_avg), preventing the eggshell from breaking."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is it possible for a system of two objects to have zero total momentum even if both objects are moving?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, if they are moving in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitudes",
          "Only if the collision is elastic",
          "Only if the objects have the same mass",
          "No, if they are moving, they must have total momentum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Momentum is a vector. If two objects have equal mass and speed but move in opposite directions, their momentum vectors sum to zero. More generally, total momentum is zero if m₁v⃗₁ + m₂v⃗₂ = 0, regardless of whether masses are equal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system consists of two blocks on a frictionless surface. If they are pushed apart by a spring, what is true about the total momentum after the spring is released?",
        "options": [
          "It is equal to the potential energy of the spring",
          "It increases in the direction of the lighter block",
          "It remains zero (the same as before release)",
          "It increases in the direction of the heavier block"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The spring force is internal to the system (blocks+spring). With no external horizontal forces on the frictionless surface, the total horizontal momentum of the system is conserved. Since it starts at zero, it remains zero after release—the blocks move apart with equal and opposite momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the area under a Force vs. Time (F-t) graph represent?",
        "options": [
          "Power",
          "Work",
          "Acceleration",
          "Impulse"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Impulse is defined as the product of average force and time (J = F_avg * Δt). Graphically, this is the area under the Force vs. Time curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a real-world collision between two cars, kinetic energy is usually not conserved. Where does the 'lost' kinetic energy go?",
        "options": [
          "It is converted into extra momentum",
          "It stays in the engine of the cars",
          "It is destroyed during the impact",
          "It is transformed into sound, heat, and deformation energy"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Energy is conserved but changes form. In inelastic collisions, some kinetic energy is transformed (not destroyed) into other forms: sound waves, thermal energy (heat), and the energy required to permanently deform the car bodies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which has a greater change in momentum: a car that hits a wall and stops, or a car that hits a wall and bounces back?",
        "options": [
          "They are the same",
          "It depends on the mass of the car",
          "The car that stops",
          "The car that bounces back"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Change in momentum Δp = m(v_f - v_i). For a car that stops: Δp = m(0 - v) = -mv (magnitude mv). For a car that bounces back at the same speed: Δp = m(-v - v) = -2mv (magnitude 2mv). The bouncing car undergoes twice the change in momentum."

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) p=mv is a vector, 2) J=Ft=Δp, 3) KE is not always conserved, but momentum is conserved in isolated systems.",
        "0": "Start with: Momentum is mass in motion. An object's momentum changes only when a net force acts on it over time (impulse)."
