    "subject": "Physics",
    "topic": "Special Relativity",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Einstein's First Postulate of Special Relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all:",
        "options": [
          "Inertial frames of reference.",
          "Accelerating frames of reference.",
          "Gravitational fields.",
          "Rotating systems."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An inertial frame is one moving at a constant velocity. Einstein stated that there is no 'preferred' frame; the laws of nature do not change if you are moving at a steady speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Second Postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum (c) is:",
        "options": [
          "Constant for all observers, regardless of their motion.",
          "Dependent on the speed of the light source.",
          "Faster if the observer is moving toward the source.",
          "Slower when passing through a magnetic field."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the most counter-intuitive part of relativity: light always measures as 300,000 km/s, even if you are chasing the beam at 99% the speed of light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be considered an 'inertial frame of reference'?",
        "options": [
          "A train moving at a constant 100 km/h on a straight track.",
          "A car slamming on its brakes.",
          "A rocket during its launch phase.",
          "A child on a merry-go-round spinning at high speed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inertial frames have zero acceleration. All other options involves a change in speed or direction (acceleration)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Before Einstein, classical (Galilean) relativity suggested that if you threw a ball at 10 m/s from a train moving at 50 m/s, the ball's speed relative to the ground would be 60 m/s. Why does this NOT work for light?",
        "options": [
          "Because the speed of light is an absolute limit and constant for all observers.",
          "Because light is a wave and waves don't add velocities.",
          "Because light carries no mass and therefore has no momentum.",
          "Because the train's glass windows slow the light down."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Einstein's second postulate overrules the classical addition of velocities for light. Light speed (c) plus train speed (v) still equals (c)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason Einstein had to develop these postulates?",
        "options": [
          "To reconcile the conflict between Maxwell’s electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics.",
          "To explain why the Earth's gravity pulls on the Moon.",
          "To prove that the Sun is the center of the Solar System.",
          "To calculate the energy required to split an atom."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maxwell's equations predicted a constant speed for electromagnetic waves (light), but Newton's laws suggested speeds should be relative. Einstein chose to keep Maxwell's constant speed as a universal law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an observer on Earth and an observer on a high-speed spaceship both measure the speed of light from a distant star, what will they find?",
        "options": [
          "They will both measure exactly 'c'.",
          "The observer on the spaceship will measure a higher speed.",
          "The observer on Earth will measure a higher speed.",
          "The results will depend on the star's distance."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Regardless of the relative motion between the observers or the star, the Second Postulate ensures the speed of light remains invariant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of 'Simultaneity' in Special Relativity suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "Two events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be for another.",
          "All events in the universe happen at the same time.",
          "Time flows at the same rate for every person in the universe.",
          "Past, present, and future are indistinguishable to all observers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since light speed is constant but distances change for moving observers, the timing of events depends on the observer's frame of reference."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Einstein's postulates lead to the conclusion that space and time are:",
        "options": [
          "Intertwined as a single four-dimensional fabric called spacetime.",
          "Completely independent of each other.",
          "Only relevant within the Earth's atmosphere.",
          "Fixed and absolute as Newton originally described."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Special Relativity demonstrates that changes in motion affect both space (length) and time (dilation), proving they are linked."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the first postulate, if you are in a sealed room moving at a constant velocity, can you perform an experiment to prove you are moving?",
        "options": [
          "No, there is no internal experiment that can detect constant velocity.",
          "Yes, by measuring the time it takes for a ball to drop.",
          "Yes, by observing the interference of light beams.",
          "Yes, by measuring the air pressure in the room."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The laws of physics are identical. Without looking outside at another reference point, constant motion feels exactly like being at rest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Principle of Invariance'?",
        "options": [
          "The speed of light does not change regardless of the motion of the source or observer.",
          "The mass of an object never changes.",
          "The length of an object is the same for all observers.",
          "Gravity remains the same throughout the galaxy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Invariance refers specifically to quantities (like the speed of light) that do not vary even when the frame of reference changes."
