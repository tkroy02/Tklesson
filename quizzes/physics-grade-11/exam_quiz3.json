        "question": "A student measures the thickness of a book cover five times using a micrometer and records: 3.28 mm, 3.26 mm, 3.29 mm, 3.27 mm, and 3.28 mm. The manufacturer specifies the true thickness as 3.15 mm. How would you characterize these measurements?",

          "Accurate but not precise",
          "Precise but not accurate",
          "Both accurate and precise",
          "Neither accurate nor precise"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value. Precision refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other. The average of the student's measurements is (3.28 + 3.26 + 3.29 + 3.27 + 3.28) / 5 = 16.38 / 5 = 3.276 mm. The true value is 3.15 mm, so the measurements are off by an average of 0.126 mm, making them **not accurate**. However, the measurements are all within a very narrow range of 0.03 mm (3.29 - 3.26 = 0.03 mm), showing excellent reproducibility and therefore good **precision**. Thus, the measurements are precise but not accurate."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, perform the multiplication: $24.68 \\times 3.1 = 76.508$. The number 24.68 has four significant figures, but 3.1 has only two. According to the rule for multiplication, the result should be rounded to the least number of significant figures present in the factors, so the product should be rounded to two significant figures. However, to maintain precision for the subtraction step, we keep the full value for now. Next, subtract: $76.508 - 12.4 = 64.108$. For addition and subtraction, we look at decimal places. 76.508 has three decimal places, but 12.4 has only one decimal place. Therefore, the final answer must be rounded to one decimal place, which gives 64.1. However, we must now consider the significant figure rule from the multiplication. 64.1 has three significant figures, but our final answer cannot be more precise than the least precise measurement used. The number 3.1 (two significant figures) limits our final answer to two significant figures. Rounding 64.1 to two significant figures gives 64. Therefore, the correct answer is 64."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To convert from kilometers per hour to meters per second, we need to convert kilometers to meters and hours to seconds. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour. Therefore, the conversion is: $110 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ km}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ h}}{3600 \\text{ s}} = 110 \\times 1000 \\div 3600 = 110,000 \\div 3600 = 30.5555... \\text{ m/s}$. The original value, 110 km/h, has three significant figures, so the final answer should also be expressed with three significant figures.

        "explanation": "First, calculate the total number of seconds. There are 24 hours in a day and 3600 seconds in an hour.

The number 31 days has two significant figures, but a common convention with defined quantities (like days in October, hours in a day) is that they are exact and don't limit precision.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "First, resolve each vector into its x and y components. For $\\vec{A}$: $A_x = 15 \\cos 120^\\circ = 15 \\times (-0.5) = -7.5$ units. $A_y = 15 \\sin 120^\\circ = 15 \\times (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 15 \\times 0.8660 = 12.99$ units. For $\\vec{B}$ (along the -y axis): $B_x = 0$ units. $B_y = -10$ units. Next, add the components to find the components of the resultant vector $\\vec{R} = \\vec{A} + \\vec{B}$: $R_x = A_x + B_x = -7.5 + 0 = -7.5$ units. $R_y = A_y + B_y = 12.99 + (-10) = 2.99$ units. The magnitude of the resultant is found using the Pythagorean theorem: $R = \\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2} = \\sqrt{(-7.5)^2 + (2.99)^2} = \\sqrt{56.25 + 8.94} = \\sqrt{65.19} = 8.07$ units. To find the direction (angle $\\theta$ measured from the +x axis), we first find the reference angle $\\alpha$ from the negative x-axis: $\\alpha = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{|R_y|}{|R_x|}) = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{2.99}{7.5}) = \\tan^{-1}(0.3987) = 21.7^\\circ$. Since $R_x$ is negative and $R_y$ is positive, the resultant vector lies in the second quadrant. Therefore, its angle from the +x axis is $180^\\circ - \\alpha = 180^\\circ - 21.7^\\circ = 158.3^\\circ$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "We set up a coordinate system with the cliff top as the origin (y=0) and upward as the positive direction. The ocean surface is below the cliff, so its position will be a negative value, $-h$. We know the initial velocity $v_0 = +15 \\text{ m/s}$, the acceleration due to gravity $g = -9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$ (negative because it acts downward), and the total time of flight $t = 5.2 \\text{ s}$. We can use the kinematic equation for position: $y(t) = v_0t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$. At $t = 5.2 \\text{ s}$, the rock is at the ocean, so $y(5.2) = -h$. Plugging in the values: $-h = (15)(5.2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-9.8)(5.2)^2$. Calculating: $15 \\times 5.2 = 78$. $(5.2)^2 = 27.04$. $-4.9 \\times 27.04 = -132.496$ (since $\\frac{1}{2} \\times -9.8 = -4.9$). So, $-h = 78 - 132.496 = -54.496$.

        "explanation": "For resistors in series, the total resistance is $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 = 15 + 25 = 40 \\Omega$. Using Ohm's Law ($V = IR$), the current supplied by the battery is $I = \\frac{V}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{24}{40} = 0.6 \\text{ A}$. In a series circuit, the current is the same through all components. Therefore, the voltage across $R_1$ is $V_1 = I R_1 = 0.6 \\times 15 = 9 \\text{ V}$. The voltage across $R_2$ is $V_2 = I R_2 = 0.6 \\times 25 = 15 \\text{ V}$. (Check: $V_1 + V_2 = 9 + 15 = 24 \\text{ V}$, which equals the battery voltage). The power dissipated in $R_2$ can be calculated using $P = I^2 R = (0.6)^2 \\times 25 = 0.36 \\times 25 = 9 \\text{ W}$. Alternatively, $P = \\frac{V_2^2}{R} = \\frac{15^2}{25} = \\frac{225}{25} = 9 \\text{ W}$."

        "explanation": "First, find the resistance of the bulb using the power and voltage ratings. The formula $P = \\frac{V^2}{R}$ can be rearranged to $R = \\frac{V^2}{P} = \\frac{(120)^2}{200} = \\frac{14,400}{200} = 72 \\Omega$. This resistance is assumed to be constant (though in reality it changes slightly with temperature). Next, find the current at the rated voltage using $P = IV$, so $I = \\frac{P}{V} = \\frac{200}{120} = 1.667 \\text{ A}$. Now, if the bulb is operated at $V' = 125 \\text{ V}$, the resistance remains the same (approximately).

        "explanation": "This is a time dilation problem. The event occurring on Earth takes $\\Delta t_0 = 3$ hours as measured by an observer on Earth (this is the proper time, since the event is at rest relative to the Earth observer). An observer on the spaceship, moving at a relative speed $v = 0.92c$, will measure a dilated time $\\Delta t$. The formula for time dilation is $\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta t_0}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. First, calculate $v^2/c^2 = (0.92)^2 = 0.8464$. Then, $1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.8464 = 0.1536$. The Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.1536}} = \\frac{1}{0.392} = 2.551$. Therefore, the time measured on the spaceship is $\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta t_0 = 2.551 \\times 3 = 7.65 \\text{ hours}$. From the ship's perspective, the Earth event takes longer."
