    "duration": 40,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two objects have the same mass but different volumes. Object A has a volume of 10 cm³ and Object B has a volume of 20 cm³. Which object has a higher density?",
        "options": [
          "Object A",
          "Object B",
          "They have the same density",
          "Not enough information"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density is defined as $\\rho = m/V$. Since mass is constant, density is inversely proportional to volume. The object with the smaller volume (Object A) must have the higher density."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid brass sphere is transported from Earth to the Moon. How do its mass and density change?",
        "options": [
          "Both mass and density decrease",
          "Mass remains constant; density decreases",
          "Both mass and density remain constant",
          "Mass decreases; density remains constant"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mass is the amount of matter and does not change with location. Density is an intrinsic property based on mass and volume; since neither changes, density remains constant regardless of gravity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a large ship moves from the high-density saltwater of the ocean into the lower-density freshwater of a river, what happens to the volume of the ship submerged in the water?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases",
          "It increases",
          "It stays the same",
          "The ship sinks completely"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To stay afloat, the ship must displace a weight of water equal to its own weight. Since freshwater is less dense, the ship must displace a larger volume of it to achieve the same buoyant force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Archimedes Principle' regarding an object submerged in a fluid?",
        "options": [
          "The buoyant force is equal to the mass of the object",
          "The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced",
          "The object will always sink if its volume is small",
          "Fluid pressure decreases with depth"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Archimedes' Principle states that the upward buoyant force exerted on a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you compress a fixed mass of gas into a smaller volume at a constant temperature, what happens to its density?",
        "options": [
          "Density increases",
          "Density decreases",
          "Density remains constant",
          "Density becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density $\\rho = m/V$. If the mass $m$ is constant and the volume $V$ decreases, the value of the fraction increases, resulting in a higher density."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 100g block of lead and a 100g block of aluminum are both fully submerged in water. Which block experiences a greater buoyant force? (Density of Lead > Density of Aluminum)",
        "options": [
          "The lead block",
          "The aluminum block",
          "They experience the same buoyant force",
          "Buoyant force depends on depth, not material"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since aluminum is less dense than lead, a 100g block of aluminum has a larger volume than a 100g block of lead. Because it has a larger volume, it displaces more water, resulting in a greater buoyant force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A container is filled to the brim with water. An ice cube is placed in it and floats. Some water overflows. After the ice melts, what happens to the water level in the container?",
        "options": [
          "The water overflows further",
          "The water level drops",
          "The water level remains exactly at the brim",
          "It depends on the temperature of the air"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A floating object displaces a weight of fluid equal to its own weight. When the ice melts, it turns into a mass of water equal to the mass of the ice, which occupies exactly the volume of the 'hole' the ice made in the water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the depth of a fluid and the pressure it exerts?",
        "options": [
          "Pressure is independent of depth",
          "Pressure decreases as depth increases",
          "Pressure increases linearly with depth",
          "Pressure increases as the square of the depth"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fluid pressure is calculated as $P = \\rho gh$. This shows that for a fluid of constant density, pressure increases linearly with the depth $h$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is neutrally buoyant (it neither sinks nor floats to the top) when placed in a liquid, what can be said about its density?",
        "options": [
          "Its density is greater than the liquid's density",
          "Its density is less than the liquid's density",
          "Its density is exactly equal to the liquid's density",
          "Its density is zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Neutral buoyancy occurs when the weight of the object exactly equals the buoyant force, which happens when the object's average density matches the density of the fluid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be the most accurate way to measure the volume of a gas produced in a chemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Using a ruler to measure the gas cloud",
          "Weighing the gas on a standard scale",
          "Measuring the volume of water displaced in an inverted graduated cylinder",
          "Calculating the volume based on the color of the gas"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The water displacement method (using a pneumatic trough and an inverted cylinder) is a standard laboratory technique to capture and measure the volume of gas."
