      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sample of neon gas occupies 4.0 L at a pressure of 100 kPa. If the volume is compressed to 1.0 L at constant temperature, what is the new pressure?",
        "options": [
          "25 kPa",
          "100 kPa",
          "400 kPa",
          "800 kPa"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "According to Boyle's Law (P1V1 = P2V2), 100 * 4.0 = P2 * 1.0. Solving for P2 gives 400 kPa. When volume decreases by 1/4, pressure increases by 4x."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balloon is filled with 3.0 L of air at a pressure of 1.0 atm. It is submerged in a lake until the pressure becomes 3.0 atm. If the temperature remains constant, what is the new volume?",
        "options": [
          "1.0 L",
          "3.0 L",
          "6.0 L",
          "9.0 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using P1V1 = P2V2: 1.0 * 3.0 = 3.0 * V2. V2 = 1.0 L. As the pressure triples, the volume must shrink to one-third of its original size."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a hydraulic system, the input piston has an area of 5 cm² and the output piston has an area of 250 cm². If an input force of 10 N is applied, what is the output force?",
        "options": [
          "50 N",
          "250 N",
          "500 N",
          "2500 N"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pascal's Principle (F1/A1 = F2/A2): 10 / 5 = F2 / 250. 2 = F2 / 250. F2 = 500 N. The mechanical advantage is 50 (250/5)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A gas at 27°C and 2.0 L is heated to 127°C at constant pressure. What is the new volume?",
        "options": [
          "1.5 L",
          "2.67 L",
          "3.0 L",
          "9.4 L"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Convert temperatures to Kelvin: T1 = 300 K, T2 = 400 K. Using Charles's Law (V1/T1 = V2/T2): 2.0 / 300 = V2 / 400. V2 = (2.0 * 400) / 300 = 2.67 L."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the pressure on a gas and double its absolute temperature, what happens to the volume?",
        "options": [
          "It quadruples",
          "It is cut in half",
          "It remains the same",
          "It doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using the Combined Gas Law (P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2): If P2 = 2P1 and T2 = 2T1, then (P1V1/T1) = (2P1 * V2 / 2T1). The 2s cancel out, meaning V1 = V2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A piston compresses a gas from 500 cm³ to 100 cm³. If the initial pressure was 15 psi, what is the final pressure?",
        "options": [
          "3 psi",
          "15 psi",
          "60 psi",
          "75 psi"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "P1V1 = P2V2: 15 * 500 = P2 * 100. 7500 = P2 * 100. P2 = 75 psi."

          "1000 Pa",
          "4000 Pa",
          "1000 kPa",
          "2000 Pa"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "P = F / A. P = 2000 N / 2.0 m² = 1000 Pa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A weather balloon is released at sea level (1.0 atm) with a volume of 10 m³. At a certain altitude, the volume expands to 40 m³. If temperature is constant, what is the pressure at that altitude?",
        "options": [
          "0.25 atm",
          "0.5 atm",
          "2.0 atm",
          "4.0 atm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "P1V1 = P2V2: 1.0 * 10 = P2 * 40. P2 = 10 / 40 = 0.25 atm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the kinetic molecular theory, why does pressure increase when volume decreases at a constant temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The particles move faster",
          "The particles get larger",
          "The frequency of collisions with the walls increases",
          "The particles lose energy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a smaller volume, the gas particles have less space to move, so they strike the walls of the container more often, which results in higher pressure."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hydraulic jack requires 20 N of force to lift a 400 N load. What is the ratio of the output piston area to the input piston area?",

          "2:1",
          "10:1",
          "20:1",
          "40:1"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "F2/F1 = A2/A1. 400 / 20 = 20. Therefore, the output area must be 20 times larger than the input area."
