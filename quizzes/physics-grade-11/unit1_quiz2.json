          "3,500 m",
          "35,000 m"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "1 km = 1000 m, so 3.5 km × 1000 = 3,500 m."
      },

          "75 m"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "1 m = 1000 mm, so 750 mm ÷ 1000 = 0.75 m."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "2.5 hours × 60 min/hour × 60 s/min = 2.5 × 3600 = 9,000 s."

          "Force",
          "Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Scalars have only magnitude. Mass is a scalar; velocity, displacement, and force have direction and are vectors."

          "Unit",
          "Measurement"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By definition, a vector quantity includes both magnitude (size) and direction."

          "Time",
          "Acceleration",
          "Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Acceleration involves a change in velocity in a specific direction, making it a vector."

          "2,500 g"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "1 kg = 1000 g, so 0.25 kg × 1000 = 250 g."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels 5 km north, then 5 km east. The distance traveled is:",
        "options": [
          "0 km",
          "5 km",
          "7.1 km",
          "10 km"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Distance is a scalar (total path length). 5 km + 5 km = 10 km. (The displacement would be approximately 7.1 km northeast.)"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements about vectors is true?",
        "options": [
          "They can be added using ordinary arithmetic",
          "They are fully described by magnitude alone",
          "They can be represented by arrows",
          "They never change with direction"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Vectors are often represented graphically by arrows, where the length indicates magnitude and the arrowhead indicates direction."

          "250 ms"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "1 ms = 0.001 s, so 0.0025 s ÷ 0.001 = 2.5 ms, or multiply by 1000: 0.0025 × 1000 = 2.5 ms."
