    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you heat a liquid from the top rather than the bottom, why does it take much longer for the bottom of the liquid to get warm?",
        "options": [
          "Liquids cannot conduct heat at all.",
          "Convection cannot occur because the hot, less-dense liquid stays at the top.",
          "Radiation is blocked by the surface of the liquid.",
          "Gravity pulls the heat upward."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Convection depends on hot fluid rising. If the heat source is at the top, the warm water stays there, and heat can only reach the bottom through the much slower process of conduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a vacuum flask (Thermos), the inner walls are often 'silvered' or mirror-like. Which method of heat transfer does this specifically minimize?",
        "options": [
          "Conduction",
          "Convection",
          "Radiation",
          "Evaporation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Shiny, mirrored surfaces reflect infrared radiation back toward the source, preventing energy from being emitted out of or absorbed into the flask."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be the most effective way to keep a house cool in a very hot, sunny climate?",
        "options": [
          "Painting the roof black to absorb heat quickly.",
          "Painting the roof white to reflect solar radiation.",
          "Using solid metal beams for the walls to conduct heat to the ground.",
          "Removing all insulation to let air flow through the walls."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "White surfaces have high reflectivity (albedo), meaning they reflect the majority of the Sun's radiant energy rather than absorbing it into the structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When you walk barefoot on a carpet and then onto a tile floor, the tile feels much colder even though both are at the same temperature. This is because:",
        "options": [
          "The tile has a lower temperature than the carpet.",
          "The carpet is a source of thermal energy.",
          "Tile has a higher thermal conductivity than carpet.",
          "Tile has a lower specific heat than carpet."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Your feet are warmer than the floor. Tile conducts that heat away from your skin much faster than the insulating carpet, creating the sensation of cold."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of the 'Greenhouse Effect,' how does the atmosphere trap heat?",
        "options": [
          "It prevents conduction between the Earth and space.",
          "It reflects visible light back to the sun.",
          "It allows short-wave radiation in but absorbs and re-radiates long-wave infrared energy back to Earth.",
          "It stops all convection currents from leaving the planet."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Sunlight (short-wave) passes through, but the heat radiated by Earth (long-wave infrared) is absorbed by greenhouse gases, slowing down the loss of energy to space."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is fiberglass 'batting' (the fluffy pink material) used in attic insulation?",
        "options": [
          "Glass is an excellent conductor of heat.",
          "The fibers trap tiny pockets of air, preventing both conduction and convection.",
          "The pink color reflects infrared radiation.",
          "It adds mass to the house to increase thermal energy storage."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By trapping air in small spaces, the fiberglass prevents air from circulating (convection) and utilizes air's naturally low conductivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do the heating coils in a refrigerator need to be located on the outside of the unit?",
        "options": [
          "To use radiation to heat the kitchen.",
          "To allow the heat removed from the inside to be released into the environment via convection.",
          "To prevent the coils from freezing.",
          "To use conduction to warm the refrigerator door."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A refrigerator is a heat pump; it gathers heat from the inside and must dump that energy into the outside air, typically using convection fins."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person wearing a 'space blanket' (thin, shiny foil) stays warm primarily because the blanket:",
        "options": [
          "Conducts heat back into the body.",
          "Prevents convection by stopping the wind.",
          "Reflects the body's own infrared radiation back toward them.",
          "Generates heat through a chemical reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The primary function of the metallic coating is to reflect the body's radiant heat, which would otherwise be lost to the cold environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is the primary method of heat transfer responsible for the formation of 'sea breezes' at the coast?",
        "options": [
          "Conduction",
          "Convection",
          "Radiation",
          "Thermal Expansion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Land heats faster than water; the air above the land rises (convection), creating a low-pressure area that draws in the cooler air from over the sea."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you hold one end of a copper rod and one end of a glass rod in a flame, why does the copper rod burn your hand first?",
        "options": [
          "Copper has a higher temperature than glass.",
          "Copper has free electrons that facilitate rapid conduction.",
          "Glass reflects all the heat from the flame.",
          "Copper absorbs more radiation than glass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Copper is a metallic conductor. Its free-moving electrons allow kinetic energy to be passed from the flame to your hand much more efficiently than in an insulator like glass."
