        "question": "A student measures the length of a table four times and records the following measurements: 1.54 m, 1.52 m, 1.55 m, and 1.53 m. Upon checking with a standard reference, the actual length of the table is determined to be 1.50 m. Which of the following statements correctly describes the student's measurements in terms of accuracy and precision?",
        "options": [
          "They are accurate but not precise",
          "They are precise but not accurate",
          "They are both accurate and precise",
          "They are neither accurate nor precise"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value (1.50 m). The average of the student's measurements is approximately 1.535 m, which is not very close to 1.50 m, so the measurements are not accurate. Precision refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other. The four measurements are all within 0.03 m of each other (range = 1.55 - 1.52 = 0.03 m), indicating good reproducibility and therefore good precision. Thus, the measurements are precise but not accurate."

        "options": ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, perform the multiplication: 12.5 × 3.00 = 37.5. Both 12.5 and 3.00 have three significant figures, so their product should have three significant figures. However, we keep the exact value (37.5) for the next step. Then, add 37.5 + 8.57 = 46.07. When adding, we look at decimal places: 37.5 has one decimal place, and 8.57 has two decimal places. The rule for addition is that the final answer should have the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places. Therefore, 46.07 should be rounded to one decimal place, giving 46.1. The number 46.1 has three significant figures."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "To convert from miles per hour to meters per second, we need to convert miles to meters and hours to seconds. 65 miles/hour × (1609 meters/1 mile) × (1 hour/3600 seconds) = 65 × 1609 ÷ 3600. First, 65 × 1609 = 104,585. Then, 104,585 ÷ 3600 = 29.05139... m/s. Considering significant figures, 65 has two significant figures, 1609 has four, and 3600 is an exact conversion factor. The result should be reported with two significant figures, giving 29 m/s, or with three significant figures (since 65 could be considered exact in some contexts) giving 29.1 m/s. The closest option is 29.1 m/s."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, calculate the area in square meters: 125.5 m × 48.2 m = 6049.1 m². Since 125.5 has four significant figures and 48.2 has three significant figures, the product should have three significant figures. However, we keep the full value for conversion. To convert to square kilometers, divide by 1,000,000 (since 1 km² = 1,000,000 m²): 6049.1 ÷ 1,000,000 = 0.0060491 km². Now we must round to three significant figures. The first three digits of 0.0060491 are 604 (after the leading zeros). Looking at the fourth digit (9), we round up, giving 0.00605 km². The leading zeros are not significant; they only serve to place the decimal."

Vector B has components: Bx = 0 units; By = -6.0 units (negative because it points along the -y axis). Adding components: Rx = Ax + Bx = 6.928 + 0 = 6.928 units; Ry = Ay + By = 4.0 + (-6.0) = -2.0 units. The magnitude of the resultant is R = √(Rx² + Ry²) = √(6.928² + (-2.0)²) = √(48.0 + 4.0) = √52.0 ≈ 7.21 units. The direction is given by θ = tan⁻¹(Ry/Rx) = tan⁻¹(-2.0/6.928) = tan⁻¹(-0.2887) ≈ -16.1°, which means 16.1° below the positive x-axis."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "We need to calculate the distance for each phase separately. Phase 1 (acceleration): The acceleration is a = (25 - 0)/8.0 = 3.125 m/s². Distance d₁ = v₀t + ½at² = 0 + ½(3.125)(8.0)² = 0.5 × 3.125 × 64 = 100 m. Phase 2 (constant speed): d₂ = v × t = 25 × 12 = 300 m. Phase 3 (deceleration): The acceleration is a = (0 - 25)/5.0 = -5.0 m/s². Distance d₃ = v₀t + ½at² = 25(5.0) + ½(-5.0)(5.0)² = 125 - 0.5 × 5.0 × 25 = 125 - 62.5 = 62.5 m.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Let upward be positive. The initial position is y₀ = +50 m (top of cliff), and the final position is y = 0 (ground). Using the equation y = y₀ + v₀t + ½at², with a = -10 m/s²: 0 = 50 + 30t + ½(-10)t² = 50 + 30t - 5t². Rearranging: 5t² - 30t - 50 = 0. Divide by 5: t² - 6t - 10 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: t = [6 ± √(36 + 40)]/2 = [6 ± √76]/2 = [6 ± 8.718]/2. The positive root is t = (6 + 8.718)/2 = 14.718/2 = 7.36 s. The negative root would give a negative time, which is physically meaningless. Therefore, the ball takes approximately 7.36 seconds to hit the ground."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The slope of the line gives the acceleration: a = (30 - 10)/(6 - 2) = 20/4 = 5 m/s². Using point-slope form, we can find the velocity at any time. Since the line passes through (2, 10): v - 10 = 5(t - 2) → v = 5t. (We can verify: at t=2, v=10; at t=6, v=30). So v(t) = 5t. Displacement is the area under the v-t curve, which can be found by integration: ∫₀⁵ 5t dt = [5t²/2]₀⁵ = (5 × 25)/2 = 125/2 = 62.5 m. Alternatively, since the motion is uniformly accelerated, we could use d = v₀t + ½at², but note that v₀ = 0 from our equation."

The displacement equation is: y - y₀ = v₀t + ½at². Let the ground be y = 0, and let the release point be y₀ = h (the height we're looking for). Then: 0 - h = 5(8) + ½(-9.8)(8)² = 40 - 4.9 × 64 = 40 - 313.6 = -273.6. Therefore, h = 273.6 m, which rounds to 274 m with three significant figures."

The magnitude is v = √(vx² + vy²) = √(22.98² + (-10.12)²) = √(528.1 + 102.4) = √630.5 = 25.1 m/s.

        "explanation": "The path difference is Δd = 3.0 - 2.5 = 0.5 m. For destructive interference, the path difference must equal (n + ½)λ, where n is an integer. So 0.5 = (n + ½)λ = (n + ½)(v/f) = (n + ½)(v/340). Solving for v: v = 0.5 × 340/(n + ½) = 170/(n + ½). For n = 0: v = 170/0.5 = 340 m/s. For n = 1: v = 170/1.5 = 113.3 m/s (too slow for sound). For n = 2: v = 170/2.5 = 68 m/s (even slower). So the only physically reasonable answer is 340 m/s."
