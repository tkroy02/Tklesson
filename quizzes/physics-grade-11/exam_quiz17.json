        "question": "A stationary observer hears a train whistle with a frequency of $485\\,\\text{Hz}$. If the actual frequency of the whistle is $440\\,\\text{Hz}$, determine whether the train is approaching or receding and calculate its speed. (Assume the speed of sound in air is $340\\,\\text{m/s}$)",

          "Receding at $63.0\\,\\text{m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The observed frequency is higher than the source frequency, indicating the source is approaching. Using the Doppler formula $f' = f\\left(\\frac{v}{v - v_s}\\right)$, we have $485 = 440\\left(\\frac{340}{340 - v_s}\\right)$. Solving: $485/440 = 340/(340 - v_s) \\Rightarrow 1.1023 = 340/(340 - v_s) \\Rightarrow 340 - v_s = 340/1.1023 \\approx 308.5 \\Rightarrow v_s \\approx 31.5\\,\\text{m/s}$."

The longest wavelength corresponds to $n = 0$, so $1.0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda$, thus $\\lambda = 2.0\\,\\text{m}$."
