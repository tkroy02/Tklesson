        "question": "The speeds of a car are recorded as follows:<br>Point A to Point B = 30 m/s<br>Point B to Point C = 40 m/s<br>Point C to Point D = 20 m/s<br><br>What is the average speed of the car?",
        "options": [
          "20 m/s",
          "30 m/s",
          "40 m/s",
          "90 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Average speed = (30 + 40 + 20)/3 = 90/3 = 30 m/s. This assumes equal time intervals or equal segments between points."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Distance is a scalar quantity (total path length). The van travels 90 m north plus 90 m south = 180 m total distance."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the total displacement of a van that travels 50 m due North and 40 m due East?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Displacement = $\\sqrt{50^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{2500 + 1600} = \\sqrt{4100} \\approx 64.0$ m."
      },

          "3 m/s",
          "5 m/s",
          "7 m/s",
          "15 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Average speed = (25 m - 10 m) / (5 s - 2 s) = 15 m / 3 s = 5 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How fast will an object (in motion along the x-axis) be moving at t = 20 s if it had a speed of 4 m/s at t = 0 and a constant acceleration of 3 m/s²?",

        "question": "A car is rolling toward a cliff with an initial speed of 25 m/s. The maximum negative acceleration that the brakes can provide is -0.5 m/s². If the cliff is 400 m from the initial position of the car, will the car go over the cliff?",

          "Yes",
          "No",
          "Cannot be determined",
          "It depends on the car's mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stopping distance = $u^2/(2a) = (25)^2/(2×0.5) = 625/1 = 625$ m. Since 625 m > 400 m, the car cannot stop in time and will go over the cliff."
