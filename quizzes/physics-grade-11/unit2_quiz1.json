      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A book rests on a table. According to Newton's Third Law, the force of the book on the table is equal and opposite to:",
        "options": [
          "The force of gravity on the book",
          "The force of the table on the book",
          "The force of gravity on the table",
          "The force of the book on the Earth"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action force there is an equal and opposite reaction force. The book pushing down on the table (action) is paired with the table pushing up on the book (reaction)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car accelerates forward on a level road. The force that directly causes this acceleration is:",
        "options": [
          "The force of the engine on the drive wheels",
          "The force of the road on the drive wheels",
          "The force of air resistance backward",
          "The force of gravity downward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While the engine provides torque to the wheels, it's the friction between the tires and road (road pushing forward on the wheels) that propels the car forward. This is the external force causing acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves with constant velocity. According to Newton's First Law:",
        "options": [
          "There must be no forces acting on it",
          "The net force on it is zero",
          "It has no inertia",
          "It must be in free fall"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's First Law states that an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force. Constant velocity means zero net force, not necessarily zero individual forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a tug-of-war, when Team A pulls on the rope with 500 N and Team B pulls with 500 N, the tension in the rope is:",
        "options": [
          "0 N",
          "500 N",
          "1000 N",
          "250 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tension is transmitted equally throughout a rope. Each team pulls with 500 N, creating 500 N of tension in the rope. The forces are equal and opposite, resulting in zero net force on the rope."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heavy truck and a light car have a head-on collision. According to Newton's Third Law:",
        "options": [
          "The truck exerts more force on the car",
          "The car exerts more force on the truck",
          "They exert equal force on each other",
          "The force depends on their speeds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law states the forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. The truck might experience less acceleration due to its greater mass, but the force magnitudes are equal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person pushes a heavy box but it doesn't move. The force of static friction between the box and floor:",
        "options": [
          "Is zero",
          "Is equal to the applied force",
          "Is greater than the applied force",
          "Depends only on the weight of the box"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Static friction matches the applied force up to its maximum value. Since the box doesn't move, the net force is zero, so static friction equals the applied force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An astronaut in the International Space Station appears weightless because:",
        "options": [
          "There is no gravity in space",
          "Gravity is much weaker at that altitude",
          "She is in free fall along with the station",
          "The station's rotation cancels gravity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Gravity at the ISS altitude is about 90% of Earth's surface gravity. The astronaut and station are both in free fall toward Earth, creating the sensation of weightlessness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is thrown upward. At the highest point of its trajectory:",
        "options": [
          "Velocity is zero and acceleration is zero",
          "Velocity is zero and acceleration is 9.8 m/s² downward",
          "Velocity is 9.8 m/s upward and acceleration is zero",
          "Velocity is 9.8 m/s downward and acceleration is 9.8 m/s² downward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the highest point, vertical velocity is momentarily zero as it changes from upward to downward. Acceleration due to gravity is constant at 9.8 m/s² downward throughout."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a car turns a corner at constant speed, which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "No net force acts on the car",
          "A net force acts toward the center of the turn",
          "A net force acts away from the center of the turn",
          "The frictional force on the car is zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Changing direction requires a centripetal force. For a car turning, friction between tires and road provides this inward force toward the center of the turn."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A skydiver falls at terminal velocity. This means:",
        "options": [
          "Her acceleration is zero",
          "She has stopped falling",
          "Air resistance is zero",
          "Gravity has stopped acting"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Terminal velocity occurs when air resistance equals weight. Net force becomes zero, so acceleration becomes zero. She continues falling at constant speed."
