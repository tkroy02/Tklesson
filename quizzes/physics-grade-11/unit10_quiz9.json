    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Length Contraction' in Special Relativity?",
        "options": [
          "The phenomenon where a moving object's length is measured to be shorter than its proper length.",
          "The physical compression of an object due to air resistance at high speeds.",
          "The shrinking of an object in all dimensions (width, height, and length).",
          "The decrease in the distance between atoms due to increased gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Length contraction is the relativistic effect where the length of an object is measured to be shorter when it is moving relative to the observer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which direction does length contraction occur?",
        "options": [
          "Only in the direction of the object's motion.",
          "Perpendicular to the direction of motion.",
          "Uniformly in all directions (the object gets smaller overall).",
          "Opposite to the direction of motion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Relativistic contraction only affects the dimension parallel to the velocity. The height and width of a moving object remain unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Proper Length' (L₀)?",
        "options": [
          "The length of an object measured by an observer who is at rest relative to the object.",
          "The length of an object measured when it is moving at the speed of light.",
          "The maximum possible length an object can reach.",
          "The length of an object measured from a moving frame of reference."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Proper length is the 'rest length'—the measurement taken by someone in the same frame of reference as the object."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As an object's velocity approaches the speed of light, its measured length (L) relative to a stationary observer approaches:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Infinity",
          "Its proper length",
          "Half of its proper length"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formula $L = L_0\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ shows that as $v$ approaches $c$, the term in the square root approaches zero, meaning the length contracts toward zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a 100-meter long spaceship flies past Earth at 0.8c, an observer on Earth would measure its length as:",
        "options": [
          "60 meters",
          "100 meters",
          "166 meters",
          "80 meters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the Lorentz contraction formula with $v=0.8c$ gives $\\sqrt{1 - 0.64} = 0.6$. Therefore, $100 \\times 0.6 = 60$ meters."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an astronaut on a high-speed spaceship perceive the length of their own ship?",
        "options": [
          "The ship appears to be its normal proper length.",
          "The ship appears much shorter to the astronaut.",
          "The ship appears much longer to the astronaut.",
          "The ship appears to flicker in and out of existence."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Principle of Relativity, the astronaut is at rest relative to the ship. Therefore, they always measure the proper length ($L_0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An astronaut traveling at 0.99c toward a star 10 light-years away will perceive the distance to that star as:",
        "options": [
          "Much shorter than 10 light-years.",
          "Exactly 10 light-years.",
          "Much longer than 10 light-years.",
          "Zero light-years."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Length contraction applies to the 'space' or distance between points. To the moving astronaut, the distance between Earth and the star is contracted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Length contraction is often described as the 'reciprocal' of time dilation. This is because:",
        "options": [
          "Both effects ensure that the speed of light remains constant for all observers.",
          "One makes things bigger while the other makes things smaller.",
          "Length contraction only happens when time speeds up.",
          "They cancel each other out so that Newtonian physics still works."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Time dilation and length contraction work together to ensure that $velocity = distance/time$ always results in 'c' for light, regardless of the observer's motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following subatomic particles provides experimental evidence for length contraction?",
        "options": [
          "Muons traveling through the atmosphere.",
          "Electrons in a static copper wire.",
          "Protons at rest in a nucleus.",
          "Neutrons in a nuclear reactor."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From the muon's frame of reference, it can reach the Earth's surface before decaying because the height of the atmosphere is length-contracted to a very small distance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why don't we see cars on the highway getting shorter?",
        "options": [
          "Highway speeds are too slow for the Lorentz factor to differ significantly from 1.",
          "Gravity on Earth prevents length contraction from happening.",
          "Rubber tires absorb the contraction effect.",
          "The atmosphere pushes back against the contraction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At non-relativistic speeds, $\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ is so close to 1 that the change in length is smaller than the width of an atom."
