        "options": ["-3.14 rad/s²", "-30.0 rad/s²", "-5.24 rad/s²", "-1.57 rad/s²", "-10.5 rad/s²"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convert rpm to rad/s: ω_i = (500 × 2π)/60 = 52.36 rad/s; ω_f = (200 × 2π)/60 = 20.94 rad/s. Use α = (ω_f - ω_i)/t = (20.94 - 52.36) / 10.0 = -3.14 rad/s²."

        "options": ["4.36 rad", "8.72 rad", "1.75 rad", "6.98 rad", "3.49 rad"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using θ = ½(ω_i + ω_f)t: θ = ½(0 + 3.49) × 2.50 = 1.745 × 2.50 = 4.36 rad."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using ω_f = ω_i + αt: 300 = 0 + 15.0t. Solving for t gives 300 / 15.0 = 20.0 s."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using θ = ω_i t + ½αt²: 40.0 = 0 + ½(α)(4.00)². 40.0 = 8α. α = 40.0 / 8 = 5.00 rad/s²."

        "question": "An electric drill is turned off and coasting to a stop. If it was spinning at 100 rad/s and stops after turning through 250 radians, what was its angular acceleration?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using ω_f² = ω_i² + 2αθ: 0 = (100)² + 2(α)(250). 0 = 10000 + 500α. α = -10000 / 500 = -20.0 rad/s²."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A grindstone starting from rest has a constant angular acceleration of 4.00 rad/s². What is its angular velocity after it has made 5.00 complete revolutions?",
        "options": ["15.9 rad/s", "6.32 rad/s", "12.6 rad/s", "20.0 rad/s", "25.1 rad/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convert rev to rad: θ = 5.00 × 2π = 31.42 rad. Use ω_f² = ω_i² + 2αθ: ω_f² = 0 + 2(4.00)(31.42) = 251.36. ω_f = √251.36 ≈ 15.9 rad/s."

        "question": "A potter's wheel slows from 12.0 rad/s to stop in 30.0 seconds. How many revolutions does it make before stopping?",
        "options": ["28.6 rev", "180 rev", "57.3 rev", "90.0 rev", "11.5 rev"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "θ = ½(ω_i + ω_f)t = ½(12.0 + 0) × 30.0 = 180 rad. Convert to revolutions: 180 / 2π ≈ 28.6 rev."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation follows the form θ = ω_i t + ½αt². Comparing the t² term, ½α = 0.5, so α = 1.0 rad/s²."

          "Angular acceleration must be constant",
          "Angular velocity must be constant",

          "The object must start from rest"
