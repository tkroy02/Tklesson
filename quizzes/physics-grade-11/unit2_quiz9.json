      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A textbook sits at rest on a table. A student says, 'The book doesn't fall because the table pushes up on it with a force equal to its weight.' Is this explanation consistent with Newton's laws?",
        "options": [
          "No, because the book cannot exert a force on itself.",
          "No, because if forces were balanced the book would move.",
          "Yes, because the upward force from the table balances gravity.",
          "Yes, because Newton's first law says objects at rest have no forces."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The book is at rest so net force = 0. The normal force from the table equals the weight, consistent with Newton's first law."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.0-kg box is pulled across a level floor by a horizontal force of 10 N. If it moves at constant velocity, what is the approximate coefficient of kinetic friction?",
        "options": [
          "0.25",
          "0.51",
          "0.75",
          "0.10"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant velocity ⇒ F_net = 0 ⇒ friction = applied force = 10 N. μ_k = F_friction / (mg) = 10 / (2 × 9.8) ≈ 10 / 19.6 ≈ 0.51."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a 50-N horizontal force is applied to a 5.0-kg crate on a level floor, it moves at constant speed. Which statement is necessarily true?",
        "options": [
          "The crate accelerates at 10 m/s².",
          "The friction force is less than 50 N.",
          "The friction force is 50 N.",
          "There is no friction acting on the crate."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Constant speed ⇒ a = 0 ⇒ net force = 0. So friction force must equal applied force = 50 N."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A soccer ball is kicked and hits a wall, bouncing back. Regarding the force pair during contact:",
        "options": [
          "The ball exerts a force on the wall, but the wall exerts no force on the ball.",
          "The wall exerts a force on the ball, but the ball exerts no force on the wall.",
          "Both exert forces on each other, but the wall's force is larger.",
          "Both exert forces on each other that are equal in magnitude."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Newton's third law: the force pair between ball and wall are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.5-kg stone is dropped. As it falls, which statement is correct about the force Earth exerts on the stone and the stone exerts on Earth?",
        "options": [
          "Earth pulls the stone, but the stone does not pull Earth.",
          "The stone pulls Earth, but Earth does not pull the stone.",
          "Both pull each other with equal forces.",
          "Both pull each other, but Earth's pull is much larger."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's third law: gravitational forces are equal in magnitude regardless of mass difference."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 4.0-kg block is pushed up a frictionless incline at constant speed. The force pushing it parallel to the incline is 20 N. What is the incline's angle?",
        "options": [
          "30°",
          "45°",
          "60°",
          "15°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constant speed ⇒ F_push = mg sinθ ⇒ 20 = (4)(9.8) sinθ ⇒ sinθ ≈ 0.51 ⇒ θ ≈ 30°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heavy crate rests on a rough horizontal floor. A worker pushes but it doesn't move. The friction force acting is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero because it's not moving.",
          "Equal to the worker's push.",
          "Greater than the worker's push.",
          "Less than the worker's push but not zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Static friction adjusts to match applied force until maximum static friction is reached. Since a = 0, friction = applied force."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1200-kg car moves at constant velocity on a horizontal road. The engine provides 300 N forward force. What is the friction force magnitude?",

          "0 N",
          "300 N",
          "1200 N",
          "11,760 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant velocity ⇒ net force = 0 ⇒ friction force backward = engine force forward = 300 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two magnets repel each other while held in place. Student A says, 'The force on magnet 1 is larger because it's heavier.' This is:",
        "options": [
          "True, because heavier objects exert larger forces.",
          "False, because Newton's third law says forces are equal.",
          "True, because force depends on mass.",
          "False, because only one magnet creates the force."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Interaction forces are equal in magnitude regardless of mass (Newton's third law)."

          "2 N downward",
          "2 N upward",
          "0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By Newton's third law, the apple pulls down on the branch with same magnitude the branch pulls up on apple: 2 N downward."
