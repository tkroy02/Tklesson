      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two particles are moving in the same direction with speeds 10 m/s and 15 m/s. What is the velocity of the second relative to the first?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "5 m/s",
          "-5 m/s",
          "25 m/s",
          "0 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Relative velocity = $v_2 - v_1 = 15 - 10 = 5$ m/s in the same direction."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car increases its speed from 10 m/s to 30 m/s while covering a distance of 80 m. What is the time taken?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "8 s",
          "2 s",
          "5 s",
          "4 s"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$ ⇒ $900 = 100 + 160a$ ⇒ $a = 5$ m/s². $v = u + at$ ⇒ $30 = 10 + 5t$ ⇒ $t = 4$ s."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bus starts from rest with an acceleration of 1 m/s². A man who is 48 m behind the bus starts running at a constant speed of 10 m/s to catch the bus. After how much time will he catch it?",
        "image": "",

          "8 s"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$10t - 48 = \\frac{1}{2}(1)t^2$ ⇒ $20t - 96 = t^2$ ⇒ $t^2 - 20t + 96 = 0$ ⇒ $(t-8)(t-12)=0$ ⇒ $t = 8$ s (earliest time)."
      },

          "None of these",
          "A horizontal line"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Speed-time graphs show only magnitude, not direction. Returning to start requires displacement = 0, which cannot be determined from speed-time graph alone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is moving with a constant acceleration of 4 m/s². If its velocity at t = 4 s is 20 m/s, what was its velocity at t = 2 s?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [

          "4 m/s"

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$v_4 = v_2 + a(2)$ ⇒ $20 = v_2 + 4(2)$ ⇒ $20 = v_2 + 8$ ⇒ $v_2 = 12$ m/s."

        "question": "A particle moves along a curved path. Is it possible for the magnitude of its average velocity to be equal to its average speed over a specific time interval?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Yes, as long as the starting and ending points are the same.",
          "Yes, if the acceleration is constant throughout the curve.",
          "Only if the particle moves in a straight line without reversing direction.",
          "Always, because speed is simply the magnitude of velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average velocity = displacement/time, average speed = distance/time. They are equal only when distance = displacement, which occurs only for straight-line motion without reversal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves such that its velocity and acceleration vectors are in opposite directions. What is happening to the object's motion?",

          "The object has stopped moving."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When velocity and acceleration are opposite, they oppose each other, causing the object to slow down (decelerate)."

        "question": "An object starts from rest and moves with constant acceleration. In the first 2 seconds it covers distance $h_1$. In the next 2 seconds it covers $h_2$. What is the ratio $h_2/h_1$?",
        "image": "",

          "1.5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$h_1 = \\frac{1}{2}a(2)^2 = 2a$. First 4 seconds: $s_4 = \\frac{1}{2}a(4)^2 = 8a$. $h_2 = 8a - 2a = 6a$. Ratio = $6a/2a = 3$."

          "$v\\sqrt{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$v^2 = 2as$. After $4s$: $v'^2 = 2a(4s) = 8as = 4(2as) = 4v^2$, so $v' = 2v$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can an object have a northward velocity while experiencing a southward acceleration?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Yes, this occurs whenever an object moving north is slowing down.",
          "Yes, but only if the object is at its maximum height.",
          "No, because the net force must be in the direction of velocity.",
          "No, acceleration always determines the direction of motion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity and acceleration are independent. When opposite, the object slows down. Example: car moving north applies brakes → velocity north, acceleration south."
