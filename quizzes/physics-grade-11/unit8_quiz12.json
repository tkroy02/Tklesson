    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an air column that is closed at one end and open at the other, what must be present at the closed end for resonance to occur?",
        "options": [
          "A node (zero displacement)",
          "An antinode (maximum displacement)",
          "A rarefaction only",
          "A crest only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At a closed boundary, air molecules are prevented from vibrating, creating a displacement node. The open end always acts as an antinode."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pipe that is open at both ends is vibrating at its fundamental frequency. How many wavelengths fit inside the pipe length L?",
        "options": [
          "0.5 wavelengths",
          "0.25 wavelengths",
          "1.0 wavelength",
          "2.0 wavelengths"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an open pipe, the fundamental frequency has antinodes at both ends and one node in the middle. This distance represents half of a wavelength (L = λ/2)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the harmonics produced by a pipe that is closed at one end?",
        "options": [
          "Only odd harmonics (1st, 3rd, 5th...)",
          "Only even harmonics (2nd, 4th, 6th...)",
          "All harmonics (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)",
          "Only the fundamental frequency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because one end is a node and the other is an antinode, only odd-numbered quarters of a wavelength can fit (1/4λ, 3/4λ, etc.), meaning only odd harmonics resonate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the length of an open pipe is 0.5 meters, what is the wavelength of the sound produced at its fundamental frequency?",
        "options": [
          "1.0 meter",
          "0.5 meters",
          "0.25 meters",
          "2.0 meters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an open pipe at the fundamental frequency, L = λ/2. Therefore, λ = 2L. If L = 0.5m, then λ = 1.0m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the fundamental frequency of a closed pipe compare to an open pipe of the same length L?",
        "options": [
          "The closed pipe has half the frequency (one octave lower).",
          "The closed pipe has double the frequency (one octave higher).",
          "The frequencies are identical.",
          "The closed pipe frequency is four times higher."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An open pipe fundamental is λ = 2L, while a closed pipe fundamental is λ = 4L. Since the closed pipe wavelength is twice as long, its frequency is half as high."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a pipe closed at one end, what is the harmonic number of the pattern that contains exactly 0.75 wavelengths?",
        "options": [
          "3rd harmonic",
          "2nd harmonic",
          "5th harmonic",
          "Fundamental"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "0.75 wavelengths is equal to 3/4λ. In a closed pipe, the harmonics follow the pattern (n/4)λ for odd integers of n. n=3 is the 3rd harmonic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the pitch of a wind instrument (like a flute) as the air inside it warms up?",
        "options": [
          "The pitch increases.",
          "The pitch decreases.",
          "The pitch remains exactly the same.",
          "The pitch becomes infrasonic."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Warm air increases the speed of sound (v). Since the length of the instrument (and thus λ) is constant, and v = fλ, an increase in v results in an increase in frequency (f)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A resonance tube is open at both ends and is 1.2 meters long. What is the wavelength of the second harmonic?",
        "options": [
          "1.2 meters",
          "0.6 meters",
          "2.4 meters",
          "0.3 meters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the second harmonic of an open pipe, the length L is equal to one full wavelength (L = λ). Thus, λ = 1.2 meters."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you blow across the top of a bottle and then fill it halfway with water, what happens to the pitch of the sound produced?",
        "options": [
          "The pitch increases.",
          "The pitch decreases.",
          "The pitch stays the same because the bottle width didn't change.",
          "The sound disappears."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding water shortens the length of the air column (L). A shorter column creates a shorter wavelength, which results in a higher frequency (pitch)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a closed pipe, the distance between a node and the adjacent antinode is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "1/4 of a wavelength",
          "1/2 of a wavelength",
          "One full wavelength",
          "1/8 of a wavelength"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The smallest unit of a standing wave pattern is the distance from a node to the next antinode, which is exactly one-quarter of a full cycle (λ/4)."
