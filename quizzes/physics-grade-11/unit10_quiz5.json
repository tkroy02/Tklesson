    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point charge +Q is at the center of a conducting spherical shell. What is the net charge on the inner surface of the shell?",
        "options": [
          "-Q",
          "+Q",
          "Zero",
          "Variable depending on the radius."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a conductor, the internal electric field must be zero. A charge of -Q must accumulate on the inner surface to perfectly cancel the field from the +Q central charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the plate area of a capacitor is tripled and the plate separation is doubled, what is the new capacitance relative to the original (C)?",
        "options": [
          "1.5 C",
          "6 C",
          "0.67 C",
          "3 C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "C = εA/d. If A becomes 3A and d becomes 2d, the new capacitance is (3/2)C or 1.5C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An electron is released from rest in a uniform electric field directed toward the North. In which direction will the electron move?",
        "options": [
          "South",
          "North",
          "East",
          "West"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electric field lines point in the direction a positive charge would move. Since the electron is negative, the force acting on it is opposite to the field direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two 10 Ω resistors are in parallel, and this combination is in series with a 5 Ω resistor. What is the total resistance?",
        "options": [
          "10 Ω",
          "15 Ω",
          "25 Ω",
          "7.5 Ω"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parallel pair is (10*10)/(10+10) = 5 Ω. Adding the 5 Ω series resistor gives 5 + 5 = 10 Ω."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the brightness of a bulb if the voltage across it is doubled, assuming resistance remains constant?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes four times brighter.",
          "It becomes twice as bright.",
          "It becomes half as bright.",
          "It remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Power (brightness) is proportional to the square of the voltage (P = V²/R). Doubling V results in (2)² or 4 times the power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which rule is used to determine the direction of the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field?",
        "options": [
          "Right-Hand Rule (Flat palm)",
          "Left-Hand Rule (Fingers curled)",
          "Lenz's Law",
          "Coulomb's Law"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the RHR: Thumb points with current, fingers point with field, and the palm indicates the direction of the magnetic force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A charged particle moves through a region of space without being deflected. This could indicate:",
        "options": [
          "The electric and magnetic forces are equal and opposite.",
          "There is no magnetic field present.",
          "The particle is moving very slowly.",
          "The particle is moving perpendicular to the electric field."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a velocity selector, the electric force (Fe = qE) and magnetic force (Fm = qvB) cancel each other out for a specific velocity, resulting in zero deflection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solenoid with a current 'I' produces a magnetic field 'B'. If the number of turns per unit length is doubled, what is the new magnetic field?",
        "options": [
          "2 B",
          "4 B",
          "0.5 B",
          "B"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "B = μ₀nI. The magnetic field strength inside a solenoid is directly proportional to the number of turns per unit length (n)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The units of Electric Potential (Volts) are equivalent to:",

          "Joules per Coulomb",
          "Newtons per Coulomb",
          "Joules per Second",
          "Coulombs per Second"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Potential is defined as the work done (energy) per unit charge, which is J/C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wire is moved through a magnetic field, but no current is induced. This is likely because:",
        "options": [
          "The wire is moving parallel to the magnetic field lines.",
          "The wire is moving too fast.",
          "The magnetic field is too strong.",
          "The wire is made of copper."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Induction requires the wire to cut across magnetic field lines. If motion is parallel, there is no change in flux and no force on the charges in the wire."
