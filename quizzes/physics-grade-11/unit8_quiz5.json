    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave?",
        "options": [
          "The direction of particle oscillation relative to the direction of energy transfer.",
          "The speed at which the wave travels through a vacuum.",
          "Only longitudinal waves carry energy through a medium.",
          "Transverse waves require a medium, but longitudinal waves do not."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In transverse waves, particles move perpendicular to the wave direction; in longitudinal waves, they move parallel to it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of a wave source is doubled while the medium remains the same, what happens to the wavelength?",
        "options": [
          "The wavelength is halved.",
          "The wavelength doubles.",
          "The wavelength remains unchanged.",
          "The wavelength quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wave speed is constant in a fixed medium (v = fλ). Therefore, frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which property of a mechanical wave is most directly associated with the amount of energy it carries?",
        "options": [
          "Amplitude",
          "Wavelength",
          "Period",
          "Wave Speed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude. A larger displacement requires more work from the source."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When two wave pulses of equal positive amplitude meet while traveling in opposite directions, what occurs at the moment they overlap?",
        "options": [
          "Pure constructive interference results in a pulse with double the amplitude.",
          "The pulses bounce off each other and reverse direction.",
          "They cancel each other out completely, leaving the medium flat.",
          "Energy is lost as heat, and both pulses disappear."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Principle of Superposition, the displacements add algebraically. Two positive peaks combine to form a larger peak."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a longitudinal wave, what are the regions called where the particles of the medium are spread farthest apart?",
        "options": [
          "Rarefactions",
          "Compressions",
          "Crests",
          "Nodes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rarefactions are low-pressure zones where particles are spread out, similar to troughs in a transverse wave."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does sound travel faster in water than it does in air?",
        "options": [
          "Water is less compressible (more rigid) than air.",
          "Water molecules are closer together, so they collide more frequently.",
          "Water has a lower density than air.",
          "Sound is a transverse wave in water but longitudinal in air."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wave speed depends on the elasticity and density of the medium. Water's high bulk modulus (resistance to compression) makes sound travel much faster than in air."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wave moves through a string. If the tension in the string is increased, what happens to the wave speed?",
        "options": [
          "The wave speed increases.",
          "The wave speed decreases.",
          "The wave speed remains the same.",
          "The wave speed becomes dependent on the amplitude."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a string, v = √(T/μ). Increasing tension (T) increases the speed at which the disturbance propagates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the particles of a medium after a mechanical wave pulse has passed through them?",
        "options": [
          "They return to their original equilibrium positions.",
          "They continue moving in the direction of the wave.",
          "They are permanently displaced by a distance equal to the amplitude.",
          "They stop moving entirely, even if they were moving before."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Waves transport energy, not matter. Particles vibrate temporarily as the energy passes but do not undergo net displacement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding the frequency of a wave?",
        "options": [
          "It is determined solely by the source of the wave.",
          "It changes when the wave moves from one medium to another.",
          "It is calculated by multiplying wave speed by wavelength.",
          "It is measured in units of Meters per Second."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Frequency is a property of the source. While speed and wavelength change when entering a new medium, frequency remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of 'destructive interference' between two waves?",
        "options": [
          "A reduction in the overall displacement of the medium.",
          "An increase in the total energy of the wave system.",
          "The creation of a new wave with a higher frequency.",
          "A permanent change in the speed of the waves."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Destructive interference occurs when a crest meets a trough, causing the displacements to partially or fully cancel out."
