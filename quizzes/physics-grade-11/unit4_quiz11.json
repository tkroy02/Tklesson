      {

        "question": "If a massless rope passes over an ideal pulley, how does the tension on one side compare to the tension on the other?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "The tension is greater on the side with the moving mass.",
          "The tension is the same on both sides.",
          "The tension is zero at the point of contact with the pulley.",
          "The tension is doubled on the side being pulled down."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ideal pulley is frictionless and massless, so tension is transmitted undiminished; same on both sides."
