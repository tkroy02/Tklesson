    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bullet of mass m is fired at velocity u toward a stationary block of mass M. What formula represents the total initial momentum of the system before the collision?",
        "options": [
          "(m+M)u",
          "Mu",
          "mu",
          "½mu²"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Momentum = mass × velocity. The block is stationary (velocity = 0), so its momentum is 0. The bullet's momentum is m × u. Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is mu."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The bullet passes through the block and exits with a lower velocity v. If the block moves with velocity V, which equation represents the conservation of momentum?",
        "options": [
          "mu = (m+M)V",
          "mu = mv + MV",
          "mu = mv - MV",
          "u = v + V"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The law of conservation of momentum states: total initial momentum = total final momentum. Initially: p_i = m*u. Finally: the bullet has momentum m*v and the block has momentum M*V. Therefore, m*u = m*v + M*V."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Immediately after the bullet exits, which object will typically have the higher kinetic energy, assuming m is much smaller than M and the bullet is still quite fast?",
        "options": [
          "They will have equal kinetic energy",
          "The block",
          "The bullet",
          "It depends only on the force of the impact"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Kinetic energy KE = ½mv². Even though m is small, v (the bullet's exit speed) is typically very large, making v² enormous. The block's mass M is large but its velocity V is usually small after the collision. Therefore, the term ½mv² for the bullet often dominates, giving it higher kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the block is at a height of 60 m and is hit by the bullet, how long will it take for the block to hit the ground after it starts moving horizontally? (Use g ≈ 9.8 m/s²)",
        "options": [
          "≈12.2 s",
          "It depends on the block's horizontal speed V",
          "≈3.5 s",
          "≈6.1 s"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The vertical fall time for a projectile is independent of its horizontal velocity. Using the equation for vertical displacement from rest: h = ½gt². Solving for t: t = √(2h/g) = √(2*60/9.8) ≈ √(12.24) ≈ 3.5 s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the block's horizontal velocity after impact is V, what is its horizontal range from the original position (0m) when it hits the ground? (Height = h, fall time = t)",
        "options": [
          "V × h",
          "½ Vt²",
          "V² / (2g)",
          "V × √(2h/g)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For projectile motion, horizontal range = horizontal velocity × time of flight. The time of flight for an object falling from height h is t = √(2h/g). Therefore, the range R = V × t = V × √(2h/g)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As the bullet passes through the block, work is done against friction and deformation. What happens to the total mechanical energy of the system (bullet + block)?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases",
          "It increases",
          "It remains constant",
          "It doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is not conserved when non-conservative forces (like friction) do work. The bullet does work to deform the block and overcome friction, converting some of the system's initial kinetic energy into heat and sound. Therefore, total mechanical energy decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If we used a 'bouncy' rubber bullet that hit the block and bounced backward instead of passing through, how would the block's final velocity V compare to the 'pass-through' scenario?",
        "options": [
          "V would be exactly the same",
          "V would be zero",
          "V would be higher",
          "V would be lower"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If the bullet bounces back, its change in momentum (Δp_bullet) is greater (e.g., from +mu to -mv). By Newton's Third Law, the impulse on the block is also greater. A greater impulse means a greater change in the block's momentum, resulting in a higher final velocity V for the block."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of Newton's laws explains why the force the bullet exerts on the block is equal to the force the block exerts on the bullet?",
        "options": [
          "Newton's Second Law",
          "Newton's First Law",
          "The Law of Universal Gravitation",
          "Newton's Third Law"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law states: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The force of the bullet on the block and the force of the block on the bullet are an action-reaction pair, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the mass of the block M were doubled, but the bullet's momentum change (Δp_bullet) remained the same, what would happen to the block's final velocity V?",
        "options": [
          "It would become zero",
          "It would double",
          "It would be halved",
          "It would stay the same"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The impulse on the block equals the bullet's change in momentum (Δp_bullet), and also equals the block's change in momentum (Δp_block = M*V, assuming it starts at rest). If Δp_bullet is constant and M doubles, then V must be halved to keep the product M*V constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the collision, the bullet is inside the block for a time Δt. The average force exerted on the block is:",
        "options": [
          "MV × Δt",
          "½MV²",
          "Mg",
          "MV / Δt"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "By the Impulse-Momentum Theorem, the average force on the block is: F_avg = Δp_block / Δt. The block's change in momentum is Δp_block = M*V (if it starts from rest). Therefore, F_avg = (M*V) / Δt."

        "0": "Start with the basics: Momentum (p=mv) is conserved in a system with no external forces. A force acting over time (impulse) changes an object's momentum."
