          "Remain the same.",
          "Decrease by half.",
          "Double.",
          "Quadruple."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$f_k = \\mu_k F_N$, so doubling $F_N$ doubles $f_k$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wider tire on a car (assuming same material and load) provides:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Significantly more friction than a narrow tire.",
          "Significantly less friction than a narrow tire.",
          "The same amount of friction.",
          "No friction at all."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Friction depends on normal force and coefficient, not contact area (for most materials)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To keep an object moving at a constant velocity across a rough floor, the applied force must:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Be greater than the maximum static friction.",
          "Be exactly equal to the kinetic friction.",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block is on an incline. If the component of weight acting down the incline is $20\\text{ N}$ and the maximum static friction is $25\\text{ N}$, what happens?",

        "options": [
          "The block slides down.",

          "The block's mass increases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Down force $20\\text{ N}$ is less than max static friction $25\\text{ N}$, so block remains at rest."

          "Downward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tires push backward on road; road pushes forward on tires (static friction) to accelerate car."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The maximum static friction is given by:",

          "Constant: $f_k = \\mu_k N$",
          "Always greater than static friction",
          "Independent of normal force"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Kinetic friction is constant for given surfaces and normal force: $f_k = \\mu_k F_N$."
      },

          "$\\mu_s$ varies, $\\mu_k$ constant"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Static friction is generally harder to overcome, so $\\mu_s > \\mu_k$ for most materials."

          "$2.5\\text{ m/s}^2$ East"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$F_{net} = 25 - 15 = 10\\text{ N}$ East. $a = F_{net}/m = 10/10 = 1.0\\text{ m/s}^2$ East."
