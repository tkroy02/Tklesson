        "question": "Inertia is a property of an object that is directly related to its:",

        "options": [
          "Velocity",
          "Weight",
          "Mass",
          "Volume"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inertia = resistance to change in motion. More mass = more inertia."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical quantity is described as the 'measure of inertia'?",

          "Acceleration",
          "Force",
          "Speed",
          "Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Mass quantifies how much an object resists acceleration; it is the measure of inertia."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is moving in a straight line with a constant speed, it is in a state of:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Static equilibrium",
          "Dynamic equilibrium",
          "Non-equilibrium",
          "Constant acceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Dynamic equilibrium = constant velocity (moving at constant speed in straight line)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do passengers in a car lurch forward when the driver slams on the brakes?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "A 'force of motion' pushes them forward.",
          "Their inertia carries them forward.",
          "The car exerts a forward force on the passengers.",
          "Air pressure inside the car increases toward the front."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's First Law: passengers continue moving forward due to inertia while car slows down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An astronaut in deep space (zero gravity) throws a wrench. What happens to the wrench after it leaves the astronaut's hand?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "It slows down and stops as its force of motion runs out.",
          "It moves in a circle around the astronaut.",
          "It continues at a constant velocity in a straight line indefinitely.",
          "It immediately drops 'downward' relative to the astronaut."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "No net force acts on wrench in deep space, so it continues at constant velocity (Newton's First Law)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the 'Correct View' regarding a ball rolling on grass that eventually stops?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Its force of motion has been used up.",
          "It stops because there is no net force acting on it.",
          "It stops because of frictional force.",
          "It stops because it naturally prefers to be at rest."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ball stops due to friction (external force), not because 'force of motion runs out'."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heavy sign hangs stationary from two vertical wires. Which statement is correct?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "There are no forces acting on the sign because it is at rest.",
          "The upward tension forces balance the downward weight.",
          "The net force is directed upward to keep the sign from falling.",
          "The sign is in dynamic equilibrium."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sign at rest → equilibrium → net force = 0. Upward tension balances downward weight."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are in a smoothly moving train traveling at a constant velocity and you drop a ball, where does it land?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Directly below your hand.",
          "Well behind you because the train moves forward.",
          "Well in front of you.",
          "It follows a curved path toward the back of the train."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ball has same horizontal velocity as train, so relative to you, it falls straight down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A skydiver falling at 'terminal velocity' has reached a point where the air resistance equals their weight. What is their acceleration?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "$9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$ downward",
          "$0\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "Increasing as they fall",
          "Dependent on their initial jump height"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Net force = weight - air resistance = 0, so $a = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A crate is pushed across a rough floor at a constant speed. Which horizontal forces are acting on it?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Only the applied push.",
          "A push and an equal friction force in opposite directions.",
          "A push and a smaller friction force.",
          "No horizontal forces act because the speed is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant speed → equilibrium → net force = 0. Applied push = friction in opposite direction."
