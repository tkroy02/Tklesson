    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is dropped from a height and bounces back up. Considering the ball and Earth together as a system, what happens to the total momentum?",
        "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "Remains constant", "Becomes zero"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In an isolated system (ball + Earth), total momentum is conserved. As the ball falls, Earth moves imperceptibly upward, maintaining constant total momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A glass cup and a plastic cup fall from the same height onto a hard floor. The glass shatters while the plastic bounces. Which experiences the greater magnitude of impulse?",
        "options": ["Glass cup", "Plastic cup", "Same for both", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both have identical mass and impact velocity, so they have the same change in momentum (impulse magnitude). The material affects force distribution, not total impulse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical cars crash into identical barriers. Car A stops in 0.1 seconds, Car B in 0.2 seconds. Which car experiences greater average force during the crash?",
        "options": ["Car A", "Car B", "Same force", "Need more information"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$F_{avg} = Δp/Δt$. Same $Δp$ (identical cars, same speed) but smaller $Δt$ means larger $F_{avg}$. Car A's shorter stopping time means greater average force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an elastic collision between two objects, which of the following is conserved that is NOT conserved in a perfectly inelastic collision?",
        "options": ["Total momentum", "Total kinetic energy", "Total velocity", "Individual momenta"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total momentum is conserved in ALL collisions. Total kinetic energy is conserved ONLY in elastic collisions and is NOT conserved in inelastic collisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Airbags in cars reduce injury during collisions primarily by:",
        "options": ["Reducing the change in momentum", "Increasing the stopping time", "Decreasing the car's mass", "Increasing the friction force"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Airbags increase collision time ($Δt$). Since $F_{avg} = Δp/Δt$, increasing $Δt$ reduces the average force on passengers, minimizing injury."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person standing on frictionless ice throws a heavy ball horizontally. How does the person's recoil speed compare if they throw the ball harder?",
        "options": ["Greater recoil speed", "Smaller recoil speed", "Same recoil speed", "No recoil occurs"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Momentum conservation: initial total $p=0$. Throwing harder gives ball greater forward momentum, so person must gain greater backward momentum → greater recoil speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball of mass $m$ hits a wall with speed $v$ and sticks to it. Another identical ball hits the same wall with the same speed $v$ and bounces back with speed $v$. Which ball experiences greater magnitude of impulse from the wall?",
        "options": ["The ball that sticks", "The ball that bounces", "Same impulse for both", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Impulse = $Δp$. Sticking ball: $Δp = 0 - mv = -mv$ (magnitude $mv$). Bouncing ball: $Δp = -mv - mv = -2mv$ (magnitude $2mv$). Bouncing ball has double the impulse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rocket accelerates upward in space (far from any planet) by expelling exhaust gases downward. This demonstrates:",
        "options": ["Newton's First Law", "Conservation of energy", "Conservation of momentum", "Action-reaction pairs"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The rocket+exhaust is an isolated system. Expelling mass (exhaust) downward gives it downward momentum, so the rocket gains upward momentum to conserve total system momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A small car and a large truck have a head-on collision at equal speeds. Which vehicle experiences the greater magnitude of force during the collision?",
        "options": ["The small car", "The large truck", "Same force on both", "Depends on their speeds"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law: forces are equal and opposite. The force on the car from the truck equals the force on the truck from the car during contact."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the total momentum of a system to remain constant, the system must be:",
        "options": ["At rest", "Isolated from external forces", "Composed of equal masses", "Undergoing elastic collisions only"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Conservation of momentum requires the system to be isolated (net external force = 0). Internal forces can change individual momenta but not the total."

        "0": "Start with the basic principles: momentum = mass × velocity, impulse changes momentum, and momentum is conserved in isolated systems."
