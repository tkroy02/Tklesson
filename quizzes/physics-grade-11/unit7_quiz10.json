    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two stationary blocks, Block A and Block B, sit on a frictionless horizontal plane. Block A has a mass three times that of Block B. A constant horizontal force $F$ is applied to Block A, pushing it across a distance $d$. The force is then removed and applied to Block B, pushing it across the exact same distance $d$. At the moment each block has traveled the distance $d$, which of the following is true?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "$p_B = p_A$ and $KE_B = KE_A$",
          "$p_B = \\sqrt{3}p_A$ and $KE_B = 3KE_A$",
          "$p_B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}p_A$ and $KE_B = KE_A$",
          "$p_B = p_A$ and $KE_B = \\frac{1}{3}KE_A$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Work $Fd$ gives same $KE$. $p \\propto \\sqrt{m}$, so $p_B/p_A = \\sqrt{1/3} = 1/\\sqrt{3}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly inelastic one-dimensional collision, what initial condition is required for the system to lose 100% of its kinetic energy?",

          "It is physically impossible to lose all kinetic energy in any collision."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "100% KE loss means final velocity = 0 ⇒ total momentum = 0."

        "question": "A 50 g ping-pong ball is traveling at a high speed when it strikes a stationary 2.5 kg steel sphere in a one-dimensional elastic collision. The ping-pong ball rebounds in the opposite direction. After the interaction, how do the magnitude of momentum ($p$) and the kinetic energy ($K$) of the ping-pong ball compare to those of the steel sphere?",

          "The ping-pong ball has a smaller magnitude of momentum and less kinetic energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Light object rebounds with nearly same speed, so its $p$ is smaller but retains most KE."

        "question": "An observer on a riverbank sees a boat with two passengers drifting downstream at a constant velocity $v$. One passenger at the front of the boat throws a heavy gear bag toward the passenger at the rear. While the bag is in the air—and neglecting any water resistance—the velocity of the boat is:",
