    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid metal sphere has a radius R. If the temperature increases by ΔT, what is the fractional change in its volume (ΔV / V₀)?",
        "options": [
          "3αΔT",
          "αΔT",
          "α³ΔT",
          "4/3παΔT"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since volume is a three-dimensional property, the volumetric coefficient β is approximately 3α, making the fractional change 3αΔT."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An aluminum ring is heated. What happens to the area of the hole in the center of the ring?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains unchanged.",
          "It decreases only if the ring is very thick."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thermal expansion acts like a photographic enlargement; every part of the object, including empty spaces, expands outward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A glass bottle (β = 2.7 x 10⁻⁵/°C) is filled with 500 mL of water (β = 21 x 10⁻⁵/°C) at 20°C. If the temperature rises to 50°C, which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "The water expands more than the glass, causing an overflow.",
          "The glass expands more than the water, leaving a gap.",
          "The total volume of the system remains constant.",
          "Only the water expands; the glass volume is fixed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the volumetric expansion coefficient of water is significantly higher than that of glass, the water's volume increases faster than the bottle's capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A steel rod is clamped at both ends so it cannot expand. When heated, what type of stress develops in the rod?",
        "options": [
          "Compressive stress",
          "Tensile stress",
          "Shear stress",
          "No stress is produced."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the rod 'wants' to expand but is prevented by the clamps, the clamps push back, compressing it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following materials would likely require the largest expansion gaps when used in railroad tracks?",
        "options": [
          "Aluminum (α = 24 x 10⁻⁶/°C)",
          "Steel (α = 12 x 10⁻⁶/°C)",
          "Invar (α = 1.2 x 10⁻⁶/°C)",
          "Pyrex glass (α = 3.3 x 10⁻⁶/°C)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The higher the coefficient of linear expansion, the more the material changes length, requiring larger gaps to prevent buckling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metal plate has a length L and width W. After a temperature increase ΔT, what is the new area A?",
        "options": [
          "A₀(1 + 2αΔT)",
          "A₀(1 + αΔT)",
          "A₀(1 + 3αΔT)",
          "A₀(1 + α²ΔT)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For two-dimensional expansion (area), the effective coefficient is approximately 2α, leading to A = A₀(1 + 2αΔT)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a glass container crack when boiling water is poured into it, but a Pyrex container does not?",
        "options": [
          "Pyrex has a much lower coefficient of expansion, reducing internal stress.",
          "Pyrex is much thicker than regular glass.",
          "Regular glass is more flexible than Pyrex.",
          "Pyrex absorbs heat more slowly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Low expansion means the inner and outer surfaces of the glass don't fight against each other as much during rapid temperature changes (thermal shock)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1.0 m copper rod expands by 1.7 mm for a certain ΔT. How much would a 2.0 m copper rod expand under the same conditions?",
        "options": [
          "3.4 mm",
          "1.7 mm",
          "0.85 mm",
          "6.8 mm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expansion ΔL is directly proportional to the initial length L₀. Doubling the length doubles the expansion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason that tight metal lids on glass jars can be loosened by running them under hot water?",
        "options": [
          "The metal lid expands more than the glass jar.",
          "The hot water lubricates the seal.",
          "The glass jar contracts while the lid expands.",
          "The pressure inside the jar increases, pushing the lid up."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metals generally have much higher α values than glass, so the lid becomes slightly loose as it expands away from the glass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the change in length of a 50 m aluminum wire if the temperature drops from 30°C to -10°C. (α = 2.4 x 10⁻⁵/°C)",
        "options": [
          "-0.048 m",
          "0.048 m",
          "-0.012 m",
          "-0.024 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔL = αL₀ΔT = (2.4 x 10⁻⁵)(50)(-40) = -0.048 m. The negative sign indicates contraction."
