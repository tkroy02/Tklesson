        "question": "A remote-controlled car is driving to the right when it enters a sandy patch, causing it to slow down with a constant leftward acceleration of magnitude $0.80 \\text{ m/s}^2$. After $3.5 \\text{ s}$, the car is still moving to the right with a speed of $4.20 \\text{ m/s}$. What was the velocity of the car immediately before it hit the sandy patch?",

        "options": [
          "$4.20 \\text{ m/s}$ to the right",
          "$5.60 \\text{ m/s}$ to the right",
          "$7.00 \\text{ m/s}$ to the right",
          "$8.40 \\text{ m/s}$ to the right"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$v_0 = v - at = 4.20 - (-0.80)(3.5) = 4.20 + 2.80 = 7.00 \\text{ m/s}$."

        "question": "A hockey puck is sliding across a patch of rough ice at an initial velocity of $8.40 \\text{ m/s}$ to the right. The friction from the ice creates a constant leftward acceleration of magnitude $1.20 \\text{ m/s}^2$. How many seconds will it take for the puck to slide to a complete stop?",

          "$7.0 \\text{ s}$",
          "$8.0 \\text{ s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$t = \\frac{v - v_0}{a} = \\frac{0 - 8.40}{-1.20} = \\frac{-8.40}{-1.20} = 7.0 \\text{ s}$."

        "question": "If a body moves with uniform acceleration, which quantity increases linearly with time?",

          "Displacement",
          "Velocity",
          "Acceleration",
          "Distance squared"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For uniform acceleration, $v = u + at$, so velocity increases linearly with time. Displacement increases quadratically ($s \\propto t^2$)."

        "type": "mcq",

          "$s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$",

          "$s = vt - \\frac{1}{2}at^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When starting from rest ($u = 0$), $s = \\frac{1}{2}at^2$ is a special case of $s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$."

        "question": "A car moves with uniform velocity. Which of the following is true?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Acceleration is zero",
          "Displacement is zero",
          "Velocity changes every second",
          "Acceleration is constant but nonzero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Uniform velocity means constant speed in a straight line, so acceleration is zero."

          "Always true",
          "Never true",
          "True only if acceleration is zero",
          "True only at the start"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Equal distances in equal time intervals means constant velocity. For uniform acceleration, velocity changes, so distances are not equal unless acceleration is zero."

        "question": "A body moving with uniform acceleration doubles its velocity in time $t$. How does the displacement in this interval compare to the displacement in the first half of that velocity increase?",

          "Quadruple",
          "Half"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If velocity doubles from $v$ to $2v$, the average velocity is $1.5v$. The time to reach $2v$ is twice the time to reach $v$, so displacement ratio = $(1.5v \\times 2t) / (0.5v \\times t) = 3$ (Triple)."

          "Velocity squared vs displacement"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For constant acceleration, $v = u + at$, so velocity vs time is linear with slope = acceleration (positive if acceleration is positive)."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This equation comes from motion with constant acceleration. The equation itself shows that for any displacement $s$, the relationship holds with the same $a$."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $s \\propto t^2$, then $s = kt^2$. Comparing with $s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$, if $u = 0$, then $\\frac{1}{2}a = k$, so $a = 2k$, which is constant."
