      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A position-time graph is a downward-opening parabola. What does this indicate about the acceleration?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "The acceleration is increasing over time.",
          "The acceleration is zero because the graph is a smooth curve.",
          "The acceleration is constant and positive.",
          "The acceleration is constant and negative."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A parabolic position-time graph indicates constant acceleration. Downward-opening means negative curvature, so acceleration is constant and negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under what condition is the magnitude of the average velocity over an interval equal to the average of the initial and final velocities?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Only when the acceleration is constant.",
          "Always, for any type of motion.",
          "Only when the object starts from rest.",
          "Only when the displacement is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average velocity = (u + v)/2 only for constant acceleration. For variable acceleration, this relationship does not hold."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the velocity-time graph of an object is a horizontal line, what can you conclude about the position-time graph?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "It must be a horizontal line at the origin.",
          "It must be a parabola.",
          "It must be a straight line with a slope of zero.",
          "It must be a straight line with a non-zero slope."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Horizontal velocity-time graph means constant velocity. Position-time graph is then a straight line with slope equal to that constant velocity (non-zero unless velocity is zero)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two objects are dropped from the same height. Object A is heavy and Object B is light. Ignoring air resistance, which hits the ground with a higher speed?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Object B, because it has less inertia.",
          "Object A, because it has more weight.",
          "It depends on the surface area of the objects.",
          "They both hit the ground at the same speed."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same acceleration due to gravity regardless of mass. They hit the ground with the same speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object's speed is increasing, does its acceleration necessarily have to be increasing?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Yes, a constant acceleration would mean constant speed.",
          "No, but the velocity must be constant.",
          "Yes, because acceleration is the derivative of speed.",
          "No, speed may increase at a constant acceleration."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Constant positive acceleration also causes speed to increase. Acceleration does not need to increase; it just needs to be in the same direction as velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An observer in a moving train sees a ball drop straight down. An observer on the platform sees the ball follow a parabolic path. Who is correct about the ball's motion?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Only the observer on the train, because they are closer to the ball.",
          "Both are correct; motion is relative to the frame of reference.",
          "Only the observer on the platform, because they are stationary.",
          "Neither, the true path is a straight diagonal line."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Motion is relative. Both observers are correct from their respective frames of reference. There is no absolute frame."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a particle's displacement is zero over a time interval, what can be said about its average speed?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "It is equal to the average velocity.",
          "It must be zero.",
          "It must be positive.",
          "It could be zero or positive."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Average speed = distance/time. Displacement zero means average velocity = 0, but distance could be positive (if object moved and returned) or zero (if object never moved). So average speed could be zero or positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the peak of its trajectory, a ball thrown straight up has zero velocity. Is its acceleration also zero at this point?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "It depends on the initial speed of the throw.",
          "No, the acceleration remains a constant downward value.",
          "Yes, because the ball has momentarily stopped.",
          "No, the acceleration is zero only at the moment of release."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gravity acts continuously. At the peak, velocity is zero but acceleration due to gravity is still 9.8 m/s² downward throughout the motion."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels around a circular track at a constant speed. Is the car accelerating?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "No, because the speedometer reading does not change.",
          "Only if it is speeding up or slowing down.",
          "Yes, but only at the start and end of the lap.",
          "Yes, because its direction of motion is constantly changing."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is change in velocity. Since direction changes continuously (even at constant speed), there is centripetal acceleration toward the center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object has a negative acceleration, does it necessarily mean it is slowing down?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "No, but only if the acceleration is changing.",
          "No, it could be speeding up in the negative direction.",
          "Yes, because the velocity vector must be decreasing.",
          "Yes, negative acceleration is the same as deceleration."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Negative acceleration means acceleration vector points in the negative direction. If velocity is also negative, the object speeds up in the negative direction."
