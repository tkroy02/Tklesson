      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 75 kg person stands on a scale in an elevator accelerating upward at 3.0 m/s². What is the scale reading in newtons? Use g = 9.8 m/s².",
        "options": [
          "735 N",
          "960 N",
          "588 N",
          "853 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Scale reading = m(g + a) = 75 × (9.8 + 3.0) = 75 × 12.8 = 960 N"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An elevator moves downward while slowing to a stop. If the passenger’s apparent weight is 20% greater than her true weight, what is the elevator’s acceleration direction?",
        "options": [
          "Upward",
          "Downward",
          "Zero",
          "Cannot determine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Apparent weight > true weight means normal force > mg, so net force upward ⇒ acceleration upward. Slowing while moving downward confirms upward acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 6.0 kg mass hangs from a spring balance in a moving lift. The balance reads 48 N. What is the magnitude of the lift’s acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "1.8 m/s² downward",
          "1.8 m/s² upward",
          "8.0 m/s² downward",
          "8.0 m/s² upward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "48 = 6(9.8 + a) ⇒ 9.8 + a = 8.0 ⇒ a = -1.8 m/s². Negative means acceleration downward (relative to upward positive)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a 55 kg person in an elevator experiences an apparent weight of 450 N, what is the elevator’s acceleration? Use g = 9.8 m/s².",
        "options": [
          "Upward at 1.6 m/s²",
          "Downward at 1.6 m/s²",
          "Upward at 9.8 m/s²",
          "Downward at 9.8 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "450 = 55(9.8 + a) ⇒ 9.8 + a ≈ 8.18 ⇒ a ≈ -1.62 m/s² ⇒ downward acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 12 kg box sits on the floor of an elevator. The normal force from the floor is 132 N. What is the elevator’s acceleration? Use g = 9.8 m/s².",
        "options": [
          "1.2 m/s² upward",
          "1.2 m/s² downward",
          "11.0 m/s² upward",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "N = m(g + a) ⇒ 132 = 12(9.8 + a) ⇒ 9.8 + a = 11 ⇒ a = 1.2 m/s² upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an elevator cable snaps and the elevator falls freely, what does a scale read for a person inside?",
        "options": [
          "Their normal weight",
          "More than their weight",
          "Less than their weight",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Free fall means a = g downward ⇒ apparent weight = m(g - g) = 0. Scale reads zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the top of a Ferris wheel turning at constant speed, a 60 kg rider feels a normal force of 570 N from the seat. If the wheel’s radius is 12 m, what is the speed of the rider? Use g = 9.8 m/s².",

          "1.90 m/s",
          "3.00 m/s",
          "4.50 m/s",
          "6.00 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "mg - N = mv²/r ⇒ 588 - 570 = 60(v²/12) ⇒ 18 = 5v² ⇒ v² = 3.6 ⇒ v ≈ 1.90 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A roller coaster car goes over a circular hill of radius 25 m at 10 m/s. A 70 kg passenger is at the top. Calculate the normal force from the seat at that instant. Use g = 9.8 m/s².",
        "options": [

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "N = m(g - v²/r) = 70(9.8 - 100/25) = 70(9.8 - 4) = 70 × 5.8 = 406 N."

          "4 mg"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Apparent weight = m(g + a) = m(g + 3g) = 4mg. So it's 4 times their normal weight."
