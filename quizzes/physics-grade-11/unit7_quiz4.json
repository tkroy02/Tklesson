      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the property of 'Specific Heat Capacity'?",
        "options": [
          "The energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1°C.",
          "The total thermal energy contained within a substance at 100°C.",
          "The speed at which heat moves through a specific material.",
          "The temperature at which a substance changes phase from solid to liquid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Specific heat capacity is a measure of how much energy is needed to change the temperature of a specific amount of mass. It is a 'per kilogram' property."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add the same amount of heat energy to equal masses of water and lead, why does the lead reach a much higher temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Lead has a higher specific heat capacity than water.",
          "Water molecules are physically larger and move slower.",
          "Lead has a lower specific heat capacity, meaning it is less 'resistant' to temperature change.",
          "Water reflects the heat while lead absorbs it."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Substances with low specific heat capacities require very little energy to show a large increase in temperature (average kinetic energy)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water has a very high specific heat capacity. How does this affect the climate of cities located near the ocean?",
        "options": [
          "Coastal cities experience extreme temperature swings every day.",
          "The water acts as a thermal buffer, keeping temperatures more moderate and stable.",
          "The water causes the air to heat up faster than in a desert.",
          "Specific heat has no effect on local weather or climate."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because water requires a massive amount of energy to change temperature, it absorbs heat in the summer and releases it in the winter without changing its own temperature drastically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation Q = mcΔT, what does the 'c' represent?",
        "options": [
          "The speed of light",
          "The total heat energy",
          "Specific Heat Capacity",
          "The change in temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In thermodynamics, 'c' is the constant for specific heat capacity, unique to each substance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance with a high 'thermal inertia' would most likely have which property?",
        "options": [
          "A very low boiling point",
          "A high specific heat capacity",
          "High thermal conductivity",
          "A very low mass"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Thermal inertia refers to the resistance to temperature change. A high specific heat capacity provides this resistance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is water often used as a coolant in car engines?",
        "options": [
          "It is the only liquid that does not expand when heated.",
          "It can absorb a large amount of heat with only a small increase in its own temperature.",
          "It is a better conductor than metal.",
          "It has a lower density than other liquids."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Water's high specific heat allows it to carry a lot of energy away from the engine without boiling immediately."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is an intensive property (does not depend on the amount of matter present)?",
        "options": [
          "Thermal Energy",
          "Mass",
          "Specific Heat Capacity",
          "Total Heat Capacity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Specific heat capacity is the same for 1 gram of water as it is for 1000 grams of water. It is a property of the material itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the molecules of a substance with a low specific heat capacity when heat is added?",
        "options": [
          "Their average kinetic energy increases rapidly.",
          "They grow in size but do not move faster.",
          "They absorb energy into vibrations without increasing speed.",
          "They immediately stop moving."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Low specific heat means most of the added energy goes directly into translational kinetic energy, which we measure as a rapid rise in temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the mass of a substance but add the same amount of heat, what happens to the temperature change (ΔT)?",
        "options": [
          "The temperature change is doubled.",
          "The temperature change is halved.",
          "The temperature change stays the same.",
          "The temperature change becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to Q = mcΔT, ΔT is inversely proportional to mass. Doubling the mass spreads the energy over more particles, resulting in half the temperature rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which material would likely be best for a heat sink in a computer (needs to absorb and dissipate heat quickly)?",
        "options": [
          "A material with high specific heat and low conductivity.",
          "A material with low specific heat and high conductivity.",
          "Wood or plastic.",
          "A material that expands significantly when heated."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A heat sink needs to be able to transfer heat away (high conductivity) and change temperature easily to maintain a gradient (low specific heat)."
