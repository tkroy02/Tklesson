    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), what is the relationship between the restoring force and the displacement from the equilibrium position?",
        "options": [
          "The force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the opposite direction.",
          "The force is inversely proportional to the square of the displacement.",
          "The force is constant regardless of the displacement.",
          "The force is directly proportional to the square of the displacement."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is defined by Hooke's Law (F = -kx). The negative sign indicates that the force always acts to restore the object to equilibrium, opposite to the direction of displacement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At which point in the oscillation of a simple pendulum is the velocity of the bob at its maximum?",
        "options": [
          "At the equilibrium position.",
          "At the points of maximum displacement (amplitude).",
          "Halfway between the equilibrium and the amplitude.",
          "The velocity is constant throughout the entire motion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is at its minimum (zero) and has been entirely converted into kinetic energy, resulting in maximum speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an object in SHM is at its maximum displacement (amplitude), what is the state of its acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "Acceleration is at its maximum magnitude.",
          "Acceleration is zero.",
          "Acceleration is constant and equal to g.",
          "Acceleration is at its minimum non-zero value."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because F = ma and F = -kx, the force is greatest when displacement is greatest. Therefore, acceleration reaches its peak magnitude at the amplitude."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the period of a mass-spring system if the mass is quadrupled (4x) while the spring constant remains the same?",
        "options": [
          "The period doubles.",
          "The period quadruples.",
          "The period is halved.",
          "The period remains unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period T is proportional to the square root of mass (T = 2π√(m/k)). The square root of 4 is 2, so the period doubles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a system undergoing SHM, the total mechanical energy of the system is proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "The square of the amplitude.",
          "The square root of the amplitude.",
          "The amplitude itself.",
          "The frequency of oscillation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total energy in SHM is calculated as E = 1/2 kA². This shows that if you double the amplitude, the energy increases by a factor of four."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a necessary condition for a simple pendulum to exhibit Simple Harmonic Motion?",
        "options": [
          "The angle of displacement must be small (typically less than 15°).",
          "The mass of the bob must be very large.",
          "The string must be elastic.",
          "The pendulum must be in a vacuum."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "SHM requires a restoring force proportional to displacement. For a pendulum, this only holds true at small angles where sin(θ) ≈ θ (the small-angle approximation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is oscillating in SHM with a frequency of 5 Hz, how long does it take to complete one full cycle?",
        "options": [
          "0.2 seconds",
          "5.0 seconds",
          "0.5 seconds",
          "2.0 seconds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period (T) is the reciprocal of frequency (f). T = 1/f = 1/5 = 0.2 seconds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the equilibrium position of an oscillating mass-spring system, which energy form is at its minimum?",
        "options": [
          "Elastic potential energy.",
          "Kinetic energy.",
          "Total mechanical energy.",
          "Thermal energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elastic potential energy is 1/2 kx². At equilibrium, x = 0, so the potential energy is zero (minimum)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the period of a simple pendulum change if it is moved from Earth to the Moon (where gravity is weaker)?",
        "options": [
          "The period increases.",
          "The period decreases.",
          "The period remains the same.",
          "The period becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period is T = 2π√(L/g). Since gravity (g) is in the denominator, a smaller 'g' results in a larger 'T' (a slower swing)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the characteristic shape of a displacement-time graph for an object in SHM?",
        "options": [
          "A sine or cosine wave.",
          "A straight line with a constant slope.",
          "A series of sharp, triangular peaks.",
          "A parabola."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mathematical 'harmonic' nature of the motion results in a sinusoidal curve (sine or cosine), representing smooth periodic oscillation."
