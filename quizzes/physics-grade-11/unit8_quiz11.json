    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the Doppler Effect?",
        "options": [
          "The change in observed frequency of a wave due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.",
          "The change in the speed of a wave as it moves from one medium into another.",
          "The increase in amplitude that occurs when two waves interfere constructively.",
          "The bending of a wave as it passes around an obstacle or through an opening."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Doppler Effect is the shift in perceived frequency (or wavelength) caused by the motion of the source, the observer, or both, relative to the medium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a sound source moves toward a stationary observer, what happens to the perceived pitch and the observed wavelength?",
        "options": [
          "The pitch increases and the wavelength decreases.",
          "The pitch decreases and the wavelength increases.",
          "Both the pitch and the wavelength increase.",
          "The pitch increases but the wavelength remains constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the source moves toward the observer, wave fronts are emitted closer together in space, shortening the wavelength and increasing the frequency (pitch)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An observer is moving away from a stationary siren. Compared to the actual frequency of the siren, the frequency heard by the observer is:",
        "options": [
          "Lower",
          "Higher",
          "The same",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By moving away, the observer intercepts fewer wave crests per second than they would if stationary, resulting in a lower perceived frequency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In astronomy, when a galaxy is moving away from Earth, its light spectrum is shifted toward longer wavelengths. This is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Redshift",
          "Blueshift",
          "Ultraviolet shift",
          "Gamma shift"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because red light has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum, a Doppler shift toward longer wavelengths is called a redshift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when an aircraft travels at exactly the speed of sound (Mach 1)?",
        "options": [
          "Wave fronts pile up in front of the aircraft to create a 'sound barrier'.",
          "The sound waves are stretched to infinite length.",
          "No sound can be produced by the aircraft's engines.",
          "The Doppler Effect no longer applies."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At Mach 1, the source travels at the same speed as the waves it emits, causing the wave fronts to overlap at the front of the craft, creating a high-pressure shock front."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Sonic Boom' is heard on the ground when an airplane:",
        "options": [
          "Travels faster than the speed of sound, creating a conical shock wave.",
          "Breaks through a physical cloud of water vapor.",
          "Engine hits its maximum RPM.",
          "Accelerates from rest to any speed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Supersonic travel creates a 3D 'Mach Cone' of overlapping wave fronts. When this high-pressure cone passes an observer, it is heard as a sudden boom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a source of sound is stationary and the observer moves toward it at 50 m/s, how does the speed of the sound waves relative to the observer change?",
        "options": [
          "The relative speed increases.",
          "The relative speed decreases.",
          "The relative speed remains 340 m/s.",
          "The speed of sound becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The wave speed relative to the medium stays the same, but because the observer is moving toward the waves, the waves pass the observer at a higher relative velocity (v_wave + v_obs)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Police use 'Radar Guns' to measure car speeds. This technology relies on the Doppler Effect applied to:",
        "options": [
          "Radio waves",
          "Sound waves",
          "Infrasonic waves",
          "Visible light waves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) uses the frequency shift of radio waves reflected off a moving vehicle to calculate its speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A source emits a frequency f. If the source moves away from a stationary observer at a speed equal to the speed of sound (vs = v), what frequency does the observer hear?",
        "options": [
          "0.5f",
          "2f",
          "f (No change)",
          "Infinite frequency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the formula f' = f[v / (v + vs)], if vs = v, then f' = f[v / (v + v)] = f(1/2) = 0.5f."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following does NOT affect the magnitude of the Doppler shift heard by an observer?",
        "options": [
          "The loudness (amplitude) of the sound.",
          "The speed of the source.",
          "The speed of the observer.",
          "The speed of sound in the medium."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Doppler Effect relates specifically to frequency and wavelength. The amplitude (loudness) of the wave does not change the frequency shift."
