      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two small spheres with identical charges q are suspended from a single point by strings of length L. At equilibrium, the strings make an angle θ with the vertical. Which expression represents the electrostatic force Fe between them?",
        "options": [
          "Fe = mg tanθ",
          "Fe = mg sinθ",
          "Fe = mg cosθ",
          "Fe = qE"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In equilibrium, the horizontal electrostatic force balances the horizontal component of tension (T sinθ), while the vertical component (T cosθ) balances gravity (mg). Dividing these gives Fe/mg = tanθ."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A +4.0 μC charge is at (0, 3) and a +4.0 μC charge is at (0, -3). What is the net force on a -2.0 μC charge placed at (4, 0)? (All coordinates in meters).",
        "options": [
          "4.6 x 10^-3 N toward the origin",
          "0 N",
          "9.2 x 10^-3 N away from the origin",
          "5.8 x 10^-3 N toward the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distance to each charge is 5m. F_individual = (9e9 * 4e-6 * 2e-6)/25 = 0.00288 N. Vertical components cancel. Net force = 2 * F * cosθ = 2 * 0.00288 * (4/5) = 0.0046 N."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A +Q charge and a +9Q charge are separated by distance L. At what distance from +Q is the net electric force on a third charge zero?",

          "L/3",
          "L/10",
          "3L/4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Setting forces equal: kQq/x² = k(9Q)q/(L-x)². Taking the root: 1/x = 3/(L-x) -> L-x = 3x -> x = L/4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two charges q1 = +8μC and q2 = -2μC are 20 cm apart. Where can a third charge be placed so that it experiences no net force?",
        "options": [
          "20 cm to the right of q2 (outside the charges)",

          "20 cm to the left of q1",
          "40 cm to the right of q2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For opposite charges, equilibrium is outside, near the smaller charge. sqrt(8)/(0.2+x) = sqrt(2)/x -> 2/(0.2+x) = 1/x -> 2x = 0.2 + x -> x = 0.2m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Three identical charges +q are placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle with side length a. What is the magnitude of the net force on any one of the charges?",

          "0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The force is the vector sum of two forces (F = kq²/a²) at a 60° angle. Using the law of cosines: F_net = sqrt(F² + F² + 2F² cos 60°) = sqrt(3)F."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two charges A and B are separated by a distance R. If the charge on A is doubled, the charge on B is doubled, and the distance is halved, the force becomes:",

          "16 times the original force.",

          "4 times the original force.",
          "The same as the original force."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "F ∝ (q1*q2)/r². Factor change = (2 * 2) / (0.5)² = 4 / 0.25 = 16."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An electron and a proton are separated by 0.53 x 10^-10 m. How does the electrostatic force Fe compare to the gravitational force Fg between them?",
        "options": [
          "Fe is roughly 10^39 times stronger than Fg.",
          "Fe is roughly equal to Fg.",
          "Fg is stronger because it is always attractive.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the subatomic scale, the high value of k compared to G makes electrostatic forces vastly more powerful than gravity."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "q2 experiences two attractive forces (magnitude F=kq²/L²) along the x and y axes. The resultant is sqrt(F² + F²) = sqrt(2)F."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "q = sqrt(Fr²/k). q = sqrt(0.040 * 0.03² / 9e9) = sqrt(4e-15) ≈ 6.3e-8 C."
