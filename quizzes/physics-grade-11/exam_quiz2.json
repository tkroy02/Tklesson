        "question": "A student measures the diameter of a wire five times using a micrometer and records the following measurements: 2.45 mm, 2.46 mm, 2.44 mm, 2.47 mm, and 2.45 mm. The manufacturer specifies the true diameter as 2.50 mm. How would you characterize these measurements in terms of accuracy and precision?",

          "Neither accurate nor precise"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The average of the measurements is (2.45 + 2.46 + 2.44 + 2.47 + 2.45)/5 = 12.27/5 = 2.454 mm. The true value is 2.50 mm, so the measurements are off by about 0.046 mm, making them not accurate. However, the measurements are all within a range of 0.03 mm (2.47 - 2.44 = 0.03 mm), showing good reproducibility and therefore good precision. Thus, the measurements are precise but not accurate."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, consider the multiplication: 18.45 has four significant figures, but 2.2 has only two significant figures. Their product should have two significant figures. 18.45 × 2.2 = 40.59, which rounds to 41 (two significant figures). Then add 41 + 6.78 = 47.78. When adding, we look at decimal places: 41 has no decimal places (it's essentially 41 with uncertainty in the ones place), and 6.78 has two decimal places. The result should have no decimal places, so 47.78 rounds to 48. Therefore, the final answer with correct significant figures is 48."
