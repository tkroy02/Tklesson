    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Three containers of different shapes (one narrow, one wide, and one zig-zag) are filled to the same height with water. How does the pressure at the bottom of the containers compare?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure is highest in the narrow container.",
          "The pressure is highest in the wide container.",
          "The pressure is the same in all three containers.",
          "The pressure is highest in the zig-zag container."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "According to the formula P = ρgh, hydrostatic pressure depends only on the density of the fluid, the gravitational field, and the vertical depth. It is independent of the container's shape or horizontal dimensions (the Hydrostatic Paradox)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a static fluid, how does the pressure act at a specific point at a certain depth?",
        "options": [
          "Only in the downward direction.",
          "Only in the upward and downward directions.",
          "Equally in all directions.",
          "Only perpendicular to the walls of the container."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a static fluid, the pressure at any point is isotropic, meaning it is exerted equally in all directions. This is why a submerged balloon is squeezed from all sides rather than just from the top."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Pascal's Principle, what happens when you apply pressure to one part of a confined, incompressible fluid?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure increases only at the bottom of the container.",
          "The pressure increases equally throughout the entire fluid.",
          "The pressure decreases at other points to balance the system.",
          "The pressure is absorbed by the fluid's viscosity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pascal's Principle states that any change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and to the walls of the containing vessel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a dam need to be much thicker at the bottom than at the top?",
        "options": [
          "To support the weight of the air above the water.",
          "Because water is denser at the bottom of the lake.",
          "Because water pressure increases with depth.",
          "To prevent the water from becoming a gas at high pressures."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since P = ρgh, the water pressure increases linearly with depth. The bottom of the dam must withstand a significantly higher force per unit area than the top, requiring a thicker, stronger base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you dive into a swimming pool filled with mercury (density 13,600 kg/m³) instead of water (1,000 kg/m³), how would the pressure at a depth of 1 meter compare?",
        "options": [
          "It would be the same as in water.",
          "It would be much higher than in water.",
          "It would be slightly lower because mercury is a metal.",
          "It would be zero because mercury is opaque."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pressure is directly proportional to the density of the fluid. Because mercury is 13.6 times denser than water, the hydrostatic pressure at any given depth would be 13.6 times higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two points, A and B, are located in a large lake. Point A is 5 m deep, and Point B is also 5 m deep but is located under a large overhanging rock. How does the pressure at A compare to B?",
        "options": [
          "Pressure at A is higher because there is no rock blocking the water column.",
          "Pressure at B is higher because of the weight of the rock.",
          "The pressures at A and B are equal.",
          "The pressure depends on the temperature of the rock."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pressure is a function of the vertical distance to the free surface. Since both points are at the same depth and are part of the same continuous fluid, the pressure is identical regardless of the rock overhang."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best explains why the absolute pressure at the bottom of a lake is higher than the gauge pressure?",
        "options": [
          "Absolute pressure includes the atmospheric pressure acting on the surface.",
          "Gauge pressure includes the weight of the lake bed.",
          "Absolute pressure is only used for gases, not liquids.",
          "Atmospheric pressure only acts on the shores of the lake."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute pressure is the total pressure at a point, which is the sum of the pressure from the fluid (gauge pressure) and the atmospheric pressure pressing down on the fluid's surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would happen to the pressure at the bottom of a water tank if it were moved to the Moon, where gravity is about 1/6 that of Earth?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure would increase due to the lack of atmosphere.",
          "The pressure would remain exactly the same.",
          "The pressure would be significantly lower.",
          "The water would float away, so pressure would be zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the formula P = ρgh, 'g' represents the gravitational field strength. On the Moon, 'g' is much smaller, meaning the weight of the water column is smaller, thus exerting less pressure on the bottom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a U-shaped tube filled with two different non-mixing liquids, the liquid with the lower density will:",
        "options": [
          "Have a higher column height to balance the pressure.",
          "Have a lower column height.",
          "Always sink to the bottom of the tube.",
          "Disappear due to evaporation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the interface where the liquids meet, the pressure from both sides must be equal. Since P = ρgh, the liquid with the smaller density (ρ) must have a larger height (h) to produce the same pressure as the denser liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person is snorkeling at a depth of 0.5 m. Why can't they use a very long snorkel (e.g., 10 m) to breathe while standing on the bottom of a deep lake?",
        "options": [
          "The air in the snorkel would turn into a liquid.",
          "The external water pressure on their chest would make it impossible to expand their lungs.",
          "The air at the top of the tube is too thin to breathe.",
          "Water would leak into the snorkel from the bottom."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To inhale, your chest muscles must expand the lungs against the external pressure. At a depth of 10 m, the water pressure is roughly double atmospheric pressure, which is far too strong for human chest muscles to overcome."
