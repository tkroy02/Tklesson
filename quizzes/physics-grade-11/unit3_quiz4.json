      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a projectile's launch speed is doubled while keeping the angle constant, what happens to its horizontal range (on level ground)?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "The range doubles.",
          "The range triples.",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Range $R \\propto v^2$. If speed doubles, $v^2$ quadruples, so range quadruples."

          "Vertical velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "No horizontal force means horizontal acceleration = 0, so horizontal velocity is constant."
