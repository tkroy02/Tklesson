        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From F = k(L − L₀): 4 = k(0.24 − L₀), 7 = k(0.28 − L₀). Divide: 7/4 = (0.28 − L₀)/(0.24 − L₀) → 1.75(0.24 − L₀) = 0.28 − L₀ → 0.42 − 1.75L₀ = 0.28 − L₀ → 0.14 = 0.75L₀ → L₀ ≈ 0.1867 m = 18.67 cm."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Max force = kx_max = 400 × 0.15 = 60 N. Mass = F/g = 60 / 10 = 6 kg."

        "explanation": "9 = k(0.16 − L₀), 15 = k(0.22 − L₀). Dividing: 15/9 = (0.22 − L₀)/(0.16 − L₀) → 5/3 = (0.22 − L₀)/(0.16 − L₀) → 0.8 − 5L₀ = 0.66 − 3L₀ → 0.14 = 2L₀ → L₀ = 0.07 m = 7.0 cm."
