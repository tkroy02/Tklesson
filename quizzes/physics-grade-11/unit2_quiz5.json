      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two cars travel with equal velocities in opposite directions. Relative velocity between them is:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Equal to velocity of one car",
          "Double the velocity of one car",
          "Half the velocity of one car"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Relative velocity = $v - (-v) = v + v = 2v$, which is double the velocity of one car."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A body accelerates uniformly from 5 m/s to 15 m/s in 10 s. Its average velocity is:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "5 m/s",
          "10 m/s",
          "15 m/s",
          "20 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For uniform acceleration, average velocity = $\\frac{u + v}{2} = \\frac{5 + 15}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$ m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If displacement is zero but the body is moving, its velocity must be:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Nonzero",
          "Increasing",
          "Constant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the body is moving, it has instantaneous velocity. Displacement can be zero if it returns to start, but velocity during motion is nonzero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car moving with uniform acceleration covers 100 m in 4 s. What can you say about initial and final velocities?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Initial and final velocities are equal",
          "Final velocity is greater than initial velocity",
          "Initial velocity is greater than final velocity",
          "Cannot determine"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since it covers distance in positive time with uniform acceleration, the car must be speeding up, so final velocity > initial velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car moves such that $v \\propto t$. Which of the following is true?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Acceleration is zero",
          "Acceleration is constant",
          "Acceleration is increasing",
          "Acceleration is decreasing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $v \\propto t$, then $v = kt$. Comparing with $v = u + at$, if $u = 0$, then $a = k$, which is constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car accelerates to twice its initial velocity. How does stopping distance change if deceleration remains constant?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Remains the same",
          "Doubles",
          "Quadruples",
          "Halves"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stopping distance $s = \\frac{v^2}{2a}$. If velocity doubles, $v^2$ quadruples, so stopping distance quadruples."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Displacement-time graph is a positive slope. What can you conclude?",

        "options": [
          "Velocity is constant",
          "Acceleration is constant",
          "Velocity is increasing",
          "Acceleration is zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A straight line on displacement-time graph means constant slope, which indicates constant velocity. Positive slope means velocity is positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vehicle decelerates to half its speed over a certain distance. If deceleration is constant, stopping distance is:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Half the original distance",
          "Quarter of the original distance",
          "Double the original distance",
          "Equal to original distance"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If speed halves from $v$ to $v/2$ over distance $s$, then using $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$, stopping distance from $v/2$ to $0$ is $\\frac{(v/2)^2}{2a} = \\frac{v^2/4}{2a} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{v^2}{2a} = \\frac{1}{4}$ of the distance from $v$ to $0$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two vehicles start from the same point. Vehicle A accelerates uniformly, Vehicle B moves at constant velocity. Which overtakes which?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "A overtakes B eventually",
          "B overtakes A eventually",
          "Both remain together",
          "Cannot tell"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vehicle A starts from rest (usually) and accelerates, so its velocity increases. Eventually A's velocity exceeds B's constant velocity, and A will overtake B if given enough time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car accelerates uniformly for a certain time, then decelerates uniformly to stop over the same distance. Final velocity at midpoint is:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Equal to initial velocity",
          "Maximum",
          "Cannot determine"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The car speeds up to a maximum at the midpoint (where acceleration ends and deceleration begins), then slows down. So velocity is maximum at the midpoint."
