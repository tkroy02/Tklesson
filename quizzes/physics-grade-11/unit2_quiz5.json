        "question": "Two blocks are connected by a light string over a frictionless pulley. Block A (4.0 kg) hangs vertically, and Block B (6.0 kg) rests on a horizontal frictionless surface. What is the tension in the string?",

          "31.4 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let $a$ be acceleration magnitude. For hanging mass: $m_Ag - T = m_A a$. For horizontal mass: $T = m_B a$. Adding: $m_Ag = (m_A + m_B)a \\rightarrow a = 3.92$ m/s². Then $T = m_B a = 6.0 \\times 3.92 = 23.5$ N."
