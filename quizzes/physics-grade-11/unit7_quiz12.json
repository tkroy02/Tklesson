        "question": "A passenger is standing in the aisle of a high-speed train traveling at a constant velocity of 120 km/h. The train suddenly strikes a massive track obstruction and comes to an immediate halt. If we neglect friction between the passenger's shoes and the floor, what describes the passenger's motion at the moment of impact?",

        "options": [
          "The passenger stops instantly along with the train.",
          "The passenger continues moving forward at 120 km/h relative to the ground.",
          "The passenger is thrown backward at 120 km/h relative to the train's motion.",
          "The passenger's velocity immediately increases due to the conservation of energy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's First Law: no horizontal force, so passenger continues at 120 km/h."
