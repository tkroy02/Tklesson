    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a substance is at its boiling point and heat is continuously added, the temperature remains constant. What is the 'missing' energy doing at the microscopic level?",
        "options": [
          "It is performing work to completely overcome intermolecular attractive forces.",
          "It is increasing the average speed of the molecules within the liquid.",
          "It is being used to increase the atmospheric pressure around the substance.",
          "It is being converted into chemical energy via a reaction with the container."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Latent heat of vaporization is the energy required to pull molecules far enough apart that they are no longer bound by liquid-phase attractions, increasing potential energy rather than kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The latent heat of vaporization for water is approximately 2.26 x 10⁶ J/kg, while the latent heat of fusion is 3.34 x 10⁵ J/kg. Why is there such a large difference?",
        "options": [
          "Vaporization requires total separation of molecules, while fusion only requires loosening them.",
          "Water molecules are physically larger in the gas phase than in the solid phase.",
          "Melting happens at a lower temperature, so it naturally requires less energy.",
          "Gravity pulls harder on liquid water than it does on steam."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecules in a gas are nearly independent, requiring massive energy to break all bonds, whereas liquid molecules remain in close contact and only need their lattice structure disrupted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following occurs when a gas undergoes deposition into a solid state?",
        "options": [
          "Thermal energy is released to the surroundings.",
          "The average kinetic energy of the molecules increases.",
          "The molecules gain potential energy from the environment.",
          "The process absorbs heat, making the surroundings colder."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moving from a high-energy gas phase to a low-energy solid phase requires the substance to discard its internal potential energy (exothermic process)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.5 kg block of ice at 0°C is placed in a warm room. If 167,000 J of heat is absorbed by the ice, what is the final state of the substance? (Lf = 334,000 J/kg)",
        "options": [
          "It is entirely liquid water at 0°C.",
          "It is a mixture of ice and water at 0°C.",
          "It is entirely liquid water at a temperature above 0°C.",
          "It is still a solid block of ice at 0°C."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using Q = mL, the energy required to melt the block is (0.5 kg)(334,000 J/kg) = 167,000 J. Since the heat provided exactly equals this, the ice melts completely but remains at 0°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a 'mist' or 'fog' often appear when you open a freezer or breathe out on a cold day?",
        "options": [
          "Water vapor in the air loses energy and condenses into tiny liquid droplets.",
          "The cold air causes the gas molecules to expand and become visible.",
          "The oxygen in the air is freezing into solid crystals.",
          "The freezer is releasing pre-made steam into the room."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rapid cooling of warm, moist air forces the water vapor to undergo an exothermic phase change (condensation) into visible liquid droplets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a heating curve, the slope of the line representing liquid water is less steep than the slope representing ice. What does this tell you?",
        "options": [
          "Liquid water has a higher specific heat capacity than ice.",
          "Ice has a higher specific heat capacity than liquid water.",
          "Both phases have identical specific heat capacities.",
          "Specific heat capacity is irrelevant to the slope of a heating curve."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A shallower slope means more energy is required to raise the temperature by one degree. Since water (c ≈ 4186 J/kg·C) requires more energy than ice (c ≈ 2100 J/kg·C), its slope is flatter."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the mass of a substance undergoing a phase change, what happens to the amount of heat required to complete that phase change?",
        "options": [
          "The required heat doubles.",
          "The required heat remains the same.",
          "The required heat is cut in half.",
          "The required heat increases by a factor of four."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the formula Q = mL, the energy required is directly proportional to the mass of the substance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the behavior of molecules during the 'sublimation' of dry ice (CO₂)?",
        "options": [
          "They gain enough potential energy to move directly from a lattice to an independent gas state.",
          "They lose kinetic energy as they transition into the gas phase.",
          "They form temporary liquid droplets that evaporate instantly.",
          "They slow down until they become visible as a white cloud."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sublimation is an endothermic process where molecules absorb enough energy to jump from a solid structure directly to a gaseous state, bypassing the liquid phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the temperature of a boiling pot of water not exceed 100°C even if the stove is turned to a higher setting?",
        "options": [
          "The extra energy increases the rate of vaporization rather than the temperature.",
          "The water has reached its maximum possible kinetic energy.",
          "The pot acts as a thermal insulator above 100°C.",
          "The heat is being radiated away as light."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the boiling point, all added energy is consumed as latent heat to turn liquid into steam faster. The temperature only rises again once the phase change is complete."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When steam at 100°C is used to heat a room, it is more effective than the same mass of water at 100°C because:",
        "options": [
          "The steam releases a large amount of latent heat as it condenses into water.",
          "Steam molecules are smaller and can move through the air more easily.",
          "Steam has a higher temperature than 100°C water.",
          "Steam is less dense and therefore holds more heat per unit of volume."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steam holds the 'hidden' energy used to vaporize it. When it condenses back into liquid in a radiator, it releases that massive amount of latent heat into the room."
