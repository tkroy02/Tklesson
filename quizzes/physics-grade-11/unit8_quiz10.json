    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sound waves are classified as mechanical waves because they:",
        "options": [
          "Require a medium to propagate.",
          "Can travel through a vacuum.",
          "Travel at the speed of light.",
          "Are strictly transverse in nature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mechanical waves require a physical medium (solid, liquid, or gas) because they rely on particle-to-particle interaction to transport energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which property of a sound wave is primarily responsible for the 'pitch' of the sound?",
        "options": [
          "Frequency",
          "Amplitude",
          "Speed",
          "Wavelength"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pitch is the human brain's perception of the frequency of a sound wave. Higher frequency equals higher pitch."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which of the following media would sound typically travel the fastest?",
        "options": [
          "Steel (Solid)",
          "Water (Liquid)",
          "Air (Gas)",
          "Vacuum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sound travels fastest in solids because the intermolecular forces are stronger and particles are more closely packed, allowing for quicker transmission of vibrations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the amplitude of a sound wave is doubled, how does the energy (intensity) of the wave change?",
        "options": [
          "It quadruples.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It is halved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wave intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude (I ∝ A²). Therefore, doubling the amplitude (2²) results in four times the intensity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sound wave with a frequency of 15 Hz would be classified as:",
        "options": [
          "Infrasonic",
          "Ultrasonic",
          "Audible",
          "Supersonic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The human audible range is roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Frequencies below 20 Hz are infrasonic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a longitudinal sound wave, a region where the particles are spread far apart and the pressure is low is called a:",
        "options": [
          "Rarefaction",
          "Compression",
          "Crest",
          "Antinode"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In longitudinal waves, high-pressure regions are compressions and low-pressure regions are rarefactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the speed of sound in air as the temperature increases?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As air temperature increases, the molecules move faster and collide more frequently, which increases the speed at which the sound disturbance propagates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The human ear perceives a change in sound intensity as a change in:",
        "options": [
          "Loudness",
          "Pitch",
          "Timbre",
          "Velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Loudness is the subjective human perception of sound intensity (which is measured physically in decibels or W/m²)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding the movement of air particles as a sound wave passes through them?",
        "options": [
          "They oscillate back and forth parallel to the direction of the wave.",
          "They move in a circular motion toward the listener.",
          "They move perpendicular to the direction of the wave.",
          "They stop moving entirely once the wave reaches them."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sound is a longitudinal wave, meaning the particle displacement is parallel to the direction of energy propagation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'quality' of a musical sound that allows us to distinguish between a piano and a violin playing the same note is called:",
        "options": [
          "Timbre",
          "Resonance",
          "Amplitude",
          "Fundamental Frequency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Timbre (or sound quality) is determined by the number and intensity of the harmonics and overtones accompanying the fundamental frequency."
