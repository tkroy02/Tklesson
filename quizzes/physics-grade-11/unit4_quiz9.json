      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two sumo wrestlers lunge at each other, collide, and come to a complete stop. One wrestler (200 kg) was moving at 2.3 m/s. If the other was moving at 2.9 m/s, what is his mass?",
        "options": ["159 kg", "173 kg", "189 kg", "161 kg", "137 kg"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since they come to a standstill, total final momentum = 0. Therefore, their initial momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. m₁v₁ = m₂v₂ → (200 kg)(2.3 m/s) = m₂(2.9 m/s) → m₂ = 460 / 2.9 ≈ 158.62 kg. The closest option is 159 kg."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two objects have the same momentum. If one object is much more massive than the other, which one has the higher velocity?",
        "options": [
          "The velocity is independent of mass for momentum",
          "The more massive object",
          "The less massive object",
          "They must have the same velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Momentum p = m*v. For the same p, if mass m is larger, velocity v must be smaller, and vice versa. Therefore, the less massive object must have a higher velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heavy truck and a light car are traveling with the same kinetic energy. Which one has a greater momentum?",
        "options": [
          "The car",
          "Momentum cannot be compared without knowing the exact speeds",
          "The truck",
          "They have equal momentum"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Kinetic energy KE = ½mv². Momentum p = mv. For the same KE, p = √(2m*KE). Therefore, for a fixed KE, momentum is proportional to the square root of mass. The heavier truck has greater momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is equivalent to the Impulse experienced by an object?",
        "options": [
          "The change in the object's momentum",
          "The rate of change of momentum",
          "The final momentum of the object",
          "The total work done on the object"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Impulse-Momentum Theorem states: Impulse (J) = Average Force × Time = Change in Momentum (Δp = mΔv). Therefore, impulse equals the change in momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do crumple zones in cars help protect passengers during a collision?",
        "options": [
          "They increase the time of the collision, reducing the average force",
          "They prevent the car from bouncing back",
          "They decrease the total change in momentum",
          "They increase the total impulse on the car"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The change in momentum (impulse) is fixed for a given crash speed. Impulse = F_avg × Δt. By increasing the collision time (Δt) via crumpling, the average force (F_avg) on the passengers is reduced, decreasing injury risk."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an isolated system, two objects collide and stick together. This is an example of what kind of collision?",
        "options": [
          "Superelastic collision",
          "Elastic collision",
          "Partially elastic collision",
          "Perfectly inelastic collision"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A perfectly inelastic collision is defined as one where the colliding objects stick together and move as one combined mass after impact. Maximum kinetic energy is lost (converted to other forms), but momentum is still conserved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is thrown against a wall and bounces back with the same speed. Compared to a ball that hits the wall and stops, which one experiences a greater impulse?",
        "options": [
          "It depends on the mass of the wall",
          "They both experience the same impulse",
          "The ball that stops",
          "The ball that bounces back"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Impulse = change in momentum (Δp = mΔv). For the ball that stops: Δv = v_final - v_initial = 0 - v = -v (magnitude m*v). For the ball that bounces back with same speed: Δv = (-v) - v = -2v (magnitude 2m*v). The bouncing ball has twice the change in velocity, thus a greater impulse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Conservation of momentum is a direct consequence of which of Newton's Laws?",
        "options": [
          "Newton's Law of Gravitation",
          "Newton's First Law",
          "The Law of Universal Inertia",
          "Newton's Third Law"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law (action-reaction pairs) states that internal forces in a system are equal and opposite. When summed over time (impulse), these internal forces cancel out, leading to no net change in the system's total momentum if no external forces act."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the net external force acting on a system is zero, what can be said about the total momentum of that system?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases due to friction",
          "It increases linearly",
          "It must be zero",
          "It remains constant"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Law of Conservation of Momentum states: If the net external force on a system is zero, the total momentum of the system remains constant (is conserved)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A small car and a large truck collide head-on and stick together. Which vehicle experiences the greater magnitude of force during the collision?",
        "options": [
          "The truck",
          "They both experience the same magnitude of force",
          "The car",
          "It depends on which vehicle was going faster"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By Newton's Third Law, the force the truck exerts on the car is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force the car exerts on the truck. They are an action-reaction pair during the collision contact."
