        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$1\\,\\text{cm}^3 = (10^{-2}\\,\\text{m})^3 = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^3$. Therefore $600\\,\\text{cm}^3 = 600 \\times 10^{-6} = 6 \\times 10^2 \\times 10^{-6} = 6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^3$."

          "Parallax error"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Instrumental error (faulty calibration) is systematic. Random errors are unpredictable, human and parallax errors are personal errors."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Efficiency $= \\dfrac{\\text{useful power output}}{\\text{total power input}} \\times 100\\%$. Power (rate of doing work) directly measures how quickly work is done, making it the key quantity for efficiency calculations."
