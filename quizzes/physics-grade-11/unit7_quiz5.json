      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much energy is required to raise the temperature of 2.0 kg of water from 20°C to 50°C? (Specific heat of water = 4184 J/kg·°C)",
        "options": [
          "125,520 J",
          "251,040 J",
          "418,400 J",
          "8,368 J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using Q = mcΔT: Q = (2.0 kg)(4184 J/kg·°C)(50°C - 20°C) = (2.0)(4184)(30) = 251,040 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An aluminum block has a mass of 0.5 kg and a specific heat of 900 J/kg·°C. What is the Heat Capacity (C) of this specific block?",
        "options": [
          "450 J/°C",
          "1800 J/°C",
          "900 J/°C",
          "225 J/°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat Capacity (C) is calculated as C = mc. Here, C = (0.5 kg)(900 J/kg·°C) = 450 J/°C. Note that Heat Capacity does not include the mass unit in its result."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 100g of water at 80°C is mixed with 100g of water at 20°C in an insulated container, what will be the final equilibrium temperature?",
        "options": [
          "40°C",
          "50°C",
          "60°C",
          "100°C"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When equal masses of the same substance are mixed, the final temperature is the simple average: (80 + 20) / 2 = 50°C. Energy lost by hot water equals energy gained by cold water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 500g piece of copper (c = 385 J/kg·°C) loses 7700 J of energy. By how much did its temperature decrease?",

          "20°C",
          "40°C",
          "10°C",
          "4°C"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Convert mass to kg: 0.5 kg. Use ΔT = Q / (mc). ΔT = 7700 / (0.5 * 385) = 7700 / 192.5 = 40°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a calorimetry experiment, the 'Method of Mixtures' relies on which fundamental physics principle?",
        "options": [
          "Newton's Third Law",
          "Law of Conservation of Energy",
          "Ideal Gas Law",
          "Law of Universal Gravitation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The assumption that heat lost by the hot object equals heat gained by the cold object (Q_out = Q_in) is a direct application of energy conservation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "2.0 kg of water at 90°C is mixed with 1.0 kg of water at 30°C. What is the final temperature of the mixture?",

          "60°C",
          "70°C",
          "45°C",
          "80°C"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "m1(T1 - Tf) = m2(Tf - T2). 2(90 - Tf) = 1(Tf - 30) -> 180 - 2Tf = Tf - 30 -> 210 = 3Tf -> Tf = 70°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which requires more heat: raising 1 kg of water (c = 4184 J/kg·°C) by 10°C or raising 10 kg of iron (c = 450 J/kg·°C) by 10°C?",
        "options": [
          "The water requires more heat.",
          "The iron requires more heat.",
          "They require the same amount of heat.",
          "It depends on the starting temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For water: Q = (1)(4184)(10) = 41,840 J. For iron: Q = (10)(450)(10) = 45,000 J. The iron requires slightly more."

        "question": "A 0.2 kg metal sample at 100°C is placed in 0.1 kg of water at 20°C. The final temperature is 40°C. What is the specific heat of the metal?",
        "options": [
          "697 J/kg·°C",
          "385 J/kg·°C",
          "418 J/kg·°C",
          "836 J/kg·°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat gained by water = (0.1)(4184)(40-20) = 8368 J. Heat lost by metal = (0.2)(c_metal)(100-40) = 12(c_metal). Set equal: 12c = 8368 -> c ≈ 697 J/kg·°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the heat input (Q) to a sample while keeping the mass constant, what happens to the temperature change (ΔT)?",
        "options": [
          "It is halved.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since Q = mcΔT, Q and ΔT are directly proportional. If Q doubles, ΔT must also double."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the final temperature of a mix of 1kg oil (c = 2000 J/kg·°C) and 1kg water (c = 4184 J/kg·°C) NOT the simple average of their starting temperatures?",
        "options": [
          "Because they have different masses.",
          "Because they have different specific heat capacities.",
          "Because oil does not absorb heat.",
          "Because the container absorbs all the energy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The simple average only works if the Heat Capacities (mc) are equal. Because water has a higher specific heat, it resists temperature change more, pulling the final temperature closer to water's initial temperature."
