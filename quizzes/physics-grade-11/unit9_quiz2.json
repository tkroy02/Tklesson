        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the ratio method: F' = F * (q_factor / r_factor^2) = 10 * (2 / 3^2) = 10 * (2/9) ≈ 2.22 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Three charges (q1, q2, q3) are placed in a straight line. q1 is at x=0, q2 is at x=2, and q3 is at x=4. To find the net force on q2, you must:",
        "options": [
          "Calculate the vector sum of the force from q1 and the force from q3.",
          "Multiply the forces from q1 and q3 together.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The force is proportional to the product of the charges: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5. Thus, the new force is 1.5F."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a system of three charges arranged in an equilateral triangle, the net force on one charge is found by adding the two force vectors. If the two individual forces are F, the net force will be:",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vector addition of two forces of magnitude F at a 60° angle results in R = sqrt(F^2 + F^2 + 2F^2 cos 60°) = sqrt(3F^2) = sqrt(3)F."
