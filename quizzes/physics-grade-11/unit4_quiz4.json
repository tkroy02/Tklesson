    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A stationary firecracker explodes into two fragments. Fragment A (0.02 kg) flies east at 10 m/s. If Fragment B has mass 0.03 kg, what is its velocity?",
        "options": ["6.67 m/s west", "6.67 m/s east", "15 m/s west", "15 m/s east"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial momentum = 0. Total final momentum must be 0: $(0.02)(10) + (0.03)(v_B) = 0$. Solving: $v_B = -6.67$ m/s (west)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A stationary bomb explodes into three equal-mass pieces. Two pieces fly at right angles: 12 m/s north and 16 m/s east. What is the speed of Piece 3?",
        "options": ["10 m/s", "14 m/s", "20 m/s", "28 m/s"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Let each mass = m. Momenta: p₁ = 12m north, p₂ = 16m east. Vector sum = m√(12²+16²) = 20m southwest. For total p=0, p₃ = 20m northeast. Speed = 20 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person on a frictionless cart holds a rock. The person throws the rock forward relative to themselves. What happens to the cart's speed?",
        "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "Remains same", "Depends on rock's mass"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Throwing rock forward exerts backward force on cart (Newton's 3rd law). This backward force reduces cart's forward speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A moving sled on frictionless ice drops a bag of sand from its back. The sled's speed after dropping the bag:",
        "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays same", "Depends on sand mass"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Dropping mass vertically creates no horizontal force. Horizontal momentum conserved: $Mv = (M-m)v' + m(v)$ → $v' = v$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an explosion of a stationary object, the kinetic energy of the fragments comes from:",
        "options": ["Momentum conservation", "Chemical potential energy", "External work done", "Gravity"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Stored chemical/nuclear potential energy converts to kinetic energy. Momentum conservation only redistributes velocities, doesn't create energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two blocks (2 kg and 3 kg) are pressed together with a compressed spring between them on frictionless surface. When released, if the 2 kg block moves at 6 m/s left, what is the 3 kg block's velocity?",
        "options": ["4 m/s right", "4 m/s left", "9 m/s right", "9 m/s left"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial p=0. Let right be positive: $(2)(-6) + (3)(v) = 0$ → $-12 + 3v = 0$ → $v = +4$ m/s (right)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A man standing in a stationary boat jumps ashore. As he jumps forward, the boat moves:",
        "options": ["Forward", "Backward", "Doesn't move", "Rotates"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To jump forward, man pushes backward on boat (action). Boat pushes forward on man (reaction), but boat itself moves backward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rocket in deep space accelerates by burning fuel. Its acceleration increases over time even with constant fuel ejection rate because:",
        "options": ["Momentum increases", "Mass decreases", "Exhaust speed increases", "Gravity decreases"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$a = F/m$. Thrust $F$ may be constant, but mass $m$ decreases as fuel burns, so acceleration $a$ increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bullet embeds in a block. An identical bullet shatters the block at same speed. Which gives the block(s) greater total horizontal momentum after impact?",
        "options": ["Embedding bullet", "Shattering bullet", "Same for both", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Horizontal momentum conserved in both. Bullet's initial horizontal momentum transfers to block system (intact or pieces) equally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ice skater spinning with arms extended pulls her arms in. What happens to her rotational speed?",
        "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays same", "Depends on mass"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum conserved: $L = I\\omega$. Pulling arms in decreases $I$, so $\\omega$ increases to keep $L$ constant."
