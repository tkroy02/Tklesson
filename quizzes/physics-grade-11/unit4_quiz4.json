      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Newton's First Law, an object moving at constant velocity continues this motion because:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "No forces act on it",
          "Net external force is zero",
          "Mass is constant",
          "Gravity is balanced"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's First Law: object maintains constant velocity unless acted upon by net external force. Constant velocity means net force = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car cruising at constant highway speed is in:",
        "image": "",

          "Static equilibrium",
          "Dynamic equilibrium",
          "Non-equilibrium",
          "Free fall"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant velocity means dynamic equilibrium."

        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Net force downward",
          "Zero net force",
          "Maximum acceleration",
          "Zero velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At terminal velocity, air resistance = weight, so net force = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Directly proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to the net force.",
          "Directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass.",
          "Independent of the mass of the object.",
          "Always equal to $9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$a = F_{net}/m$, so acceleration ∝ net force and ∝ 1/mass."
      },

          "In the direction of the largest individual force."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since mass is a positive scalar, $\\vec{a}$ has the same direction as $\\vec{F}_{net}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the net force acting on an object while keeping its mass constant, the acceleration will:",

          "Remain the same.",
          "Double.",

        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "Twice that of Object B.",
          "Half that of Object B.",

          "Four times that of Object B."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$a \\propto 1/m$ when force constant. Twice mass → half acceleration."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$F_{net} = 50 - 20 = 30\\text{ N}$ to the right."
