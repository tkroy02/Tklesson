      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fluid flows into a pipe with a specific diameter at a rate of 0.50 m³/s. If the exit end of the pipe has a cross-sectional area of 0.10 m², what is the speed of the fluid as it exits the pipe?",
        "options": [
          "5.0 m/s",
          "0.05 m/s",
          "0.20 m/s",
          "50 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the volume flow rate formula Q = Av, where Q is flow rate and A is area: v = Q / A. v = 0.50 m³/s / 0.10 m² = 5.0 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A baseball has a mass of 0.15 kg (weight ≈ 1.47 N), but it weighs 0.60 N when completely submerged in water. What is its volume? (Assume density of water = 1000 kg/m³ and g = 9.8 m/s²)",
        "options": [
          "8.88 x 10⁻⁵ m³",
          "1.50 x 10⁻⁴ m³",
          "6.12 x 10⁻⁵ m³",
          "8.70 x 10⁻³ m³"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The buoyant force is the weight loss: Fb = 1.47 N - 0.60 N = 0.87 N. Since Fb = ρVg, Volume (V) = Fb / (ρg) = 0.87 / (1000 * 9.8) ≈ 8.88 x 10⁻⁵ m³."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The reason why a coconut floats in water is because:",
        "options": [
          "The density of the coconut is less than the density of the water it displaces",
          "The gravitational force acting on the coconut is less than the buoyant force",
          "The surface area of the coconut is the same as the surface area of the water contacting it",
          "The density of the coconut is equal to the density of the water it displaces"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An object floats when its average density is less than the density of the fluid. This allows it to displace a weight of water equal to its own weight before it is fully submerged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is initially submerged 1 m below the surface of water. If this same object is then lowered to a depth of 2 m, how does the absolute pressure on the object change?",
        "options": [
          "The absolute pressure slightly increases",
          "The absolute pressure doubles",
          "The absolute pressure halves",
          "The absolute pressure slightly decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute pressure = P_atm + ρgh. While the gauge pressure (ρgh) doubles from 1m to 2m, the atmospheric pressure (~101 kPa) remains constant. Therefore, the total (absolute) pressure increases, but does not double."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the radius of a pipe with flowing liquid is decreased by a factor of 2, how does the velocity of the fluid need to change in order to maintain a constant flow rate?",
        "options": [
          "Increase by a factor of 4",
          "Increase by a factor of 2",
          "Decrease by a factor of 2",
          "Decrease by a factor of 4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Flow rate Q = Av is constant. Area A is proportional to the square of the radius (r²). If r is halved, area becomes 1/4. To keep Q constant, velocity must increase by a factor of 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a horizontal pipe where the diameter widens, what happens to the fluid speed and the internal pressure?",
        "options": [
          "Speed decreases and pressure increases",
          "Speed increases and pressure decreases",
          "Both speed and pressure increase",
          "Both speed and pressure decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Continuity Equation states speed decreases as area increases. Bernoulli's Principle states that in horizontal flow, as speed decreases, pressure increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water flows through a hose at 2.0 m/s. If a nozzle is attached that reduces the exit area to one-fourth of the hose's area, what is the exit velocity?",
        "options": [
          "8.0 m/s",
          "0.5 m/s",
          "4.0 m/s",
          "16.0 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using A1v1 = A2v2: If A2 = 1/4 * A1, then v2 = 4 * v1. So, v2 = 4 * 2.0 m/s = 8.0 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object has a density of 1200 kg/m³. When placed in water (density = 1000 kg/m³), which of the following describes the net force acting on it while it is held submerged?",
        "options": [
          "The net force is downward because gravity exceeds the buoyant force",
          "The net force is upward because buoyancy always pushes up",
          "The net force is zero because it is submerged",
          "The net force depends on the depth of the object"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the object is denser than the fluid, the downward force of gravity (weight) is greater than the upward buoyant force, resulting in a net downward force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are measuring 'Gauge Pressure' at the bottom of a 5 m deep tank, which factor are you ignoring?",
        "options": [
          "The atmospheric pressure acting on the surface",
          "The density of the fluid",
          "The acceleration due to gravity",
          "The depth of the fluid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gauge pressure measures the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. It calculates only the pressure exerted by the fluid itself (ρgh), ignoring the atmospheric pressure pressing on the surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pipe narrows from a radius of 10 cm to a radius of 5 cm. What is the ratio of the fluid velocity in the narrow section to the velocity in the wide section (vnarrow : vwide)?",
        "options": [
          "4:1",
          "2:1",
          "1:2",
          "16:1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The area ratio is the square of the radius ratio: (10/5)² = 4. To maintain the same flow rate, the velocity in the narrow section must be 4 times that of the wide section."
