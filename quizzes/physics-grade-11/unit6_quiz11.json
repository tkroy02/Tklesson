      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A stream of water falling from a faucet becomes narrower as it falls. Which principle best explains this observation?",
        "options": [
          "Gravity increases the velocity, so the area must decrease to keep flow rate constant.",
          "Surface tension pulls the water inward as it loses pressure.",
          "The air pressure pushes the stream together as it speeds up.",
          "Water density increases as it falls, reducing the required volume."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As water falls, gravity accelerates it (v increases). According to the Continuity Equation (A1v1 = A2v2), if velocity increases, the cross-sectional area (A) must decrease to maintain a constant flow rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the human body, the speed of blood in the capillaries is significantly slower than in the aorta. Why is this, considering the aorta branches into millions of capillaries?",
        "options": [
          "The total combined cross-sectional area of all capillaries is much larger than the aorta.",
          "Capillaries are much narrower, which naturally slows down the fluid.",
          "The heart's pressure is lost by the time blood reaches the capillaries.",
          "Blood becomes more viscous in smaller vessels."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While an individual capillary is tiny, the *total* area of the capillary bed is roughly 500-1000 times larger than the area of the aorta. Because total Area x Velocity must be constant, the massive increase in area results in a very low velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An air duct system needs to move 1.2 m³/s of air. If the maximum silent air velocity is 4 m/s, what is the minimum diameter required for a circular duct?",
        "options": [
          "0.30 m",
          "0.62 m",
          "0.10 m",
          "0.38 m"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Q = Av. Area = 1.2 / 4 = 0.3 m². Since A = πr², r = sqrt(0.3 / π) ≈ 0.31 m. Diameter = 2r ≈ 0.62 m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pipe transports a gas that is being compressed. If the density of the gas doubles while moving from section 1 to section 2, and the area remains constant, what happens to the velocity?",
        "options": [
          "The velocity is cut in half.",
          "The velocity doubles.",
          "The velocity remains the same.",
          "The velocity quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For gases (compressible fluids), the Mass Flow Rate is constant: ρ1A1v1 = ρ2A2v2. If A is constant and ρ doubles, v must be cut in half to balance the equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5-gallon (18.9 Liter) container is filled in 2 minutes. What is the volume flow rate in cubic meters per second (m³/s)?",
        "options": [
          "0.000158 m³/s",
          "0.157 m³/s",
          "0.00945 m³/s",
          "0.000031 m³/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "18.9 Liters = 0.0189 m³. Time = 120 seconds. Q = 0.0189 / 120 = 0.0001575 m³/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a fluid flow is described as 'steady,' what does this imply regarding the flow rate Q?",
        "options": [
          "Q is constant over time at any given point.",
          "Q is the same at every point in the pipe regardless of area.",
          "The velocity is zero at the pipe walls.",
          "The fluid is moving in a perfectly straight line."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steady flow means that the fluid properties (velocity, pressure, flow rate) at any specific point do not change over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A fuel line branches from a 10 mm diameter pipe into three 5 mm diameter pipes. How does the velocity in one of the small pipes compare to the main pipe?",
        "options": [
          "It is 1.33 times faster.",
          "It is the same.",
          "It is 4 times faster.",
          "It is 0.75 times slower."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area of main = π(5)². Total area of branches = 3 * π(2.5)². Velocity ratio = Area_main / Total_Area_branches = 25π / 18.75π = 1.33."
      },

        "question": "Water flows through a 4 cm diameter pipe at 5 m/s. It then enters a section where the pipe diameter is reduced to 2 cm. What is the new flow rate (Q)?",
        "options": [
          "It remains 0.00628 m³/s.",
          "It increases to 0.0251 m³/s.",
          "It decreases to 0.00157 m³/s.",
          "It remains 5.0 m/s."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The flow rate (Q) is constant in a single-path pipe. Q = A1v1 = π(0.02)² * 5 = 0.00628 m³/s. Even though velocity increases, Q does not change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the 'mass flow rate' of a liquid if it flows into a region where the temperature increases (assuming the liquid expands slightly)?",
        "options": [
          "The mass flow rate remains constant.",
          "The mass flow rate increases.",
          "The mass flow rate decreases.",
          "The mass flow rate becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conservation of mass dictates that mass flow rate (kg/s) must be constant regardless of temperature-induced density or volume changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A nurse is administering an IV. If the tube diameter is doubled but the pump maintains a constant volume flow rate (Q), how does the blood velocity change?",
        "options": [
          "Velocity becomes one-fourth of the original.",
          "Velocity becomes half of the original.",
          "Velocity doubles.",
          "Velocity remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since A = π(d/2)², doubling the diameter (d) increases the area by a factor of 4. Since v = Q/A, the velocity must decrease to 1/4 of its original value."
