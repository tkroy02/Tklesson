      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.500 kg ball is tied to a 1.20 m string and whirled in a horizontal circle at a constant speed of 6.00 m/s. What is the tension in the string? (Ignore gravity)",
        "options": ["15.0 N", "2.50 N", "18.0 N", "12.5 N", "30.0 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a horizontal circle, tension provides the centripetal force. T = mv²/r = (0.500 kg × (6.00 m/s)²) / 1.20 m = 15.0 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.00 kg bucket of water is swung in a vertical circle of radius 1.00 m. What is the minimum speed at the top so the water does not spill? (Use g = 9.80 m/s²)",
        "options": ["3.13 m/s", "4.43 m/s", "5.00 m/s", "9.80 m/s", "2.14 m/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At minimum speed at the top, gravity provides all centripetal force (Tension = 0). mg = mv²/r → v = √(gr) = √(9.80 × 1.00) ≈ 3.13 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.00 kg bucket is swung in a vertical circle (r = 1.00 m) with a speed of 7.00 m/s at the bottom. What is the tension in the rope at this point? (Use g = 9.80 m/s²)",
        "options": ["117.6 N", "98.0 N", "19.6 N", "78.4 N", "137.2 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the bottom, Tension points up and Gravity points down. Net force F_c = T - mg. Therefore, T = m(v²/r + g) = 2.00 × (49/1 + 9.80) = 2.00 × 58.8 = 117.6 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.200 kg ball on a 0.800 m string is swung in a vertical circle. The tension at the top is 1.00 N. What is the ball's speed at the top? (Use g = 9.80 m/s²)",
        "options": ["3.44 m/s", "2.21 m/s", "4.43 m/s", "1.57 m/s", "5.02 m/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the top, both Tension and Gravity act toward the center. T + mg = mv²/r. Solving for v: v = √[r(T/m + g)] = √[0.800 × (1.00/0.200 + 9.80)] = √[0.800 × 14.8] = √11.84 ≈ 3.44 m/s."

        "question": "A conical pendulum has a 0.100 kg mass on a 1.00 m string at a 30.0° angle from the vertical. What is the tension? (Use g = 9.80 m/s²)",
        "options": ["1.13 N", "0.849 N", "0.980 N", "0.566 N", "1.96 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical component of tension balances weight: T cosθ = mg. T = (0.100 × 9.80) / cos(30°) = 0.980 / 0.866 ≈ 1.13 N."

        "question": "A 0.100 kg conical pendulum on a 1.00 m string at a 30.0° angle has what tangential speed? (Use g = 9.80 m/s²)",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Radius r = L sinθ = 0.500 m. Tension T = 1.132 N. Horizontal force: T sinθ = mv²/r. v = √(T sinθ r / m) = √(1.132 × 0.5 × 0.5 / 0.100) = √2.83 ≈ 1.68 m/s."

        "question": "A 1200 kg car rounds a flat curve of radius 45.0 m. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.600, what is the maximum speed the car can have without slipping? (Use g = 9.80 m/s²)",
        "options": ["16.3 m/s", "26.5 m/s", "11.2 m/s", "21.0 m/s", "14.4 m/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Friction provides centripetal force: μmg = mv²/r. v = √(μgr) = √(0.600 × 9.80 × 45.0) = √264.6 ≈ 16.3 m/s."

        "question": "If a string used to whirl a 0.400 kg ball in a horizontal circle (r = 2.00 m) can withstand 60.0 N, what is the maximum speed?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "T_max = mv²/r. v = √(T_max × r / m) = √(60.0 × 2.00 / 0.400) = √300 ≈ 17.3 m/s."

        "question": "A roller coaster car (500 kg) is at the bottom of a vertical loop (r = 15.0 m) moving at 20.0 m/s. What is the normal force? (Use g = 9.80 m/s²)",
        "options": ["1.82 × 10⁴ N", "1.33 × 10⁴ N", "4.90 × 10³ N", "2.31 × 10⁴ N", "8.24 × 10³ N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "N = m(v²/r + g) = 500 × (400/15 + 9.80) = 500 × (26.67 + 9.80) = 500 × 36.47 ≈ 18,235 N."

        "question": "At what point in a vertical circle is the tension in a string at its absolute minimum value?",
        "options": ["At the top", "At the bottom", "On the sides", "It is constant", "At 45 degrees"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the top, gravity helps provide the centripetal force, reducing the 'burden' on the string tension. At the bottom, tension must fight gravity, reaching its maximum."
