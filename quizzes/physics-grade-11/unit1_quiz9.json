        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sum $= 52.2$, mean $= 52.2 \\div 5 = 10.44$. Considering the precision of measurements (1 decimal place), round to $10.4$."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Paper thickness is extremely small ($\\approx 0.1\\,\\text{mm}$). A micrometer screw gauge with least count $0.01\\,\\text{mm}$ is most appropriate."
