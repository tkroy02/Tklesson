        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "98.12 ÷ 2.32 = 42.2931... 98.12 has 4 sig figs, 2.32 has 3 sig figs. Result must have 3 sig figs: 42.3."

          "10.2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sum = 52.2, mean = 52.2 ÷ 5 = 10.44. Considering the precision of measurements (1 decimal place), round to 10.4."

          "Vernier caliper",
          "Measuring tape"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Paper thickness is extremely small (~0.1 mm). A micrometer screw gauge with least count 0.01 mm is most appropriate."
