      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A first-class lever has the fulcrum 0.3 m from a 400 N load and 0.9 m from the effort. What is the ideal mechanical advantage?",
        "options": ["3.0", "0.33", "2.0", "1.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal MA = Effort arm length / Load arm length = 0.9 m / 0.3 m = 3.0"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lever lifts a 400 N load 0.1 m while the effort moves 0.35 m. If the effort required is 114.3 N, what is the actual mechanical advantage?",
        "options": ["≈ 3.5", "≈ 2.29", "≈ 4.0", "≈ 1.75"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Actual MA = Load / Effort = 400 N / 114.3 N ≈ 2.29"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lever system has an ideal MA of 3.0 but an actual MA of 2.29. What is its efficiency (as a percentage)?",
        "options": ["≈ 76.3%", "≈ 86.7%", "100%", "≈ 66.7%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency = (Actual MA / Ideal MA) × 100% = (2.29 / 3.0) × 100% ≈ 76.3%"
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A second-class lever has the load 0.4 m from the fulcrum and effort 1.2 m from the fulcrum. What is the velocity ratio?",
        "options": ["3.0", "0.33", "2.0", "0.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "VR = Effort arm / Load arm = 1.2 m / 0.4 m = 3.0"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lever system has a velocity ratio of 4 and an efficiency of 80%. What actual mechanical advantage does it provide?",
        "options": ["3.2", "4.0", "5.0", "2.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MA = Efficiency × VR = 0.80 × 4 = 3.2"

        "options": ["3.0", "0.33", "2.0", "1.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Actual MA = Load / Effort = 450 N / 150 N = 3.0"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lever requires the effort to move 0.6 m to lift the load 0.15 m. What is the velocity ratio?",
        "options": ["4.0", "3.0", "2.0", "0.25"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "VR = Distance effort moves / Distance load moves = 0.6 m / 0.15 m = 4.0"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lever system has an actual MA of 3 and a VR of 4. What is its efficiency?",
        "options": ["75%", "100%", "133%", "50%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency = (MA / VR) × 100% = (3 / 4) × 100% = 75%"

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A third-class lever has an effort arm of 0.25 m and a load arm of 0.75 m. What is its ideal mechanical advantage?",
        "options": ["0.33", "3.0", "1.0", "0.67"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal MA = Effort arm / Load arm = 0.25 m / 0.75 m = 1/3 ≈ 0.33"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lever system is 60% efficient and has a velocity ratio of 5. How much effort is needed to lift a 300 N load?",
        "options": ["100 N", "250 N", "180 N", "150 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MA = Efficiency × VR = 0.60 × 5 = 3.0. Effort = Load / MA = 300 N / 3 = 100 N"
