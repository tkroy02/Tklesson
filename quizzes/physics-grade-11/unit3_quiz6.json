    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A first-class lever has the fulcrum 0.3 m from a 400 N load and 0.9 m from the effort. What is the ideal mechanical advantage (MA)?",
        "options": ["3.0", "0.33", "2.0", "1.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal MA = Effort arm length / Load arm length = 0.9 m / 0.3 m = 3.0"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The same lever lifts the 400 N load 0.1 m while the effort moves 0.35 m. What is the actual mechanical advantage?",
        "options": ["≈ 2.29", "3.0", "1.14", "4.0"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Actual MA = Load / Effort. Work in = Work out if 100% efficient: Effort × 0.35 m = 400 N × 0.1 m → Effort ≈ 114.29 N. Actual MA = 400 / 114.29 ≈ 2.29."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the lever in questions 1–2, what is the efficiency (as a percentage)?",
        "options": ["≈ 76.2%", "≈ 86.7%", "100%", "≈ 66.7%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency = (Actual MA / Ideal MA) × 100% = (2.29 / 3.0) × 100% ≈ 76.3% (slight rounding)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A second-class lever has the load between fulcrum and effort. If the load is 0.4 m from the fulcrum and effort is 1.2 m from the fulcrum, what is the velocity ratio (VR)?",
        "options": ["3.0", "0.33", "2.0", "0.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "VR = Distance moved by effort / Distance moved by load = Effort arm / Load arm = 1.2 / 0.4 = 3.0"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lever system has VR = 4 and efficiency = 80%. What actual MA does it provide?",
        "options": ["3.2", "4.0", "5.0", "2.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency = (MA / VR) × 100% → MA = Efficiency × VR / 100 = 0.80 × 4 = 3.2"
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A worker applies 150 N of effort to lift a 450 N crate using a lever. What is the actual mechanical advantage?",
        "options": ["3.0", "0.33", "2.0", "1.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Actual MA = Load / Effort = 450 N / 150 N = 3.0"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the lever above, if the effort moves 0.6 m to lift the crate 0.15 m, what is the velocity ratio?",
        "options": ["4.0", "3.0", "2.0", "0.25"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "VR = Distance effort moves / Distance load moves = 0.6 m / 0.15 m = 4.0"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the same numbers (MA = 3, VR = 4), what is the efficiency of the lever?",
        "options": ["75%", "100%", "133%", "50%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency = (MA / VR) × 100% = (3 / 4) × 100% = 75%"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A third-class lever has MA less than 1. If the effort arm is 0.25 m and load arm is 0.75 m, what is the ideal MA?",
        "options": ["0.33", "3.0", "1.0", "0.67"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal MA = Effort arm / Load arm = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3 ≈ 0.33"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a lever system is 60% efficient and has VR = 5, how much effort is needed to lift a 300 N load?",
        "options": ["100 N", "250 N", "180 N", "150 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MA = Efficiency × VR = 0.60 × 5 = 3.0. Effort = Load / MA = 300 N / 3 = 100 N"
