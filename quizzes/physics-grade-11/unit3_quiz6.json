          "40 m/s"

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "No horizontal acceleration means horizontal velocity remains constant at 15 m/s."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At 45°, $\\tan\\theta = v_y/v_x = 1$, so $v_y = v_x$."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$R = v_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}$. If $h$ quadruples, $\\sqrt{h}$ doubles, so range doubles."
