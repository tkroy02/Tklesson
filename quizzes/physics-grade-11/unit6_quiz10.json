      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A main water pipe with a radius of 12 cm branches into four identical smaller pipes, each with a radius of 6 cm. If the water velocity in the main pipe is 2 m/s, what is the velocity in each of the smaller pipes?",
        "options": [
          "2 m/s",
          "4 m/s",
          "8 m/s",
          "0.5 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Main area A = π(12)². Total exit area = 4 * π(6)². Since 12² = 144 and 4 * 6² = 4 * 36 = 144, the total area remains the same. Therefore, the velocity remains 2 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An artery with a cross-sectional area of 1.0 cm² branches into 20 smaller capillaries, each with an area of 0.1 cm². If blood flows at 10 cm/s in the artery, what is the speed in each capillary?",
        "options": [
          "5 cm/s",
          "10 cm/s",
          "0.5 cm/s",
          "200 cm/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Q_in = Q_out. (1.0 cm² * 10 cm/s) = (20 * 0.1 cm² * v_cap). 10 = 2 * v_cap. v_cap = 5 cm/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a fluid is 'incompressible,' what does this imply about the Continuity Equation?",
        "options": [
          "The density of the fluid remains constant throughout the flow.",
          "The velocity of the fluid is the same at all points.",
          "The pressure is the same at all points.",
          "The fluid cannot flow through narrow gaps."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Incompressibility means the density (ρ) does not change. This allows us to cancel density from both sides of the mass flow equation, leaving us with the volume flow equation A1v1 = A2v2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A garden hose with a diameter of 2.0 cm fills a 20-liter bucket in 1 minute. What is the volume flow rate (Q) of the water?",
        "options": [
          "20 L/min",
          "0.33 L/s",
          "0.00033 m³/s",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "20 L/min is the direct measurement. 20/60 = 0.33 L/s. Since 1000 L = 1 m³, 0.33 L/s = 0.00033 m³/s. All represent the same flow rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A horizontal pipe narrows to half its original diameter. How does the flow rate (Q) change?",
        "options": [
          "It quadruples.",
          "It is cut in half.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It depends on the fluid pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The 'flow rate' (Volume per unit time) remains constant due to the Conservation of Mass. Only the 'velocity' of the fluid changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water enters a pipe at 3 m/s. The pipe's area increases by a factor of 3. What is the new velocity?",
        "options": [
          "9 m/s",
          "3 m/s",
          "1 m/s",
          "0.33 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A1v1 = A2v2. (A1 * 3) = (3A1 * v2). Solving for v2 gives 1 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a plumbing system, if the velocity of water needs to be doubled, how should the pipe's cross-sectional area be adjusted?",
        "options": [
          "Double the area.",
          "Reduce the area by half.",
          "Increase the area by a factor of 4.",
          "Keep the area the same and increase pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since Av is constant, to double v, A must be reduced by half (multiplied by 0.5)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the speed of a river as it moves from a wide, deep channel into a narrow, shallow canyon?",
        "options": [
          "The speed increases.",
          "The speed decreases.",
          "The speed stays the same.",
          "The speed stops completely."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A smaller cross-sectional area (narrow and shallow) requires a higher velocity to maintain the same volume flow rate of water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A syringe has a piston area of 1.2 cm² and a needle opening of 0.01 cm². If the piston is pushed at 1 cm/s, at what speed does the fluid exit the needle?",
        "options": [
          "1.2 cm/s",
          "12 cm/s",
          "120 cm/s",
          "0.012 cm/s"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A1v1 = A2v2 -> (1.2 * 1) = (0.01 * v2). v2 = 1.2 / 0.01 = 120 cm/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical law is the foundation of the Continuity Equation?",

          "Pascal's Law"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Continuity Equation is a mathematical expression of the principle that matter cannot be created or destroyed as it flows through a system."
