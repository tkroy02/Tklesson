        "question": "Action-reaction pairs in FBDs:",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Both appear on the same FBD",
          "Act on the same object",
          "Act on different objects",
          "Cancel each other always"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law: action-reaction pairs act on different objects, so they never appear on the same FBD."
      },
      {

        "question": "For a hanging object, tension equals weight when:",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$T - mg = ma$. When $a = 0$, $T = mg$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a box is subjected to a $10\\text{ N}$ force acting East and a $6\\text{ N}$ force acting West, what is the net force?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "$16\\text{ N}$ East",
          "$4\\text{ N}$ East",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$F_{net} = 10 - 6 = 4$ N East."

          "Normal Force ($F_N$)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "FBD shows only actual forces acting ON the object. Net force is the result, not a separate force."

        "question": "Kinetic friction always acts in which direction?",

          "The same direction as the object's velocity.",
          "Opposite to the direction of sliding relative to the surface.",
          "Vertically downward.",
          "Perpendicular to the surface."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Kinetic friction opposes relative motion between surfaces, so it acts opposite to sliding direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Every object near the Earth's surface experiences gravity. In which direction should the Weight ($F_g$) vector always point?",

          "Opposite to the Normal Force.",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Weight is force due to gravity, always directed downward toward Earth's center."

          "Law of Conservation of Force"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's First Law describes inertia: objects resist changes in their state of motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the natural tendency of an object regarding its state of motion?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "To eventually come to rest.",
          "To resist changes in its state of motion.",

          "To always follow a curved path."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in their velocity."

        "question": "Which of the following conditions must be met for an object to be in equilibrium?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "The object must be at rest.",
          "The velocity must be increasing at a constant rate.",
          "The net force acting on the object must be zero.",
          "Only one force can be acting on the object."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium means $a = 0$, so $F_{net} = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car is traveling due North at a constant speed of $100\\text{ km/h}$ on a straight highway. What is the net force acting on the car?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Directed due North.",
          "Directed due South to counter friction.",
          "Zero.",
          "Equal to the weight of the car."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Constant velocity means zero acceleration, so $F_{net} = ma = 0$."
