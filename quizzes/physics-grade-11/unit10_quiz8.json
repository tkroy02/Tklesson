    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Time Dilation' in the context of Special Relativity?",
        "options": [
          "The slowing down of time as perceived by an observer in a different inertial frame.",
          "The physical expansion of a clock's gears due to heat.",
          "The speeding up of time as an object approaches the speed of light.",
          "A psychological effect where time seems to move slower during high-speed travel."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Time dilation is a physical reality where a clock moving relative to an observer is measured to tick more slowly than a clock at rest in the observer's own frame."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Light Clock' thought experiment demonstrates that for a moving observer, light must travel a:",
        "options": [
          "Longer diagonal path, requiring more time to complete a tick.",
          "Shorter vertical path, requiring less time to complete a tick.",
          "Path that bends due to the 'aether wind'.",
          "Circular path around the light source."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To a stationary observer, the light in a moving clock travels a diagonal path. Since the speed of light (c) is constant, a longer distance must result in a longer duration of time ($t = d/c$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Proper Time' (t₀)?",
        "options": [
          "The time interval measured by an observer at rest relative to the event.",
          "The standard time measured at the Prime Meridian (GMT).",
          "The time measured by an observer moving at the speed of light.",
          "The time it takes for light to travel one astronomical unit."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Proper time is the time interval measured by someone who sees the 'start' and 'stop' of an event at the same location in space."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an astronaut travels at 90% the speed of light to a distant star and returns, how will their age compare to their twin who stayed on Earth?",
        "options": [
          "The astronaut will be younger than the Earth-bound twin.",
          "The astronaut will be older than the Earth-bound twin.",
          "They will both be the exact same age.",
          "The astronaut will have aged at double the rate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to time dilation, the astronaut's 'clock' (biological and mechanical) ticked slower relative to the Earth frame. This is known as the Twin Paradox."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following must be true for time dilation to become noticeable in everyday life?",
        "options": [
          "Objects would need to move at a significant fraction of the speed of light.",
          "Objects would need to be extremely heavy.",
          "The temperature would need to be near absolute zero.",
          "Objects would need to move in a perfect vacuum."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At everyday speeds (like a car or plane), the Lorentz factor is so close to 1 that time dilation is infinitesimal and undetectable without atomic clocks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Lorentz factor (γ) is used to calculate time dilation. As velocity (v) approaches the speed of light (c), the value of γ:",
        "options": [
          "Increases toward infinity.",
          "Decreases toward zero.",
          "Stays exactly at 1.0.",
          "Becomes a negative number."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $v$ approaches $c$, the denominator of the Lorentz equation approaches zero, causing $\\gamma$ (and thus the time dilation effect) to grow toward infinity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Has time dilation been experimentally proven?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, using precise atomic clocks on high-speed jets and satellites.",
          "No, it remains a purely theoretical mathematical concept.",
          "Yes, but only within the powerful magnetic fields of particle accelerators.",
          "No, because humans cannot yet travel fast enough to test it."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Experiments like the Hafele-Keating experiment used atomic clocks on airplanes to confirm that time actually slows down for moving objects exactly as predicted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From the perspective of a moving observer, their own clock:",
        "options": [
          "Appears to tick normally.",
          "Appears to slow down.",
          "Appears to speed up.",
          "Stops completely."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the first postulate, the laws of physics are the same in your own frame. You never 'feel' time slowing down; it only appears slow when compared to a different frame."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites must account for time dilation because:",
        "options": [
          "Their high orbital speed causes their clocks to run slower than Earth clocks.",
          "The vacuum of space speeds up their internal electronics.",
          "The sun's radiation slows down the satellite's signals.",
          "They move in a different time zone every few minutes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GPS satellites move fast enough that their atomic clocks lose several microseconds a day relative to Earth. Without relativistic corrections, GPS location data would be off by kilometers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the measurement of time if an object were hypothetically able to reach the speed of light?",
        "options": [
          "Time would effectively stand still (time dilation becomes infinite).",
          "Time would reverse and move backward.",
          "Time would speed up to infinity.",
          "Time would remain unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the limit where $v = c$, the Lorentz factor becomes undefined (division by zero), suggesting that for light itself, 'time' as we measure it does not pass."
