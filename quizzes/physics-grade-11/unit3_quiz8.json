      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pump lifts 500 kg of water per minute from a well 15 m deep. What is the power output of the pump? (Take g = 10 m/s²)",
        "options": ["1.25 kW", "1.85 kW", "2.50 kW", "3.75 kW"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Power = Work/time = (mgh)/t. Mass per second = 500 kg / 60 s = 25/3 kg. Power = (25/3 * 10 * 15) = 1250 W = 1.25 kW."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An electric motor has an efficiency of 80%. If it is rated at 2.0 kW, what is the useful power output?",
        "options": ["1.6 kW", "2.5 kW", "2.0 kW", "0.8 kW"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Useful Power = Efficiency × Input Power = 0.80 × 2.0 kW = 1.6 kW."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A body of mass 2 kg is moving at 3 m/s. A constant force of 4 N opposite to its motion is applied until it stops. What is the work done by this force?",
        "options": ["-9 J", "+9 J", "-6 J", "+6 J"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work-Energy Theorem: Work done = Change in KE. Initial KE = ½ × 2 × 3² = 9 J. Final KE = 0 J. Work = 0 - 9 = -9 J (negative as force opposes motion)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A machine has a velocity ratio (VR) of 6 and is 75% efficient. What effort is required to lift a load of 180 N?",
        "options": ["40 N", "22.5 N", "135 N", "30 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MA = Efficiency × VR = 0.75 × 6 = 4.5. MA = Load/Effort → Effort = Load/MA = 180 N / 4.5 = 40 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bullet of mass 0.02 kg traveling at 200 m/s penetrates a wooden block and comes to rest after moving 0.05 m inside it. What is the average resistive force exerted by the block?",
        "options": ["4000 N", "8000 N", "2000 N", "1000 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work done by force = Change in KE. -F × d = 0 - ½mv². F = (½ × 0.02 × 200²) / 0.05 = 400 / 0.05 = 8000 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The graph of force (F) versus displacement (s) for an object is a straight line through the origin. The work done is represented by:",
        "options": ["The slope of the line", "The area under the graph", "The vertical intercept", "The horizontal intercept"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a force-displacement graph, the work done is given by the area under the graph, regardless of the shape of the line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a unit of power?",
        "options": ["Newton-meter (Nm)", "Watt (W)", "Joule per second (J/s)", "Kilowatt-hour (kWh)"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Nm and J/s are units of power (1 W = 1 J/s). Kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy (power × time), not power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A boy pulls a 10 kg sled 20 m across a level surface with a force of 30 N at 60° to the horizontal. What is the work done? (cos 60° = 0.5)",
        "options": ["300 J", "520 J", "600 J", "150 J"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work = F × s × cosθ = 30 N × 20 m × cos60° = 30 × 20 × 0.5 = 300 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1200 W kettle heats 1.5 kg of water from 20°C to 100°C. How long does it take approximately? (Specific heat capacity of water = 4200 J/kg°C, ignore heat losses)",
        "options": ["420 s", "520 s", "630 s", "210 s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy needed Q = mcΔT = 1.5 × 4200 × 80 = 504,000 J. Time = Energy / Power = 504,000 J / 1200 W = 420 s."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring of spring constant 500 N/m is compressed by 0.1 m. The maximum speed of a 0.5 kg mass attached to it upon release is?",
        "options": ["1 m/s", "3.16 m/s", "10 m/s", "0.1 m/s"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Elastic PE = ½kx² = ½ × 500 × (0.1)² = 2.5 J. This converts to max KE: ½mv² = 2.5 → ½ × 0.5 × v² = 2.5 → v² = 10 → v = √10 ≈ 3.16 m/s."
