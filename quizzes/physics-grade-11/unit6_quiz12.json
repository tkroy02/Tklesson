        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A stream of water falling vertically from a faucet becomes narrower as it falls. Which principle best explains this observation?",
        "options": [
          "As the water accelerates due to gravity, its velocity increases, requiring the area to decrease to keep flow rate constant.",
          "The surface tension of the water increases as it falls, pulling the molecules closer together.",
          "Atmospheric pressure is greater at lower altitudes, compressing the stream.",
          "The water density increases as it gains kinetic energy, reducing the volume it occupies."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Continuity Equation (A1v1 = A2v2), if velocity increases as the fluid falls due to gravity, the cross-sectional area must decrease to maintain the same volume flow rate (Q)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the human circulatory system, the velocity of blood in the capillaries is much slower than in the aorta. What is the primary reason for this?",
        "options": [
          "Capillaries are so narrow that friction slows the blood down significantly.",
          "The total combined cross-sectional area of all capillaries is much larger than the area of the single aorta.",
          "The heart's pump pressure does not reach the capillaries.",
          "Blood becomes more viscous as it moves further from the heart."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While an individual capillary is tiny, the human body contains billions of them. Their total combined cross-sectional area is approximately 1000 times greater than the aorta, forcing the velocity to drop significantly to maintain a constant total flow rate."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An air duct system must move 1.2 m³/s of air. If the maximum air velocity allowed is 4.0 m/s, what is the minimum radius required for a circular duct?",
        "options": [
          "0.30 m",
          "0.31 m",
          "0.09 m",
          "0.62 m"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, find area: A = Q / v = 1.2 / 4.0 = 0.3 m². Using A = πr², we get 0.3 = πr², so r = sqrt(0.3 / π) ≈ 0.31 m."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pipe transports a gas that is being compressed. If the density of the gas doubles while moving from section 1 to section 2, and the pipe area remains constant, what happens to the velocity?",
        "options": [
          "The velocity doubles to compensate for the higher density.",
          "The velocity remains the same.",
          "The velocity is cut in half.",
          "The velocity is reduced by a factor of four."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For compressible fluids (gases), the mass flow rate must be constant: ρ1A1v1 = ρ2A2v2. If area (A) is constant and density (ρ) doubles, the velocity (v) must be halved."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 20-Liter container is filled by a hose in exactly 80 seconds. What is the volume flow rate (Q) in SI units (m³/s)?",
        "options": [
          "0.25 m³/s",
          "2.5 x 10⁻⁴ m³/s",
          "4.0 x 10⁻³ m³/s",
          "1.6 x 10⁻² m³/s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Convert 20 L to m³: 20 L = 0.020 m³. Flow rate Q = Volume / Time = 0.020 m³ / 80 s = 0.00025 m³/s or 2.5 x 10⁻⁴ m³/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a fluid flow is described as 'steady,' what does this imply about the volume flow rate (Q)?",
        "options": [
          "Q is the same at every point in the pipe even if the pipe area changes.",
          "The value of Q at any fixed point in the system does not change over time.",
          "Q must be zero at the boundaries of the pipe.",
          "The fluid is moving in a perfectly straight line without any turbulence."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Steady flow refers to a condition where fluid properties (velocity, pressure, and flow rate) at any fixed point in the system do not change with time."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A fuel line with a diameter of 12 mm branches into three identical pipes, each with a diameter of 4 mm. How does the velocity in one of the small pipes (v2) compare to the main pipe (v1)?",
        "options": [
          "v2 = 3v1",
          "v2 = 9v1",
          "v2 = v1",
          "v2 = 1.33v1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area 1 ∝ 12² = 144. Total Area 2 = 3 * (4²) = 48. Since A1v1 = A2v2, 144 * v1 = 48 * v2, which simplifies to v2 = 3v1."

        "question": "Water flows through a 4 cm diameter pipe at 5 m/s. It then enters a section where the diameter is reduced to 2 cm. What is the new volume flow rate (Q)?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant at approximately 0.0063 m³/s.",
          "It increases to 0.025 m³/s.",
          "It decreases to 0.0016 m³/s.",
          "It increases to 20 m/s."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Principle of Continuity, the volume flow rate (Q) remains constant in a closed-pipe system. While the velocity increases, the volume of water passing through per second remains the same."

        "question": "A nurse uses a syringe to inject medicine. If the plunger diameter is 10 mm and the needle diameter is 0.5 mm, what is the ratio of the exit velocity to the plunger velocity?",

          "100:1",
          "200:1"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Velocity ratio is the inverse of the area ratio. Ratio = (D1/D2)² = (10 / 0.5)² = 20² = 400."
