    "duration": 45,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Bernoulli's Principle, what happens to the internal pressure of a fluid as its velocity increases along a horizontal streamline?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure increases.",
          "The pressure decreases.",
          "The pressure remains constant.",
          "The pressure becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bernoulli's Principle states that for an inviscid flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A horizontal pipe has a wide section and a narrow section. In which section is the internal fluid pressure higher?",
        "options": [
          "The narrow section, because the fluid is moving faster.",
          "The wide section, because the fluid is moving slower.",
          "Both sections have the same pressure because they are at the same height.",
          "Pressure depends only on the density of the fluid."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the wide section, the fluid velocity is lower (Continuity Equation). According to Bernoulli's Principle, lower velocity in a horizontal pipe results in higher static pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Torricelli's Law states that the speed (v) of efflux of a fluid through a small hole at the bottom of a tank at a depth (h) is given by which formula?",
        "options": [
          "v = mgh",
          "v = sqrt(2gh)",
          "v = ρgh",
          "v = 1/2 ρv²"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Torricelli's Law is derived from Bernoulli’s equation. It shows that the exit velocity is the same as the velocity a single drop would reach if it fell freely from height h: v = √(2gh)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a shower curtain often pull inward toward you when you turn on the water?",
        "options": [
          "The high-speed water and air inside the shower create a region of low pressure.",
          "The hot water increases the air density inside the shower.",
          "Static electricity from the water attracts the plastic curtain.",
          "The water droplets physically push the air out of the shower."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The moving water (and the air it drags with it) creates a high-velocity zone. According to Bernoulli, this creates lower pressure inside the shower than the stationary air outside, pushing the curtain inward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a term in the full Bernoulli Equation?",
        "options": [
          "Static Pressure (P)",
          "Dynamic Pressure (1/2 ρv²)",
          "Hydrostatic Pressure (ρgh)",
          "Fluid Viscosity (η)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Bernoulli Equation assumes 'ideal' flow, which means it neglects viscosity (internal friction) and turbulence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An airplane wing (airfoil) is designed so that air moves faster over the top surface than the bottom. What is the result?",
        "options": [
          "Higher pressure on top, creating a downward force.",
          "Lower pressure on top, creating an upward lift force.",
          "Equal pressure on both sides, relying on the engine for lift.",
          "The air speed doesn't affect the pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because the air moves faster over the curved top, the pressure there drops. The higher pressure underneath the wing pushes the airplane upward, creating lift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Venturi meter, the 'throat' is the narrowest part of the device. What is measured at the throat to determine the flow rate?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in temperature.",
          "A drop in pressure.",
          "A change in fluid density.",
          "An increase in gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A Venturi meter uses the pressure difference between the wide and narrow sections. The significant pressure drop in the throat is directly related to the flow velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A large water tank is open to the atmosphere. If a hole is poked 5 meters below the water level, what is the speed of the water leaking out? (Use g = 9.8 m/s²)",
        "options": [
          "4.9 m/s",
          "7.0 m/s",
          "9.9 m/s",
          "49 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "v = sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 5) = sqrt(98) ≈ 9.9 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you blow air between two empty soda cans hanging near each other, what will happen?",
        "options": [
          "They will move apart.",
          "They will move toward each other.",
          "They will spin in place.",
          "Nothing will happen."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The moving air between the cans creates a low-pressure zone. The higher atmospheric pressure on the outside of the cans pushes them together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Bernoulli's Equation is a statement of which fundamental conservation law?",
        "options": [
          "Conservation of Mass",
          "Conservation of Momentum",
          "Conservation of Energy",
          "Conservation of Angular Momentum"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Bernoulli’s Equation is the conservation of energy per unit volume for a flowing fluid."
