        "question": "A student wants to knock over a stationary wooden target by throwing a projectile at it. The student has two options: a 400 g lump of putty that will stick to the target upon impact, and a 400 g bouncy ball that will rebound in the opposite direction. Both are thrown with the exact same initial velocity. Which projectile is more likely to successfully knock over the target?",

        "options": [
          "The lump of putty",
          "The bouncy ball",
          "Both will have the same effect",
