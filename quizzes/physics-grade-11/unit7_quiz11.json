    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the average kinetic energy of molecules while a substance is melting at a constant temperature?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant.",
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy. Since the temperature is constant during a phase change, the average kinetic energy does not change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During boiling, thermal energy is added but the temperature stays at 100°C. Where is this energy going?",
        "options": [
          "Into increasing the potential energy of the molecules.",
          "Into increasing the speed of the molecules.",
          "It is being destroyed by the phase change.",
          "It is being converted into light energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The energy (Latent Heat) is used to do work against intermolecular forces to separate the molecules, which increases the system's potential energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Specific Latent Heat of Fusion ($L_f$) for ice is $3.34 \\times 10^5$ J/kg. What does this value represent?",
        "options": [
          "The energy needed to melt 1 kg of ice at 0°C.",
          "The energy needed to raise 1 kg of ice by 1°C.",
          "The temperature at which ice starts to melt.",
          "The total heat energy contained in 1 kg of ice."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Latent heat of fusion is specifically the energy required to change 1 kg of a substance from solid to liquid without changing its temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the temperature of a liquid drop during evaporation if no external cooling is applied?",
        "options": [
          "The fastest molecules escape, leaving behind molecules with lower average kinetic energy.",
          "The liquid reacts with the air to absorb cold.",
          "The molecules that stay behind speed up to fill the gaps.",
          "Evaporation only happens when the liquid is already cold."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaporation is a cooling process because the 'hottest' (most energetic) molecules leave, which lowers the average energy (temperature) of the remaining liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which transition requires more energy for 1 kg of water: Melting ($0^\\circ\\text{C}$) or Boiling ($100^\\circ\\text{C}$)?",
        "options": [
          "Boiling (Vaporization)",
          "Melting (Fusion)",
          "They require the exact same amount of energy.",
          "It depends on the container size."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vaporization requires much more energy ($2.26 \\times 10^6$ J/kg) because molecules must be completely separated, whereas melting ($3.34 \\times 10^5$ J/kg) only requires loosening the bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following processes is exothermic (releases heat)?",
        "options": [
          "Condensation",
          "Melting",
          "Evaporation",
          "Sublimation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When gas turns to liquid (condensation), it must give off its latent heat to the surroundings to slow down and form bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a heating curve, what does the slope of the lines (the rising parts) represent?",
        "options": [
          "The substance is in a single phase and its temperature is increasing.",
          "The substance is undergoing a phase change.",
          "The latent heat is being absorbed.",
          "The substance is losing energy to the environment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sloped lines show a temperature increase within a single state (solid, liquid, or gas), where $Q = mc\\Delta T$ applies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much heat is released when 2 kg of water freezes at 0°C? ($L_f = 334,000$ J/kg)",
        "options": [
          "668,000 J",
          "334,000 J",
          "167,000 J",
          "0 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Q = mL = 2 \\text{ kg} \\times 334,000 \\text{ J/kg} = 668,000 \\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is a burn from $100^\\circ\\text{C}$ steam more severe than a burn from $100^\\circ\\text{C}$ water?",
        "options": [
          "Steam releases extra energy (latent heat) as it condenses on the skin.",
          "Steam is actually much hotter than 100°C.",
          "Steam molecules are larger and hit the skin harder.",
          "Water conducts heat slower than steam."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When steam hits your skin, it turns back into water. That phase change releases a huge amount of latent heat directly onto the skin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between evaporation and boiling?",
        "options": [
          "Evaporation happens only at the surface; boiling happens throughout the liquid.",
          "Evaporation requires heat; boiling does not.",
          "Boiling is an exothermic process; evaporation is endothermic.",
          "They are the exact same process with different names."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaporation is a surface phenomenon that can happen at any temperature, while boiling occurs throughout the bulk of the liquid at a specific boiling point."
