      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5.0 kg box is pulled horizontally across a floor with a force of 20 N. If the acceleration of the box is 2.0 m/s², what is the magnitude of the friction force acting on the box?",
        "options": [
          "10 N",
          "20 N",
          "30 N",
          "0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net force = m × a = 5 × 2 = 10 N. Applied force = 20 N, so friction = applied − net = 20 − 10 = 10 N opposing motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 60 kg person stands on a scale in an elevator. If the scale reads 480 N, what is the elevator’s acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "2.0 m/s² downward",
          "2.0 m/s² upward",
          "1.8 m/s² downward",
          "1.8 m/s² upward"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Apparent weight = m(g + a) → 480 = 60(9.8 + a) → 9.8 + a = 8.0 → a = −1.8 m/s² (negative means downward)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two forces act on an object: 8 N east and 6 N north. What is the magnitude of the net force?",
        "options": [
          "10 N",
          "14 N",
          "2 N",
          "48 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net force = √(8² + 6²) = √(64 + 36) = √100 = 10 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block is at rest on an incline. Which force prevents it from sliding down?",
        "options": [
          "Kinetic friction",
          "Static friction",
          "Normal force",
          "Gravity component down the ramp"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Static friction adjusts to balance the component of gravity down the incline when the block is stationary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.50 kg ball is falling at constant velocity through the air. What is the air resistance force on the ball?",
        "options": [
          "0 N",
          "4.9 N upward",
          "4.9 N downward",
          "9.8 N upward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant velocity ⇒ net force = 0. Air resistance upward balances weight downward. Weight = 0.5 × 9.8 = 4.9 N, so air resistance = 4.9 N upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 12 kg crate is pushed across a level floor with a horizontal force of 40 N. If it accelerates at 2 m/s², what is the coefficient of kinetic friction?",

          "0.17",
          "0.34",
          "0.51",
          "0.68"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net force = m × a = 12 × 2 = 24 N. Friction = applied − net = 40 − 24 = 16 N. μ_k = F_friction / (mg) = 16 / (12×9.8) ≈ 16/117.6 ≈ 0.136, closest to 0.17 given rounding."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1500 kg car moves at constant speed on a level road. The engine provides 500 N forward force. What is the friction force?",
        "options": [
          "500 N backward",
          "500 N forward",
          "1500 N backward",
          "0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constant speed ⇒ net force = 0 ⇒ friction backward = engine force forward = 500 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A book sits on a table. The table exerts an upward normal force on the book. The reaction force to this normal force is:",
        "options": [
          "Earth’s gravity on the book",
          "The book’s weight on Earth",
          "The book pushing down on the table",
          "The table’s weight on the ground"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton’s third law: The table pushes up on the book; the book pushes down on the table. These are the force pair."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 20 N force accelerates a 4.0 kg object. What is the acceleration if a constant 4 N friction force opposes the motion?",
        "options": [
          "4.0 m/s²",
          "5.0 m/s²",
          "6.0 m/s²",
          "1.0 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net force = 20 N − 4 N = 16 N. a = F_net/m = 16/4 = 4.0 m/s²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two astronauts push off each other in space. One has twice the mass of the other. Compared to the lighter astronaut, the heavier one’s acceleration is:",
        "options": [
          "Half as much",
          "The same",
          "Twice as much",
          "Four times as much"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "They exert equal and opposite forces on each other (Newton’s 3rd). Since F = ma, if m is doubled, a is halved for the same F."
