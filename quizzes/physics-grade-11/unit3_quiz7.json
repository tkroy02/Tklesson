    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wheelbarrow is an example of which class of lever?",
        "options": ["First-class", "Second-class", "Third-class", "Not a lever"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a wheelbarrow, the load is between the fulcrum (wheel) and the effort (handles), making it a second-class lever."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person uses a pair of tweezers to pick up a small object. What class of lever are tweezers?",
        "options": ["First-class", "Second-class", "Third-class", "Not a lever"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Tweezers are a third-class lever — effort is applied between the fulcrum (pivot point) and the load (tips)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A first-class lever has an effort arm of 1.5 m and a load arm of 0.5 m. What is its ideal mechanical advantage (MA)?",
        "options": ["3.0", "0.33", "2.0", "1.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal MA = Effort arm ÷ Load arm = 1.5 m ÷ 0.5 m = 3.0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A single fixed pulley is used to lift a 200 N load by pulling downward on the rope. What is the ideal mechanical advantage?",
        "options": ["1", "2", "0.5", "Depends on rope length"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A single fixed pulley changes direction but doesn't multiply force; ideal MA = 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A single movable pulley supports a 300 N load. What is the minimum effort needed to lift it if friction is negligible?",
        "options": ["150 N", "300 N", "100 N", "75 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Single movable pulley has ideal MA = 2, so Effort = 300 N ÷ 2 = 150 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pulley system uses four supporting ropes to lift the load. What is its velocity ratio (VR)?",
        "options": ["4", "2", "1", "8"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity ratio (VR) = number of supporting ropes = 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pulley system with VR = 5 requires an effort of 60 N to lift a 240 N load. What is its efficiency?",
        "options": ["80%", "75%", "90%", "60%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Actual MA = 240 N ÷ 60 N = 4. Efficiency = (4 ÷ 5) × 100% = 80%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a third-class lever?",
        "options": ["Biceps lifting forearm", "Crowbar prying open a lid", "Bottle opener", "Scissors"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the biceps–forearm system, effort is between fulcrum (elbow) and load (hand), making it third-class."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block and tackle has 6 supporting ropes and is 75% efficient. What actual MA does it provide?",
        "options": ["4.5", "6.0", "5.0", "3.0"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal MA (VR) = 6. Actual MA = Efficiency × VR = 0.75 × 6 = 4.5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A second-class lever has an effort arm of 0.8 m and load arm of 0.2 m. If the efficiency is 90%, what effort is needed to lift a 360 N load?",
        "options": ["100 N", "80 N", "120 N", "90 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal MA = 0.8 ÷ 0.2 = 4. Actual MA = 0.90 × 4 = 3.6. Effort = 360 N ÷ 3.6 = 100 N."
