      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bullet is fired horizontally from a height of 1.5 m at 400 m/s. At the same time, a second bullet is dropped from the same height. Which hits the ground first?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "They both hit the ground at the same time.",
          "The dropped bullet.",
          "It depends on the mass of the bullets.",
          "The fired bullet."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion. Both start with zero vertical velocity from same height, so they hit simultaneously."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile is launched horizontally from a cliff 80 m high. How far has it fallen vertically after 2 seconds? (Use $g = 10\\text{ m/s}^2$)",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "20 m",

          "80 m",
          "40 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(10)(4) = 20$ m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plane flying horizontally at 50 m/s drops a package from a height of 500 m. Where will the plane be when the package hits the ground? (Neglect air resistance)",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "500 m ahead of the package.",
          "Directly above the package.",
          "500 m behind the package.",
          "At the starting point."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Plane and package have same horizontal velocity, so they remain vertically aligned throughout."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile strikes the ground with $v_x = 3\\text{ m/s}$ and $v_y = 4\\text{ m/s}$. What is the impact angle below the horizontal?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\tan\\theta = v_y/v_x = 4/3 = 1.333$, so $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(1.333) = 53.1°$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the trajectory equation $y = \\frac{g}{2v_x^2}x^2$, if gravity $g$ were somehow doubled, what would happen to the vertical drop $y$ for the same horizontal distance $x$?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "The drop y would stay the same.",
          "The drop y would be halved.",
          "The drop y would double.",
          "The drop y would quadruple."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$y \\propto g$, so if $g$ doubles, $y$ doubles."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a horizontally launched projectile follow a 'half-parabola' rather than a full one?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Because it moves too fast to complete the curve.",
          "Because it never moves upward from its launch height.",
          "Because horizontal motion is constant.",
          "Because gravity only turns on halfway through the flight."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Full parabola requires upward and downward motion. Horizontal launch starts at highest point, so only downward half is seen."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair of equations correctly models a horizontal launch from height $h$ with speed $v_0$, taking $t=0$ at launch and neglecting air resistance?",

          "$x(t) = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$, $y(t) = h - v_0t$",

          "11.25 m"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$t = x/v_0 = 30/20 = 1.5$ s. $h = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(10)(2.25) = 11.25$ m."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$v_x = v_0$ constant, $v_y = gt$, so $v = \\sqrt{v_0^2 + (gt)^2}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A common mistake is to use $R = v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)/g$ for the range of a horizontally launched projectile. Why is this incorrect?",
        "image": "",
        "options": [
          "Because $\\theta$ is $90^\\circ$ in a horizontal launch.",
          "Because $\\theta$ is $0^\\circ$.",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For horizontal launch, $\\theta = 0^\\circ$, so $\\sin(0^\\circ) = 0$, giving $R = 0$ incorrectly."
