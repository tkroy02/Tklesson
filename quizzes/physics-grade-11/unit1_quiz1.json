          "0.67 × 10⁻³"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To get 6.7, the decimal point is moved 4 places to the right, resulting in a negative exponent: 6.7 × 10⁻⁴."

          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The leading zeros are not significant. The digits 2, 0, 1, and the trailing zero are significant, giving a total of 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student measures the length of a table as 1.562 m. How many significant figures does this measurement have?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "All non-zero digits and zeros between them are significant. 1.562 has four significant figures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Perform the following addition, reporting the answer with the correct number of significant figures: 12.11 kg + 0.3 kg",
        "options": [
          "12.41 kg",
          "12.4 kg",

          "13 kg"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In addition, the answer is rounded to the least precise decimal place. 0.3 has one decimal place, so 12.11 + 0.3 = 12.41, rounded to 12.4."

          "45,000"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A positive exponent of 5 means move the decimal point 5 places to the right: 4.50 → 450,000."
