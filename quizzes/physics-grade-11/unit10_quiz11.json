        "question": "Which equation represents the energy of a single quantum (photon) of light?",

        "question": "What is a 'Blackbody' in physics?",
        "options": [
          "An idealized object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation.",
          "A hole in space where gravity is so strong light cannot escape.",
          "Any object that is painted with matte black paint.",
          "A star that has run out of fuel and stopped glowing."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A blackbody reflects no light and appears perfectly black when cold, but it acts as a perfect radiator when heated."
      },
      {

        "question": "As the temperature of a blackbody increases, the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation:",

          "Shifts toward shorter wavelengths (blue-shift).",
          "Shifts toward longer wavelengths (red-shift).",
          "Remains exactly the same.",
          "Disappears into the infrared spectrum only."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wien's Displacement Law states that hotter objects emit radiation with higher energy and shorter wavelengths."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does Planck's Constant (h) represent in nature?",
        "options": [
          "The fundamental scale of quantization in the universe.",
          "The maximum speed any particle can reach.",
          "The rate at which an object cools down in a vacuum.",
          "The distance between the nucleus and the electron."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Planck's constant sets the size of the smallest possible 'packets' of energy and action in the universe."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to quantum theory, why does a red light have less energy per photon than a blue light?",
        "options": [
          "Red light has a lower frequency than blue light.",
          "Red light travels slower than blue light in a vacuum.",
          "Red light has a larger amplitude than blue light.",
          "Red photons are physically larger than blue photons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since E = hf, a lower frequency (like that of red light) results in a lower energy per photon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the total power emitted by a blackbody if its absolute temperature is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of 16.",
          "It simply doubles.",
          "It increases by a factor of 4.",
          "It decreases because higher temperatures create shorter waves."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, total power is proportional to T⁴; therefore, $2^4 = 16$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Planck suggested that oscillators in a blackbody can only have energy levels that are:",
        "options": [
          "Integer multiples of hf.",
          "Always equal to the speed of light.",
          "Completely random and unpredictable.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy states are restricted to E = nhf, where n is a whole number (1, 2, 3...)."
