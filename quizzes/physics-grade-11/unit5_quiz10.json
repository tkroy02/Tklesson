    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid sphere (I = 2/5 mr²) rolls without slipping. What fraction of its total kinetic energy is rotational kinetic energy?",
        "options": ["2/7", "2/5", "5/7", "1/2", "3/5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "K_total = K_trans + K_rot = 1/2mv² + 1/2(2/5mr²)(v/r)² = 1/2mv² + 1/5mv² = 7/10mv². The ratio K_rot / K_total is (1/5) / (7/10) = 2/7."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cylinder of mass 4.0 kg is rolling with a translational velocity of 3.0 m/s. If its rotational kinetic energy is 9.0 J, what is its total kinetic energy?",
        "options": ["27.0 J", "18.0 J", "36.0 J", "45.0 J", "9.0 J"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "K_trans = 1/2 * m * v² = 0.5 * 4.0 * 3.0² = 18.0 J. K_total = K_trans + K_rot = 18.0 J + 9.0 J = 27.0 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You are trying to open a heavy door. Why is the door handle placed as far as possible from the hinges?",
        "options": [
          "To maximize the lever arm, reducing the force required",
          "To increase the moment of inertia of the door",
          "To decrease the work done to open the door",
          "To increase the angular velocity of the door",
          "To change the direction of the torque"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torque = Force × Lever Arm. By increasing the distance (lever arm) from the pivot (hinge), a smaller force produces the same torque needed to rotate the door."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.0 kg hoop (I = mr²) starts from rest and rolls down a hill of height 3.0 m. What is its linear velocity at the bottom? (g = 9.8 m/s²)",
        "options": ["5.42 m/s", "7.67 m/s", "3.13 m/s", "9.80 m/s", "4.12 m/s"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "mgh = 1/2mv² + 1/2(mr²)(v/r)² = 1/2mv² + 1/2mv² = mv². v = √(gh) = √(9.8 * 3.0) ≈ 5.42 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mechanic applies a force of 50 N perpendicularly to a wrench at a distance of 0.2 m from a bolt. If they move their hand to a distance of 0.4 m, what force is needed to produce the same torque?",
        "options": ["25 N", "50 N", "100 N", "12.5 N", "20 N"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torque is constant. F1 * d1 = F2 * d2. 50 * 0.2 = F2 * 0.4. 10 = 0.4 * F2. F2 = 25 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following objects of the same mass and radius would have the highest total kinetic energy if they all had the same translational velocity?",
        "options": [
          "A hollow pipe (hoop)",
          "A solid sphere",
          "A solid cylinder",
          "A hollow sphere",
          "They would all be equal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "K_total = 1/2mv² + 1/2Iω². Since m, r, and v are the same, the object with the largest Moment of Inertia (the hoop, I=mr²) will have the highest rotational energy and thus the highest total energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spinning flywheel loses 100 J of energy due to friction as it slows down. If its initial energy was 500 J, what is its final angular velocity compared to its initial (ω_f / ω_i)?",
        "options": ["√(0.8)", "0.8", "0.64", "√(0.2)", "0.2"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "K is proportional to ω². Final Energy = 400 J. 400/500 = (ω_f / ω_i)². 0.8 = (ω_f / ω_i)². Ratio = √0.8."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A force is applied to a door at an angle of 30° to the surface of the door. Compared to a perpendicular force (90°), the torque produced is:",
        "options": [
          "Half as much",
          "Twice as much",
          "The same",
          "√3/2 as much",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torque = rF sin(θ). sin(30°) = 0.5. Therefore, the torque is 50% of the maximum possible torque (which occurs at 90°)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object rolls down an incline. If it is 'slipping' (sliding with no friction), how does its translational velocity at the bottom compare to when it rolls without slipping?",
        "options": [
          "It is faster when slipping",
          "It is faster when rolling",
          "It is the same in both cases",
          "It depends on the mass",
          "It is zero when slipping"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When slipping with no friction, all Potential Energy becomes Translational Kinetic Energy. When rolling, some energy must be 'shared' with rotation, leaving less for translation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 10 kg disk (I = 1/2 mr²) radius 0.5 m is rotating at 4 rad/s. If the mass is doubled but the angular velocity is halved, the rotational kinetic energy:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases by half",
          "Stays the same",
          "Doubles",
          "Is quartered",
          "Increases by 4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "K = 1/2 (1/2 mr²) ω². If m → 2m and ω → 1/2ω, then K_new = 1/2 (1/2 * 2m * r²) * (1/4 ω²) = 1/2 * (1/2 * 1/2 mr² ω²) = 1/2 K_old."
