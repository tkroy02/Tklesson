        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$F_{net} = ma = 3.0 \\times 4.0 = 12$ N right. $F_{net} = 14 + F_2$ ⇒ $F_2 = -2$ N (2 N left)."

          "Because they are not equal in magnitude.",
          "Because they act on different bodies.",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Forces cancel only when they act on the same object. Action-reaction act on different objects."
