        "question": "A bullet weighing 60g is fired at a velocity of 360 m/s at a block weighing 1kg at rest on a frictionless surface. When the bullet hits the block, it becomes lodged in the block and causes the block to move. How fast does the block move after the collision?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inelastic collision. Conservation of momentum: (0.060)(360) + (1)(0) = (1.060)v_f → v_f = 21.6 / 1.060 ≈ 20.4 m/s."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "|v⃗| = √(5² + (-2)²) = √29 ≈ 5.385 m/s. |p⃗| = m|v⃗| = 30 × 5.385 ≈ 161.55 ≈ 162 kg·m/s."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "East = +. Total p = (400)(20) + (800)(-15) = -4000 kg·m/s. v_f = p_total / (400+800) = -4000/1200 ≈ -3.33 m/s (west)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A popular topic in early space exploration was how to safely return modules back to the surface of the earth. Early designs contained materials that could only withstand impulses of up to 4500 kg·m/s before parts of the module became compromised. One such model of mass 500kg is approaching ocean waters and deploys its shoot, reducing its speed to 8 m/s. If the module decelerates to zero velocity in 0.9 seconds upon hitting the water, is the module structurally compromised?",

          "More information is needed to solve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Impulse = Δp = m(v_f - v_i) = 500(0 - 8) = -4000 kg·m/s. Magnitude = 4000 kg·m/s, which is less than 4500 kg·m/s limit → not compromised."

        "options": [
          "By bending our knees we extend the time it takes us to stop, which diminishes the impact force",
          "By bending our knees we use a greater force to stop, which makes the impulse smaller",
          "When we bend our knees we extend the time in which we apply the force that stops us, so our impulse is greater",
          "When we bend our knees we extend the time in which we apply the force that stops us, so our impulse is smaller",
          "By bending our knees we extend the time it takes us to stop, which increases the impact force"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Impulse = F_avg × Δt = Δp (constant). Increasing Δt decreases F_avg, reducing impact force."

        "options": ["140 kg", "120 kg", "100 kg", "70 kg"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "East = +. Momentum: 70(5) + m_T(-4) = (70 + m_T)(-1) → 350 - 4m_T = -70 - m_T → 420 = 3m_T → m_T = 140 kg."
