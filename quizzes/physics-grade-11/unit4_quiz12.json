      {

        "question": "As the angle of the incline ($\\theta$) increases, what happens to the normal force ($F_N$)?",

          "It increases.",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$F_N = mg \\cos \\theta$. As $\\theta$ increases, $\\cos \\theta$ decreases, so normal force decreases."
