      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bimetallic strip consists of brass and iron. When heated, the strip bends toward the iron side. What does this indicate?",
        "options": [
          "Brass has a higher coefficient of linear expansion than iron.",
          "Iron has a higher coefficient of linear expansion than brass.",
          "Iron is a better thermal conductor than brass.",
          "Brass is heavier than iron."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The material that expands more (higher α) will become longer and force the strip to curve toward the material that expands less."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A steel bridge is 100 m long at 0°C. If the temperature rises to 30°C, how much will it expand? (α_steel = 12 x 10⁻⁶ /°C)",
        "options": [
          "0.036 m",
          "0.36 m",
          "0.012 m",
          "1.2 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔL = αL₀ΔT = (12 x 10⁻⁶)(100)(30) = 0.036 m (or 3.6 cm)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an aluminum plate has a circular hole in the center and the entire plate is heated, what happens to the size of the hole?",
        "options": [
          "The hole gets larger.",
          "The hole gets smaller.",
          "The hole stays the same size.",
          "The hole becomes an oval."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thermal expansion acts like a photographic enlargement; every dimension, including gaps and holes, increases proportionally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The coefficient of volume expansion (β) for a specific solid is generally how many times its linear expansion coefficient (α)?",
        "options": [
          "3 times",
          "2 times",
          "Equally the same",
          "Squared"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since volume is three-dimensional ($L^3$), the volumetric coefficient β is approximately $3\alpha$ for isotropic materials."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are expansion joints (gaps) built into concrete highways and sidewalks?",
        "options": [
          "To allow the concrete to expand in summer without buckling.",
          "To provide better traction for tires.",
          "To allow water to drain more easily.",
          "To reduce the amount of concrete needed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without gaps, the internal stress caused by constrained thermal expansion would cause the concrete to crack or buckle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.0 L glass flask is filled to the brim with mercury at 20°C. If heated to 50°C, mercury overflows. Why?",
        "options": [
          "Liquids generally have higher expansion coefficients than solids.",
          "The glass flask contracts while the mercury expands.",
          "Mercury's density increases with temperature.",
          "The flask expands more than the mercury."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both expand, but β_mercury > β_glass. The liquid expands faster than the container's volume increases, causing overflow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the unique property of water regarding thermal expansion between 0°C and 4°C?",
        "options": [
          "It contracts as it is heated from 0°C to 4°C.",
          "It expands faster than any other liquid.",
          "Its volume remains perfectly constant.",
          "It turns into a solid at 4°C."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water is most dense at 4°C. Between 0°C and 4°C, it actually contracts as temperature increases, which is why ice floats."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A copper rod (α = 17 x 10⁻⁶ /°C) is 2.000 m long. To what temperature must it be heated from 20°C to reach a length of 2.0034 m?",
        "options": [
          "120°C",
          "100°C",
          "50°C",
          "140°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔL = 0.0034. 0.0034 = (17x10⁻⁶)(2.0)(ΔT). ΔT = 100. Final Temp = 20 + 100 = 120°C."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following states of matter typically exhibits the highest thermal expansion coefficients?",

          "Gases",
          "Liquids",
          "Solids",
          "All are equal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gases have the weakest intermolecular forces, allowing them to expand much more significantly than liquids or solids for the same temperature change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the temperature of a gas in a flexible container is doubled (in Kelvin) while pressure is constant, what happens to its volume?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It decreases by half.",
          "It increases by 3 times."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Charles's Law (a specific case of volumetric expansion for gases), volume is directly proportional to absolute temperature."
