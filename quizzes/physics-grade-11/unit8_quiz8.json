    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Principle of Superposition, what happens when two wave pulses meet while traveling in opposite directions along the same medium?",
        "options": [
          "The algebraic sum of the individual displacements creates a resultant displacement.",
          "The waves bounce off each other and reverse their direction of travel.",
          "The wave with the higher energy absorbs the wave with the lower energy.",
          "Both waves are permanently destroyed upon contact."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total displacement is the vector sum of the individual displacements at the point of overlap. After passing, the pulses continue in their original directions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two waves of equal amplitude and frequency are perfectly 'in phase'. What is the result of their interference?",
        "options": [
          "Constructive interference resulting in double the amplitude.",
          "Destructive interference resulting in zero amplitude.",
          "The frequency of the resulting wave is doubled.",
          "The speed of the resulting wave increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Being in phase means crests align with crests and troughs align with troughs, causing the displacements to add together constructively."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a standing wave pattern, what are the points called that appear to remain stationary and have zero displacement?",
        "options": [
          "Nodes",
          "Antinodes",
          "Crests",
          "Rarefactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nodes are the result of constant total destructive interference at specific locations in a standing wave."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the minimum path difference required between two identical sound sources for a listener to experience total destructive interference (silence)?",
        "options": [
          "One-half of a wavelength (λ/2)",
          "One full wavelength (λ)",
          "One-quarter of a wavelength (λ/4)",
          "Zero wavelength"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A path difference of λ/2 causes the crest of one wave to meet the trough of the other, shifting them 180° out of phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a wave pulse on a string hits a 'fixed' boundary (like a wall), how does the reflected pulse compare to the incident pulse?",
        "options": [
          "It is inverted (upside down).",
          "It remains upright.",
          "Its speed is doubled.",
          "It disappears completely."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A fixed boundary exerts an equal and opposite force on the string (Newton's 3rd Law), causing the reflected wave to return inverted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A standing wave is formed on a string of length L fixed at both ends. In the first harmonic (fundamental frequency), how many nodes are present?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The fundamental harmonic consists of one 'loop' with nodes at each fixed end and one antinode in the center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What occurs when two sound waves of slightly different frequencies interfere with each other?",
        "options": [
          "Beats are produced.",
          "A standing wave is formed.",
          "The pitch becomes a perfect average.",
          "Total silence is achieved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Beats are periodic fluctuations in loudness caused by the alternating constructive and destructive interference of two different frequencies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two waves, each with an amplitude of 0.5 m, undergo total destructive interference. What is the resultant amplitude?",
        "options": [
          "0.0 m",
          "1.0 m",
          "0.25 m",
          "0.5 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In total destructive interference, the positive displacement of one exactly cancels the negative displacement of the other (+0.5 + -0.5 = 0)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you increase the tension in a guitar string while keeping the length the same, what happens to the frequency of the standing waves produced?",
        "options": [
          "The frequency increases.",
          "The frequency decreases.",
          "The frequency remains the same.",
          "The wavelength increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing tension increases wave speed (v). Since v = fλ and the wavelength is fixed by the string length, the frequency must increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical principle explains why sound waves can bend around corners or through doorways?",
        "options": [
          "Diffraction",
          "Interference",
          "Refraction",
          "Polarization"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diffraction is the bending and spreading of waves as they encounter an obstacle or an opening."
