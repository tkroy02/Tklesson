          "constant velocity",

          "infinite displacement"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A straight line on a displacement-time graph represents constant velocity (uniform motion)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the part labelled P represent?",

          "Total displacement",
          "uniform velocity",
          "uniform deceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The curved section P shows increasing slope, which indicates increasing velocity - this represents uniform acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the part labelled Q represent?",
        "image": "images/kinese2.png",
        "options": [
          "uniform acceleration",
          "Total displacement",

          "uniform deceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The curved section Q shows decreasing slope, which indicates decreasing velocity - this represents uniform deceleration."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the average velocity?",
        "image": "images/kinese2.png",
        "options": [
          "0 m/s",
          "30 m/s",
          "60 m/s",
          "15 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average velocity = total displacement / total time. Since the object returns to its starting point, total displacement = 0, so average velocity = 0 m/s."
      },

          "Q",
          "P + Q"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both P and Q are curved sections, indicating changing velocity. There is no straight line section, so no part represents uniform velocity."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the total displacement of the graph?",

          "None of the options"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For a velocity-time graph with triangular shape, displacement = area under graph = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Symbols for the vertical height and horizontal base were not provided, so correct answer not provided."

          "object at rest"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A straight line on a velocity-time graph represents constant acceleration. The slope (rise/run) gives the acceleration value."

          "object at rest"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A vertical line on a displacement-time graph would represent infinite velocity (instantaneous change in position), which is physically impossible."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A displacement-time graph with a horizontal line represents:",

          "object at rest"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A horizontal line on a displacement-time graph means position is not changing over time, so the object is at rest (zero velocity)."

          "$OA + AB + BC + OD + OC$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
