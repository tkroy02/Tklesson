      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5.0 kg block slides down a frictionless inclined plane that makes a 30° angle with the horizontal. What is the block's acceleration down the incline?",
        "options": [
          "4.9 m/s²",
          "8.5 m/s²",
          "9.8 m/s²",
          "2.5 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On a frictionless incline, acceleration a = g sinθ = 9.8 × sin30° = 9.8 × 0.5 = 4.9 m/s²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 12 kg crate is placed on a ramp inclined at 25°. The coefficient of static friction is 0.40. Will the crate begin to slide down the ramp?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, because mg sinθ > μ_s mg cosθ",
          "No, because friction can hold it",
          "Yes, because μ_s is too small",
          "No, because the angle is too shallow"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Calculate: mg sinθ = 12×9.8×sin25° ≈ 49.7 N. Max static friction = μ_s mg cosθ = 0.40×117.6×cos25° ≈ 42.6 N. Since 49.7 > 42.6, the crate will slide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A skier with total mass 65 kg descends a 20° slope. The coefficient of kinetic friction between skis and snow is 0.10. What is the skier's acceleration down the slope?",
        "options": [
          "2.43 m/s²",
          "3.36 m/s²",
          "1.85 m/s²",
          "4.12 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "a = g(sinθ - μ_k cosθ) = 9.8(sin20° - 0.10 cos20°) = 9.8(0.3420 - 0.09397) = 9.8×0.2480 ≈ 2.43 m/s²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 3.0 kg block is pushed up a 40° incline with a force of 50 N parallel to the incline. μ_k = 0.30. What is the block's acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "8.12 m/s² up the incline",
          "5.45 m/s² up the incline",
          "2.15 m/s² down the incline",
          "1.80 m/s² up the incline"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Downhill component: mg sin40° ≈ 18.90 N. Normal: mg cos40° ≈ 22.52 N. Friction: f_k = 0.30×22.52 ≈ 6.76 N (downhill, opposes motion). Net force uphill: 50 - 18.90 - 6.76 = 24.34 N. a = 24.34/3.0 ≈ 8.12 m/s² up."

        "question": "A 15 kg box is placed on a ramp inclined at 15°. μ_s = 0.35. What minimum force parallel to the incline is needed to prevent the box from sliding down?",
        "options": [
          "0 N (friction alone prevents sliding)",
          "12.5 N up the incline",
          "25.3 N up the incline",
          "38.0 N up the incline"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Downhill component: mg sin15° ≈ 38.04 N. Max static friction: μ_s mg cos15° ≈ 49.70 N. Since max friction > downhill force, friction alone holds it, so no additional force needed."

        "question": "A 2.0 kg block is at rest on a 35° incline. μ_s = 0.45. Does it remain at rest? If not, what is its acceleration (using μ_k = μ_s)?",
        "options": [
          "No, it slides with a ≈ 2.01 m/s² down",
          "Yes, it remains at rest",
          "No, it slides with a ≈ 4.12 m/s² down",
          "Yes, but barely (friction at maximum)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Downhill: mg sin35° ≈ 11.24 N. Max static friction: μ_s mg cos35° ≈ 7.23 N. Since 11.24 > 7.23, it slides. a = g(sinθ - μ_k cosθ) = 9.8(0.5736 - 0.45×0.8192) ≈ 2.01 m/s²."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Deceleration a = g(sinθ + μ_k cosθ) = 9.8(0.4226 + 0.25×0.9063) ≈ 6.36 m/s² down incline. Using v_f² = v₀² + 2ad: 0 = 8.0² + 2(-6.36)d → d ≈ 5.03 m."

          "1.80 m/s² down the incline"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Force components: parallel to incline = 25 cos20° ≈ 23.49 N up, perpendicular = 25 sin20° ≈ 8.55 N into incline. Normal N = mg cos20° + 8.55 ≈ 45.39 N. Friction f_k = 0.15×45.39 ≈ 6.81 N down incline. Downhill weight component: mg sin20° ≈ 13.41 N. Net uphill: 23.49 - 13.41 - 6.81 = 3.27 N. a = 3.27/4.0 ≈ 0.82 m/s² up."
