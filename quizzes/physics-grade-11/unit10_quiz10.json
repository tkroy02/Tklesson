    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental meaning of Einstein's equation E = mc²?",
        "options": [
          "Energy and mass are two different forms of the same thing.",
          "Energy is created when mass moves at the speed of light.",
          "Mass is destroyed to create the speed of light.",
          "Electricity is more powerful than gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation demonstrates that mass is essentially a highly concentrated form of energy, and the two are interchangeable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation E = mc², why is the speed of light (c) squared?",
        "options": [
          "It acts as a massive conversion factor between mass and energy.",
          "Because light travels in two directions at once.",
          "To account for the two different poles of a magnet.",
          "Because the energy is always doubled during a nuclear reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since c is a very large number ($3 \\times 10^8$ m/s), squaring it results in a massive constant, explaining why a tiny amount of matter contains vast energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the measured mass of an object as its velocity increases toward c?",
        "options": [
          "Its relativistic mass increases.",
          "Its mass decreases to zero.",
          "Its mass remains exactly the same as its rest mass.",
          "The object physically grows in size."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As an object gains kinetic energy, that energy manifests as an increase in the object's resistance to acceleration, effectively increasing its relativistic mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Rest Energy'?",
        "options": [
          "The energy an object possesses simply by existing, even at rest.",
          "The energy an object loses when it comes to a complete stop.",
          "The energy required to move an object from Earth to space.",
          "The amount of sleep required by an astronaut."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rest energy is the energy equivalent of an object's rest mass, determined by the formula $E_0 = m_0 c^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which real-world phenomenon is a direct application of E = mc²?",
        "options": [
          "Nuclear fusion in the core of the Sun.",
          "The reflection of light off a mirror.",
          "The combustion of gasoline in a car engine.",
          "The flow of water through a hydroelectric dam."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Sun converts mass into energy by fusing hydrogen into helium; the resulting mass is slightly less than the starting mass, released as radiant energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a nuclear reaction, if the products have less total mass than the reactants, what happened to the missing mass?",
        "options": [
          "It was converted into kinetic energy or radiation.",
          "It disappeared from the universe entirely.",
          "It turned into dark matter.",
          "It was absorbed by the neutrons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'missing' mass (mass defect) is released as energy, calculated by the difference in mass multiplied by $c^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it impossible for an object with mass to reach the speed of light?",
        "options": [
          "Its mass would become infinite, requiring infinite energy to accelerate.",
          "Because the friction of the ether would burn the object up.",
          "Because the object would turn into pure sound.",
          "Because light would push the object backward."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As velocity approaches c, relativistic mass grows toward infinity, meaning no finite amount of energy can accelerate it to exactly c."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 1 kg of matter and 1 kg of antimatter annihilate, how much energy is released?",
        "options": [
          "The energy equivalent of 2 kg of mass (2c²).",
          "Zero energy, because they cancel each other out.",
          "The energy equivalent of only 0.5 kg of mass.",
          "Exactly 1 Joule of energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In total annihilation, 100% of the mass of both the matter and antimatter particles is converted into pure energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is the correct relativistic expression for Total Energy?",
        "options": [
          "E = γm₀c²",
          "E = ½ mv²",
          "E = mgh",
          "E = VIt"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total energy includes the rest energy multiplied by the Lorentz factor (γ), which accounts for the object's motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A compressed spring has more mass than an uncompressed spring.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy and mass are equivalent. The potential energy added to the spring increases its total energy, which technically increases its mass, though the change is too small to measure."
