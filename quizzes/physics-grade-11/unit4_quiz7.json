      {

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The magnitude of the friction force is directly proportional to which other force?",
        "image": "",

          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Static friction is typically harder to overcome, so $\\mu_s > \\mu_k$ for most materials."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true about the magnitude of static friction ($f_s$)?",

        "options": [
          "It is always a constant value regardless of the push.",
          "It adjusts its magnitude to match the applied force up to a certain maximum.",
          "It is always equal to $\\mu_s F_N$ as long as the object is at rest.",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $20\\text{ kg}$ box rests on a floor where the maximum static friction is $98\\text{ N}$. If you push it with a horizontal force of $50\\text{ N}$ and it does not move, what is the actual static friction force?",

          "$48\\text{ N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since box doesn't move, static friction balances applied force: $f_s = 50\\text{ N}$."

        "question": "Once an object begins to slide, the friction force acting on it is called:",

          "It increases.",
          "It stays exactly the same.",

          "It immediately drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Static friction maximum $\\mu_s F_N$ is typically greater than kinetic friction $\\mu_k F_N$, so force drops."

          "The roughness of the surfaces."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Kinetic friction depends on materials and normal force, but is generally independent of speed and contact area."

          "They only apply to objects with no mass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Coefficients of friction are ratios, so they have no units."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which material combination would likely have the lowest coefficient of friction?",

          "Leather on stone"
        ],
