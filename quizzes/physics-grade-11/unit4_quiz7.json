      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cart is traveling at 3 m/s when it launches a ball straight into the air with initial velocity 15 m/s. Ignoring air resistance, how much time will the ball take from launch to return to its initial height?",
        "options": [
          "Δt = 3.0 s",
          "None of these",
          "Δt = 4.5 s",
          "Δt = 1.5 s",
          "Δt = 30 s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The horizontal motion of the cart does not affect vertical air time. For vertical launch: time to return to launch height = 2v₀/g = (2 × 15 m/s) / 9.8 m/s² ≈ 3.06 s ≈ 3.0 s."

        "question": "A car of mass 1110 kg accelerates from 10 m/s to 35 m/s in 2 s. Determine the average total force on the car during this time.",
        "options": [
          "F = 1.4 × 10⁴ N",
          "F = 2.4 × 10⁴ N",
          "F = 4.4 × 10⁴ N",
          "F = 3.9 × 10⁴ N",
          "F = 1.1 × 10⁴ N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average force = mass × average acceleration = m × (Δv/Δt) = 1110 kg × ((35-10) m/s / 2 s) = 1110 × 12.5 = 13,875 N ≈ 1.4 × 10⁴ N."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A space shuttle of mass 2.0 × 10⁶ kg traveling at 700 m/s adjusts its velocity to 770 m/s. What was the impulse?",
        "options": [
          "140 MN·s",
          "80 MN·s",
          "600 kN·s",
          "940 N·s",
          "120 kN·s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Impulse = change in momentum = m(v_f - v_i) = 2.0 × 10⁶ kg × (770 - 700) m/s = 2.0 × 10⁶ × 70 = 140 × 10⁶ N·s = 140 MN·s."

        "question": "A 1500 kg truck driving at 5 m/s launches a 500 kg rocket backwards at 100 m/s relative to the ground. What is the truck's final velocity?",
        "options": [
          "40 m/s",
          "None of these",
          "15 m/s",
          "20 m/s",
          "5 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conservation of momentum: (1500+500)×5 = 1500×v_truck + 500×(-100). 2000×5 = 1500v_truck - 50000 → 1500v_truck = 60000 → v_truck = 40 m/s in the original direction."

        "question": "A golfer putts a 0.046 kg ball 20 m away on grass (μ=0.9). The 1 kg club is swung at 1 rad/s. How long was the golf club and arm?",
        "options": [
          "0.86 m",
          "0.95 m",
          "0.53 m",
          "0.49 m",
          "1.23 m"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, find ball's initial speed from stopping distance: u = √(2μg d) = √(2×0.9×9.8×20) ≈ 18.78 m/s. For an elastic-like collision between club (mass M=1 kg, speed v_c = ωL) and stationary ball (m=0.046 kg), approximate: u ≈ 2M/(M+m) × v_c. Solve for L: 18.78 = (2/(1.046)) × (1×L) → L ≈ 18.78 × 1.046 / 2 ≈ 9.82 m? That seems unrealistic for a putter. However, based on the provided checkmark in your original file, the intended answer is 0.95 m, likely using a different model (e.g., conservation of angular momentum or inelastic collision)."

          "20 N·s",
          "25 N·s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Impulse J = m*v. Kinetic energy KE = ½ m v². Combine: J² = 2m(KE) → m = J²/(2×KE) = (10²)/(2×2500) = 100/5000 = 0.02 kg = 20 g. The impulse magnitude is 10 N·s."

        "options": [
          "-11.8 m/s",
          "-6.1 m/s",
          "-18.4 m/s",
          "-24.5 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic collision. Each mass = 0.0375 kg. Conservation: 0.0375×17.0 + 0.0375×v_B = 0.075×2.60 → 0.6375 + 0.0375v_B = 0.195 → v_B = (0.195 - 0.6375)/0.0375 = -0.4425/0.0375 = -11.8 m/s."

        "options": [
          "They will be the same",
          "Final momentum will be greater",
          "Final momentum will be less",
          "Not enough information"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an isolated system with no external forces, total momentum is conserved. Sticking together (inelastic collision) does not change the total momentum vector."

          "v1f = -v, v2f = 2v",
          "v1f = 0, v2f = 3v"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For equal-mass elastic collisions in 1D, the velocities swap in the center-of-mass frame, which translates to v1f = v2i and v2f = v1i. Here: v1i = v, v2i = -2v. So v1f = -2v, v2f = v."

          "6.78 m/s opposite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conservation of momentum (initially at rest): 0 = 250×14 + 750×v₂ → v₂ = -3500/750 ≈ -4.67 m/s. Negative means opposite direction."
