        "question": "A car is initially $25\\text{ m}$ directly behind a truck. Both vehicles are moving at the same constant speed of $18\\text{ m/s}$ in the same direction. At a certain instant, the car begins to accelerate uniformly at $2.2\\text{ m/s}^2$ to pass the truck. Calculate the time it takes for the car to reach the position of the truck's rear bumper.",
        "options": ["$4.8\\text{ s}$", "$2.4\\text{ s}$", "$7.2\\text{ s}$", "$3.6\\text{ s}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the reference frame of the truck, the car starts at rest (relative velocity = 0) and must cover a relative distance of $25\\text{ m}$ with a relative acceleration of $2.2\\text{ m/s}^2$. Using $s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$: $25 = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}(2.2)t^2 \\rightarrow t^2 = 25/1.1 = 22.73 \\rightarrow t \\approx 4.77 \\approx 4.8\\text{ s}$."

Neglecting air resistance, calculate the total time the ball remains in the air before it strikes the ground below the balcony. Use $g = 9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$.",
        "options": ["$3.55\\text{ s}$", "$2.85\\text{ s}$", "$4.25\\text{ s}$", "$1.90\\text{ s}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Taking downward as positive, the initial displacement is $+12\\text{ m}$, initial velocity is $-14\\text{ m/s}$, and acceleration is $+9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$. Using $s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$: $12 = -14t + 4.9t^2 \\rightarrow 4.9t^2 - 14t - 12 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula: $t = \\frac{14 \\pm \\sqrt{196 + 235.2}}{9.8} = \\frac{14 \\pm \\sqrt{431.2}}{9.8} = \\frac{14 \\pm 20.77}{9.8}$. Taking the positive root: $t = (14 + 20.77)/9.8 = 34.77/9.8 \\approx 3.55\\text{ s}$."

        "explanation": "Using the range formula: $R = \\frac{u^2\\sin(2\\theta)}{g}$. Substituting: $7.8 = \\frac{u^2\\sin(44^{\\circ})}{9.8} = \\frac{u^2(0.6947)}{9.8}$. Solving for $u^2$: $u^2 = \\frac{7.8 \\times 9.8}{0.6947} = \\frac{76.44}{0.6947} = 110.0$. Therefore $u = \\sqrt{110.0} \\approx 10.5\\text{ m/s}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the boat to travel straight across, the upstream component of its velocity must exactly cancel the downstream current. The upstream component is $v_{boat}\\sin\\theta = 5.0 \\times \\sin(25^{\\circ}) = 5.0 \\times 0.4226 \\approx 2.1\\text{ m/s}$. Therefore the current speed is $2.1\\text{ m/s}$."

        "explanation": "The deceleration is constant: $a = -F/m = -450/1200 = -0.375\\text{ m/s}^2$. Using $v = u + at$: $15 = 22 + (-0.375)t \\rightarrow -7 = -0.375t \\rightarrow t = 7/0.375 = 18.67 \\approx 18.7\\text{ s}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the point where sliding just begins, the component of gravity down the ramp equals the maximum static friction force: $mg\\sin\\theta = \\mu_s mg\\cos\\theta$. Canceling $mg$ gives $\\mu_s = \\tan\\theta = \\tan(28^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.532 \\approx 0.53$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The net force on the system is the hanging weight minus the applied force (since the applied force opposes the motion): $F_{net} = m_2g - 10 = 5.0(9.8) - 10 = 49 - 10 = 39\\text{ N}$. Total mass being accelerated is $m_1 + m_2 = 15 + 5 = 20\\text{ kg}$. Therefore $a = F_{net}/m_{total} = 39/20 = 1.95\\text{ m/s}^2$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the bottom of the circular arc, the net upward force provides the centripetal acceleration: $N - mg = mv^2/r$. Thus $N = m(g + v^2/r) = 75(9.8 + (110)^2/400) = 75(9.8 + 12100/400) = 75(9.8 + 30.25) = 75(40.05) \\approx 3004 \\approx 3000\\text{ N}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With both resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance is $R_{eq} = V/I = 12/5 = 2.4\\Omega$. Using the parallel resistance formula: $\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{4.0} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2.4} = 0.25 + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{R_2} = \\frac{1}{2.4} - 0.25 = 0.4167 - 0.25 = 0.1667$.

        "explanation": "This is a Doppler effect situation with the source moving toward a stationary observer: $f' = f\\frac{v}{v - v_s}$. Substituting: $30450 = 30000\\frac{1500}{1500 - v_s}$. Simplifying: $\\frac{30450}{30000} = \\frac{1500}{1500 - v_s} \\rightarrow 1.015 = \\frac{1500}{1500 - v_s}$.
