    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is moving in Simple Harmonic Motion, what is the phase difference between its displacement and its acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "180° (out of phase)",
          "0° (in phase)",
          "90° (quarter cycle)",
          "360° (full cycle)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the relationship a = -ω²x, acceleration is always proportional to displacement but in the opposite direction. When displacement is at a positive maximum, acceleration is at a negative maximum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the exact moment an oscillator passes through the equilibrium position, which of the following is true about its acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "The acceleration is zero.",
          "The acceleration is at its maximum magnitude.",
          "The acceleration is changing direction.",
          "The acceleration is equal to 9.8 m/s²."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, displacement (x) is zero. Since the restoring force is F = -kx, there is no net force and therefore no acceleration at that specific instant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following remains constant throughout the entire motion of an ideal Simple Harmonic Oscillator?",
        "options": [
          "The total mechanical energy.",
          "The magnitude of the restoring force.",
          "The velocity of the mass.",
          "The potential energy of the system."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an ideal system without friction, energy is constantly shuffled between kinetic and potential forms, but the total mechanical energy (Etot = Ek + Ep) remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a mass-spring system, what happens to the maximum speed of the mass if the amplitude of oscillation is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "The maximum speed doubles.",
          "The maximum speed increases by a factor of four.",
          "The maximum speed remains the same.",
          "The maximum speed is halved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maximum velocity is defined as vmax = ωA. Since ω (angular frequency) depends only on k and m, doubling the amplitude (A) directly doubles the maximum speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are observing a graph of velocity vs. time for an SHM system, what does the slope of the line represent at any given point?",
        "options": [
          "The instantaneous acceleration of the object.",
          "The instantaneous displacement of the object.",
          "The restoring force constant (k).",
          "The total energy of the system."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In any motion graph, the slope of a velocity-time graph represents the rate of change of velocity, which is acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At which point in the cycle are the kinetic energy and potential energy of an SHM system equal to each other?",
        "options": [
          "When displacement is A/√2.",
          "At exactly half the amplitude (A/2).",
          "At the equilibrium position.",
          "At the maximum displacement (A)."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Potential energy is 1/2 kx². For this to equal half of the total energy (1/2 kA²), x² must equal A²/2, meaning x = A/√2 (approx. 0.707A)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the period of a simple pendulum not depend on the mass of the bob?",
        "options": [
          "Both the restoring force and inertia are proportional to mass, so mass cancels out.",
          "Because gravity is the only force acting on the bob.",
          "Because mass only affects systems with springs, not systems with gravity.",
          "Because the bob is in a state of free-fall throughout its swing."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The driving force is mg*sin(θ) and the resistance to motion (inertia) is m. Because mass appears on both sides of F=ma, it cancels out, making the acceleration independent of the mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the stiffness of a spring (spring constant k) is increased, what is the effect on the frequency of oscillation?",
        "options": [
          "The frequency increases.",
          "The frequency decreases.",
          "The frequency remains the same.",
          "The frequency becomes independent of the mass."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since frequency f = (1/2π)√(k/m), a larger spring constant k increases the numerator, leading to a higher frequency (faster oscillations)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the magnitude of acceleration of a mass in SHM as it moves from the amplitude toward the equilibrium position?",
        "options": [
          "The magnitude of the acceleration decreases.",
          "The magnitude of the acceleration increases.",
          "The acceleration remains constant.",
          "The acceleration becomes positive regardless of its previous sign."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the object moves toward equilibrium, the displacement (x) decreases. Since a = -kx/m, the magnitude of acceleration decreases as x approaches zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'restoring force' in a simple pendulum?",
        "options": [
          "The component of gravity acting tangent to the path of motion.",
          "The tension in the string.",
          "The full weight of the pendulum bob.",
          "Air resistance pushing against the direction of motion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity pulls vertically. The component mg*sin(θ) acts along the arc of the swing, always pointing back toward the equilibrium position."
