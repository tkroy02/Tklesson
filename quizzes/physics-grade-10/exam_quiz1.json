    "Its mass decreases",
    "Its weight is less than on Earth",
    "Its weight remains the same as on Earth"

  "options": [
    "Gravity",
    "Normal Force",
    "Friction",
    "Net Force"
  ],
  "answer": ["A", "B"],
  "explanation": "Gravity pulls downward, and the normal force pushes upward from the table. Net force is not a separate force—it is the vector sum of all forces. Friction is not acting because the book is motionless with no applied force trying to slide it."

    "The object's weight.",
    "The object's inertia.",
    "The gravitational force acting on the object."
  ],
  "answer": ["B", "D"],
  "explanation": "Mass and inertia are properties of the object itself and do not change with location. Weight and gravitational force depend on the local acceleration due to gravity, which is different on the Moon."

    "The force of kinetic friction is acting on the block.",
    "The block is in equilibrium."
  ],
  "answer": ["A", "B", "D"],
  "explanation": "Since the block is at rest and not moving, net force is zero and it is in equilibrium. Static friction exactly balances the applied force up to its maximum limit. Kinetic friction only acts when the object is sliding, so C is false."

    "Potential energy is constant",
    "Net work being done on the car is zero",
    "Total mechanical energy is increasing"
  ],
  "answer": ["A", "B", "C"],
  "explanation": "Kinetic energy is constant because speed is constant. Potential energy is constant because the road is flat (no height change). Net work is zero because kinetic energy is constant (work-energy theorem). Total mechanical energy (KE + PE) is constant, not increasing, so D is false."
},

    "The balloon will be attracted to the rod.",
    "The balloon will stay perfectly still.",
    "The balloon will lose its charge and become neutral."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "According to the Law of Electric Charges, like charges repel each other. Since both the rod and the balloon are negatively charged, they will push away from one another."

    "4 units",
    "12 units",
    "9 units",
    "108 units"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Coulomb's Law follows the inverse-square law for distance ($F \\propto 1/d^2$). If the distance increases by a factor of 3, the force decreases by $3^2$, which is 9. Therefore, $36 \\div 9 = 4\\,\\text{units}$."

  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "In series, resistances add directly: $R_s = R_1 + R_2 = 12 + 12 = 24\\, \\Omega$. In parallel, the reciprocal rule applies: $1/R_p = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 = 1/12 + 1/12 = 2/12 = 1/6$. Therefore, $R_p = 6\\, \\Omega$."

  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Power is calculated using $P = I \\times V$. To find the current, rearrange the formula to $I = P / V$. Therefore, $1200\\,\\text{W} / 120\\,\\text{V} = 10.0\\,\\text{A}$."

  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Using the formula $P = I^2R$, we square the current first ($3.0^2 = 9.0$) and then multiply by the resistance ($9.0 \\times 20 = 180\\, \\text{W}$)."
