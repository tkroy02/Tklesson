    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What physical property quantitatively measures an object's inertia?",
        "options": [
          "Weight",
          "Volume",
          "Mass",
          "Density"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mass is the quantitative measure of inertia - objects with greater mass have greater resistance to changes in motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Newton's Second Law, how does acceleration relate to mass when force is constant?",
        "options": [
          "Acceleration is directly proportional to mass",
          "Acceleration is inversely proportional to mass",
          "Acceleration is unrelated to mass",
          "Acceleration increases exponentially with mass"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $F = ma$, when force is constant, acceleration is inversely proportional to mass: $a = \\frac{F}{m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a freight train have much greater inertia than a passenger car?",
        "options": [
          "Trains have better engines",
          "Trains have more wheels",
          "Trains have much greater mass",
          "Trains travel on steel rails"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inertia is directly proportional to mass. A freight train's enormous mass (millions of kg) gives it tremendous inertia compared to a car (~2000 kg)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the required stopping distance when a vehicle's speed doubles?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles",

          "Steel wheels slip on tracks"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A freight train's mass of ~10,000 tons creates such enormous inertia that stopping requires 1-2 km even with maximum braking."
      },

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do seatbelts protect passengers during sudden stops?",
        "options": [
          "They make passengers lighter",
          "They provide the force to overcome inertia",

          "Brake materials work better on light vehicles"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Greater mass means greater inertia and more kinetic energy, requiring more powerful brakes to achieve the same deceleration."
      },
      {

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Double mass (2×) and double speed (4× from $v^2$) gives 2 × 4 = 8× the kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of crumple zones in vehicles?",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the 3-second following distance rule recommended?",
        "options": [
          "It's easy to remember",
          "It accounts for reaction time and stopping distance",
          "It makes traffic flow smoother",
          "It's required by law everywhere"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The 3-second rule ensures sufficient distance for human reaction time plus the physics-based stopping distance required by inertia and friction limits."
      },

          "All vehicles stop equally well",
          "Vehicle mass affects stopping capability and collision forces",
          "Mass only matters for commercial vehicles"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Understanding that greater mass means greater inertia and kinetic energy helps drivers appreciate why heavier vehicles require different driving strategies and have different collision dynamics."
