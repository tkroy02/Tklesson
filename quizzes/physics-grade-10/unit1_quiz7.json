    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental difference between speed and velocity?",
        "options": [
          "Speed is always faster than velocity",
          "Velocity includes direction, speed does not",
          "Speed is measured in m/s, velocity in km/h",
          "Speed is for cars, velocity is for planes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Speed is a scalar quantity (magnitude only), while velocity is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction). Both can be measured in the same units."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Speed is a scalar quantity, so it only needs magnitude: '18 m/s'. The other options with directions represent velocity."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both speed and velocity are measured in units of distance per time, such as meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h)."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Speed is the magnitude of velocity, so if velocity is 12 m/s East, the speed is 12 m/s (scalar quantity, no direction)."

          "Velocity that is very high"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Displacement North = 45 m, Displacement South = 60 m, Net displacement = 15 m South. Total time = 30 s. Average velocity = 15 m South ÷ 30 s = 0.5 m/s South"
      },

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Time for first part = 80 km ÷ 50 km/h = 1.6 h, Time for second part = 80 km ÷ 80 km/h = 1 h, Total distance = 160 km, Total time = 2.6 h, Average speed = 160 km ÷ 2.6 h = 61.5 km/h"

          "18 m/s East"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When velocities are in the same direction, they add: 6 m/s East + 3 m/s East = 9 m/s East (vector addition)"

          "This situation is impossible"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When an object moves in a circle at constant speed, the speed is constant but the velocity changes because the direction is constantly changing."

          "10 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
