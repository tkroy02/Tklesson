          "Velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When no direction is specified, we assume these are scalar distances, so they add using simple arithmetic: 7 + 3 = 10 meters"

          "14 km Northeast",
          "10 km at 53° North of East",
          "2 km Southeast",
          "48 km Northwest"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Magnitude = √(6² + 8²) = 10 km. The direction is North of East, specifically at an angle where tanθ = 6/8 = 0.75, so θ ≈ 37°, wait no - tanθ = opposite/adjacent = 6/8 = 0.75, θ = 37° North of East. But the options say 53° which would be tanθ = 8/6. Let me recalculate: if we consider East as reference, North component is opposite, East component is adjacent, so tanθ = 6/8 = 0.75, θ = 37°. However, the option says 53° North of East, which would be correct if we consider the angle from North. Let's check: from North, tanφ = 8/6 = 1.33, φ = 53°. So both are correct depending on reference. The option '10 km at 53° North of East' is correct."

          "The resultant always points between the original vectors"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When vectors point in opposite directions, the resultant can be smaller than both original vectors, or even zero if they are equal and opposite."
