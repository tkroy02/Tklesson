      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The figure below shows a wheel moving from point P to point Q along a frictionless path. Which of the following has the highest gravitational potential energy of A, B, C and D?",
        "image": "images/potential01.png",
        "options": [
          "A",
          "B",
          "C",
          "D"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravitational potential energy (PE) is given by PE = mgh. Since mass (m) and gravitational acceleration (g) are constant, PE is directly proportional to height (h) above the reference point. Point A is at the highest elevation, so it has the greatest gravitational potential energy."

        "question": "The figure below shows a wheel moving from point P to point Q along a frictionless path. Which of the following has the highest kinetic energy?",
        "image": "images/potential01.png",
        "options": [
          "A",
          "B",
          "C",
          "D"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In a frictionless system, mechanical energy is conserved (PE + KE = constant). Kinetic energy (KE) is highest when potential energy (PE) is lowest. Point D is at the lowest elevation, meaning it has the least PE and therefore the most KE."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is said to do a negative work?",
        "options": [
          "An object projected vertically upward while gravity tries to pull it down.",
          "A motorist slamming on the accelerator of his car to move his car even faster.",
          "A man who sits in a chair and watches the evening news.",
          "A soccer player who kicks a football and watches as it goes into the goal post."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work is negative when the force applied is opposite to the direction of displacement. For an object moving upward, the gravitational force acts downward, opposing the motion. Therefore, gravity does negative work on the object."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A man pushes a heavy box across a rough floor at a constant speed. Which force is doing positive work on the box?",
        "options": [
          "The force of gravity pulling down on the box",
          "The applied force from the man's push",
          "The friction force opposing the motion",
          "The normal force from the floor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The man's applied force is in the same direction as the box's displacement, so it does positive work. Friction does negative work, and gravity and the normal force do zero work as they are perpendicular to the displacement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A weightlifter slowly lowers a heavy barbell to the floor. Regarding the work done by the weightlifter's arms on the barbell, which is correct?",
        "options": [
          "Positive work, because he is exerting a force",
          "Negative work, because his force opposes the downward motion",
          "No work, because the barbell ends up lower",
          "Cannot be determined without the mass"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The weightlifter exerts an upward force to control the descent, but the barbell moves downward. Force and displacement are in opposite directions, so the work done by the lifter is negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student carries a backpack horizontally across the room at a constant height. What is the work done by the student on the backpack?",
        "options": [
          "Positive work",
          "Negative work",
          "No work",
          "It depends on the weight of the backpack"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The student exerts an upward force to support the backpack, but the displacement is horizontal. The force (vertical) is perpendicular to the displacement (horizontal), so no work is done by the student's supporting force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car's brakes are applied, bringing it to a stop. The work done by the friction force in the brakes is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive",
          "Negative",
          "Zero",
          "First positive, then negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The friction force from the brakes acts opposite to the car's direction of motion (displacement). Therefore, it does negative work, removing kinetic energy from the car."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario describes a force doing ZERO work?",
        "options": [
          "A child pulls a wagon forward.",
          "A person lifts a suitcase off the ground.",
          "A planet orbits the Sun in a circular path due to gravity.",
          "A hockey player shoots a puck across the ice."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For circular orbit, the gravitational force is always directed toward the center (centripetal), while the instantaneous displacement is tangential. The force is perpendicular to the displacement, so gravity does zero work on the orbiting planet."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A father pulls a child in a sled through the snow. The rope makes a 30° angle with the horizontal. The horizontal component of the father's pull does:",
        "options": [
          "Positive work",
          "Negative work",
          "No work",
          "Positive or negative work depending on speed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The horizontal component of the force is in the same direction as the horizontal displacement of the sled. Therefore, it does positive work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A book sits at rest on a table. What is the work done by the normal force from the table on the book over a 10-minute period?",
        "options": [
          "Positive work",
          "Negative work",
          "No work",
          "It increases over time"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Work requires displacement. The book is at rest, so its displacement is zero. Therefore, the work done by the normal force is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is thrown upward. On its way UP, what is the work done by air resistance?",
        "options": [
          "Positive work",
          "Negative work",
          "No work",
          "Positive at first, then negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Air resistance always opposes motion. As the ball moves upward, air resistance acts downward, opposite to the displacement. Therefore, it does negative work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mover pushes a crate up a ramp into a truck. The force he applies is parallel to the ramp. The work done by the mover is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive, because force and displacement are in the same direction",
          "Negative, because he is working against gravity",
          "Zero, because the crate gains potential energy",
          "Negative, because the ramp has friction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The applied force is parallel to the ramp and in the same direction as the displacement along the ramp. Therefore, the work done by the mover is positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite is in a stable circular orbit around Earth. The work done by Earth's gravity on the satellite during one complete orbit is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive",
          "Negative",
          "Zero",
          "Equal to the satellite's kinetic energy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a circular orbit, the gravitational force is centripetal—always perpendicular to the satellite's instantaneous velocity (and therefore displacement). A force perpendicular to displacement does zero work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You hold a book against a vertical wall by pushing on it horizontally, preventing it from falling. As you hold it steady, what is the work done by your push?",
        "options": [
          "Positive work",
          "Negative work",
          "No work",
          "It's impossible to tell"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Your push is horizontal, but the book has no displacement (it is held steady). Since displacement is zero, the work done by your force is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring is compressed and then released, launching a ball. During the launch, the work done by the spring on the ball is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive",
          "Negative",
          "Zero",
          "First positive, then negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The spring force and the ball's displacement are in the same direction during the launch (the spring pushes the ball forward as it expands). Therefore, the spring does positive work on the ball, transferring energy to it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car is driving up a steep hill at a constant speed. Regarding the work done by the engine force, which statement is correct?",
        "options": [
          "The engine does zero work because speed is constant.",
          "The engine does positive work to overcome gravity and friction.",
          "The engine does negative work because it's going uphill.",
          "The engine does no work if the hill is frictionless."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The engine force is in the direction of motion (forward) to overcome the opposing forces of gravity (downhill component) and friction. Force and displacement are in the same direction, so the engine does positive work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Positive work",
          "Negative work",
          "No work",
          "Positive for lifting, negative for walking"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The arm exerts an upward force to hold the suitcase, but the displacement of the suitcase is horizontal. The force (vertical) is perpendicular to the displacement (horizontal), so no work is done by the arm's supporting force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When you catch a fast-moving ball, your hands apply a force to slow it down. The work done by your hands on the ball is:",

          "Zero",
          "It depends on the ball's mass"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Your hands apply a force opposite to the ball's direction of motion to stop it. Force and displacement are in opposite directions, so the work done by your hands is negative (you remove kinetic energy from the ball)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A crane lifts a steel beam vertically upward at a constant speed. The work done by the crane's cable on the beam is:",

          "Positive",
          "Negative",
          "Zero",
          "Zero because speed is constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The tension in the cable acts upward, and the displacement is also upward. Force and displacement are in the same direction, so the work done by the cable is positive."

          "The normal force as a person jumps into the air."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a falling raindrop, the force of gravity (downward) and the displacement (downward) are in the same direction. Therefore, gravity does positive work on the drop, increasing its kinetic energy until air resistance balances it."
