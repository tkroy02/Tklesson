        "question": "What is the overall shape of the displacement-time graph for vertical projectile motion?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "A parabola (cap-shaped curve)",
          "A straight line",
          "A hyperbola",
          "A sinusoidal wave"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertical displacement follows the quadratic equation s = ut - ½gt², which is a parabolic relationship."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the steep upward slope at the start represent?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "The initial high velocity of the object moving upward",
          "The acceleration due to gravity",
          "The maximum height reached",
          "The time of flight"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A steeper slope means greater velocity; at t = 0, the object is thrown with its maximum speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the velocity at the highest point of the curve?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "The velocity becomes zero momentarily",
          "The velocity is maximum",
          "The velocity is half the initial velocity",
          "The velocity is negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The object stops moving upward before starting to fall downward — this is the turning point where kinetic energy is momentarily zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is the time taken to rise equal to the time to fall?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "Yes, in a vacuum (no air resistance)",
          "No, rising takes longer",
          "No, falling takes longer",
          "It depends on the initial velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The motion is symmetric — same acceleration g acts downward both ways, so ascent and descent times are equal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the slope of the graph related to velocity?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "The slope = instantaneous velocity",
          "The slope = acceleration",
          "The slope = displacement",
          "The slope = time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since displacement-time graphs have slope = change in displacement ÷ change in time, a positive slope means upward motion and a negative slope means downward motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Object at rest",
          "Constant acceleration",
          "Variable acceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A horizontal line in a velocity-time graph represents uniform or constant velocity, hence the object is moving uniformly at 6m/s without acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the graph flatten at the top?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "Because velocity = 0 m/s there",
          "Because acceleration is maximum",
          "Because displacement is zero",
          "Because time stops"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The slope of the displacement-time graph becomes horizontal when velocity is zero — the object is momentarily at rest at maximum height."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the downward-sloping portion represent?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "The falling motion of the object back toward the ground",
          "The object slowing down",
          "The object at constant velocity",
          "The object accelerating upward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The negative slope indicates decreasing displacement — the object is moving downward with increasing speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the total time of flight for an object thrown up at 20 m/s? (g = 9.8 m/s²)",

          "4.08 s",
          "2.04 s",
          "6.12 s",
          "8.16 s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Time to rise = u/g = 2.04 s, and the total flight time is twice that because ascent = descent: 2 × 2.04 = 4.08 s"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the maximum height reached by an object thrown upward at 20 m/s? (g = 9.8 m/s²)",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",

          "20.4 m",
          "10.2 m",
          "40.8 m",
          "15.3 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the top, velocity = 0, so using v² = u² - 2gh, we get h = u²/2g = (20)²/(2 × 9.8) = 400/19.6 ≈ 20.4 m"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what point is the acceleration of the object greatest?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "Acceleration is constant throughout",
          "At the highest point",
          "At the start of motion",
          "Just before hitting the ground"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity provides constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s² downward throughout the entire motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the velocity of the object when it returns to its starting point?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "Equal to the initial velocity but downward",
          "Zero",
          "Half the initial velocity",
          "Twice the initial velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to symmetry, the object returns with the same speed as it was thrown, but in the opposite direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does air resistance affect the motion shown in the graph?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "It makes the ascent time shorter than descent time",
          "It makes the descent time shorter than ascent time",
          "It doesn't affect the symmetry",
          "It increases the maximum height"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Air resistance reduces the maximum height and makes the ascent time shorter than descent time, breaking the perfect symmetry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the displacement when the object returns to its starting point?",

          "Zero",
          "Equal to maximum height",
          "Half the maximum height",
          "Twice the maximum height"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Displacement is measured from the starting point, so when the object returns, its displacement is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During which part of the motion is the velocity positive?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "During the upward journey only",
          "During the downward journey only",
          "Throughout the motion",
          "Only at the highest point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity is positive (upward) during ascent and negative (downward) during descent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the acceleration at the highest point?",

          "9.8 m/s² downward",
          "Zero",
          "9.8 m/s² upward",
          "It varies"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even though velocity is zero at the highest point, acceleration due to gravity remains constant at 9.8 m/s² downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would the graph change if the object were thrown with greater initial velocity?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "The parabola would be wider and taller",
          "The parabola would be narrower",
          "The shape would change to a straight line",
          "It would be identical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Greater initial velocity increases both the maximum height and total time of flight, making the parabola wider and taller."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the speed of the object halfway up during ascent?",
        "image": "images/grade-10-kinematics3.png",
        "options": [
          "Less than initial speed but greater than zero",

          "Zero",
          "Greater than initial speed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The object slows down continuously during ascent, so at halfway up, its speed is less than initial speed but still positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Conceptual: Why is projectile motion analysis important in physics?",
        "options": [
          "It demonstrates fundamental principles of kinematics and gravity",
          "It's only useful for sports applications",
          "It applies only to objects thrown vertically",
          "It's a theoretical concept with no real applications"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Projectile motion demonstrates key physics principles including constant acceleration, energy conservation, and the independence of horizontal and vertical motions."
