    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between a base quantity and a derived quantity in the SI system?",
        "options": [
          "Base quantities are more important than derived quantities",
          "Base quantities are defined independently, while derived quantities are defined in terms of base quantities",
          "Base quantities are measured directly, derived quantities are calculated",
          "Base quantities use prefixes, derived quantities do not"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Base quantities (length, mass, time, etc.) are defined independently and form the foundation of the SI system. Derived quantities (force, energy, velocity) are defined mathematically in terms of base quantities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the kilogram currently defined in terms of the Planck constant rather than a physical artifact?",
        "options": [
          "The physical artifact was lost",
          "To make it easier for students to understand",

          "To make the kilogram smaller"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The kilogram was redefined in 2019 using the Planck constant to create a standard that is invariant, universally reproducible, and based on fundamental constants of nature, eliminating dependence on a physical object that could change over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "explanation": "Dimensional analysis involves checking that both sides of an equation have the same physical dimensions. It's useful for verifying equations, deriving relationships, and identifying errors in calculations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If velocity has dimensions of LT⁻¹ and acceleration has dimensions of LT⁻², what are the dimensions of force?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Random errors are unpredictable variations that differ between measurements, while systematic errors are consistent biases that affect all measurements in the same way. Random errors affect precision, systematic errors affect accuracy."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The ± notation indicates the uncertainty or estimated error in the measurement. In this case, the true value is expected to lie between 15.4 cm and 15.8 cm."

          "They are the same thing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
