    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the mathematical condition for equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "$F_{net} > 0$",
          "$F_{net} < 0$",
          "$F_{net} = 0$",
          "$F_{net} = ma$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium occurs when the net force equals zero: $F_{net} = 0$, resulting in zero acceleration according to Newton's Second Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between static and dynamic equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "Static has constant velocity, dynamic has acceleration",
          "Static is at rest, dynamic has constant velocity",
          "Static has net force, dynamic has zero net force",
          "Static involves rotation, dynamic involves translation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Static equilibrium: object at rest ($v = 0$). Dynamic equilibrium: object moving with constant velocity ($v = \\text{constant}$). Both have $F_{net} = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A book rests on a table. What forces are balanced in vertical equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "Weight down and friction sideways",
          "Weight down and normal force up",
          "Normal force up and applied force sideways",
          "Weight down and tension up"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In vertical equilibrium, the weight downward is balanced by the normal force upward from the table: $F_g = F_N$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What condition must be satisfied for horizontal equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Sigma F_x > 0$",
          "$\\Sigma F_x < 0$",
          "$\\Sigma F_x = 0$",
          "$\\Sigma F_x = ma$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Horizontal equilibrium requires the sum of all horizontal force components to equal zero: $\\Sigma F_x = 0$."

          "There are no forces acting"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At constant velocity, the engine force forward exactly balances friction and air resistance backward, so $F_{net} = 0$ - this is dynamic equilibrium."
      },
      {

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rotational equilibrium occurs when the sum of all torques equals zero: $\\Sigma \\tau = 0$, preventing angular acceleration."

        "question": "A sign hangs motionless from two cables. What equilibrium conditions apply?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Torque = force × lever arm, where the lever arm is the perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of force action: $\\tau = F \\times d_\\perp$."

          "No equilibrium present"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A balanced seesaw demonstrates rotational equilibrium - the clockwise and counterclockwise torques about the pivot point are equal."
      },
      {

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Complete equilibrium requires force balance in all directions ($\\Sigma F_x = 0$, $\\Sigma F_y = 0$) and torque balance ($\\Sigma \\tau = 0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object floats in water. What equilibrium condition is satisfied?",

          "Only vertical equilibrium",
          "Both vertical and rotational equilibrium",
          "Complete equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A floating object satisfies vertical equilibrium: buoyant force upward equals weight downward. It may or may not satisfy other equilibrium conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to an object in equilibrium if one force suddenly increases?",
        "options": [
          "It remains in equilibrium",
          "It accelerates in the direction of the increased force",
          "It moves at constant speed",
          "It rotates without translating"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If one force increases, the net force is no longer zero, and the object accelerates according to $F_{net} = ma$ in the direction of the net force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ladder leans against a frictionless wall. Why might it not be in complete equilibrium?",

          "Torques don't balance",
          "It's always in equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With a frictionless wall, there's no horizontal force at the top to balance the torque from the ladder's weight, so torques don't balance and the ladder could rotate."
      },

          "100 N"
        ],
        "answer": "C",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An object can have $\\Sigma F = 0$ (no translation) but $\\Sigma \\tau \\neq 0$ (rotation occurs) if forces create a net torque."

          "Weight",
          "Kinetic friction",
          "Tension"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At constant speed, the applied push forward is balanced by kinetic friction backward, maintaining horizontal equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when both $\\Sigma F = 0$ and $\\Sigma \\tau = 0$?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When both $\\Sigma F = 0$ and $\\Sigma \\tau = 0$, the object experiences no translation and no rotation - it maintains its exact motion state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is choosing the pivot point carefully important in torque problems?",
        "options": [
          "It changes the mass of the object",
          "It can eliminate unknown forces from the torque equation",
          "It affects the gravitational constant",
          "It determines if equilibrium exists"
