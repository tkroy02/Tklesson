        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Upward pulling reduces the normal force because the vertical component of tension helps support some of the weight."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In equilibrium, the vector sum of all forces equals zero (ΣF = 0), resulting in no acceleration."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Friction is proportional to normal force (f = μN), so when normal force decreases, friction decreases proportionally."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The optimal angle depends on the friction coefficient - upward pulling reduces normal force and friction, but also reduces the horizontal component."
