      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the kinetic theory of gases, when the absolute temperature of an ideal gas doubles, the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas",
        "options": ["quadruples", "doubles", "is cut in half", "is quartered"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\langle KE \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T$, so doubling T doubles the average kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When gas escapes from a pressurized cylinder, the stream of gas feels cool. This is because",
        "options": [
          "Work is being done at the expense of thermal energy.",
          "Of the convection inside the cylinder.",
          "Pressurized cylinders are good thermal insulators.",
          "The moisture in the air condenses and cools."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The gas expands rapidly doing work against atmospheric pressure, which reduces internal energy and temperature (adiabatic cooling)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A thermodynamic system is taken from an initial state X along the path XYZX as shown in the PV-diagram. For the process X→Y, ΔU is greater than zero and",
        "image": "images/therm1.png",
        "options": ["Q < 0 and W = 0", "Q < 0 and W > 0", "Q > 0 and W < 0", "Q > 0 and W > 0"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "From first law: ΔU = Q − W > 0 ⇒ Q > W. From PV diagram: X→Y is expansion → W > 0. Thus Q > 0 and Q > W."

        "question": "A thermodynamic system is taken from an initial state X along the path XYZX as shown in the PV-diagram. For the process Y→Z, Q is greater than zero and",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From PV diagram: Y→Z is constant volume → W = 0. Given Q > 0, first law gives ΔU = Q > 0."

        "question": "If three identical samples of an ideal gas are taken from initial state I to final state F along the paths IAF, IF, and IBF as shown in the pV-diagram above, which of the following must be true?",
        "image": "images/therm2.png",
        "options": [
          "The heat absorbed by the gas is the same for all three paths.",
          "The change in internal energy of the gas is the same for all three paths.",
          "The expansion along path IF is adiabatic.",
          "The expansion along path IF is isothermal."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. Since initial state I and final state F are the same for all paths, ΔU is the same regardless of path. Heat Q depends on work W (area under path), so Q differs for each path. Path IF is a straight line, not necessarily following pV^γ = constant (adiabatic) or pV = constant (isothermal)."

        "question": "Gas in a chamber passes through the cycle ABCA as shown in the diagram above. In the process AB, 12 joules of heat is transferred to the gas. In the process BC, no heat is exchanged with the gas. For the complete cycle ABCA, the work done by the gas is 8 joules. How much heat is added to or removed from the gas during process CA?",
        "image": "images/therm3.png",
        "options": ["20 J is removed.", "4 J is removed.", "4 J is added.", "20 J is added."],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a complete cycle, ΔU = 0. Using first law: Q_net − W_cycle = 0 ⇒ (Q_AB + Q_BC + Q_CA) − 8 = 0 ⇒ (12 + 0 + Q_CA) = 8 ⇒ Q_CA = −4 J. Negative means 4 J is removed."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the gas in a container absorbs 275 joules of heat, has 125 joules of work done on it, and then does 50 joules of work, what is the increase in the internal energy of the gas?",
        "options": ["450 J", "400 J", "350 J", "200 J"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "First law: ΔU = Q − W_by_gas. Net work by gas = −125 + 50 = −75 J. So ΔU = 275 − (−75) = 350 J."
