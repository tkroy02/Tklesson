    "topic": "Kinetic theory applications, adiabatic processes, PV diagrams, first law of thermodynamics",
    "duration": 45,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the kinetic theory of gases, when the absolute temperature of an ideal gas doubles, the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas",
        "options": [
          "quadruples",
          "doubles",
          "is cut in half",
          "is quartered"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\langle KE \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T$, so doubling T doubles the average kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When gas escapes from a pressurized cylinder, the stream of gas feels cool. This is because",
        "options": [
          "Work is being done at the expense of thermal energy.",
          "Of the convection inside the cylinder.",
          "Pressurized cylinders are good thermal insulators.",
          "The moisture in the air condenses and cools."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The gas expands rapidly doing work against atmospheric pressure, which reduces internal energy and temperature (adiabatic cooling)."

        "question": "A thermodynamic system is taken from an initial state X along the path XYZX as shown in the PV-diagram. For the process X→Y, ΔU is greater than zero and",

          "Q < 0 and W = 0",

          "Q > 0 and W < 0",
          "Q > 0 and W > 0"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "From first law: ΔU = Q − W > 0 ⇒ Q > W. From PV diagram: X→Y is expansion → W > 0. Thus Q > 0 and Q > W."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From PV diagram: Y→Z is constant volume → W = 0. Given Q > 0, first law gives ΔU = Q > 0."
