      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Bunsen burner works by passing high-speed gas through a small nozzle, which then 'pulls' surrounding air into the tube to mix with the gas. This is an application of:",
        "options": [
          "Archimedes' Principle",
          "Pascal's Principle",
          "The Bernoulli Effect",
          "The Continuity Equation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The fast-moving gas creates a low-pressure zone relative to the static atmosphere outside the intake holes, forcing air into the burner."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water flows from a main city pipe (large diameter) into a smaller pipe in a home. If the home pipe is at the same elevation as the city pipe, how do the velocity and pressure change as the water enters the home?",
        "options": [
          "Velocity increases, Pressure increases.",
          "Velocity increases, Pressure decreases.",
          "Velocity decreases, Pressure increases.",
          "Velocity decreases, Pressure decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Decreasing the area increases velocity (Continuity). Increasing the velocity at a constant height must decrease the pressure (Bernoulli)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Prairie dogs build mounds with one entrance higher than the other. Wind blows faster over the higher mound. How does this help the prairie dog?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the temperature inside.",
          "It creates a pressure difference that forces fresh air through the burrow.",
          "It increases the humidity inside the burrow.",
          "It prevents predators from smelling the prairie dog."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The higher velocity over the taller mound creates lower pressure there. The pressure at the lower mound is higher, creating a natural 'vacuum cleaner' effect that circulates air through the tunnel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When you turn on a hot shower, the shower curtain often 'sucks' inward toward the water. Neglecting the temperature of the air, this happens because:",
        "options": [
          "The water molecules pull the curtain via surface tension.",
          "The moving water and air inside the shower have lower pressure than the static air outside.",
          "The curtain is attracted to the drain's magnetic field.",
          "Gravity pulls the curtain toward the water stream."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The velocity of the air/water mixture inside the stall is higher than the air outside, creating a low-pressure zone that allows atmospheric pressure to push the curtain inward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A patient has a partial blockage in an artery that reduces the cross-sectional area to $1/3$ of its original size. By what factor does the blood velocity increase?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{3}$",
          "$3$",
          "$9$",
          "It stays the same to keep the heart rate constant."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From the Continuity Equation ($A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$), velocity is inversely proportional to area. Reducing area to $1/3$ increases velocity by a factor of $3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A siphon is being used to empty an open tank. If a small hole is poked in the top of the siphon tube (the highest point), what happens?",
        "options": [
          "The water flows faster because of added air pressure.",
          "The water flow stops immediately.",
          "The water flow remains unchanged.",
          "The water flows backward into the tank."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The siphon relies on a continuous column of liquid and a pressure lower than atmospheric at the peak. Poking a hole allows atmospheric pressure in, 'breaking' the vacuum and causing the liquid to fall back into the reservoirs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When two high-speed trains pass each other in opposite directions, they tend to be pulled toward each other. This is because:",
        "options": [
          "The magnetic fields of the trains attract.",
          "The air between the trains is moving very fast, creating a low-pressure zone.",
          "The air between the trains is compressed, pushing them together.",
          "The trains' masses create a significant gravitational attraction."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The air trapped between the passing trains is highly turbulent and fast-moving compared to the air on the outer sides, resulting in lower pressure between them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A water cannon reduces its nozzle diameter to increase the range of the water. If the water exits the nozzle at $20\\text{ m/s}$, what is the maximum height it can reach if pointed straight up? (Use $g = 10\\text{ m/s}^2$)",
        "options": [
          "$10\\text{ m}$",
          "$20\\text{ m}$",
          "$40\\text{ m}$",
          "$200\\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using Bernoulli's simplified form (or kinematics): $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 = \\rho gh \\implies h = v^2 / 2g$. So, $400 / 20 = 20\\text{ m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the bulb of a perfume atomizer is squeezed, air rushes over the top of a vertical tube dipped in perfume. The perfume rises in the tube because:",
        "options": [
          "The bulb pushes the perfume up.",
          "The fast air creates a low pressure at the top of the tube.",
          "The perfume density decreases.",
          "Capillary action is increased by the wind."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is the standard Venturi/Bernoulli application: high velocity air → low pressure → liquid is pushed up by the higher pressure in the reservoir."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A horizontal pipe contains water flowing at $4\\text{ m/s}$ with a pressure of $100,000\\text{ Pa}$. If the pipe widens and the velocity drops to $2\\text{ m/s}$, what happens to the total mechanical energy per unit volume of the fluid?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It doubles."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Bernoulli's Principle is a statement of conservation of energy. In an ideal fluid, the total energy per unit volume ($P + \\rho gh + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$) remains constant along the streamline."
