      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The containers pictured above are each filled to a height $h$ with the same fluid of uniform density. Which of the following is true of the pressure, $p_i$, $p_{ii}$, $p_{iii}$, and $p_{iv}$, at the bottom of each respective container?",
        "image": "images/fludo3.png",
        "options": [
          "$p_{iii} > p_i > p_{ii} > p_{iv}$",
          "$p_i > p_{ii} > p_{iii} > p_{iv}$",
          "$p_i = p_{ii}$ ; $p_{iii} > p_{iv}$",
          "$p_i > p_{ii}$ ; $p_{iii} = p_{iv}$",
          "They are all the same."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Hydrostatic pressure at the bottom depends only on the fluid density $\\rho$, gravitational acceleration $g$, and vertical height $h$ from the surface to the bottom point. Since all containers have the same $\\rho$, $g$, and $h$, the pressure $p = \\rho g h$ (plus atmospheric pressure, which is the same for all) is identical in each container, regardless of shape."

        "question": "The continuity equation indicates that the speed of a fluid flowing through a pipe will change when the cross-sectional area of the pipe changes. Which of the following assumptions justify the use of the continuity equation? Select two answers.",
        "options": [
          "The fluid can be modeled as an ideal gas.",
          "The mass flow rate is constant.",
          "The fluid is incompressible.",
          "The fluid has uniform pressure everywhere."
        ],
        "answer": ["B", "C"],
        "explanation": "The continuity equation in the form $A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$ requires:\n1. **Mass flow rate is constant** (steady flow, no fluid accumulation in the pipe).\n2. **The fluid is incompressible** (constant density, so volume flow rate is also constant)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pump provides water to a hose at a constant rate. When the hose is at a height of 2 m above level ground, the stream of water hits the ground a distance of 6 m from the end of the hose, as shown in the figure. If the end of the hose is moved to 4 m above the ground, about how far will the stream travel before hitting the ground?",
        "image": "images/fludo4.png",
        "options": ["3 m", "6 m", "8.5 m", "12 m"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The water leaves horizontally with constant speed $v$ (constant flow rate, same hose). The time of flight is $t = \\sqrt{2y/g}$, and the horizontal range is $x = v t$. With $v$ constant, $x \\propto \\sqrt{y}$. Doubling $y$ from 2 m to 4 m increases the range by a factor of $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$. So $x_2 = 6 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 8.5 \\ \\text{m}$."

        "question": "A stone is accelerating downward through water. Which of the following describe a force that the water exerts on the stone? Select two answers.",
        "options": [
          "A buoyant force directed downward",
          "A buoyant force directed upward",
          "A frictional force directed downward",
          "A frictional force directed upward"
        ],
        "answer": ["B", "D"],
        "explanation": "The water exerts two forces on the stone: (1) A buoyant force, which is always upward (since the stone is denser than water), and (2) A frictional force (drag) that opposes the stone's motion. Since the stone is moving downward, the drag force is directed upward."

        "question": "Water flows with speed through a horizontal, cylindrical pipe. Which of the following changes in the geometry of the pipe will double the speed of the water in the pipe?",
        "options": [
          "Doubling the area of the pipe",
          "Doubling the radius of the pipe",
          "Halving the area of the pipe",
          "Halving the radius of the pipe"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From continuity, $Q = A v$ is constant. To double $v$, the area must be halved. Halving the area of the pipe (option C) achieves this. Doubling the radius multiplies area by 4, which reduces $v$ to 1/4 of original."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $M$ is at rest at the bottom of a container full of liquid. Let $W$ be the magnitude of the weight of the block, let $F_B$ be the magnitude of the buoyant force on the block, and let $N$ be the magnitude of the normal force exerted on the block by the bottom of the container. Which of the following is a correct expression of Newton's second law for the block?",
        "options": [
          "$Ma = N - F_B$",
          "$Ma = W - F_B$",
          "$Ma = W - N$",
          "$Ma = W - N - F_B$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "If we take downward as the positive direction, the forces in that direction are weight $W$ (positive) and upward forces $N$ and $F_B$ (both negative). Newton's second law gives: $W - N - F_B = Ma$. At rest, $a = 0$ yields $W = N + F_B$, but the general equation is option D."

        "question": "A pipe of radius $R_A$ carries water moving at a speed $v_A$ at point A. The pipe then narrows to a smaller radius $R_B$ and travels upward a distance $H$ to point B, where the water is moving at speed $v_B$. Which of the following is a correct expression for the pressure difference $P_A - P_B$ between points $A$ and $B$?",

          "$\\rho g H + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (v_B^2 - v_A^2)$",
          "$\\rho g H + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (v_B^2 + v_A^2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Apply Bernoulli's equation: $P_A + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_A^2 + \\rho g y_A = P_B + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_B^2 + \\rho g y_B$, with $y_B - y_A = H$. Rearranging gives $P_A - P_B = \\rho g H + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (v_B^2 - v_A^2)$."

        "options": [
          "Place a beaker on a mass balance and tare the balance. Place the pieces in the beaker and record the mass, then add just enough water to the beaker to cover the pieces and record the volume of added water.",
          "Place the pieces on a mass balance, one at a time and record the mass of each. Submerge the pieces one at a time in a graduated cylinder filled with a volume of water and record the volume change.",
          "Fill four beakers with fluids that have different densities. Place a different piece in each beaker and record whether it sinks or floats.",
          "Fill four beakers with fluids that have different densities. Place one of the pieces into each beaker and record whether it sinks or floats. Repeat with the remaining three pieces."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The most accurate method measures mass and volume directly for each piece. Option B uses a mass balance for mass and water displacement in a graduated cylinder for volume—both standard techniques yielding quantitative data to compute density precisely."

        "question": "The equation of continuity for an incompressible fluid, $A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$, is essentially an expression of the conservation of which of the following quantities?",
        "options": ["Energy", "Time", "Linear momentum", "Angular momentum", "Mass"],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The continuity equation $A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$ is derived from the principle of conservation of mass. For an incompressible fluid (constant density $\\rho$), conservation of mass simplifies to conservation of volume flow rate."

          "The gravitational potential energy of the water-Earth system increases.",
          "The gravitational potential energy of the water-Earth system decreases.",
          "Work is done because the water in the larger pipe has a higher pressure.",
          "Work is done because the water in the larger pipe has a lower pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From Bernoulli's principle, in a horizontal pipe, fluid in a wider section has higher pressure and lower speed. The pressure difference does work on the fluid, converting pressure potential energy into kinetic energy as it moves into the narrower section where speed is higher."
