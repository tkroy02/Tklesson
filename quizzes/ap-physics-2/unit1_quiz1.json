      {

        "question": "A 5 kg block of wood has a volume of $0.01 \\text{ m}^3$. What is its density?",
        "options": [
          "$50 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$500 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$0.05 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$200 \\text{ kg/m}^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\rho = m/V = 5 / 0.01 = 500 \\text{ kg/m}^3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person stands on one foot. If they then stand on two feet, how do the force and pressure exerted on the floor change?",
        "options": [
          "Force stays the same; Pressure stays the same.",
          "Force stays the same; Pressure doubles.",
          "Force stays the same; Pressure is halved.",
          "Force doubles; Pressure stays the same."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The force (weight) is constant. However, by standing on two feet, the contact area $A$ doubles. Since $P = F/A$, doubling the area halves the pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical containers are filled to the same height with water ($\\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$) and oil ($\\rho = 800 \\text{ kg/m}^3$). Which statement about the pressure at the bottom is true?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure is the same in both containers.",
          "The pressure is higher in the oil container.",
          "The pressure is higher in the water container.",
          "Pressure depends on the shape of the container, not the fluid type."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Hydrostatic pressure is $\\rho gh$. Since water has a higher density ($\\rho$) and the height ($h$) is the same, the water exerts more pressure at the bottom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A diver swims to a depth of 20 meters in a lake. What is the gauge pressure at this depth? (Use $g = 10 \\text{ m/s}^2$)",
        "options": [
          "$20,000 \\text{ Pa}$",
          "$200,000 \\text{ Pa}$",
          "$301,000 \\text{ Pa}$",
          "$2,000 \\text{ Pa}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gauge pressure is $\\rho gh$. $P_{\\text{gauge}} = (1000)(10)(20) = 200,000 \\text{ Pa}$. (Absolute pressure would include atmospheric pressure $P_0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes Pascal's Principle?",
        "options": [
          "Pressure in a fluid decreases as its velocity increases.",
          "Any change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the fluid.",
          "An object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.",
          "Total energy in a fluid remains constant along a streamline."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is the definition of Pascal's Principle, which is the operational basis for hydraulic lifts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hydraulic lift has two pistons. Piston 1 has an area of $0.01 \\text{ m}^2$ and Piston 2 has an area of $0.1 \\text{ m}^2$. If a $100 \\text{ N}$ force is applied to Piston 1, what is the output force on Piston 2?",
        "options": [
          "$10 \\text{ N}$",
          "$100 \\text{ N}$",
          "$1,000 \\text{ N}$",
          "$10,000 \\text{ N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$P_1 = P_2 \\implies F_1/A_1 = F_2/A_2$. So, $100 / 0.01 = F_2 / 0.1 \\implies 10,000 = F_2 / 0.1 \\implies F_2 = 1,000 \\text{ N}$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure. If the barometer is moved to a higher altitude, what happens to the height of the mercury column?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It fluctuates but returns to $760 \\text{ mm}$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At higher altitudes, there is less air above you, so $P_{\\text{atm}}$ decreases. Since $P_{\\text{atm}} = \\rho g h_{\\text{column}}$, a lower atmospheric pressure results in a shorter mercury column."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An oddly shaped container is filled with water. Points A, B, and C are all at the same horizontal depth from the surface, but the container is wider at Point B. How does the pressure compare?",
        "options": [
          "$P_B$ is the highest.",
          "$P_A < P_B < P_C$.",
          "$P_A = P_B = P_C$.",
          "Pressure is zero at Point A if it's under a narrow neck."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Hydrostatic pressure depends only on the depth ($h$) below the surface, not the shape or width of the container. This is often called the 'Hydrostatic Paradox.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Absolute pressure is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "Gauge pressure minus atmospheric pressure.",
          "Atmospheric pressure plus gauge pressure.",
          "Density times gravity.",
          "Force divided by mass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$P_{\\text{abs}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho g h$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are the dams of reservoirs usually built thicker at the bottom than at the top?",
        "options": [
          "To withstand the higher temperature at the bottom.",
          "Because water is denser at the bottom.",
          "Because the pressure exerted by the water increases with depth.",
          "To prevent the water from leaking through the soil."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $P = \\rho gh$, the pressure against the dam wall increases linearly as you go deeper. The dam must be thicker at the base to provide the necessary counter-force to this high pressure."
