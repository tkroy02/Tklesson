      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A large tank is filled with water. A small hole is poked at a depth $h$ below the surface, and water leaks out with speed $v$. If the hole is moved to a depth $2h$, what is the new speed of the leaking water?",
        "options": [
          "$v/2$",
          "$v \\sqrt{2}$",
          "$2v$",
          "$4v$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to Torricelli's Law ($v = \\sqrt{2gh}$), speed is proportional to the square root of the depth. Doubling $h$ increases $v$ by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Pitot tube is used to measure the speed of an airplane by measuring the pressure difference between 'stagnation pressure' (where air velocity is zero) and 'static pressure' (the ambient air). If the pressure difference $\\Delta P$ quadruples, the speed of the airplane has:",
        "options": [
          "Doubled.",
          "Quadrupled.",
          "Remained the same.",
          "Decreased by half."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From Bernoulli, $\\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$. Therefore, $v \\propto \\sqrt{\\Delta P}$. If $\\Delta P$ increases by 4, $v$ increases by $\\sqrt{4} = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A large tank is filled with water to height $h$, but the space above the water is filled with compressed air at pressure $P_{\\text{air}} > P_{\\text{atm}}$. How does the efflux speed from a hole at the bottom compare to an open tank?",
        "options": [
          "It is the same.",
          "It is slower.",
          "It is faster.",
          "It is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The 'driving force' is now the sum of the hydrostatic pressure ($\\rho gh$) and the extra air pressure. This adds more energy to the system, resulting in a higher exit velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a horizontal Venturi tube, the cross-sectional area at point 2 is half the area at point 1. Which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "$v_2 = 2v_1$ and $P_2 > P_1$",
          "$v_2 = 2v_1$ and $P_2 < P_1$",
          "$v_2 = 4v_1$ and $P_2 < P_1$",
          "$v_2 = v_1$ and $P_2 = P_1$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Continuity requires $v_2$ to be double $v_1$ ($A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$). Bernoulli requires that the region of higher velocity must have a lower pressure ($P_2 < P_1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A siphon is used to move water over a small hill. At the highest point of the siphon tube, the pressure of the water is:",
        "options": [
          "Greater than atmospheric pressure.",
          "Equal to atmospheric pressure.",
          "Less than atmospheric pressure.",
          "Zero (a vacuum)."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At the high point, the water has gained gravitational potential energy ($\\rho gh$). To conserve energy, either the kinetic energy or the pressure must decrease. Since the fluid is moving, the pressure must drop below $P_{\\text{atm}}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two tanks are identical, but Tank A has a hole $1 \\text{ m}$ below the surface, and Tank B has a hole $2 \\text{ m}$ below the surface. Both tanks are sitting on a table $1 \\text{ m}$ high. Which stream of water will hit the floor further away from the tank?",
        "options": [
          "Tank A",
          "Tank B",
          "Both hit at the same distance.",
          "Not enough information."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both streams fall from the same height ($1 \\text{ m}$), so they take the same time to hit the floor. However, Tank B has a higher efflux velocity because the hole is deeper ($v = \\sqrt{2gh}$), giving it a greater horizontal range ($x = v \\cdot t$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$ in the Bernoulli equation represents:",
        "options": [
          "Force per unit area.",
          "Kinetic energy per unit volume.",
          "Potential energy per unit mass.",
          "Total mechanical energy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Units are $(\\text{kg/m}^3)(\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2) = \\text{J/m}^3$. This is energy per volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firehose with a large diameter is connected to a small nozzle. As the water enters the nozzle, what happens to the energy components?",
        "options": [
          "Potential energy increases, Pressure decreases.",
          "Kinetic energy increases, Pressure decreases.",
          "Kinetic energy decreases, Pressure increases.",
          "Both Kinetic and Potential energy increase."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a horizontal hose, $h$ is constant. As the area decreases, $v$ increases (Kinetic Energy increases). To balance the equation, the pressure $P$ must decrease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two tanks are filled to the same height $h$. Tank 1 contains water ($\\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$) and Tank 2 contains oil ($\\rho = 800 \\text{ kg/m}^3$). How do the efflux speeds compare?",
        "options": [
          "Water exits faster.",
          "Oil exits faster.",
          "They exit at the same speed.",
          "It depends on the size of the hole."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In $v = \\sqrt{2gh}$, the density $\\rho$ cancels out. Just like objects of different masses fall at the same rate in a vacuum, different fluids exit a tank at the same speed regardless of density."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you hold a piece of paper and blow air across the top of it, the paper rises. This happens because:",
        "options": [
          "You are pushing the paper up with your breath.",
          "The air on top is moving faster, creating a lower pressure than the air underneath.",
          "The air on top is hotter.",
          "The humidity of your breath increases the buoyant force."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a classic Bernoulli demonstration. Fast-moving air on top = lower pressure. Higher static pressure underneath creates a net upward force."
