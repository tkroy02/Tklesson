    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heat engine operates between a hot reservoir at 600 K and a cold reservoir at 300 K. If the engine performs 500 J of work in one cycle, what is the minimum amount of heat that must have been extracted from the hot reservoir ($Q_H$)?",
        "options": [
          "500 J",
          "750 J",
          "1000 J",
          "1500 J"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Maximum efficiency is Carnot efficiency: $\\eta = 1 - T_L/T_H = 1 - 300/600 = 0.5$. Since $\\eta = W/Q_H$, we have $0.5 = 500/Q_H \\implies Q_H = 1000$ J."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following changes would increase the mean free path of molecules in a sealed, rigid container of an ideal gas?",
        "options": [
          "Increasing the temperature",
          "Increasing the pressure by adding more gas",
          "Decreasing the number of gas molecules",
          "Decreasing the volume of the container"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mean free path $\\lambda$ is inversely proportional to number density ($N/V$). In a rigid container, volume is constant, so decreasing the number of molecules ($N$) reduces the density and increases the distance between collisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves are plotted for the same sample of gas. Curve A has a lower, broader peak that is shifted to the right compared to Curve B. Which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "Curve A represents the gas at a higher temperature.",
          "Curve B represents the gas at a higher temperature.",
          "Curve A represents a gas with heavier molecules.",
          "The total area under Curve A is greater than the area under Curve B."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As temperature increases, the most probable speed shifts right and the distribution flattens/spreads out to maintain the same total area (number of molecules)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metal bridge has an initial length of 100 m. If the temperature increases by 20°C and the coefficient of linear expansion is $12 \\times 10^{-6}/^\\circ C$, what is the change in the length of the bridge?",
        "options": [
          "0.012 m",
          "0.024 m",
          "0.120 m",
          "0.240 m"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using $\\Delta L = \\alpha L_0 \\Delta T$: $\\Delta L = (12 \\times 10^{-6})(100)(20) = 0.024$ m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which of the following is true for any real, spontaneous process occurring in an isolated system?",
        "options": [
          "The entropy of the system must increase.",
          "The internal energy of the system must increase.",
          "The temperature of the system must remain constant.",
          "The process can be reversed without changing the surroundings."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Second Law states that for any spontaneous process in an isolated system, the total entropy must increase, moving the system toward a more disordered state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ideal gas is expanded isobarically. During this process, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "Heat is added to the system.",
          "No work is done by the gas.",
          "The internal energy of the gas decreases.",
          "The temperature of the gas stays constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an isobaric expansion, $V$ increases, so $T$ must increase ($PV=nRT$). Since $\\Delta U$ is positive and work $W$ is done by the gas, heat $Q$ must be added to the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Carnot cycle, which two types of processes alternate to form the closed loop on a pV diagram?",
        "options": [
          "Isobaric and isochoric",
          "Isothermal and adiabatic",
          "Isothermal and isochoric",
          "Isobaric and adiabatic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A Carnot cycle consists of two reversible isothermal processes (expansion and compression) and two reversible adiabatic processes."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the absolute temperature of an ideal gas is tripled, by what factor does the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules change?",
        "options": [
          "1.73 (sqrt of 3)",
          "3",
          "6",
          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The average kinetic energy $K_{avg}$ is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $T$ ($K_{avg} = 1.5 k_B T$). Tripling $T$ triples $K_{avg}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A gas undergoes a 'free expansion' into a vacuum. Which of the following stays constant during this irreversible process for an ideal gas?",
        "options": [
          "Pressure",
          "Entropy",
          "Internal Energy",
          "Density"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a free expansion, $Q=0$ and $W=0$. By the First Law, $\\Delta U = 0$, meaning internal energy (and temperature) remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A real refrigerator requires an input of work to move heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir. Which law of thermodynamics essentially states that this work is mandatory?",

          "First Law",
          "Second Law",
          "Third Law"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Second Law (Clausius statement) states that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the input of external work."
