      {

        "question": "A mole of ideal gas at STP is heated in an insulated constant volume container until the average velocity of its molecules doubled. Its pressure would therefore increase by what factor?",
        "options": [
          "0.5",
          "1",
          "2",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Insulated constant volume ⇒ ΔV = 0. From kinetic theory: $v_{rms} \\propto \\sqrt{T}$. Doubling $v_{rms}$ ⇒ T increases by factor 4. At constant V and n, P ∝ T ⇒ P increases by factor 4."

        "question": "A sample of gas was first compressed from $V_1$ to $V_2$ at a constant pressure of $P_1$. The sample was then cooled so that the pressure went from $P_1$ to $P_2$ while the volume remained constant at $V_2$. Finally the sample was allowed to expand from $V_2$ back to $V_1$ while the pressure increased from $P_2$ back to $P_1$ as shown in the diagram. Which of the following statements are correct? Select two answers.",

        ],
        "answers": ["A", "B"],
        "explanation": "For the cycle: (1) Compression at P₁: work on gas = area A+D. (2) Cooling at V₂: W = 0. (3) Expansion along diagonal: work by gas = area A+D. Net work = enclosed area A (counterclockwise) = work done on gas. By first law (ΔU=0 for cycle), net heat out = area A = energy lost by gas."

          "The rate of heat transfer is proportional to $A$.",

        "answers": ["A", "D"],
        "explanation": "Steady-state heat conduction rate: $\\frac{Q}{t} = k A \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{L}$, where $k$ is thermal conductivity. Thus, $\\frac{Q}{t} \\propto A$ and $\\frac{Q}{t} \\propto (T_1 - T_2)$, and inversely proportional to $L$."

          "D"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For expansion: Isothermal: $PV = \\text{constant}$, Adiabatic: $PV^\\gamma = \\text{constant}$ with $\\gamma > 1$. Since $\\gamma > 1$, the adiabatic curve is steeper than the isothermal curve when starting from the same point. The dark curve in option C falls below the isothermal curve as volume increases, correctly representing adiabatic expansion."

During this process 60 J of heat enters the system. Process 2→3 takes place at constant volume. During this process 40 J of heat leaves the system. Process 3→1 is adiabatic. $T_3$ is 275 K. What is the change in internal energy of the system during process 3→1?",

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For complete cycle: ΔU_total = 0. Process 1→2: isothermal ⇒ ΔU₁₂ = 0. Process 2→3: isochoric ⇒ ΔU₂₃ = Q₂₃ = -40 J. Thus, 0 + (-40) + ΔU₃₁ = 0 ⇒ ΔU₃₁ = +40 J. This matches T increasing from 275 K to 300 K (positive ΔU)."
