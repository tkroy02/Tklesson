        "question": "In a 15 L rigid, sealed container, there is 1 mole of an ideal gas. The container is initially at 25°C. If the gas is heated to 50°C, what is the new pressure in the container?",
        "options": [
          "1.768 atm",
          "1.431 atm",
          "1.631 atm",
          "2.451 atm",
          "1.122 atm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the container is rigid and sealed, volume (V) and moles (n) are constant. Using the Ideal Gas Law $PV = nRT$, we solve for P: $P = nRT/V$. First, convert temperatures to Kelvin: $T = 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K$. Then, $P = (1 \\text{ mol} \\times 0.08206 \\text{ L}\\cdot\\text{atm/mol}\\cdot\\text{K} \\times 323.15 \\text{ K}) / 15 \\text{ L} \\approx 1.768 \\text{ atm}$."

        "question": "A mole of ideal gas at STP is heated in an insulated constant volume container until the average velocity of its molecules doubled. Its pressure would therefore increase by what factor?",

          "0.5",
          "1",
          "2",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Insulated constant volume ⇒ ΔV = 0. From kinetic theory: $v_{rms} \\propto \\sqrt{T}$. Doubling $v_{rms}$ ⇒ T increases by factor 4. At constant V and n, P ∝ T ⇒ P increases by factor 4."

        "question": "A sample of gas was first compressed from $V_1$ to $V_2$ at a constant pressure of $P_1$. The sample was then cooled so that the pressure went from $P_1$ to $P_2$ while the volume remained constant at $V_2$. Finally the sample was allowed to expand from $V_2$ back to $V_1$ while the pressure increased from $P_2$ back to $P_1$ as shown in the diagram. Which of the following statements are correct?

        "answers": [
          "A",
          "B"
        ],
        "explanation": "For the cycle: (1) Compression at $P_1$: work on gas = area A+D. (2) Cooling at $V_2$: W = 0. (3) Expansion along diagonal: work by gas = area D. Net work = enclosed area A (counterclockwise) = work done on gas. By first law (ΔU=0 for cycle), net heat out = area A = energy lost by gas."

          "A",

        ],
        "explanation": "Steady-state heat conduction rate: $\\frac{Q}{t} = k A \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{L}$, where $k$ is thermal conductivity. Thus, $\\frac{Q}{t} \\propto A$ and $\\frac{Q}{t} \\propto (T_1 - T_2)$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For expansion: Isothermal: $PV = \\text{constant}$, Adiabatic: $PV^\\gamma = \\text{constant}$ with $\\gamma > 1$. Since $\\gamma > 1$, the adiabatic curve is steeper than the isothermal curve when starting from the same point."

During this process 60 J of heat enters the system. Process 2→3 takes place at constant volume. During this process 40 J of heat leaves the system. Process 3→1 is adiabatic. $T_3$ is 275 K.

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For complete cycle: ΔU_total = 0. Process 1→2: isothermal ⇒ ΔU₁₂ = 0. Process 2→3: isochoric ⇒ ΔU₂₃ = Q₂₃ = -40 J. Thus, 0 + (-40) + ΔU₃₁ = 0 ⇒ ΔU₃₁ = +40 J."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At thermal equilibrium, both gases share the same temperature. $v_{rms} = \\sqrt{3RT/M}$. Therefore, $v \\propto 1/\\sqrt{M}$. The ratio is $\\sqrt{32/4} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isothermal means $\\Delta T = 0$, so $\\Delta U = 0$ for an ideal gas. By the 1st Law ($\\Delta U = Q - W$), if $W = +150$ J (work done by gas), then $Q$ must be $+150$ J."
