      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A gas with a fixed number of molecules has 40 J of work done on it, and 25 J of heat are transferred from the gas to the surroundings. What happens to the internal energy of the gas?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by 65 J",
          "It increases by 15 J",
          "It decreases by 15 J",
          "It decreases by 65 J",
          "It does not change"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the First Law of Thermodynamics $\\Delta U = Q + W$ (where $W$ is work done ON the gas). Here, $W = +40$ J and $Q = -25$ J (heat leaving). $\\Delta U = -25 + 40 = +15$ J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balloon is filled with nitrogen at a temperature of 273 K to a pressure of 1 atm. If the temperature is increased to 546 K and the pressure is increased to 3 atm, by what factor does the density of the nitrogen increase?",
        "options": [
          "1.5",
          "2.0",
          "3.0",
          "6.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density $\\rho = PM/RT$. Therefore, $\\rho \\propto P/T$. The ratio of new density to old density is $(P_2/P_1) \\times (T_1/T_2) = (3/1) \\times (273/546) = 3 \\times 0.5 = 1.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "By what factor does the volume of an ideal gas change if its temperature increases by 50% and pressure quadruples?",
        "options": [
          "0.375",
          "0.75",
          "1.5",
          "6.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From $PV = nRT$, we have $V \\propto T/P$. If $T$ becomes $1.5T$ and $P$ becomes $4P$, the new volume $V' \\propto (1.5T)/(4P) = 0.375(T/P)$. The factor is 0.375."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ideal gas is held in a container with a moveable piston. If the gas expands at a constant temperature, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "The internal energy of the gas increases.",
          "The gas does positive work and absorbs heat.",
          "The gas does negative work and releases heat.",
          "The pressure of the gas increases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In an isothermal expansion, $\\Delta U = 0$. Since the gas expands, it does positive work ($W_{by} > 0$). To keep $\\Delta U = 0$, the gas must absorb an equal amount of heat ($Q = W_{by}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a process in which no heat is exchanged with the surroundings?",
        "options": [
          "Isothermal",
          "Isobaric",
          "Adiabatic",
          "Isochoric"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An adiabatic process is defined as one in which $Q = 0$. This usually happens when a system is well-insulated or the process occurs so quickly that heat has no time to flow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the volume of an ideal gas is doubled while the temperature is held constant, what happens to the root-mean-square (rms) speed of the gas molecules?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles.",
          "It quadruples.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It stays the same."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The rms speed $v_{rms} = \\sqrt{3RT/M}$ depends only on the temperature and the molar mass of the gas. If the temperature is constant, the rms speed does not change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sample of gas undergoes an isochoric process where its pressure triples. What happens to the absolute temperature of the gas?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases by a factor of 3.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It increases by a factor of 3.",
          "It increases by a factor of 9."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In an isochoric (constant volume) process, $P/T = \\text{constant}$ (Gay-Lussac's Law). If pressure triples, the absolute temperature must also triple."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a compression process, 100 J of work is done on a gas, and its internal energy increases by 150 J. How much heat was exchanged?",
        "options": [
          "50 J was absorbed.",
          "50 J was released.",
          "250 J was absorbed.",
          "250 J was released."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $\\Delta U = Q + W_{on}$: $150 = Q + 100 \\implies Q = +50$ J. A positive $Q$ means heat was absorbed by the gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cylinder with a piston contains an ideal gas. If the piston is pushed down rapidly (adiabatically), what happens to the temperature of the gas?",
        "options": [
          "It increases because work is done on the gas.",
          "It decreases because the gas is compressed.",
          "It stays the same because no heat is exchanged.",
          "It decreases because the pressure increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an adiabatic compression, $Q = 0$ and $W_{on}$ is positive. $\\Delta U = W_{on}$, so internal energy increases. For an ideal gas, an increase in $\\Delta U$ results in an increase in temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ideal gas is at temperature $T$. If the average kinetic energy of the molecules is doubled, what is the new temperature?",
        "options": [
          "0.5 T",
          "1.41 T",
          "2 T",
          "4 T"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The average kinetic energy $K_{avg}$ is directly proportional to the absolute temperature ($K_{avg} = 1.5 k_B T$). If $K_{avg}$ doubles, $T$ must double."
