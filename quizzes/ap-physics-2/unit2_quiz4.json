      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "One mole of an ideal gas has a temperature of 100°C. If this gas fills the 10.0 m³ volume of a closed container, what is the pressure of the gas?",
        "options": [
          "0.821 Pa",
          "3.06 Pa",
          "83.1 Pa",
          "310 Pa"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Using ideal gas law: \( P = \\frac{nRT}{V} \). \( n = 1 \) mol, \( T = 373.15 \) K, \( R = 8.314 \) J/(mol·K), \( V = 10.0 \) m³. \( P = \\frac{(1)(8.314)(373.15)}{10.0} \\approx 310.3 \) Pa."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ideal gas is enclosed in a container. The volume of the container is reduced to half the original volume at constant temperature. According to kinetic theory, what is the best explanation for the increase in pressure created by the gas?",
        "options": [
          "The average speed of the gas particles decreases, but they hit the container walls more frequently.",
          "The average speed of the gas particles is unchanged, but they hit the container walls more frequently.",
          "The average speed of the gas particles increases as does the frequency with which they hit the container walls.",
          "The average speed of the gas particles increases, overcoming the decreased frequency that they hit the container walls."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant temperature means average kinetic energy and rms speed are unchanged. Halving volume doubles the number density of molecules, so collision frequency with walls doubles, increasing pressure."

        "explanation": "Using \( PV = nRT \), with \( R = 0.082057 \) L·atm/mol·K. \( n = \\frac{PV}{RT} = \\frac{(2.5)(6.0)}{(0.082057)(373.15)} \\approx 0.49 \) moles."

          "The total quantity of heat, Q, associated with these processes is positive."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isobaric expansion: pressure constant, volume increases, temperature increases. Isochoric cooling: volume constant (now larger than original), pressure decreases with temperature. Final pressure < initial pressure. Other statements are not necessarily true."

With \( n = 2 \) mol, \( R = 8.314 \) J/mol·K, \( \\Delta T = 600 - 300 = 300 \) K, \( W = -2 \\times 8.314 \\times 300 \\approx -5000 \) J. Negative sign means gas does work on surroundings."
