      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "One mole of an ideal gas has a temperature of 100°C. If this gas fills the 10.0 m³ volume of a closed container, what is the pressure of the gas?",
        "options": [
          "0.821 Pa",
          "3.06 Pa",
          "83.1 Pa",
          "310 Pa"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Using the ideal gas law: $P = \\frac{nRT}{V}$. Given $n = 1$ mol, $T = 373.15$ K ($100°C + 273.15$), $R = 8.314$ J/(mol·K), and $V = 10.0$ m³. Calculation: $P = \\frac{(1)(8.314)(373.15)}{10.0} \\approx 310.2$ Pa."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ideal gas is enclosed in a container. The volume of the container is reduced to half the original volume at constant temperature. According to kinetic theory, what is the best explanation for the increase in pressure created by the gas?",
        "options": [
          "The average speed of the gas particles decreases, but they hit the container walls more frequently.",
          "The average speed of the gas particles is unchanged, but they hit the container walls more frequently.",
          "The average speed of the gas particles increases as does the frequency with which they hit the container walls.",
          "The average speed of the gas particles increases, overcoming the decreased frequency that they hit the container walls."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant temperature means average kinetic energy and rms speed ($v_{rms}$) remain unchanged. Halving the volume doubles the number density of molecules ($N/V$), meaning particles strike the walls more frequently, thus increasing pressure."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mole of a monatomic ideal gas has pressure P, volume V, and temperature T. Which of the following processes would result in the greatest amount of energy added to the gas from heat?",
        "options": [
          "A process doubling the temperature at constant pressure.",
          "An adiabatic expansion doubling the volume.",
          "A process doubling the pressure at constant volume.",
          "A process doubling the volume at constant temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a monatomic gas: $C_P = \\frac{5}{2}R$ and $C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$. (A) Constant Pressure: $Q = nC_P\\Delta T = \\frac{5}{2}RT$. (B) Adiabatic: $Q = 0$. (C) Constant Volume: $Q = nC_V\\Delta T = \\frac{3}{2}RT$. (D) Isothermal: $Q = W = RT \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693RT$. Option A yields the highest $Q$."

        "question": "An ideal gas in a closed container of volume 6.0 L is at a temperature of 100ºC. If the pressure of the gas is 2.5 atm, how many moles of gas are in the container?",

          "0.0048",
          "0.018",
          "0.49",
          "1.83"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using $PV = nRT$ with $R = 0.0821$ L·atm/(mol·K) and $T = 373$ K. $n = \\frac{PV}{RT} = \\frac{(2.5 \\text{ atm})(6.0 \\text{ L})}{(0.0821)(373 \\text{ K})} \\approx 0.49$ moles."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ideal gas undergoes an isobaric expansion followed by an isochoric cooling. Which of the following statements must be true after the completion of these processes?",
        "options": [
          "The final pressure is less than the original pressure.",
          "The final volume is less than the original volume.",
          "The final temperature is less than the original temperature.",
          "The total quantity of heat, Q, associated with these processes is positive."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1. Isobaric expansion: Pressure stays constant ($P_1$), Volume increases ($V_2 > V_1$), Temperature increases. 2. Isochoric cooling: Volume stays constant ($V_2$), Temperature decreases, and Pressure must decrease ($P_{final} < P_1$). Therefore, the final pressure is guaranteed to be lower than the initial pressure."

        "question": "Two moles of a monatomic ideal gas undergoes the process from A to B, shown in the diagram above by the solid line. Using the sign convention that work is positive when surroundings do work on the system, how much work is done in the process AB?",

          "–1200 J",
          "–5000 J"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Process AB is isobaric expansion. Work done **on** the gas is $W = -P\\Delta V$. Using $PV = nRT$, we can write $\\Delta (PV) = nR\\Delta T$. Thus, $W = -nR(T_B - T_A) = -(2)(8.314)(600 - 300) = -4988.4$ J, which rounds to $-5000$ J. The negative sign indicates the gas did work on the surroundings."
