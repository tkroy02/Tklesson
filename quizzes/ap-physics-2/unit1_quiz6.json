      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A horizontal pipe narrows from a radius of $2R$ to a radius of $R$. If the speed of the water in the wide section is $v$, what is the speed of the water in the narrow section?",
        "options": [
          "$v/4$",
          "$v/2$",
          "$2v$",
          "$4v$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Area is proportional to the square of the radius ($A = \\pi r^2$). Reducing the radius by half ($2R \\to R$) reduces the area by a factor of $4$. To satisfy $A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$, the velocity must increase by a factor of $4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water flows through a pipe with a constant volume flow rate of $0.5\\text{ m}^3\\text{/s}$. If the pipe splits into two identical smaller pipes, what is the volume flow rate in each of the smaller pipes?",
        "options": [
          "$0.25\\text{ m}^3\\text{/s}$",
          "$0.5\\text{ m}^3\\text{/s}$",
          "$1.0\\text{ m}^3\\text{/s}$",
          "It depends on the velocity of the water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conservation of mass dictates that the total flow rate entering a junction must equal the total flow rate leaving it ($Q_{\\text{in}} = \\sum Q_{\\text{out}}$). Since the pipes are identical, the $0.5\\text{ m}^3\\text{/s}$ splits equally into $0.25\\text{ m}^3\\text{/s}$ each."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The aorta (the main artery) branches into millions of tiny capillaries. Even though each capillary is much smaller than the aorta, the total cross-sectional area of all capillaries combined is much larger than the area of the aorta. How does the speed of blood in a single capillary compare to the speed of blood in the aorta?",
        "options": [
          "It is much faster in the capillary.",
          "It is much slower in the capillary.",
          "It is the same in both.",
          "It depends on the blood pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The continuity equation applies to the total area ($A_{\\text{total}}v_{\\text{total}} = \\text{constant}$). Since the total area of the capillaries is larger than the area of the aorta, the average velocity of the blood must be slower. This allows time for nutrient exchange."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A gardener attaches a nozzle to a hose. By decreasing the area of the opening, the water travels a further horizontal distance. This is primarily because:",
        "options": [
          "The pressure of the water increases at the exit.",
          "The volume flow rate increases.",
          "The velocity of the water increases.",
          "The density of the water increases."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "According to $A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$, reducing the exit area ($A_2$) increases the exit velocity ($v_2$). A higher initial horizontal velocity results in a greater projectile range."
      },
      {

          "$\\text{m/s}$",
          "$\\text{m}^2\\text{/s}$",
          "$\\text{m}^3\\text{/s}$",
          "$\\text{kg/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$Q = \\text{Area} \\times \\text{velocity} = (\\text{m}^2) \\times (\\text{m/s}) = \\text{m}^3\\text{/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A fluid moves through a pipe that widens so that the diameter triples. How does the new velocity $v_{\\text{new}}$ compare to the original velocity $v_{\\text{old}}$?",
        "options": [
          "$v_{\\text{new}} = 3v_{\\text{old}}$",
          "$v_{\\text{new}} = 9v_{\\text{old}}$",
          "$v_{\\text{new}} = v_{\\text{old}}/3$",
          "$v_{\\text{new}} = v_{\\text{old}}/9$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Tripling the diameter increases the cross-sectional area by a factor of $3^2 = 9$. To conserve flow, the velocity must decrease by a factor of $9$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Conservation of Momentum",
          "Conservation of Mass",
          "Newton's Third Law"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "It is derived from the fact that the mass of fluid $\\rho AV \\Delta t$ passing any point per unit time must be constant. For incompressible fluids, $\\rho$ is constant, so $Av$ must be constant."

        "options": [
          "$4\\text{ seconds}$",
          "$10\\text{ seconds}$",
          "$20\\text{ seconds}$",
          "$40\\text{ seconds}$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "First, find the flow rate $Q = Av = (0.1)(0.5) = 0.05\\text{ m}^3\\text{/s}$. The time required is $\\text{Volume} / Q = 2.0 / 0.05 = 40\\text{ seconds}$."

        "question": "A nurse pushes the plunger of a syringe with a velocity $v$. The ratio of the area of the plunger to the area of the needle tip is $50:1$. What is the velocity of the fluid leaving the needle?",

          "$v/50$",
          "$v$",
          "$50v$",
          "$2500v$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$A_{\\text{plunger}}v_{\\text{plunger}} = A_{\\text{needle}}v_{\\text{needle}}$. Since $A_{\\text{plunger}}$ is $50$ times $A_{\\text{needle}}$, the velocity $v_{\\text{needle}}$ must be $50$ times higher than $v_{\\text{plunger}}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water flows downward through a vertical pipe that tapers (gets thinner) as it goes down. Even without gravity, the water would speed up because of the tapering. With gravity added, what happens to the volume flow rate $Q$ as the water moves from the top to the bottom?",
        "options": [
          "$Q$ increases because of gravity.",
          "$Q$ decreases because of friction.",
          "$Q$ remains the same.",
          "$Q$ increases, then decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In steady-state flow, the volume flow rate $Q$ is constant everywhere in a single-path system, regardless of orientation or external forces like gravity. While the velocity might change due to gravity and area changes, $A \\times v$ stays constant to conserve mass."
