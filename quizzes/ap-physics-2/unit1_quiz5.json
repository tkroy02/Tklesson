        "question": "An object is floating at the surface of a liquid. Which of the following is a correct statement regarding the forces acting on the object?",
        "options": [
          "The buoyant force is greater than the object's weight.",
          "The buoyant force is equal to the object's weight.",
          "The buoyant force is less than the object's weight.",
          "The buoyant force is zero because the object is at the surface."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If an object is in equilibrium (floating), the net force must be zero. Therefore, the upward buoyant force must exactly balance the downward weight."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A boat moves from a freshwater river ($\\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$) into the saltwater ocean ($\\rho = 1025 \\text{ kg/m}^3$). What happens to the boat?",
        "options": [
          "It sinks deeper into the water.",
          "It rises slightly higher in the water.",
          "It stays at the exact same level.",
          "The buoyant force on the boat increases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In both cases, $F_B$ must equal the weight of the boat (which hasn't changed). Since $F_B = \\rho V_{\\text{sub}} g$, if the density ($\\rho$) increases, the volume submerged ($V_{\\text{sub}}$) must decrease to keep $F_B$ constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block floats in a tub of water on Earth. If the tub is taken to the Moon, where gravity is $1/6$ of Earth's, how will the block float?",
        "options": [
          "More of the block will be submerged.",
          "Less of the block will be submerged.",
          "The block will float at the same level as on Earth.",
          "The block will sink to the bottom."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The equilibrium condition is $\\rho_f V_{\\text{sub}} g = \\rho_o V_o g$. Gravity ($g$) is on both sides of the equation and cancels out. The fraction submerged depends only on the ratio of densities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cubic block of wood with side length $0.1 \\text{ m}$ has a density of $700 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. It is floating in water ($\\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$). How much of the block's vertical height is below the water level?",
        "options": [
          "$0.03 \\text{ m}$",
          "$0.05 \\text{ m}$",
          "$0.07 \\text{ m}$",
          "$0.10 \\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The fraction submerged is $\\rho_{\\text{obj}} / \\rho_{\\text{fluid}} = 700 / 1000 = 0.7$. Since it is a cube, $70\\%$ of its height will be submerged. $0.7 \\times 0.1 \\text{ m} = 0.07 \\text{ m}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metal sphere is hollow and has a total volume of $V$. If the sphere is placed in water and it floats with $80\\%$ of its volume submerged, what is the average density of the sphere?",
        "options": [
          "$1250 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$800 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$200 \\text{ kg/m}^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a floating object, $\\rho_{\\text{avg}} = (\\text{fraction submerged}) \\times \\rho_{\\text{fluid}}$. Here, $0.8 \\times 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3 = 800 \\text{ kg/m}^3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An iron anchor is resting on the bottom of a lake. Which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "$F_B > F_g$",
          "$F_B = F_g$",
          "$F_g > F_B$",
          "$F_B = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Iron is denser than water. The maximum buoyant force is not enough to balance its weight, which is why it sinks. The remaining force is supported by the normal force from the lake floor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object floats in Fluid A with $1/3$ of its volume submerged. When placed in Fluid B, it floats with $2/3$ of its volume submerged. Which fluid is denser?",
        "options": [
          "Fluid A is twice as dense as Fluid B.",
          "Fluid B is twice as dense as Fluid A.",
          "Both fluids have the same density.",
          "Fluid A is four times as dense as Fluid B."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $V_{\\text{sub}}$ is inversely proportional to $\\rho_{\\text{fluid}}$ (for a constant weight), a smaller submerged volume indicates a denser fluid. Fluid A needs only half the volume submerged compared to Fluid B, so it must be twice as dense."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two objects, X and Y, have the same volume but Object X is twice as massive as Object Y. If both are fully submerged and held in place, how do the buoyant forces compare?",
        "options": [
          "$F_{BX} = 2F_{BY}$",
          "$F_{BX} = F_{BY}$",
          "$F_{BY} = 2F_{BX}$",
          "Buoyant force depends on weight, so it cannot be determined."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Archimedes' Principle states $F_B = \\rho_{\\text{fluid}} V_{\\text{disp}} g$. Since the volumes are the same and both are fully submerged, they displace the same amount of fluid. The mass of the object does not affect the buoyant force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In AP Physics 2, we assume an object breaks the surface without resistance. If a needle is carefully placed on water and 'floats' despite being denser than water, what is the primary force acting upward?",
        "options": [
          "Buoyancy",
          "Surface Tension",
          "Magnetic Repulsion",
          "Air Pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $\\rho_{\\text{obj}} > \\rho_{\\text{fluid}}$, buoyancy alone cannot support the weight. The needle is supported by surface tension (intermolecular forces), which is usually neglected in standard buoyancy problems."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object floats at the interface of oil ($\\rho = 800 \\text{ kg/m}^3$) and water ($\\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3$). If $25\\%$ of the object is in the water and $75\\%$ is in the oil, what is the density of the object?",
        "options": [
          "$850 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$900 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$825 \\text{ kg/m}^3$",
          "$950 \\text{ kg/m}^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total buoyant force is the sum of the forces from both layers: $F_B = (\\rho_{\\text{oil}} V_{\\text{oil}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} V_{\\text{water}})g$. For equilibrium, $\\rho_{\\text{obj}} = (0.75 \\times 800) + (0.25 \\times 1000) = 600 + 250 = 850 \\text{ kg/m}^3$."
