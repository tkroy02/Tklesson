      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid block of material is cut into two unequal pieces. Piece A has twice the volume of Piece B. Which of the following statements correctly compares the densities ($\\rho$) of the two pieces?",
        "options": [
          "$\\rho_A = \\rho_B$",
          "$\\rho_A = 2\\rho_B$",
          "$\\rho_A = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_B$",
          "$\\rho_A = 4\\rho_B$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density is an intrinsic property of a uniform material. It is defined by the chemical composition and atomic structure, not the size or shape of the sample. Cutting a block into pieces doesn't change the material's density."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what depth $h$ below the surface of a lake is the absolute pressure exactly three times the atmospheric pressure $P_0$?",
        "options": [
          "$h = \\frac{2P_0}{\\rho g}$",
          "$h = \\frac{3P_0}{\\rho g}$",
          "$h = \\frac{P_0}{3\\rho g}$",
          "$h = \\frac{P_0}{\\rho g}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $P = P_0 + \\rho gh$. If $P = 3P_0$, then $3P_0 = P_0 + \\rho gh$. Subtracting $P_0$ gives $2P_0 = \\rho gh$. Solving for $h$ yields $h = \\frac{2P_0}{\\rho g}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Three containers with different shapes but equal base areas are filled with water to the same height $h$. Which statement correctly describes the downward force exerted by the water on the bottom of the containers?",
        "options": [
          "The force is the same for all three containers.",
          "The container with the most total volume has the greatest force.",
          "The container that tapers inward toward the top has the greatest force.",
          "The force depends on the total weight of the liquid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pressure at the base depends only on depth ($P = \\rho gh$). Since the area ($A$) and pressure are identical for all three, the force ($F = PA$) must also be identical. This demonstrates the hydrostatic paradox."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hydraulic system uses two pistons. Piston 1 has a radius $r$ and Piston 2 has a radius $3r$. If a force $F$ is applied to Piston 1, what is the resulting force on Piston 2?",
        "options": [
          "$9F$",
          "$3F$",
          "$F/3$",
          "$F/9$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pascal's Principle states $F_1/A_1 = F_2/A_2$. Area is proportional to the square of the radius ($A = \\pi r^2$). Since the radius is 3x larger, the area is 9x larger, meaning the force is multiplied by 9."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mercury barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure. If a small amount of air is accidentally trapped in the space above the mercury column, how will the reading be affected?",
        "options": [
          "The mercury height will be lower than the true atmospheric value.",
          "The mercury height will be higher than the true atmospheric value.",
          "The reading will remain the same.",
          "The mercury will overflow the tube."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a perfect barometer, there is a vacuum ($P=0$) above the mercury. Trapped air exerts a downward pressure on the column, meaning a shorter column is needed to balance the external $P_{\\text{atm}}$. The reading will be artificially low."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two different liquids, A and B, are poured into a U-tube. Liquid A has a density $\\rho_A$ and Liquid B has a density $\\rho_B = 2\\rho_A$. If Liquid A reaches a height $h$ above the interface, what is the height of Liquid B above the interface?",
        "options": [
          "$h/2$",
          "$2h$",
          "$h$",
          "$h/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For equilibrium at the interface, $\\rho_A g h_A = \\rho_B g h_B$. Substituting $2\\rho_A$ for $\\rho_B$ gives $\\rho_A h = 2\\rho_A h_B$, which simplifies to $h_B = h/2$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A swimmer at the bottom of a pool $4.0\\text{ m}$ deep experiences a gauge pressure $P$. If the swimmer moves to a pool $8.0\\text{ m}$ deep filled with a solution that is $10\\%$ denser than fresh water, what is the new gauge pressure?",
        "options": [
          "$2.2P$",
          "$2.0P$",
          "$1.1P$",
          "$4.4P$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gauge pressure is proportional to both density and depth ($P_g \\propto \\rho h$). The depth doubled (x2) and the density increased by $10\\%$ (x1.1). Total factor: $2 \\times 1.1 = 2.2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must an IV bag be hung at a height significantly above a patient's arm to deliver fluid to a vein?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure in the bag must exceed the blood pressure in the vein for fluid to flow.",
          "To ensure the fluid density remains constant.",
          "To prevent atmospheric pressure from entering the vein.",
          "To allow the fluid to reach terminal velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluids flow from high pressure to low pressure. By elevating the bag, we increase the hydrostatic pressure ($\\rho gh$) at the needle until it is higher than the internal venous blood pressure. This creates the pressure gradient needed for flow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A closed tank contains a layer of air at a gauge pressure of $20,000\\text{ Pa}$ above a layer of water. What is the gauge pressure at a point $1.5\\text{ m}$ below the water surface? (Use $g=10\\text{ m/s}^2$)",
        "options": [
          "$35,000\\text{ Pa}$",
          "$15,000\\text{ Pa}$",
          "$5,000\\text{ Pa}$",
          "$20,000\\text{ Pa}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total gauge pressure = $P_{\\text{air}} + \\rho gh$. $P_{\\text{total}} = 20,000 + (1000 \\times 10 \\times 1.5) = 20,000 + 15,000 = 35,000\\text{ Pa}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a static fluid, why is the pressure at a given depth the same in all directions (up, down, and sideways)?",
        "options": [
          "If pressures were different, the fluid would accelerate, violating the 'static' condition.",
          "Gravity only acts downward, so pressure only acts downward.",
          "Density is the same in all directions.",
          "Molecules only move horizontally in a liquid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If there were a pressure difference across a small volume of fluid, there would be a net force, causing the fluid to move. In a static fluid, all forces must cancel out, requiring pressure to be isotropic (same in all directions)."

You understand intrinsic vs. extensive properties, can calculate absolute and gauge pressures in various scenarios, apply Pascal's Principle and hydrostatic paradox, analyze U-tube equilibria, and explain real-world applications like IV bags and barometers.",
