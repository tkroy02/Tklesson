      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hydraulic system consists of two connected cylinders filled with an incompressible fluid. Piston A has an area of $0.05\\text{ m}^2$ and Piston B has an area of $0.50\\text{ m}^2$. If a pressure of $2000\\text{ Pa}$ is applied to Piston A, what is the change in pressure at Piston B?",
        "options": [
          "$2000\\text{ Pa}$",
          "$200\\text{ Pa}$",
          "$20,000\\text{ Pa}$",
          "$0\\text{ Pa}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Pascal's Principle, any change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid. The pressure does not change based on the area; only the resulting force does. The pressure increase at Piston B is identical to the pressure applied at Piston A."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a hydraulic car lift, the input piston has a radius $r$ and the output piston has a radius $4r$. If an input force $F$ is applied to the small piston, what is the maximum weight the output piston can support?",
        "options": [
          "$16F$",
          "$4F$",
          "$64F$",
          "$F/16$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pressure is $F/A$. Since $A = \\pi r^2$, the area of the output piston is $16$ times larger than the input piston ($4^2 = 16$). To keep pressure equal ($\\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \\frac{F_2}{A_2}$), the output force must be $16$ times larger than the input force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A technician uses a hydraulic press. The input piston is moved down a distance $h_{\\text{in}}$. If the output piston has $5$ times the area of the input piston, how far does the output piston move ($h_{\\text{out}}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$h_{\\text{in}} / 5$",
          "$5h_{\\text{in}}$",
          "$h_{\\text{in}} / 25$",
          "$h_{\\text{in}}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Liquids are incompressible, so the volume of fluid pushed out of one cylinder must equal the volume pushed into the other ($A_{\\text{in}}h_{\\text{in}} = A_{\\text{out}}h_{\\text{out}}$). If the area is $5$ times larger, the distance moved must be $5$ times smaller."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the relationship between the work done on the input piston ($W_{\\text{in}}$) and the work done by the output piston ($W_{\\text{out}}$) in an ideal hydraulic lift?",
        "options": [
          "$W_{\\text{in}} = W_{\\text{out}}$",
          "$W_{\\text{in}} < W_{\\text{out}}$",
          "$W_{\\text{in}} > W_{\\text{out}}$",
          "$W_{\\text{out}} = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A hydraulic lift is a simple machine. While it multiplies force, it cannot multiply energy. In an ideal system (no friction), the work put into the system equals the work coming out. The force multiplication is balanced by a reduction in distance moved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hydraulic system is accidentally contaminated with air bubbles. How does this affect the system compared to a system with only liquid?",
        "options": [
          "It is less efficient because work is wasted compressing the air.",
          "It is more efficient because air is lighter.",
          "Efficiency is unchanged because pressure is transmitted in all directions.",
          "The force multiplication increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Liquids are nearly incompressible, but gases (air) are highly compressible. When you push the input piston, some of the displacement goes into shrinking the air bubbles rather than moving the output piston, making the system 'spongy' and less efficient."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A closed container is filled with water. A pressure gauge at the top reads $50,000 \\text{ Pa}$. If a piston at the top is pushed to increase the pressure by $15,000 \\text{ Pa}$, what is the new pressure at a point near the bottom that originally read $75,000 \\text{ Pa}$?",
        "options": [
          "$75,000 \\text{ Pa}$",
          "$90,000 \\text{ Pa}$",
          "$65,000 \\text{ Pa}$",
          "$125,000 \\text{ Pa}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pascal's Principle states that a change in pressure is transmitted undiminished. If the pressure at the top increases by $15,000 \\text{ Pa}$, the pressure at every other point in the fluid also increases by exactly $15,000 \\text{ Pa}$. Thus, $75,000 + 15,000 = 90,000 \\text{ Pa}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hydraulic press has an input cylinder with a diameter of $2 \\text{ cm}$ and an output cylinder with a diameter of $10 \\text{ cm}$. What is the mechanical advantage (the ratio of $F_{\\text{out}}/F_{\\text{in}}$) of this system?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "10",
          "25",
          "50"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Mechanical advantage is the ratio of the areas. Since Area $A = \\pi(d/2)^2$, the area is proportional to the square of the diameter. The diameter ratio is $10/2 = 5$. Therefore, the area ratio (and mechanical advantage) is $5^2 = 25$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a hydraulic system, Piston 1 (Area $A$) is pushed down $0.5 \\text{ m}$ to lift Piston 2 (Area $4A$). How much work is done by the system on Piston 2 if the input force $F$ is $100 \\text{ N}$?",
        "options": [
          "$50 \\text{ J}$",
          "$200 \\text{ J}$",
          "$400 \\text{ J}$",
          "$800 \\text{ J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an ideal system, Work In = Work Out. Work In = Force $\\times$ distance = $100 \\text{ N} \\times 0.5 \\text{ m} = 50 \\text{ J}$. Even though the force is multiplied by 4 at the output, the distance is divided by 4, keeping the total work at $50 \\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hydraulic lift is designed so that the output piston is $2 \\text{ meters}$ higher than the input piston. When the system is at rest, how does the pressure just under the output piston ($P_2$) compare to the pressure just under the input piston ($P_1$)?",
        "options": [
          "$P_2 = P_1$",
          "$P_2 = P_1 + \\rho g(2\\text{m})$",
          "$P_2 = P_1 - \\rho g(2\\text{m})$",
          "$P_2 = P_1/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While Pascal's Principle handles changes in pressure, hydrostatic pressure still applies. As you move up in a fluid, pressure decreases. Since Piston 2 is higher than Piston 1, the base pressure $P_1$ must be higher to support the extra column of fluid. The pressure difference is $\\rho gh$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a doctor checks a patient's blood pressure using a cuff on the upper arm, they are relying on the fact that the heart and the arm are at roughly the same vertical level. If the arm were held high above the head, the measured pressure would be:",
        "options": [
          "Higher, due to Pascal's Principle.",
          "Lower, because the pressure change is not transmitted through the blood.",
          "Lower, due to the hydrostatic pressure difference.",
          "The same, because blood is an enclosed fluid."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While the heart's pulse (change in pressure) is transmitted through the arteries (Pascal's Principle), the absolute pressure at any point also depends on its height relative to the heart (hydrostatic pressure). Moving the arm up increases $h$ in the $P = P_{\\text{heart}} - \\rho gh$ calculation, resulting in a lower reading."
