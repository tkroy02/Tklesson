    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Bernoulli's Equation is essentially a statement of which conservation law applied to fluids?",
        "options": [
          "Conservation of Mass",
          "Conservation of Momentum",
          "Conservation of Energy",
          "Conservation of Angular Momentum"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The equation sums pressure (work), potential energy, and kinetic energy, ensuring the total energy per unit volume remains constant along a streamline."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water flows through a horizontal pipe that narrows from Area $A$ to Area $A/2$. How does the pressure in the narrow section compare to the pressure in the wide section?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure is higher in the narrow section.",
          "The pressure is lower in the narrow section.",
          "The pressure is the same in both sections.",
          "The pressure is zero in the narrow section."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the Continuity Equation, the fluid must move faster in the narrow section. According to Bernoulli's Equation (at constant height), an increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A large tank is filled with water but the outlet valve at the bottom is closed. The pressure at the bottom is $P$. When the valve is opened and water begins to flow out, what happens to the pressure at a point just inside the pipe near the outlet?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains exactly $P$.",
          "It fluctuates but averages to $P$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the fluid is static ($v=0$), it has maximum pressure. Once it begins to move, some of that 'pressure energy' is converted into 'kinetic energy,' causing the internal pressure to drop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ideal fluid flows through a pipe of constant cross-sectional area that rises $10\\text{ m}$ vertically. How does the pressure at the top of the pipe compare to the pressure at the bottom?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure is higher at the top.",
          "The pressure is lower at the top.",
          "The pressure is the same because the area is constant.",
          "The pressure is higher at the top because of the velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since the area is constant, the velocity is constant ($v_1 = v_2$). Bernoulli's Equation simplifies to $P_1 + \\rho gh_1 = P_2 + \\rho gh_2$. As height $h$ increases, the pressure $P$ must decrease to keep the sum constant."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Smoke rises up a chimney. On a windy day, the wind blowing across the top of the chimney causes the smoke to rise faster. This is because:",
        "options": [
          "The wind pushes the smoke up.",
          "The fast-moving air at the top creates a region of low pressure.",
          "The wind increases the density of the air inside the chimney.",
          "The wind increases the temperature at the top."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fast-moving air across the top of the chimney has a lower pressure than the static air inside the house. This pressure difference ($P_{\\text{inside}} > P_{\\text{outside}}$) creates a 'suction' effect that pulls the smoke up."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a region where streamlines are closer together, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "The fluid is moving slower and the pressure is higher.",
          "The fluid is moving faster and the pressure is higher.",
          "The fluid is moving slower and the pressure is lower.",
          "The fluid is moving faster and the pressure is lower."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Streamlines crowded together indicate a smaller cross-sectional area, which means higher velocity (Continuity). Higher velocity in a fluid leads to lower pressure (Bernoulli)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Each term in the Bernoulli equation ($P$, $\\rho gh$, and $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$) has the units of:",
        "options": [
          "Force",
          "Energy",
          "Power",
          "Pressure (or Energy per unit Volume)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$P$ is in Pascals ($\\text{N/m}^2$). $\\rho gh$ is $(\\text{kg/m}^3)(\\text{m/s}^2)(\\text{m}) = \\text{N/m}^2$. $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$ is $(\\text{kg/m}^3)(\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2) = \\text{N/m}^2$. All are units of pressure, which is equivalent to $\\text{Joules/m}^3$."

        "question": "According to the Bernoulli principle, an airplane wing generates lift because:",
        "options": [
          "Air moves faster over the curved top, creating lower pressure.",
          "Air moves slower over the top, creating higher pressure.",
          "The wing pushes the air molecules up.",
          "Gravity is weaker at higher altitudes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The shape of the wing (airfoil) causes air to travel faster over the top surface than the bottom. This results in a lower pressure on top and a higher pressure on the bottom, creating a net upward force (lift)."

        "question": "A vertical water fountain shoots water straight up. At the very peak of its path, what has happened to the energy of the fluid?",
        "options": [
          "It is all pressure energy.",
          "It is all kinetic energy.",
          "It is all potential energy.",
          "The energy was destroyed by gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At the peak, $v=0$. The kinetic energy has been fully converted into gravitational potential energy ($\\rho gh$)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A large open tank has a small hole $h$ meters below the water surface. If the tank is open to the atmosphere at the top and the hole is also open to the atmosphere, what happens to the pressure terms ($P_1$ and $P_2$) in Bernoulli's equation?",
        "options": [
          "$P_1$ is much larger than $P_2$.",
          "Both $P_1$ and $P_2$ are equal to atmospheric pressure and cancel out.",
          "$P_2$ is zero because the water is moving.",
          "$P_1$ is zero because the water is static."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both the top surface and the exiting water are in contact with the atmosphere. Thus, $P_{\\text{surface}} = P_{\\text{exit}} = P_{\\text{atm}}$, allowing them to be subtracted from both sides of the equation."
