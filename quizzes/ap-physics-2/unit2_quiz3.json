      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two completely identical samples of the same ideal gas are in equal volume containers with the same pressure and temperature in containers labeled A and B. The gas in container A performs non-zero work W on the surroundings during an isobaric (constant pressure) process before the pressure is reduced isochorically (constant volume) to ½ its initial amount. The gas in container B has its pressure reduced isochorically (constant volume) to ½ its initial value and then the gas performs non-zero work W on the surroundings during an isobaric (constant pressure) process. After the processes are performed on the gases in containers A and B, which is at the higher temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The gas in container A",
          "The gas in container B",
          "The value of the work W is necessary to answer this question.",
          "The value of the work W is necessary, along with both the initial pressure and volume, in order to answer the question."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the first law and ideal gas law: Container A does work first, raising temperature, then cools isochorically to half the pressure (halving temperature from that higher point). Container B first cools isochorically to half the temperature, then does work, raising temperature from that lower starting point by ΔT = W/(nR). Calculations show T_B = T_0/2 + W/(nR), T_A = T_0/2 + W/(2nR), so T_B > T_A."

        "question": "The volume of an ideal gas changes as the gas undergoes an isobaric (constant pressure) process starting from temperature 273°C and ending at 546°C. What is the ratio of the new volume of the gas to the old volume (V_new/V_old)?",
        "options": [
          "1/2",
          "3/2",
          "2/3",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Isobaric process: V ∝ T (in Kelvin). T_old = 273°C = 546.15 K, T_new = 546°C = 819.15 K. Ratio = 819.15 / 546.15 ≈ 1.5 = 3/2."

        "options": [
          "Place the burger itself in a metal pan at room temperature.",
          "Place the burger itself on the ceramic kitchen counter at room temperature.",

          "Place the burger in its package in a pot of non-boiling warm water."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Warm water provides much faster heat transfer via convection and higher thermal conductivity than air, even through plastic packaging. Metal pan helps but air conduction is poor compared to direct water contact."

          "The molar mass of the gas is needed to answer this question."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average KE per molecule = (3/2)k_B T. T = 293.15 K, k_B = 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K → (3/2)×1.38×10⁻²³×293.15 ≈ 6.07×10⁻²¹ J. Molar mass is irrelevant for average translational KE."

          "447"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Use PV = N k_B T. N = PV/(k_B T) = (10⁵ × 12) / (1.38×10⁻²³ × 323.15) ≈ 2.69 × 10²⁶ molecules."

The temperature of the metal is now raised so that the side lengths are increased by 4%. What has happened to the area of the square piece cut out of the center of the metal?",

          "It is decreased by 8%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Linear expansion applies to all dimensions uniformly. If side length increases by 4%, area increases by factor (1.04)² = 1.0816 → 8.16% increase. The hole expands as if made of the same material because all points on the boundary move outward with thermal expansion."

        "question": "The PV diagram shows four different possible reversible processes performed on a monatomic ideal gas. Process A is isobaric (constant pressure). Process B is isothermal (constant temperature). Process C is adiabatic. Process D is isochoric (constant volume). For which processes does the temperature of the gas decrease? Select two answers:",

        ],
        "answers": ["C", "D"],
        "explanation": "Process C (adiabatic expansion): With Q = 0, expanding gas does work, decreasing internal energy and temperature. Process D (isochoric pressure drop): Constant volume means P ∝ T, so decreasing pressure indicates decreasing temperature. Process B is isothermal (T constant). Process A (isobaric) shown in typical diagram as expansion → T increases, not decreases."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Path a→b→d: a→b is isochoric (W=0) so ΔU_ab = Q_ab = 60 J. b→d is isobaric at 8 Pa: W_bd = PΔV = 8 × 3 = 24 J, ΔU_bd = Q_bd − W_bd = 20 − 24 = −4 J. Thus ΔU_ad = 60 − 4 = 56 J. For path a→c→d: a→c is isobaric at 3 Pa, W_ac = 3 × 3 = 9 J; c→d is isochoric, W_cd = 0. Using first law: ΔU_ad = Q_acd − W_acd ⇒ 56 = Q_acd − 9 ⇒ Q_acd = 65 J."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For isochoric process: W = 0 (A true). P ∝ T at constant V, so P decreases ⇒ T decreases ⇒ U decreases (B true). v_rms ∝ √T decreases (D true). From first law: ΔU = Q (since W=0), so Q = ΔU < 0 ⇒ heat leaves system, not zero (C false)."
