    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two completely identical samples of the same ideal gas are in equal volume containers with the same pressure and temperature in containers labeled A and B. The gas in container A performs non-zero work $W$ on the surroundings during an isobaric (constant pressure) process before the pressure is reduced isochorically (constant volume) to $\\frac{1}{2}$ its initial amount. The gas in container B has its pressure reduced isochorically (constant volume) to $\\frac{1}{2}$ its initial value and then the gas performs non-zero work $W$ on the surroundings during an isobaric (constant pressure) process. After the processes are performed on the gases in containers A and B, which is at the higher temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The gas in container A",
          "The gas in container B",
          "The value of the work $W$ is necessary to answer this question.",
          "The value of the work $W$ is necessary, along with both the initial pressure and volume, in order to answer the question."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Container B performs work at a lower constant pressure than Container A. Because $W = P\\Delta V$, a lower $P$ requires a larger $\\Delta V$ to achieve the same work $W$. A larger volume at the same final pressure results in a higher final temperature per $PV = nRT$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The volume of an ideal gas changes as the gas undergoes an isobaric (constant pressure) process starting from temperature $273^{\\circ}C$ and ending at $546^{\\circ}C$. What is the ratio of the new volume of the gas to the old volume ($V_{new}/V_{old}$)?",
        "options": [
          "1/2",
          "3/2",
          "2/3",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In an isobaric process, $V \\propto T$ where $T$ is in Kelvin. $T_{old} = 273 + 273.15 = 546.15\\text{ K}$, and $T_{new} = 546 + 273.15 = 819.15\\text{ K}$. The ratio $819.15 / 546.15$ is exactly $1.5$ or $3/2$."

          "Place the burger itself in a metal pan at room temperature.",
          "Place the burger itself on the ceramic kitchen counter at room temperature.",
          "Place the burger in its package on the kitchen counter at room temperature.",
          "Place the burger in its package in a pot of non-boiling warm water."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Liquids have significantly higher thermal conductivity and heat capacity than air. Submerging the burger in water allows for rapid heat transfer via conduction and convection, even through the plastic layer."

        "question": "A pure 4-mole sample of a newly discovered monatomic ideal gas is sitting in a container at equilibrium in a $20.0^{\\circ}C$ environment. According to the kinetic theory of gases, what is the average kinetic energy per molecule for this gas?",

          "The molar mass of the gas is needed to answer this question."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average $KE$ per molecule $= \\frac{3}{2}k_B T$. Using $T = 293.15\\text{ K}$ and $k_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}\\text{ J/K}$, the calculation yields $\\approx 6.07 \\times 10^{-21}\\text{ J}$."

          "447"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using $PV = Nk_B T$, solve for $N = PV / (k_B T)$. $N = (10^5 \\times 12) / (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 323.15) \\approx 2.69 \\times 10^{26}$ molecules."

          "the molecules of a substance have minimum kinetic energy."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Absolute zero ($0\\text{ K}$) is the lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, where the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value and molecular motion is at its quantum mechanical minimum."

The temperature of the metal is now raised so that the side lengths are increased by 4%. What has happened to the area of the square piece cut out of the center of the metal?",

          "It is decreased by 8%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thermal expansion acts like a photographic enlargement. If linear dimensions increase by a factor of $1.04$, the area increases by $1.04^2 = 1.0816$, which is an $8.16\\%$ increase."

        "question": "The PV diagram shows four different possible reversible processes performed on a monatomic ideal gas. Process A is isobaric (expansion). Process B is isothermal. Process C is adiabatic expansion. Process D is isochoric pressure drop. For which processes does the temperature of the gas decrease? Select two answers:",

          "Process D"
        ],
        "answers": ["C", "D"],
        "explanation": "In adiabatic expansion (C), work is done by the gas at the expense of internal energy, so $T$ drops. In isochoric pressure drop (D), $V$ is constant so $P \\propto T$; therefore, a drop in $P$ necessitates a drop in $T$."

          "47 J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The change in internal energy $\\Delta U_{ad}$ is $56\\text{ J}$ (from path $abd$). Along path $acd$, work done is $P\\Delta V = 3\\text{ Pa} \\times 3\\text{ m}^3 = 9\\text{ J}$. Using $Q = \\Delta U + W$, $Q = 56 + 9 = 65\\text{ J}$."

          "The rms speed of the gas molecules decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since the temperature decreases and no work is done, the First Law ($\\Delta U = Q - W$) implies $Q = \\Delta U$. Since $\\Delta U$ is negative, heat must have been removed from the system ($Q \\ne 0$)."
