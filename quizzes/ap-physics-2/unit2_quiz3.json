      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two completely identical samples of the same ideal gas are in equal volume containers with the same pressure and temperature in containers labeled A and B. The gas in container A performs non-zero work W on the surroundings during an isobaric (constant pressure) process before the pressure is reduced isochorically (constant volume) to ½ its initial amount. The gas in container B has its pressure reduced isochorically (constant volume) to ½ its initial value and then the gas performs non-zero work W on the surroundings during an isobaric (constant pressure) process. After the processes are performed on the gases in containers A and B, which is at the higher temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The gas in container A",
          "The gas in container B",
          "The value of the work W is necessary to answer this question.",
          "The value of the work W is necessary, along with both the initial pressure and volume, in order to answer the question."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the first law and ideal gas law: Container A does work first, raising temperature, then cools isochorically to half the pressure (halving temperature from that higher point). Container B first cools isochorically to half the temperature, then does work, raising temperature from that lower starting point by ΔT = W/(nR). Calculations show T_B = T_0/2 + W/(nR), T_A = T_0/2 + W/(2nR), so T_B > T_A."

        "question": "The volume of an ideal gas changes as the gas undergoes an isobaric (constant pressure) process starting from temperature 273°C and ending at 546°C. What is the ratio of the new volume of the gas to the old volume (V_new/V_old)?",
        "options": [
          "1/2",
          "3/2",
          "2/3",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Isobaric process: V ∝ T (in Kelvin). T_old = 273°C = 546.15 K, T_new = 546°C = 819.15 K. Ratio = 819.15 / 546.15 ≈ 1.5 = 3/2."

        "question": "A frozen hamburger in plastic needs to be thawed quickly. Which of the methods described provides the most rapid thawing of the burger?",
        "options": [
          "Place the burger itself in a metal pan at room temperature.",
          "Place the burger itself on the ceramic kitchen counter at room temperature.",
          "Place the burger in its package on the kitchen counter at room temperature.",
          "Place the burger in its package in a pot of non-boiling warm water."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Warm water provides much faster heat transfer via convection and higher thermal conductivity than air, even through plastic packaging. Metal pan helps but air conduction is poor compared to direct water contact."

          "2.02 × 10⁻²¹ J",
          "6.07 × 10⁻²¹ J",
          "The molar mass of the gas is needed to answer this question."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average KE per molecule = (3/2)k_B T. T = 293.15 K, k_B = 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K → (3/2)×1.38×10⁻²³×293.15 ≈ 6.07×10⁻²¹ J. Molar mass is irrelevant for average translational KE."

          "447"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Use PV = N k_B T. N = PV/(k_B T) = (10⁵ × 12) / (1.38×10⁻²³ × 323.15) ≈ 2.69 × 10²⁶ molecules."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, where molecular translational kinetic energy is at its minimum quantum ground state (not necessarily zero due to zero-point energy, but minimal)."
