      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A closed chamber filled with a gas that is modeled as ideal has a movable piston of area $A$. The graph above of pressure $P$ as a function of volume $V$ shows three processes that make up cycle $XYZX$ through which the gas is taken. Process $ZX$ is isothermal. What is the force exerted on the piston by the gas during process $XY$?",
        "image": "images/therm18.png",
        "options": [
          "A) $P_1V_1$",
          "B) $P_1V_1/2$",
          "C) $P_1A$",
          "D) $P_1A/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Process $XY$ is isobaric (horizontal line at pressure $P_1$). The force exerted by the gas on the piston is given by $F = P \\times A$. Since pressure is constant at $P_1$, the force is $P_1A$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During which process in the $XYZX$ cycle is no work done on or by the gas?",
        "image": "images/therm18.png",
        "options": [
          "A) $XY$",
          "B) $YZ$",
          "C) $ZX$",
          "D) Work was done on or by the gas during every process"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Process $YZ$ is isochoric (vertical line), meaning volume is constant. Work $W = \\int P \\, dV$ is zero when $\\Delta V = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During which process in the $XYZX$ cycle is the amount of work done on the gas equal to the amount of energy that the gas exchanges with its surroundings through heating or cooling?",
        "image": "images/therm18.png",
        "options": [
          "A) $XY$",
          "B) $YZ$",
          "C) $ZX$",
          "D) None of the processes; the amount of work done on the gas is always greater than the amount of energy that the gas exchanges with its surroundings through heating or cooling."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Process $ZX$ is isothermal. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature, so $\\Delta U = 0$. From the first law, $\\Delta U = Q - W_{on}$, we have $0 = Q - W_{on}$, so $Q = W_{on}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A container is filled with an ideal gas at a high gauge pressure and sealed with a cork of radius $R$ that has been inserted into a circular opening of radius $R$. The force exerted on the cork by the gas has magnitude $F$. If the radii of the opening and cork are increased to $2R$, what will be the magnitude of the new force exerted on the cork by the gas?",
        "options": [
          "A) $F/4$",
          "B) $F/2$",
          "C) $2F$",
          "D) $4F$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Force on the cork is given by $F = P \\times A$, where $A = \\pi R^2$ is the area of the cork. When the radius is doubled to $2R$, the area becomes $\\pi (2R)^2 = 4\\pi R^2 = 4A$. Since the pressure $P$ remains the same, the new force is $4F$."

        "90": "Excellent! You understand PV cycle analysis, work in different processes, isothermal heat-work equality, and how force depends on area for a fixed pressure.",
        "70": "Good grasp. Review: 1) Force = P×A in isobaric processes, 2) Work = ∫P dV, zero if ΔV=0, 3) ΔU=0 in isothermal ⇒ Q=W, 4) Force is proportional to area if pressure constant.",
        "50": "Needs review. Focus on: Work calculation from PV diagram, distinguishing isobaric/isochoric/isothermal processes, first law for ideal gas, and force-area-pressure relationships.",
        "0": "Start with basics: Force on piston or cork = pressure × area, work done = area under PV curve, isothermal means constant T, adiabatic means no heat exchange."
