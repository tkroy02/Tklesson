        "question": "A sample of gas is in a container of fixed volume. The pressure of the gas is measured as its absolute temperature is increased. A graph of pressure measurements as a function of temperature is shown. According to the ideal gas law, which of the following will be true if the container volume is reduced to half the original value and the experiment is repeated?",

        "options": [
          "A) The graph will still show a linear relationship that extrapolates to the origin, but with a smaller slope.",
          "B) The graph will still show a linear relationship that extrapolates to the origin, but with a larger slope.",
          "C) The graph will still show a linear relationship, but it will not extrapolate to the origin.",
          "D) The graph will not show a linear relationship, but it will still extrapolate to the origin."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Based on the Ideal Gas Law $P = (nR/V)T$, the slope of a P-T graph is $nR/V$. Since volume $V$ is in the denominator, reducing the volume to half ($1/2V$) doubles the slope. The relationship remains linear and still extrapolates to 0 K (the origin)."

        "question": "An ideal gas is initially in a state that corresponds to point 1 on the graph shown, where it has pressure $p_1$, volume $V_1$, and temperature $T_1$. The gas undergoes an isothermal process represented by the curve shown, which takes it to a final state 3 at temperature $T_3$. If $T_2$ and $T_4$ are the temperatures the gas would have at points 2 and 4, respectively, which of the following relationships is true?",
        "image": "images/therm16.png",
        "options": [
          "A) $T_1 < T_3$",
          "B) $T_1 < T_2$",
          "C) $T_1 < T_4$",
          "D) $T_1 = T_2$",
          "E) $T_1 = T_4$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the Ideal Gas Law $PV = nRT$, temperature is proportional to the product of pressure and volume ($T \\propto PV$). At point 2, the pressure is $p_1$ (same as point 1) but the volume is greater than $V_1$. Therefore, $P_2V_2 > P_1V_1$, which means $T_2 > T_1$. The process from 1 to 3 is isothermal, so $T_1 = T_3$. At point 4, the volume is $V_1$ but the pressure is lower than $p_1$, so $T_4 < T_1$."

        "question": "A group of students plans to take measurements on a gas to estimate the universal gas constant $R$ from a graph. They are provided with a chart of the molar mass $M$ for various gases. Which two of the following sets of instruments and procedures would allow them to collect the necessary data to find $R$ by plotting Pressure $P$ as a function of the quantity $(\\rho / M)$?",
        "options": [
          "A) Use a pressure gauge and thermometer to measure $P$ and $T$ while keeping the volume and mass constant.",
          "B) Use a balance and a graduated cylinder to measure mass and volume while keeping the temperature and pressure constant.",
          "C) Use a pressure gauge, a balance, and a graduated cylinder to measure $P$, mass, and volume while keeping temperature constant.",
          "D) Use a thermometer, a balance, and a graduated cylinder to measure $T$, mass, and volume while keeping pressure constant."
        ],
        "answer": ["A", "C"],
        "explanation": "The Ideal Gas Law can be expressed as $P = (RT) \\cdot (\\rho/M)$. To find $R$ from a graph of $P$ vs $(\\rho/M)$, you need to determine the slope, which is $RT$. In Option A: If volume and mass are constant, the term $(\\rho/M)$ is constant. By measuring $P$ and $T$, students can find $R$ because $R = PM / \\rho T$. In Option C: By keeping $T$ constant and varying the density (mass/volume), the slope of the $P$ vs $(\\rho/M)$ graph is the constant $RT$. Knowing $T$ allows the students to solve for $R$."

        "question": "A student collects two data points for a sample of a gas that can be treated as ideal and is in a rigid container: $T_1 = 300 K, P_1 = 3.0 kPa$ and $T_2 = 310 K, P_2 = 3.1 kPa$. Which of the following is the best conclusion about the pressure of an ideal gas at absolute zero (that is, $T = 0 K$) that can be made from this data?",
        "options": [
          "A) The pressure is 0 kPa.",
          "B) No conclusion can be made, because a pattern cannot be validated based on only two data points.",
          "C) No conclusion can be made, because the substance is no longer a gas near absolute zero.",
          "D) No conclusion can be made, because the volume of the gas is zero at absolute zero, and $PV = 0$ does not necessarily imply that pressure is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an ideal gas in a rigid container (constant volume), Gay-Lussac's Law states that pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature ($P \\propto T$). The data shows a constant ratio: $3.0/300 = 0.01$ and $3.1/310 = 0.01$. This linear relationship $P = 0.01T$ indicates that when $T = 0$, $P$ must be 0. While real gases liquefy, the problem specifies the gas 'can be treated as ideal,' requiring the application of the theoretical model over all temperatures."
