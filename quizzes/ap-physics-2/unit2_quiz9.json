        "question": "A sample of gas is in a container of fixed volume. The pressure of the gas is measured as its absolute temperature is increased. A graph of pressure measurements as a function of temperature is shown. According to the ideal gas law, which of the following will be true if the container volume is reduced to half the original value and the experiment is repeated?",

        "options": [
          "A) The graph will still show a linear relationship that extrapolates to the origin, but with a smaller slope.",
          "B) The graph will still show a linear relationship that extrapolates to the origin, but with a larger slope.",
          "C) The graph will still show a linear relationship, but it will not extrapolate to the origin.",
          "D) The graph will not show a linear relationship, but it will still extrapolate to the origin."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Based on the Ideal Gas Law $P = (nR/V)T$, the slope of a P-T graph is $nR/V$. Since volume $V$ is in the denominator, reducing the volume to half ($1/2V$) doubles the slope. The relationship remains linear and still extrapolates to $0 K$ (the origin)."

        "question": "A group of students plans to take measurements on a gas to estimate the universal gas constant $R$ from a graph. They are provided with a chart of the molar mass $M$ for various gases. Which two of the following sets of instruments and procedures would allow them to collect the necessary data to find $R$ by plotting Pressure $P$ as a function of the quantity $(\\rho / M)$?",
        "options": [
          "A) Use a pressure gauge and thermometer to measure $P$ and $T$ while keeping the volume and mass constant.",
          "B) Use a balance and a graduated cylinder to measure mass and volume while keeping the temperature and pressure constant.",
          "C) Use a pressure gauge, a balance, and a graduated cylinder to measure $P$, mass, and volume while keeping temperature constant.",
          "D) Use a thermometer, a balance, and a graduated cylinder to measure $T$, mass, and volume while keeping pressure constant."
        ],
        "answer": ["A", "C"],
        "explanation": "The Ideal Gas Law can be expressed as $P = (RT) \\cdot (\\rho/M)$. To find $R$ from a graph of $P$ vs $(\\rho/M)$, you need to determine the slope, which is $RT$. In Option A: If volume and mass are constant, the term $(\\rho/M)$ is constant. By measuring $P$ and $T$, students can find $R$ because $R = PM / \\rho T$. In Option C: By keeping $T$ constant and varying the density (mass/volume), the slope of the $P$ vs $(\\rho/M)$ graph is the constant $RT$. Knowing $T$ allows the students to solve for $R$."
