      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the physical cause of the buoyant force acting on a submerged object?",
        "options": [
          "The molecular collisions of the fluid are stronger at the top of the object.",
          "The fluid pressure exerted on the bottom of the object is greater than the pressure on the top.",
          "The object's atoms repel the fluid's atoms.",
          "The force of gravity is weaker underwater."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because pressure increases with depth ($P = \\rho gh$), the upward force on the bottom surface ($F_{\\text{bottom}} = P_{\\text{bottom}}A$) is greater than the downward force on the top surface ($F_{\\text{top}} = P_{\\text{top}}A$). The difference is the buoyant force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $5 \\text{ kg}$ block of lead and a $5 \\text{ kg}$ block of aluminum are both completely submerged in a pool of water. Which block experiences a greater buoyant force? (Density of lead > Density of aluminum)",
        "options": [
          "The lead block.",
          "The aluminum block.",
          "Both experience the same buoyant force because they have the same mass.",
          "It depends on the depth of the blocks."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Buoyant force depends on the volume of fluid displaced. Since aluminum is less dense than lead, a $5 \\text{ kg}$ mass of aluminum occupies a much larger volume than $5 \\text{ kg}$ of lead. More volume means more displaced water and a higher $F_B$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An iceberg ($\\rho = 917 \\text{ kg/m}^3$) floats in ocean water ($\\rho = 1025 \\text{ kg/m}^3$). What percentage of the iceberg is visible above the surface?",
        "options": [
          "$91.7\\%$",
          "$89.5\\%$",
          "$10.5\\%$",
          "$8.3\\%$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The fraction submerged is $\\rho_{\\text{ice}} / \\rho_{\\text{water}} = 917 / 1025 \\approx 0.895$ (or $89.5\\%$). The question asks for the percentage above the surface: $100\\% - 89.5\\% = 10.5\\%$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object weighs $100 \\text{ N}$ in air. When it is fully submerged in water, its 'apparent weight' (the reading on a scale) is $80 \\text{ N}$. What is the buoyant force acting on the object?",
        "options": [
          "$180 \\text{ N}$",
          "$100 \\text{ N}$",
          "$80 \\text{ N}$",
          "$20 \\text{ N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Apparent weight is $W_{\\text{app}} = F_g - F_B$. Therefore, $F_B = F_g - W_{\\text{app}}$. $100 \\text{ N} - 80 \\text{ N} = 20 \\text{ N}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An astronaut takes a beaker of water and a floating cork to a planet where gravity is $2g$. How does the percentage of the cork submerged change?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "The cork will sink."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a floating object, $F_g = F_B$, which means $\\rho_{\\text{obj}} V_{\\text{obj}} g = \\rho_{\\text{fluid}} V_{\\text{disp}} g$. Since $g$ appears on both sides of the equation, it cancels out. The floating height depends only on the density ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A fully submerged anchor is lowered from a depth of $10 \\text{ m}$ to $50 \\text{ m}$. Assuming water is incompressible, how does the buoyant force change?",
        "options": [
          "It increases linearly with depth.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It decreases as the water becomes colder.",
          "It doubles."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$F_B = \\rho V g$. None of these variables ($\\rho$ of water, $V$ of the anchor, or $g$) change significantly with depth. While the pressure on the anchor increases, the difference in pressure between the top and bottom remains the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is placed in a fluid. It floats with exactly half of its volume submerged. What is the density of the object relative to the fluid?",
        "options": [
          "$\\rho_{\\text{obj}} = 2 \\rho_{\\text{fluid}}$",
          "$\\rho_{\\text{obj}} = \\rho_{\\text{fluid}}$",
          "$\\rho_{\\text{obj}} = 0.5 \\rho_{\\text{fluid}}$",
          "$\\rho_{\\text{obj}} = 0.25 \\rho_{\\text{fluid}}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The fraction submerged equals the ratio of densities. Since $V_{\\text{disp}}/V_{\\text{obj}} = 0.5$, then $\\rho_{\\text{obj}}/\\rho_{\\text{fluid}}$ must also be $0.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A helium balloon is tethered to the floor of a room. The buoyant force on the balloon is $F_B$ and the weight of the balloon is $W$. What is the tension $T$ in the string?",
        "options": [
          "$T = F_B + W$",
          "$T = F_B - W$",
          "$T = W - F_B$",
          "$T = F_B$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Draw a free-body diagram. The buoyant force points up, while the weight and the tension point down. For equilibrium: $F_B - W - T = 0$, so $T = F_B - W$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person is in a boat in a small pond and throws a heavy iron anchor overboard. The anchor sinks to the bottom. What happens to the water level of the pond?",
        "options": [
          "It rises.",
          "It falls.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It rises and then falls back to the same level."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the anchor is in the boat, it is 'floating,' so it displaces a volume of water equal to its weight. When it is thrown overboard and sinks, it only displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume. Since iron is denser than water, its weight-volume of water is much larger than its actual volume. Therefore, less water is displaced, and the level falls."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of wood with a specific gravity of $0.7$ is placed in a tank containing oil with a specific gravity of $0.8$. Will the wood float or sink?",
        "options": [
          "Sink, because $0.7$ is a large specific gravity.",
          "Sink, because oil is less dense than water.",
          "Float, because the density of the wood is less than the density of the oil.",
          "Float, but only if the wood is completely dry."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Specific gravity is a relative density. If $SG_{\\text{wood}} < SG_{\\text{oil}}$ ($0.7 < 0.8$), the wood is less dense than the fluid it is in and will float."
