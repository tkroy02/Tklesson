        "question": "What is the difference between free and bound ribosomes?",

          "Bound ribosomes are found only in prokaryotes, while free ribosomes are found only in eukaryotic cells",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While structurally identical, their location dictates the destination of the protein being produced (cytoplasm vs. endomembrane system/secretion)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the peptidyl transferase activity and where is it located?",

        "question": "How are ribosomes assembled in eukaryotic cells?",
        "options": [
          "rRNA is made in the nucleolus, paired with imported proteins, and subunits are exported separately",
          "They are fully assembled in the cytoplasm from various metabolic precursors found in the cytosol",
          "The small and large subunits self-assemble spontaneously on the surface of the mitochondria",
          "They are produced in the Golgi apparatus and transported to the rough ER via specialized vesicles"

        "options": [
          "rRNA is highly conserved across all life, suggesting it existed in the common ancestor of all cells",
          "The fact that ribosomes evolved independently in plants and animals proves life has multiple origins",
          "The differences in ribosomes between humans and bacteria show they share no evolutionary connection",
          "Ribosomal proteins are far more conserved than rRNA, indicating proteins were the first genetic material"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because ribosomes are essential to all life and highly conserved, rRNA sequences are used to trace the ancient history of all living things."
