    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Water Balance in Different Cell Types",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is osmosis?",
        "options": [
          "Net movement of water across selectively permeable membrane from low to high solute concentration",
          "The directional movement of solutes from high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium",
          "An active transport mechanism where water is pumped against its concentration gradient using ATP",
          "The random distribution of water molecules across a bilayer that does not require a membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Osmosis is a passive process where water moves to balance solute concentrations. It flows from a hypotonic solution (high water) to a hypertonic solution (low water)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is osmotic pressure?",
        "options": [
          "Pressure required to prevent osmotic water movement into a solution",
          "The physical pressure exerted by the cytoskeleton against the interior of the cell membrane",
          "The force that drives large, nonpolar solutes to move across the phospholipid bilayer",
          "A type of atmospheric pressure that only affects marine organisms at great depths"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Osmotic pressure ($\pi = iMRT$) is a measure of a solution's tendency to take in water. The higher the solute concentration, the higher the osmotic pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do animal cells maintain osmotic balance?",
        "options": [
          "Regulate internal solutes (ions, organic osmolytes) and use ion pumps to control water movement",
          "Utilize a rigid cellulose cell wall to physically restrict the expansion of the plasma membrane",
          "Allow water to enter and exit the cell freely without any physiological or enzymatic regulation",
          "They can only survive in perfectly isotonic environments and perish in any other condition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Animal cells use the $Na^+/K^+$ ATPase pump and organic osmolytes like taurine to adjust their internal osmolarity, preventing them from shrinking or bursting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of the contractile vacuole in freshwater protists?",
        "options": [
          "Pumps excess water out to prevent cell lysis in hypotonic environments",
          "Acts as a storage tank for water to ensure the protist does not dehydrate in the sun",
          "Actively pumps sodium and chloride ions into the cell to increase internal solute pressure",
          "It is a vestigial organelle that only functions in marine species to expel excess salt"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because freshwater is hypotonic to the cell, water constantly leaks in. The contractile vacuole collects this excess water and 'spits' it out to prevent the cell from exploding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do plant cells differ from animal cells in their response to osmotic changes?",
        "options": [
          "Cell wall provides rigid support; vacuole stores/expels water; cells turgid in hypotonic, plasmolyzed in hypertonic",
          "Plant cells lack a protective barrier and burst instantly when placed in any hypotonic solution",
          "They respond identically to animal cells because both possess the same type of plasma membrane",
          "Plant cells only survive in isotonic conditions because they lack the ability to regulate turgor pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cell wall allows plant cells to become 'turgid' (pressurized) in hypotonic solutions, which provides structural support for the plant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are compatible solutes (organic osmolytes) and their function?",
        "options": [
          "Organic compounds that accumulate to balance osmotic pressure without disrupting metabolism",
          "Toxic metabolic byproducts that lead to cell death in hypertonic or high-salt conditions",
          "Inorganic metallic ions like sodium and potassium that are the only molecules used for balance",
          "Molecules that catalyze the breakdown of the lipid bilayer to allow water to escape faster"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Compatible solutes like proline or glycerol allow a cell to match the outside environment's osmotic pressure without damaging its own enzymes or proteins."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between regulatory volume decrease (RVD) and regulatory volume increase (RVI)?",
        "options": [
          "RVD: cell shrinks after swelling by losing ions/osmolytes; RVI: cell swells after shrinking by gaining ions/osmolytes",
          "RVD is a process where the cell gains water to grow, while RVI is a process of rapid cell division",
          "RVD only occurs in prokaryotes, whereas RVI is a specialized function of eukaryotic nerve cells",
          "Both terms refer to the random, unregulated fluctuations in cell size due to temperature changes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RVD and RVI are active physiological responses. In RVD, the cell exports ions so water follows them out, reducing the cell's volume back to normal after it has swelled."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do marine organisms handle osmotic challenges?",
        "options": [
          "Marine fish: drink seawater, excrete concentrated salt via gills/kidneys; Elasmobranchs: retain urea as osmolyte",
          "They maintain an internal environment identical to freshwater and avoid contact with salt",
          "They allow salt to build up in their tissues until they reach the same salinity as the ocean",
          "Marine organisms survive only by moving to estuaries where the water is significantly less salty"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Marine fish must deal with water loss; they drink seawater and use specialized chloride cells in their gills to pump out the salt. Sharks (elasmobranchs) use urea to stay 'salty' enough to match the sea."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between blood osmolarity and kidney function?",
        "options": [
          "Kidneys regulate blood osmolarity by adjusting water reabsorption and solute excretion",
          "The kidneys filter toxins but have no biological mechanism to detect or change blood osmolarity",
          "Blood osmolarity is a fixed constant that the kidneys cannot change regardless of hydration levels",
          "The kidneys only increase blood osmolarity to ensure the brain receives enough sodium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using hormones like ADH, the kidneys can either reabsorb water to dilute the blood or excrete more water to concentrate the blood, maintaining a steady osmotic state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What occurs during plasmolysis in a plant cell?",
        "options": [
          "Water leaves cell in hypertonic solution, plasma membrane pulls away from cell wall",
          "The cell wall expands and bursts because too much water has entered from a hypotonic source",
          "The cell membrane remains attached to the wall but the nucleus dissolves in the cytoplasm",
          "It is a permanent state of cell death that occurs whenever a plant is watered with distilled water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a hypertonic environment, the vacuole loses water and shrinks. The resulting loss of turgor pressure causes the membrane to detach from the wall, a state called plasmolysis."
