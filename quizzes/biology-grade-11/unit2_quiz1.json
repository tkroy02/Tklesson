    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fluid mosaic model of membrane structure?",
        "options": [
          "Membranes are fluid bilayers of phospholipids with embedded proteins that can move laterally",
          "The membrane consists of a rigid, fixed lattice of proteins that provides a permanent structural scaffold",
          "Membranes are composed exclusively of a triple-layered phospholipid sheet that excludes all protein molecules",
          "The structure is a solid protein shell with small lipid inclusions that prevent any internal molecular movement"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The model describes the membrane as a dynamic, two-dimensional liquid where lipids and proteins can diffuse laterally, resembling a mosaic of components."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factors most significantly affect the fluidity of a biological membrane?",
        "options": [
          "Temperature, fatty acid chain length, degree of saturation, and cholesterol content",
          "The total concentration of cytosolic glucose and the current rate of nuclear DNA replication",
          "The number of ribosomes attached to the rough ER and the pH of the extracellular fluid",
          "The presence of a cellulose cell wall and the total volume of the central vacuole"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluidity is determined by kinetic energy and the chemical structure of the lipids, which influences how closely they can pack together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do saturated and unsaturated fatty acids differ in their effect on membrane properties?",
        "options": [
          "Saturated: straight chains pack tightly, decrease fluidity; Unsaturated: kinks prevent tight packing, increase fluidity",
          "Saturated fatty acids increase fluidity by creating large gaps, while unsaturated fatty acids stabilize the core",
          "Both fatty acid types have identical effects on membrane fluidity and vary only in their length",
          "Saturated fatty acids are the only lipids capable of lateral movement within the hydrophobic core"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unsaturated fatty acids contain 'cis' double bonds that create kinks, preventing the molecules from packing into a solid-like state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of cholesterol in animal cell membranes?",
        "options": [
          "Modulates fluidity and stability: reduces fluidity at high temps, prevents solidification at low temps",
          "Provides a source of quick-release chemical energy for the cell during periods of intense metabolism",
          "Functions as the primary receptor for all water-soluble hormones that enter the cytoplasm",
          "Creates a rigid, impermeable shell that prevents any small molecules from diffusing across the bilayer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cholesterol acts as a fluidity buffer; it hinders phospholipid movement at warm temperatures but interferes with tight packing at cold temperatures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are membrane rafts and what is their proposed function?",
        "options": [
          "Dynamic microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids that organize signaling proteins",
          "Permanent protein structures that anchor the plasma membrane to the underlying cell wall",
          "Small defects in the bilayer that occur when phospholipids are damaged by free radicals",
          "Large reservoirs of triglycerides used for the synthesis of new membranes during cell division"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lipid rafts are specialized areas of the membrane that cluster specific proteins together to facilitate efficient cellular signaling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is membrane asymmetry and how is it maintained?",
        "options": [
          "Different lipid composition in inner vs. outer leaflets; maintained by flippases, floppases, and scramblases",
          "An identical lipid distribution on both sides of the bilayer that is maintained by simple diffusion",
          "The property where only proteins are asymmetrical while lipids remain perfectly balanced on both sides",
          "A result of the physical pressure difference between the cytoplasm and the extracellular environment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maintaining different lipid types on each side is an active, energy-requiring process essential for cell signaling and apoptosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do integral and peripheral membrane proteins differ?",
        "options": [
          "Integral: embedded in bilayer (transmembrane or monolayer); Peripheral: attached to surface via noncovalent interactions",
          "Integral proteins are found only in prokaryotes, while peripheral proteins are exclusive to eukaryotes",
          "Peripheral proteins span the entire membrane, while integral proteins are found only on the inner leaflet",
          "Integral proteins handle structural support, while peripheral proteins are the only ones used for transport"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Integral proteins have hydrophobic regions that lock them into the bilayer, whereas peripheral proteins are loosely associated with the membrane surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the functions of membrane carbohydrates (glycocalyx)?",
        "options": [
          "Cell recognition, adhesion, protection, and creating negative surface charge",
          "Primary structural components that provide the main mechanical rigidity of the membrane",
          "Long-term energy storage used to power the active transport of ions through protein channels",
          "Temporary structural markers that have no known functional significance in animal cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbohydrates on the cell surface serve as 'ID tags' for cell-to-cell recognition and protect the cell from chemical or mechanical stress."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does temperature adaptation affect membrane composition in organisms?",
        "options": [
          "Cold-adapted: more unsaturated fatty acids; Heat-adapted: more saturated fatty acids and cholesterol",
          "Cold-adapted: more saturated fatty acids; Heat-adapted: more unsaturated fatty acids",
          "All organisms maintain an identical membrane composition regardless of their environmental habitat",
          "Only the protein density changes in response to temperature, while lipid composition remains constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To maintain proper fluidity (homeoviscous adaptation), organisms in cold environments use 'kinked' lipids to prevent the membrane from becoming too brittle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the functional significance of membrane protein mobility?",
        "options": [
          "Allows dynamic assembly of signaling complexes, cell adhesion, and response to stimuli",
          "Ensures that the nucleus remains at the center of the cell by exerting pressure on the cytoplasm",
          "Allows the cell to change its genetic code rapidly in response to external temperature changes",
          "It is a physical side effect of the lipid bilayer that provides no functional benefit to the cell"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lateral mobility allows separate proteins to meet and interact, which is necessary for triggering signal transduction pathways and immune responses."
