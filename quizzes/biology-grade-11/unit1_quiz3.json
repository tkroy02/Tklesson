      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the endosymbiotic theory?",
        "options": [
          "Organelles like mitochondria began as free-living prokaryotes engulfed by host cells",
          "Organelles evolved through the slow invagination of the cell's plasma membrane",
          "Eukaryotic cells developed complex internal structures through random mutations",
          "Mitochondria were originally viral infections that became beneficial over time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Proposed by Lynn Margulis, this theory states that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent prokaryotes that established symbiotic relationships with host cells, eventually becoming organelles."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which set of evidence supports the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria?",
        "options": [
          "Double membranes, circular DNA, 70S ribosomes, and division by binary fission",

          "A lack of genetic material and a membrane structure identical to the rough ER",
          "Structural identity to the Golgi apparatus and a shared role in protein sorting"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Key evidence: 1) Double membrane (inner from original prokaryote, outer from host vesicle), 2) Circular DNA without histones, 3) 70S ribosomes (prokaryotic type), 4) Divide independently by binary fission."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, converting chemical energy from food into ATP via the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain/oxidative phosphorylation."
      },
      {

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cristae are extensive infoldings of the inner mitochondrial membrane, greatly increasing surface area for electron transport chain proteins and ATP synthase complexes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What components are found within the mitochondrial matrix?",
        "options": [
          "Circular DNA, 70S ribosomes, and enzymes for the citric acid cycle",
          "The majority of the cell's ATP synthase complexes and respiratory pumps",
          "Chlorophyll pigments and the complexes required for capturing light",
          "Acidic hydrolytic enzymes used for the breakdown of damaged organelles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The matrix contains the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), 70S ribosomes, enzymes for citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation, and metabolites needed for respiration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do mitochondria increase their number within a cell?",
        "options": [
          "They divide by binary fission, similar to prokaryotic cells",
          "They bud off from the surface of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum",
          "They are synthesized from scratch using various cellular components",
          "They can only replicate during the mitotic phase of the host cell"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitochondria divide by binary fission, similar to prokaryotes, and can increase in number based on cellular energy demands, not necessarily synchronized with cell division."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and how is it typically inherited?",
        "options": [
          "A circular molecule with 37 genes, inherited primarily from the mother",
          "A linear molecule identical to nuclear DNA, inherited from both parents",
          "Small DNA fragments that frequently integrate into the nuclear genome",
          "A temporary genetic template that degrades after the cell finishes dividing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Human mtDNA is circular, encodes 13 proteins, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs. It's maternally inherited because sperm mitochondria are usually degraded after fertilization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a major difference between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes?",
        "options": [
          "The outer membrane has porins; the inner membrane is highly selective",
          "Both membranes are functionally identical in their protein composition",
          "The inner membrane is porous while the outer membrane is highly selective",
          "Respiratory enzymes are only found located on the outer membrane surface"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The outer membrane contains porin proteins making it permeable to small molecules. The inner membrane is highly selective, folded into cristae, and contains proteins for electron transport and ATP synthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are mitochondria considered semi-autonomous organelles?",
        "options": [
          "They possess their own DNA but still rely on nuclear genes for most proteins",
          "They can survive and reproduce outside of the host cell indefinitely",
          "They are entirely independent and control all host cell genetic functions",
          "They lack any genetic material but can still replicate their own structures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitochondria have their own genome and can synthesize some proteins, but most mitochondrial proteins (approximately 99%) are encoded by nuclear DNA and imported from the cytoplasm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What evolutionary advantage did the endosymbiotic relationship provide?",
        "options": [
          "Host cells gained efficient energy; endosymbionts gained protection",
          "Host cells lost metabolic capabilities and became dependent on parasites",
          "The relationship benefited the endosymbiont while harming the host cell",
          "It offered no clear survival advantage and was a biological accident"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This mutualistic symbiosis allowed ancestral eukaryotes to become more efficient energy producers, enabling evolution of larger, more complex cells with greater energy demands."
