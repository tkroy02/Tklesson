        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Endocytosis is an active process where cells engulf extracellular material by deforming the plasma membrane inward, forming vesicles that transport cargo into the cytoplasm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the three primary modes of endocytosis?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The three modes are distinguished by their cargo and mechanism: 'cell eating' (phagocytosis), 'cell drinking' (pinocytosis), and specific targeted uptake (receptor-mediated)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is phagocytosis and which cell types specialize in this process?",

        "explanation": "Phagocytosis involves pseudopodia extension to engulf bacteria or debris. Professional phagocytes in the immune system use this to clear pathogens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does receptor-mediated endocytosis achieve high level of cargo specificity?",
        "options": [
          "Specific receptors bind ligands, cluster in clathrin-coated pits, and internalize selectively",
          "The cell membrane acts as a physical sieve, allowing only molecules of a specific size to enter",
          "It uses general electrical charge interactions to attract any positively charged protein",
          "Random membrane ruffling captures all nearby extracellular materials equally"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Specific receptors bind targeted ligands with high affinity, allowing the cell to concentrate rare molecules even from dilute extracellular fluid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the structural role of clathrin during the endocytic process?",
        "options": [
          "Forms polyhedral lattice that deforms membrane into coated pits and provides mechanical stability",
          "Acts as a motor protein that uses ATP to pull the vesicle along microtubules",
          "Directly catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to provide energy for simple diffusion",
          "Prevents any ions from entering the vesicle during the invagination process"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Clathrin triskelions assemble into a basket-like coat that drives the curvature of the membrane, helping to pinch off the nascent vesicle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the typical fate of endocytosed materials after the initial vesicle is formed?",
        "options": [
          "Vesicles fuse with early endosomes to be sorted to lysosomes, recycling, or transcytosis",
          "The materials are immediately released into the cytosol to be used for glycolysis",
          "Vesicles are always transported directly to the nucleus for genetic processing",
          "The cargo is stored permanently in the vesicle until the cell undergoes apoptosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The endosomal system acts as a sorting station where cargo is either sent for degradation in lysosomes or recycled back to the surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does macropinocytosis differ from traditional phagocytosis?",
        "options": [
          "Non-specific uptake of large fluid volumes via membrane ruffling; lacks particle-specific receptors",
          "Specific uptake of small molecules via coated pits triggered by glucose levels",
          "It is a much slower process that only occurs in specialized nerve cells",
          "It is a passive process that does not require any reorganization of the cytoskeleton"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Macropinocytosis involves actin-driven ruffles that non-selectively gulp large amounts of extracellular fluid, whereas phagocytosis is triggered by specific particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do cells maintain membrane surface area homeostasis despite constant endocytosis?",
        "options": [
          "Balanced with exocytosis; endocytosis removes membrane while exocytosis adds it",
          "The cell constantly synthesizes entirely new lipids from amino acids in the cytoplasm",
          "Endocytic vesicles are infinitely small, so they do not affect the total surface area",
          "The membrane expands through thermal energy to fill the gaps left by vesicles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cells maintain constant area through recycling; exocytosis returns the membrane patches that were internalized during endocytosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the significance of endocytosis in the context of cell signaling?",
        "options": [
          "Terminates signals by internalizing receptors or changes signaling location",
          "It acts to amplify signals by concentrating more receptors on the extracellular leaflet",
          "It converts electrical signals into chemical signals by releasing neurotransmitters",
          "It prevents any receptor from ever reaching the membrane surface"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By internalizing receptors (downregulation), the cell can stop responding to a signal, preventing overstimulation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do some pathogens exploit the endocytic pathway to enter cells?",
        "options": [
          "Mimic ligands or trigger membrane ruffling to be internalized",
          "Passively diffuse through the hydrophobic lipid tails without using proteins",
          "Break down the entire plasma membrane to enter the cytosol directly",
          "They only enter during cell division when the nuclear envelope is disrupted"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Many viruses and bacteria bind to surface receptors, 'tricking' the cell into engulfing them via its own endocytic machinery."
