    "topic": "Energy-independent Transport Mechanisms",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is passive transport?",
        "options": [
          "Movement of substances across membranes without cellular energy input, following concentration gradients",
          "The directional movement of solutes requiring ATP hydrolysis to overcome steep thermodynamic barriers",
          "The exclusive movement of water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane to balance solute concentrations",
          "The active pumping of metallic ions against their electrochemical gradients to maintain resting potential"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Passive transport relies on the inherent kinetic energy of molecules and electrochemical gradients, requiring no direct metabolic energy (ATP) from the cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is simple diffusion and what factors affect its rate?",
        "options": [
          "Direct movement through lipid bilayer; affected by concentration gradient, molecule size/lipid solubility, temperature, membrane thickness",
          "The facilitated movement of macromolecules through protein-mediated pores that recognize specific molecular shapes",
          "A process that occurs only for small metallic ions through specialized, permanently open aqueous pores",
          "A mechanism requiring carrier proteins to move nonpolar molecules down their gradient at a constant, fixed velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Small, nonpolar molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse directly through the bilayer. The rate is governed by Fick's Law, involving gradient steepness, temperature, and lipid solubility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do facilitated diffusion channels differ from carriers?",
        "options": [
          "Channels: form aqueous pores for rapid ion/small polar molecule passage; Carriers: bind specific molecules, undergo conformational change",
          "Channels: actively bind and release molecules using ATP; Carriers: provide simple, open corridors for any small molecule",
          "Both function identically and are simply different names for the same transmembrane protein architecture",
          "Channels are found only in the nuclear envelope while carriers are found only in the mitochondrial membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Channels allow high-speed passage of specific ions, while carriers are more selective and slower because they must change shape for every molecule transported."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is Fick's Law of Diffusion and what does it describe?",
        "options": [
          "$$J = -D A \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x}$$; describes diffusion flux proportional to concentration gradient and surface area",
          "A law describing the rate of active transport where energy consumption is proportional to the square of the distance",
          "A mathematical principle used to calculate the speed of water molecules during osmosis in animal cells only",
          "A description of how protein-mediated transport is limited by the number of available ATP molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fick's Law quantifies the rate of diffusion, showing that the flux ($J$) increases with surface area ($A$) and the steepness of the gradient ($\Delta C$), but decreases with membrane thickness ($\Delta x$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are aquaporins and why are they important?",
        "options": [
          "Specialized water channel proteins that facilitate rapid osmotic water movement",
          "General-purpose channels that allow all small polar molecules to pass through the bilayer indiscriminately",
          "Carrier proteins that use ATP to actively pump water against its osmotic gradient to prevent cell swelling",
          "Specialized pores found only in the root cells of desert plants to prevent water loss to the soil"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aquaporins are highly selective channels that allow water to move rapidly across membranes while blocking the passage of ions and other solutes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What determines the direction of passive transport for charged molecules?",
        "options": [
          "Electrochemical gradient: combined effect of concentration gradient and membrane potential",
          "The concentration gradient alone, as electrical charges have no impact on the movement of particles through lipids",
          "The membrane potential exclusively, as ions will always move toward the opposite charge regardless of concentration",
          "A random probability distribution where particles move in both directions with equal frequency at all times"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For ions, the driving force is the electrochemical gradient, which accounts for both the chemical concentration difference and the electrical charge difference across the membrane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between gated and ungated (leak) channels?",
        "options": [
          "Gated: open/close in response to signals; Ungated: always open for continuous diffusion",
          "Gated channels remain open at all times while ungated channels are only produced during cellular stress",
          "Both types are always open, but gated channels are significantly wider to allow larger molecules through",
          "Gated channels require ATP to open, whereas leak channels use thermal energy to push molecules through"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Leak channels allow for constant, slow diffusion (like K+ leak channels), while gated channels require a stimulus (voltage, ligand, or mechanical) to change shape and allow passage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does molecular size affect diffusion rate through membranes?",
        "options": [
          "Smaller molecules diffuse faster; large/polar molecules diffuse slowly or not at all without assistance",
          "Larger molecules diffuse faster because they possess greater momentum and can push through the lipid tails",
          "Molecular size has no measurable effect on diffusion rate as long as the molecule is nonpolar",
          "Only charged molecules are affected by size, while all neutral molecules move at the exact same speed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Small nonpolar molecules move easily through the gaps in the bilayer. As size increases, the physical and energetic barriers to crossing the hydrophobic core become much higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is saturation kinetics in facilitated diffusion and what causes it?",
        "options": [
          "Transport rate plateaus at high solute concentration due to limited number of carrier proteins",
          "The rate of movement increases linearly and indefinitely as the concentration of the solute rises",
          "A phenomenon where the lipid membrane becomes physically saturated with fat-soluble vitamins",
          "A process that occurs only in active transport when the cell runs out of available ATP molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion relies on a finite number of proteins. Once all protein binding sites are occupied, the rate cannot increase further (Vmax)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't ions diffuse directly through lipid bilayers despite their small size?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrated ions are large and charged; lipid bilayer hydrophobic interior repels charged species",
          "Ions are too large to fit between phospholipids even when they are completely dehydrated",
          "The lipid bilayer acts as an electrical insulator that actively destroys any charged particles that touch it",
          "They can diffuse directly but the process is so slow that it is not considered biologically relevant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ions are polar and surrounded by water (hydration shells). Crossing the hydrophobic fatty acid tails requires a massive amount of energy to strip away the water and move a charge through a nonpolar medium."
