          "Creatinine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Marine bony fishes excrete nitrogen mainly as ammonia directly through their gills into the surrounding water, as it is highly soluble and can be easily diluted."

          "Ureters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The lungs are considered secondary excretory organs because they excrete carbon dioxide and water vapor during respiration, although their primary function is gas exchange."
