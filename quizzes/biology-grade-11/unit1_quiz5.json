      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary structural role of microtubules?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Microtubules are hollow tubes made of tubulin dimers. They resist compression and serve as 'tracks' along which organelles and vesicles move."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do motor proteins like kinesin interact with the cytoskeleton?",
        "options": [
          "They walk along filaments to transport vesicles using ATP energy",
          "They act as enzymatic catalysts that break down tubulin into free-floating amino acids",
          "They bind to the plasma membrane to signal the cell to stop all internal transport",
          "They synthesize new strands of actin by linking carbohydrates to existing protein chains"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Motor proteins convert chemical energy from ATP into mechanical work, allowing them to 'walk' cargo along microtubules or microfilaments."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the function of a centrosome in animal cells?",
        "options": [
          "Acting as the primary microtubule organizing center (MTOC)",
          "Storing the high concentrations of calcium needed for rapid muscle fiber contraction",
          "Serving as the specialized region where ribosomal RNA is synthesized and assembled",
          "Regulating the breakdown of toxic substances and the synthesis of membrane lipids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In animal cells, microtubules grow out from a centrosome, which contains a pair of centrioles and helps organize the mitotic spindle."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which quality distinguishes intermediate filaments from microtubules and microfilaments?",
        "options": [
          "They are more stable and focus on maintaining mechanical strength",
          "They are the most dynamic filaments and grow rapidly at their specialized plus-ends",
          "They are hollow cylinders designed to resist heavy compression forces from the exterior",
          "They are the only cytoskeletal elements that do not require any proteins for assembly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intermediate filaments are less dynamic and more permanent than the other two types, providing a scaffold that helps the cell withstand mechanical stress."
      },

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the significance of 'dynamic instability' in microtubules?",
        "options": [
          "It allows the cell to rapidly remodel its structure by growing or shrinking filaments",
          "It causes the cell membrane to become more permeable to ions during the process of mitosis",
          "It prevents the cytoskeleton from becoming too rigid, which would lead to cellular apoptosis",
          "It is the mechanism by which individual tubulin proteins are converted into high-energy ATP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dynamic instability refers to the switching between phases of polymerization (growth) and depolymerization (shrinkage) at the ends of microtubules."
      },

          "It provides physical tracks that determine the direction of vesicle movement",
          "It creates a vacuum that sucks vesicles toward the trans-face of the Golgi apparatus",
          "It dissolves the surrounding cytoplasm to allow vesicles to diffuse at a much faster rate",
          "It wraps vesicles in a protective layer of keratin to prevent them from breaking open"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Microtubules function like railroad tracks, along which motor proteins carry vesicles to specific destinations in a highly organized manner."
