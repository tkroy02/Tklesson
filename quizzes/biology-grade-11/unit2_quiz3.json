    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Energy-dependent Transport Systems",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the defining characteristic of active transport?",
        "options": [
          "Movement of substances against their electrochemical gradient using cellular energy",
          "Random motion of particles that eventually leads to an equal distribution across the bilayer",
          "Passive movement of polar molecules through non-gated transmembrane protein channels",
          "The directional flow of water toward areas of higher solute concentration without ATP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Active transport requires energy (usually ATP) to pump substances from areas of lower concentration to higher concentration, creating and maintaining vital gradients."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two main types of active transport?",
        "options": [
          "Primary active transport (direct ATP use) and secondary active transport (coupled to ion gradients)",
          "Simple active transport and facilitated active transport which differ by the use of proteins",
          "Uniporters that move single ions and channels that move multiple ions simultaneously",
          "Cytoplasmic active transport and extracellular active transport based on location"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Primary transport directly hydrolyzes ATP, while secondary transport uses the energy stored in gradients established by primary pumps (like the Na+ gradient)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general mechanism of P-type ATPases such as the sodium-potassium pump?",
        "options": [
          "Phosphorylation of an aspartate residue causes conformational changes for ion transport",
          "The pump functions as an open pore that only closes when ATP is absent from the cytosol",
          "Energy is derived from the movement of protons rather than the hydrolysis of phosphate bonds",
          "ATP binds to the protein to change its electrical charge without changing its physical shape"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "P-type pumps are reversibly phosphorylated during the transport cycle; this phosphate transfer from ATP triggers the structural shifts needed to move ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does secondary active transport (cotransport) operate?",
        "options": [
          "Uses energy from an ion moving down its gradient to drive another substance against its gradient",
          "Directly hydrolyzes one ATP molecule for every two different substances transported",
          "Relies on the passive diffusion of lipids to push polar molecules through carrier proteins",
          "Only functions in plant cells to move sucrose into the central vacuole for storage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Secondary transporters couple the favorable 'downhill' movement of one solute (like Na+) to the 'uphill' movement of another (like glucose)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are ABC transporters and why are they medically significant?",
        "options": [
          "ATP-Binding Cassette transporters that export various molecules; involved in drug resistance",
          "Passive channels that facilitate the movement of bicarbonate ions to regulate blood pH",
          "Specialized proteins that only transport amino acids in simple prokaryotic organisms",
          "Secondary transporters that use proton gradients to move large proteins into the nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ABC transporters use ATP to pump toxins and drugs out of cells. In cancer, multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins are ABC transporters that pump out chemotherapy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of active transport in maintaining membrane potential?",
        "options": [
          "Creates ion gradients (Na+, K+, Ca2+) that generate electrical potential across membranes",
          "It serves to neutralize the charge on both sides of the membrane to prevent electrical shock",
          "Active transport destroys the membrane potential to allow for faster simple diffusion",
          "It has no significant impact on the electrical properties of the plasma membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrogenic pumps move unequal charges (like 3 Na+ out for 2 K+ in), creating a net charge separation that is fundamental for nerve and muscle activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What distinguishes V-type and F-type ATPases from P-type pumps?",
        "options": [
          "V/F-type: transport protons, don't form phosphorylated intermediate; P-type: form aspartyl-phosphate intermediate",
          "All three types utilize the same phosphorylated intermediate but transport different ions",
          "P-type pumps are the only ones that transport protons, while V/F-type transport metal ions",
          "V/F-type pumps are exclusively found in the plasma membrane of animal cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "V-type and F-type ATPases use a rotary 'motor' mechanism to move protons and do not involve the covalent phosphorylation of the protein itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do active transporters achieve specificity for their particular substrates?",
        "options": [
          "Specific binding sites with precise molecular complementarity, similar to enzymes",
          "They utilize a non-specific filter that only checks for the electrical charge of the ion",
          "Substrates are selected randomly based only on their molecular weight and size",
          "All active transporters are identical and can move any polar molecule provided ATP is present"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Transporters have unique binding pockets that recognize specific chemical shapes and groups, ensuring only the correct substrate is moved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the physiological importance of the calcium pump (Ca2+ ATPase)?",
        "options": [
          "Maintains very low cytoplasmic calcium levels to allow for precise intracellular signaling",
          "It is used exclusively by bone-building cells to deposit calcium into the extracellular matrix",
          "It pumps calcium into the cytoplasm to ensure the cell remains electrically positive",
          "It is a secondary transporter that requires a high concentration of sodium to function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By keeping cytoplasmic calcium extremely low, cells can use a sudden influx of calcium as a powerful signal for muscle contraction or neurotransmitter release."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is active transport essential for the absorption of nutrients in the intestines?",
        "options": [
          "Concentrates nutrients from the lumen into cells against gradients for efficient uptake",
          "It allows nutrients to flow passively into the blood regardless of their concentration",
          "Active transport is used to push nutrients back into the gut to prevent over-absorption",
          "Its primary role is the mechanical breakdown of large starch molecules into simple sugars"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Active transport allows the body to absorb nearly 100% of available glucose and amino acids, even when their concentration in the gut is lower than in the blood."
