    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Key Membrane Transport Protein",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary physiological function of the sodium-potassium pump (Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase)?",
        "options": [
          "Maintains Na⁺ and K⁺ gradients across plasma membrane (high K⁺ inside, high Na⁺ outside)",
          "Equalizes the concentrations of Na⁺ and K⁺ across the membrane to reach osmotic equilibrium",
          "Pumps both ions into the extracellular fluid to reduce the total solute concentration of the cytosol",
          "Acts as a passive leak channel that allows potassium to exit the cell down its concentration gradient"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase actively transports 3 Na⁺ out and 2 K⁺ in per ATP hydrolyzed, establishing and maintaining crucial concentration gradients essential for many cellular functions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the stoichiometry of the Na⁺/K⁺ pump and why is it considered electrogenic?",
        "options": [
          "3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in per ATP; creates net outward current contributing to membrane potential",
          "2 Na⁺ out, 3 K⁺ in per ATP; creates a net inward current that depolarizes the membrane",
          "1 Na⁺ out, 1 K⁺ in per ATP; creates an electrically neutral exchange of monovalent cations",
          "The ratio is variable and shifts based on the availability of ATP and the current internal pH"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 3:2 ratio means one net positive charge is moved out per cycle, making the pump electrogenic and contributing directly to the negative resting membrane potential inside cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the conformational cycle of the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase?",
        "options": [
          "E1 binds Na⁺, phosphorylates, changes to E2, releases Na⁺, binds K⁺, dephosphorylates, returns to E1",
          "The pump functions as a simple revolving door that binds both ions simultaneously without phosphorylation",
          "ATP binds to the exterior of the pump to pull potassium ions through a permanently open central pore",
          "The pump undergoes a single shape change that releases all five ions into the extracellular matrix at once"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This P-type ATPase cycle involves phosphorylation to drive the transition from E1 (high Na⁺ affinity) to E2 (high K⁺ affinity) states."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What percentage of basal metabolic rate does the Na⁺/K⁺ pump account for in typical animal cells?",
        "options": [
          "Approximately 20-40% (up to 70% in neurons)",
          "Less than 2% of total cellular energy expenditure",
          "Exactly 50% across all cell types regardless of function",
          "Negligible amounts as the pump relies primarily on thermal energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This pump is a major energy consumer because it constantly works against leak channels. Neurons use especially high percentages due to the high demand for maintaining resting potentials."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do cardiac glycosides like digitalis affect the Na⁺/K⁺ pump and heart contraction?",
        "options": [
          "Inhibits pump → increased intracellular Na⁺ → reduced Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange → increased cardiac Ca²⁺ → stronger contractions",
          "Activates the pump → rapid decrease of intracellular Na⁺ → hyperpolarization → reduced cardiac output",
          "Directly binds to the mitochondria to increase ATP production specifically for the use of the sodium pump",
          "Blocks the potassium leak channels, making the sodium-potassium pump functionally redundant for signaling"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By inhibiting the pump, digitalis causes Na⁺ to build up inside the cell. This slows the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger, leading to higher intracellular Ca²⁺, which enhances heart muscle contraction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does the Na⁺ gradient created by the pump play in secondary active transport?",
        "options": [
          "Drives symport of nutrients (glucose, amino acids) and antiport of ions (Ca²⁺, H⁺)",
          "The gradient is strictly used for electrical impulses and cannot provide energy for other molecules",
          "It prevents secondary transport from occurring by occupying all available membrane space",
          "It is only utilized to transport potassium back into the cell via facilitated diffusion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The potential energy stored in the steep Na⁺ gradient is used by other transporters to 'piggyback' molecules like glucose against their own concentration gradients."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Na⁺/K⁺ pump classified as a P-type ATPase?",
        "options": [
          "Forms a phosphorylated aspartate intermediate during the transport cycle",
          "It is the only pump that transports Phosphorus in addition to monovalent cations",
          "The 'P' stands for the Peripheral nature of the protein on the cytoplasmic leaflet",
          "It uses pyrophosphate (PPi) as its primary energy source instead of ATP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "P-type ATPases are characterized by the formation of a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate during the catalytic cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the pump contribute to osmotic balance and cell volume regulation?",
        "options": [
          "Pumps out more cations than it brings in, reducing intracellular solute content",
          "Pumps equal numbers of ions to maintain exact osmotic pressure without affecting volume",
          "Increases the concentration of intracellular solutes to encourage water entry via osmosis",
          "It has no role in osmosis, as water only responds to the concentration of large proteins"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because 3 Na⁺ ions leave for every 2 K⁺ ions that enter, there is a net export of solutes, which helps prevent the cell from swelling and bursting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the pump's significance in establishing the resting membrane potential?",
        "options": [
          "Direct electrogenic contribution and maintaining the K⁺ gradient for K⁺ leak channels",
          "It creates a positive charge inside the cell relative to the outside environment",
          "It allows the cell to reach 0 mV, which is necessary for the initiation of an action potential",
          "The pump only maintains the sodium gradient, while the potential is established by the nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pump creates the high internal K⁺ concentration. When K⁺ leaks out through 'leak channels', it leaves behind a negative charge, establishing the resting potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the Na⁺/K⁺ pump regulated in response to cellular needs?",
        "options": [
          "Short-term: phosphorylation/dephosphorylation; Long-term: gene expression changes in subunit isoforms",
          "The pump is unregulated and always operates at its maximum Vmax to ensure cellular safety",
          "Regulation is achieved only by changing the thickness of the phospholipid bilayer",
          "The pump is regulated by the concentration of nitrogen gas in the surrounding extracellular fluid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hormones like insulin can trigger immediate changes in pump activity, while long-term adaptation involves producing different versions (isoforms) of the pump subunits."
