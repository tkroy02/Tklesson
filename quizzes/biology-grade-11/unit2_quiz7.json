    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Cellular Export Processes",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is exocytosis?",
        "options": [
          "Export of materials from cell via vesicle fusion with plasma membrane",
          "Uptake of materials by invagination of plasma membrane",
          "Passive diffusion of molecules out of cells",
          "Active transport of ions through channels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exocytosis is the process by which cells export materials: vesicles from inside the cell fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their contents to the extracellular space or incorporating membrane components into the plasma membrane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two main types of exocytosis?",
        "options": [
          "Constitutive (continuous) and regulated (signal-triggered)",
          "Only constitutive exists as a single type",
          "Phagocytosis and pinocytosis",
          "Active and passive exocytosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constitutive exocytosis: continuous fusion of vesicles (e.g., membrane protein delivery). Regulated exocytosis: vesicles wait for specific signal (Ca²⁺, hormone) before fusing (e.g., neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What cellular structures are involved in vesicle docking and fusion during exocytosis?",
        "options": [
          "SNARE proteins (v-SNAREs on vesicles, t-SNAREs on target), Rab GTPases, and Sec1/Munc18 proteins",
          "Only clathrin coats without other proteins",
          "Actin filaments alone drive fusion",
          "Simple lipid mixing without protein machinery"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1) Rab GTPases direct vesicles to correct location. 2) v-SNARE (vesicle) and t-SNARE (target membrane) form coiled-coil complex pulling membranes together. 3) Sec1/Munc18 regulate SNARE assembly. 4) Complexin/synaptotagmin regulate fusion in neurons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does calcium trigger regulated exocytosis in neurons?",
        "options": [
          "Action potential opens voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels → Ca²⁺ influx → binds synaptotagmin → triggers vesicle fusion",
          "Calcium directly creates holes in vesicle membranes",
          "Only magnesium is involved in exocytosis, not calcium",
          "Calcium inhibits rather than triggers exocytosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At synaptic terminal: depolarization opens CaV channels, Ca²⁺ rises from ~0.1 μM to ~10-100 μM. Ca²⁺ binds synaptotagmin (vesicle Ca²⁺ sensor), which displaces complexin, allowing SNARE complex zippering and membrane fusion within milliseconds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of exocytosis in plasma membrane repair?",
        "options": [
          "Lysosomes or other vesicles fuse with damaged membrane patches to reseal breaches",
          "Exocytosis only damages membranes further",
          "Membranes self-repair without vesicle involvement",
          "Only endocytosis repairs membranes, not exocytosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Upon membrane damage (mechanical stress, pore-forming toxins), intracellular vesicles (often lysosomes) rapidly fuse at injury site, adding membrane patch. Requires Ca²⁺ influx through wound and SNARE proteins. Essential for cell survival."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do cells maintain membrane surface area balance during exocytosis?",
        "options": [
          "Compensatory endocytosis retrieves equivalent membrane to prevent unlimited expansion",
          "Cells constantly grow larger with each exocytosis event",
          "Exocytosis doesn't add membrane, only releases contents",
          "Membrane is synthesized anew for each vesicle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For every exocytic vesicle that adds membrane, compensatory endocytosis (often clathrin-mediated) removes similar area. In neurons, 'kiss-and-run' exocytosis briefly opens fusion pore then retrieves vesicle intact."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are secretory pathways and how do they relate to exocytosis?",
        "options": [
          "ER → Golgi → secretory vesicles → exocytosis; proteins are processed through endomembrane system for export",
          "Direct synthesis at plasma membrane without vesicles",
          "Mitochondria produce all secretory products",
          "Secretory pathways only exist in prokaryotes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Secretory proteins enter ER during translation (signal peptide), travel through Golgi for modification, are packaged into secretory vesicles (immature then mature), and await signals for exocytosis. Constitutive pathway bypasses storage vesicles in some cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is polarized exocytosis and why is it important in epithelial cells?",
        "options": [
          "Targeted vesicle fusion to specific membrane domains (apical vs. basolateral); maintains cellular asymmetry",
          "Random fusion anywhere on cell surface",
          "Only occurs in neurons, not epithelial cells",
          "Fusion at cell center rather than periphery"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Epithelial cells have distinct apical and basolateral domains with different protein/lipid compositions. Vesicles are targeted to correct domain via targeting signals and cytoskeletal tracks. Essential for gut nutrient absorption, kidney function, and glandular secretion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do secretory cells package different products into separate vesicles?",
        "options": [
          "Sorting signals direct proteins to distinct vesicle types; some cells have regulated and constitutive pathways operating simultaneously",
          "All products randomly mix in same vesicles",
          "Only one product can be secreted per cell type",
          "Products are secreted without packaging into vesicles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Example: Pancreatic acinar cells package digestive enzymes (regulated pathway, zymogen granules) separately from membrane proteins (constitutive pathway). Sorting signals (like aggregation at low pH) and different vesicle coats achieve separation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to secretory vesicles just before exocytosis?",
        "options": [
          "Dock at plasma membrane, undergo priming (partial SNARE assembly), then await trigger for full fusion",
          "Immediately fuse without any preparation",
          "Dissolve and release contents into cytoplasm first",
          "Only fuse during cell division"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vesicles tether via Rab effectors, dock via SNARE interactions, then prime (rearrangements making them fusion-competent). In neurons, primed vesicles form 'readily releasable pool'. Final Ca²⁺ trigger causes rapid fusion pore opening and expansion."
