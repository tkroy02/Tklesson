        "question": "All the following are true about dehydration, except ____________",
        "options": [
          "Low blood pressure",
          "Inadequate O₂ absorption",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When blood water content is high (low osmolarity), the brain produces less ADH, allowing more water to be excreted in urine to maintain fluid balance."
