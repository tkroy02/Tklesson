    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Solution Concentration Effects on Cells",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is tonicity?",
        "options": [
          "The effect of extracellular solution on cell volume due to osmotic water movement",
          "The electrical charge of solutions surrounding cells",
          "The toxicity of solutions to living cells",
          "The temperature of solutions affecting metabolism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tonicity describes how extracellular solute concentration affects cell volume through osmosis. It depends on both solute concentration and membrane permeability: only non-penetrating solutes (can't cross membrane) affect tonicity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between osmolarity and tonicity?",
        "options": [
          "Osmolarity: total solute particles/L; Tonicity: effective osmolarity considering membrane permeability",
          "They are identical terms",
          "Osmolarity measures only penetrating solutes",
          "Tonicity is always higher than osmolarity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Osmolarity counts all dissolved particles regardless of membrane permeability. Tonicity considers only non-penetrating solutes. Example: Urea solution may have high osmolarity but be hypotonic if urea crosses membrane freely."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to animal cells in hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic solutions?",
        "options": [
          "Hypotonic: swell/burst; Isotonic: no net change; Hypertonic: shrink/crenate",
          "Hypotonic: shrink; Isotonic: swell; Hypertonic: burst",
          "All solutions cause identical responses",
          "Animal cells are unaffected by solution concentration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hypotonic (lower non-penetrating solutes): water enters → swelling → may lyse (hemolysis in RBCs). Isotonic: no net water movement. Hypertonic (higher non-penetrating solutes): water exits → shrinkage (crenation in RBCs)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do plant cells respond differently to tonicity changes compared to animal cells?",
        "options": [
          "Cell wall prevents bursting; hypotonic: become turgid; hypertonic: plasmolyze",
          "Respond identically to animal cells (burst/shrink)",
          "Only respond to isotonic solutions",
          "Plant cells actively pump water regardless of tonicity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plant cell wall provides rigid support. Hypotonic: water enters → turgor pressure increases → turgid (normal state). Hypertonic: water leaves → plasma membrane pulls from wall → plasmolysis. Cell wall prevents lysis in hypotonic solutions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does urea act as a penetrating solute for many cells?",
        "options": [
          "Small, uncharged, lipid-soluble; crosses membranes via simple diffusion and some transporters",
          "Large and charged, cannot cross membranes",
          "Only penetrates plant cells, not animal cells",
          "Cells actively exclude urea always"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Urea (60 Da) is small, neutral, and has some lipid solubility. It crosses via: 1) Simple diffusion through lipid bilayer, 2) Facilitated diffusion via UT urea transporters in kidney/erythrocytes. Thus urea solutions can be hypotonic despite high osmolarity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is isosmotic vs. isotonic?",
        "options": [
          "Isosmotic: same total solute concentration; Isotonic: same effective concentration of non-penetrating solutes",
          "Identical terms meaning same thing",
          "Isosmotic: for plants; Isotonic: for animals",
          "Isosmotic measures charge; isotonic measures pH"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isosmotic solutions have equal total osmolarity. Isotonic solutions cause no net water movement. Example: 300 mOsm urea vs. 300 mOsm NaCl: isosmotic but not isotonic for RBCs (urea penetrates, NaCl doesn't)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do cells regulate volume in response to tonicity changes?",
        "options": [
          "Regulatory Volume Decrease (RVD): lose ions/osmolytes after swelling; RVI: gain ions after shrinking",
          "Passively accept all volume changes without regulation",
          "Only plant cells regulate volume, animals don't",
          "Volume regulation occurs only in isotonic conditions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RVD: After swelling in hypotonic solution, cells activate K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels/anion exchangers to lose solutes (and water follows). RVI: After shrinking in hypertonic solution, activate Na⁺/H⁺ exchangers, Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ cotransporters to gain solutes/water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What clinical significance does tonicity have in intravenous (IV) solutions?",
        "options": [
          "IV solutions must be isotonic to blood plasma to prevent hemolysis or crenation of red blood cells",
          "All IV solutions are hypertonic for faster effect",
          "Tonicity doesn't matter for medical applications",
          "Only hypotonic solutions are used medically"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) and 5% dextrose are isotonic with blood (~300 mOsm). Hypotonic IV can cause hemolysis; hypertonic can cause crenation and dehydration. Exceptions: some drugs given in hypo/hypertonic solutions with careful monitoring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of compatible solutes in osmoregulation?",
        "options": [
          "Organic osmolytes accumulated to balance osmotic pressure without disrupting function",
          "Toxic compounds that kill cells in wrong tonicity",
          "Only inorganic ions used for volume regulation",
          "Molecules that actively pump water out of cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Compatible solutes (glycine betaine, proline, trehalose, glycerol) are accumulated in hypertonic stress. They are non-perturbing: highly soluble, non-ionic or zwitterionic, don't interfere with macromolecules. Allow cells to match external osmolarity without using high [ions] that disrupt metabolism."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does tonicity affect stomatal function in plants?",
        "options": [
          "Guard cells change turgor via K⁺/solute fluxes to open/close stomata; affected by surrounding tonicity",
          "Stomata are insensitive to osmotic conditions",
          "Only light affects stomata, not tonicity",
          "Hypertonic solutions always open stomata wider"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Guard cells accumulate K⁺, malate⁻, sucrose to lower Ψₛ, water enters, cells become turgid → stomata open. Loss of solutes → water leaves → flaccid → stomata close. Environmental factors (humidity, soil water) affect this osmotic regulation."
