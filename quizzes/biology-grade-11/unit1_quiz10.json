      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental structural difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?",
        "options": [
          "Eukaryotes have membrane-bound organelles (nucleus, mitochondria, etc.); prokaryotes lack these",
          "Prokaryotes are consistently larger in volume to accommodate their high rate of binary fission",
          "Only eukaryotic cells possess a semi-permeable phospholipid bilayer to regulate molecular entry",
          "Prokaryotes maintain a much more complex internal organization through the use of specialized motor proteins"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The defining eukaryotic feature is compartmentalization via membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes have a nucleoid region without an enclosing membrane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do plant and animal cells differ at the organelle level?",
        "options": [
          "Plant cells: chloroplasts, cell wall, large central vacuole; Animal cells: centrioles, lysosomes (usually)",
          "Animal cells utilize chloroplasts for energy while plant cells rely exclusively on large mitochondria for survival",
          "Only plant cells contain a defined nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum for the processing of genetic information",
          "They are identical in all aspects of organelle composition and differ only in the external shape of the plasma membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plants are distinguished by their rigid cellulose cell walls, chloroplasts for photosynthesis, and a large central vacuole for turgor pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What evolutionary advantage did membrane compartmentalization provide to eukaryotic cells?",
        "options": [
          "Allowed incompatible processes to occur simultaneously, increasing efficiency through specialization",
          "Simplified the cellular structure to reduce the amount of genetic material required for replication",
          "Significantly reduced the total energy consumption of the cell by eliminating the need for active transport",
          "Prevented all forms of internal communication to protect organelles from viral infections and genetic mutations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Compartmentalization allows for specialized microenvironments (like the acidic lysosome) and more complex metabolic pathways that would be impossible in a single-room cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do fungal cells differ from plant cells?",
        "options": [
          "Fungal cells have chitin cell walls, lack chloroplasts, and may have multiple nuclei",
          "Fungal cells utilize cellulose-based walls and carry out photosynthesis using specialized fungal chloroplasts",
          "Fungal cells are structurally identical to animal cells in every aspect, including the lack of a cell wall",
          "Only fungal cells contain mitochondria, which are replaced by glyoxysomes in the majority of plant tissues"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fungi have cell walls made of chitin (not cellulose), are heterotrophic (no chloroplasts), and store energy as glycogen rather than starch."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What evidence supports the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts?",
        "options": [
          "Double membranes, own DNA/ribosomes, binary fission, and phylogenetic relationships with bacteria",
          "The presence of single membranes and a lack of independent DNA, which shows they evolved from the ER",
          "Their ability to divide via mitosis in perfect synchronization with the host cell's nuclear division cycle",
          "Chemical analyses showing they are produced entirely from proteins encoded by the cell's primary nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evidence includes their circular DNA, 70S ribosomes (like bacteria), and the double membrane which represents the original symbiont and the host's engulfing vesicle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do protist cells demonstrate the diversity of eukaryotic cell organization?",
        "options": [
          "Exhibit features of plants, animals, and fungi; some have mixotrophic nutrition and unique organelles",
          "Protists represent a static evolutionary phase where all species are structurally identical to primitive animal cells",
          "All protists are strictly photosynthetic and share the exact same organelle layout as multicellular land plants",
          "They possess no unique cellular features and are essentially smaller versions of common multicellular eukaryotes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Protists are incredibly diverse, with some acting as predators, others as producers (algae), and some possessing complex shells or multiple nuclei."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the significance of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA)?",
        "options": [
          "All extant eukaryotes descend from LECA, which already possessed a nucleus and mitochondria",
          "LECA represents the first cell that evolved a cell wall, which was later lost by the ancestors of all animal groups",
          "LECA was a simple prokaryote that developed a nucleus but lacked any other membrane-bound organelles or a cytoskeleton",
          "Current evidence suggests that plants and animals evolved from different LECA ancestors that appeared at different times"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Genomic evidence suggests LECA was already a complex cell with a cytoskeleton, endomembrane system, and the ability to undergo meiosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do bacterial and archaeal cells differ structurally?",
        "options": [
          "Archaeal membranes have ether-linked lipids; bacterial membranes have ester-linked fatty acids",
          "Bacteria and Archaea are structurally identical and are only separated into domains based on their geographic location",
          "Only Archaeal cells possess a rigid cell wall, while Bacterial cells rely on a thick protein pellicle for support",
          "Bacterial cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus, whereas Archaeal cells maintain their DNA in a circular plasmid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Archaea have unique membrane chemistry (ether linkages and branched isoprenoid chains) that often helps them survive in extreme environments."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What cellular adaptations are seen in extremophiles?",
        "options": [
          "Specialized proteins, membranes, and metabolic pathways adapted to extreme temperatures or salinity",
          "Extremophiles possess entirely different organelles that are not found in any other known organisms on Earth",
          "They lack structural adaptations and rely solely on high concentrations of water to dilute the effects of heat and salt",
          "Only prokaryotes can be extremophiles because eukaryotic cells are too complex to survive outside of neutral conditions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adaptations include heat-stable enzymes with more ionic bonds and membranes with specialized lipids that prevent leaking at high temperatures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does cell size relate to cell function across different organisms?",
        "options": [
          "Surface area to volume ratio constraints drive specialization; small cells favor rapid diffusion",
          "All biological cells are restricted to the same size range to ensure that the nucleus can control the entire cytoplasm",
          "Larger cells are inherently more efficient than smaller cells because they can store more mitochondria for energy production",
          "Cell size is a random trait determined by the availability of lipids and has no significant impact on cellular function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Smaller cells have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, making gas and nutrient exchange via diffusion highly efficient. Larger cells require internal transport systems."
