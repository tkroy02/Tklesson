        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When blood water content is high (low osmolarity), the brain produces less ADH, allowing more water to be excreted in urine to maintain fluid balance."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glucose appears in urine when blood glucose exceeds approximately 180 mg/dL, which is the renal threshold - the point where transporters can no longer reabsorb all the filtered glucose."
