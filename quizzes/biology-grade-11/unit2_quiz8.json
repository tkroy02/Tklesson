    "subtitle": "2.8 Membrane Potentials",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Electrical Properties of Membranes",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is membrane potential?",
        "options": [
          "Voltage difference across cell membrane (inside relative to outside)",
          "The energy stored in chemical gradients only",
          "The pressure difference across membranes",
          "Only present in neurons, not other cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Membrane potential (Vₘ) is the electrical potential difference between interior and exterior of a cell, typically -20 to -90 mV (negative inside). Results from unequal distribution of ions and selective membrane permeability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What primarily determines the resting membrane potential in animal cells?",
        "options": [
          "Potassium diffusion through leak channels, with contribution from Na⁺/K⁺ pump",
          "Only sodium gradient determines resting potential",
          "Calcium channels maintain resting potential",
          "Chloride is the main determinant in all cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resting potential (~-70 mV) is close to K⁺ equilibrium potential (Eₖ ~ -90 mV) because membrane is most permeable to K⁺ at rest (through leak channels). Na⁺/K⁺ pump contributes electrogenically (3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the Nernst equation and what does it calculate?",
        "options": [
          "Eₓ = (RT/zF) ln([X]out/[X]in); calculates equilibrium potential for specific ion",
          "Calculates resting membrane potential from multiple ions",
          "Determines energy required for active transport",
          "Measures osmotic pressure across membranes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Nernst equation gives the voltage at which an ion is at electrochemical equilibrium (no net movement). Eₓ = (RT/zF) ln([X]ₒ/[X]ᵢ) where R=gas constant, T=temperature, z=ion charge, F=Faraday constant. At 37°C, simplifies to Eₓ = (61.5/z) log([X]ₒ/[X]ᵢ) mV."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation?",
        "options": [
          "Calculates membrane potential considering multiple ions weighted by their permeabilities",
          "Same as Nernst but for single ions only",
          "Calculates ion flux rates through channels",
          "Determines pump stoichiometry and energy use"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vₘ = (RT/F) ln( (Pₖ[K⁺]ₒ+Pₙₐ[Na⁺]ₒ+P꜀ₗ[Cl⁻]ᵢ) / (Pₖ[K⁺]ᵢ+Pₙₐ[Na⁺]ᵢ+P꜀ₗ[Cl⁻]ₒ) ). Considers relative permeabilities (P). At rest, Pₖ >> Pₙₐ, so Vₘ ≈ Eₖ. During action potential, Pₙₐ increases dramatically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to membrane potential if extracellular K⁺ concentration increases?",
        "options": [
          "Depolarization (less negative) as Eₖ becomes less negative, Vₘ follows",
          "Hyperpolarization (more negative) as potassium leaves cells",
          "No change because Na⁺ maintains potential",
          "Cells immediately die from potassium toxicity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased [K⁺]ₒ reduces K⁺ gradient, Eₖ becomes less negative (closer to zero). Since resting Vₘ tracks Eₖ due to high K⁺ permeability, cells depolarize. This occurs in hyperkalemia and affects cardiac rhythm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are graded potentials versus action potentials?",
        "options": [
          "Graded: local, decremental, variable amplitude; Action: all-or-none, non-decremental, fixed amplitude",
          "Both are identical with different names",
          "Graded: only in muscles; Action: only in neurons",
          "Action potentials are smaller than graded potentials"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Graded potentials (postsynaptic, receptor, pacemaker): local changes from ligand/mechanically-gated channels, decay with distance. Action potentials: rapid, large depolarizations from voltage-gated channels, propagate without decay due to regeneration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase in maintaining resting potential?",
        "options": [
          "Direct electrogenic contribution and maintaining ion gradients for leak channels",
          "Only maintains gradients without electrical effect",
          "Actually reduces resting potential by pumping ions",
          "Has no role in resting potential maintenance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1) Direct electrogenic effect: 3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in creates net outward current. 2) Maintains gradients: without pump, gradients run down via leak channels, Vₘ depolarizes toward 0 mV. Contributes ~-10 mV directly in some cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What determines ion permeability across membranes?",
        "options": [
          "Number and state (open/closed) of specific ion channels",
          "Only lipid solubility of ions",
          "Membrane thickness alone",
          "Temperature but not channel proteins"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Permeability (P) = (number of channels × open probability × single channel conductance) / membrane area. Different cells express different channel types. At rest: high Pₖ (leak channels). During action potential: Pₙₐ then Pₖ increase sequentially."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is electrochemical equilibrium and when does it occur?",
        "options": [
          "When electrical and chemical forces balance for an ion (no net movement); at Nernst potential",
          "When all ions have equal concentrations inside and out",
          "Only during action potentials, not at rest",
          "When ATP production equals consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrochemical equilibrium: chemical gradient driving ion in one direction equals electrical gradient driving it opposite direction. At Vₘ = Eₓ for that ion. No energy required to maintain (but energy needed to establish gradients via pumps)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do cardiac muscle cells maintain stable resting potential compared to neurons?",
        "options": [
          "Higher P꜀ₗ (chloride) and different channel expression creates more stable resting potential",
          "Have identical resting potentials to neurons",
          "No resting potential - constantly depolarizing",
          "Only use calcium, not potassium for resting potential"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cardiac myocytes have Vᵣ ≈ -90 mV (more negative than neurons) due to: 1) High Iₖ₁ (inward rectifier K⁺ channels), 2) Significant chloride conductance, 3) Different leak channel isoforms. This stability prevents spontaneous depolarizations that could trigger arrhythmias."
