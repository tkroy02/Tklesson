    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Water Movement Principles in Plants",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is water potential (Ψ) and what does it predict?",
        "options": [
          "The potential energy of water per unit volume; predicts direction of water movement",
          "The pressure required to boil water in cells",
          "Only measures solute concentration without pressure",
          "The electrical potential of water molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water potential (Ψ) measures the tendency of water to move from one area to another due to osmosis, gravity, mechanical pressure, and matrix effects. Water moves from higher Ψ to lower Ψ (more negative)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for total water potential and its components?",
        "options": [
          "Ψ = Ψₛ + Ψₚ + Ψₘ + Ψ₉; solute, pressure, matrix, gravity potentials",
          "Ψ = Ψₛ only, ignoring other components",
          "Ψ = Ψₚ - Ψₛ; pressure minus solute only",
          "Ψ = temperature × concentration gradient"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total water potential = Solute potential (Ψₛ, always ≤ 0) + Pressure potential (Ψₚ, ≥ 0 in turgid cells) + Matrix potential (Ψₘ, ≤ 0, in cell walls/soil) + Gravitational potential (Ψ₉, depends on height). For most cellular applications: Ψ = Ψₛ + Ψₚ."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is solute potential (osmotic potential, Ψₛ) and what affects it?",
        "options": [
          "Effect of dissolved solutes lowering water potential; Ψₛ = -iCRT (negative value)",
          "Pressure from cell walls increasing water potential",
          "Only positive values that attract water",
          "The potential from water molecules themselves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ψₛ = -iCRT, where i = ionization constant, C = molar concentration, R = gas constant, T = temperature (K). Always negative or zero. More solutes → more negative Ψₛ. Pure water at atmospheric pressure: Ψ = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is pressure potential (Ψₚ) in plant cells?",
        "options": [
          "Physical pressure from cell wall against expanding vacuole; positive in turgid cells",
          "Only negative pressure from transpiration pull",
          "Atmospheric pressure acting on all cells equally",
          "The pressure from solute concentration alone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In plant cells, Ψₚ is usually positive (turgor pressure) from rigid cell wall resisting osmotic water entry. Ψₚ can reach 0.5-1.5 MPa in turgid cells. In xylem under tension, Ψₚ can be negative (like stretched rubber band)."
      },
      {
       type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do plant cells adjust water potential to control water movement?",
        "options": [
          "Change solute concentration in vacuole (Ψₛ) and regulate turgor pressure (Ψₚ)",
          "Only change pressure without altering solutes",
          "Actively pump water molecules across membranes",
          "Have fixed water potential that cannot be adjusted"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plants regulate Ψ by: 1) Accumulating/compatible solutes (K⁺, sugars, proline) in vacuole to make Ψₛ more negative, 2) Adjusting cell wall elasticity to change Ψₚ response. Stomatal guard cells change Ψ via K⁺ fluxes."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to water potential in a flaccid vs. turgid plant cell?",
        "options": [
          "Flaccid: Ψₚ ≈ 0, Ψ ≈ Ψₛ (negative); Turgid: Ψₚ positive, Ψ less negative, may approach 0",
          "Flaccid cells have higher Ψ than turgid cells",
          "Both have identical water potentials",
          "Turgid cells always have negative Ψₚ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Flaccid (plasmolyzed or wilted): Ψₚ = 0, Ψ = Ψₛ (negative). Turgid: water enters, cell expands, wall pushes back creating Ψₚ > 0, so Ψ = Ψₛ + Ψₚ is less negative. At equilibrium with surroundings, Ψcell = Ψoutside."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between water potential and osmosis?",
        "options": [
          "Water moves from higher Ψ to lower Ψ (less negative to more negative)",
          "Water moves from lower Ψ to higher Ψ",
          "Water movement is random regardless of Ψ",
          "Osmosis only occurs when Ψ = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water follows Ψ gradient: from area with higher (less negative) Ψ to area with lower (more negative) Ψ. Example: Pure water (Ψ=0) → Cell with Ψ=-0.5 MPa. Cell with Ψ=-0.3 MPa → Cell with Ψ=-0.7 MPa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does water potential explain water movement in whole plants?",
        "options": [
          "Soil → root → xylem → leaf → atmosphere: progressively more negative Ψ",
          "Water moves upward against Ψ gradients",
          "All plant tissues have identical Ψ values",
          "Ψ increases (less negative) from roots to leaves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Typical Ψ values: Soil (-0.1 to -0.3 MPa) → Root cortex (-0.4 MPa) → Xylem (-0.6 to -1.0 MPa) → Leaf mesophyll (-1.0 to -2.0 MPa) → Atmosphere (-10 to -100 MPa). This gradient drives transpirational pull."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the significance of water potential in seed germination?",
        "options": [
          "Imbibition: dry seeds have very negative Ψₛ, rapidly absorb water to initiate metabolism",
          "Seeds have positive Ψ that repels water",
          "Water potential plays no role in germination",
          "Seeds only absorb water when Ψ is positive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dry seeds: Ψ may be -100 MPa or lower due to concentrated solutes in dormant state. Upon hydration, water rapidly enters (imbibition) due to huge Ψ gradient, rehydrating tissues, activating enzymes, and initiating germination."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do pressure chambers measure plant water status?",
        "options": [
          "Apply pressure to cut stem until xylem sap appears at surface; pressure = negative of leaf Ψ",
          "Measure electrical conductivity of tissues",
          "Weigh plants before and after watering",
          "Use dyes to visualize water movement"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Scholander pressure chamber: seal leaf/stem in chamber, slowly increase pressure until sap returns to cut surface. Applied pressure ≈ -Ψleaf. Used to determine when plants need irrigation and study drought stress."
