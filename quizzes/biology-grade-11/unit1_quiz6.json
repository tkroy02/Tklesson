        "options": [
          "To connect cells physically and allow communication, creating functional tissues",

          "Form channels (connexons) that allow direct passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells",
          "Completely fuse the plasma membranes of two cells into a single, shared lipid bilayer structure",
          "Secrete signaling hormones into the extracellular space to be picked up by distant target organs",
          "Link cells together structurally while preventing any exchange of molecules or electrical signals"

        "question": "What is the difference between adherens junctions and desmosomes?",
        "options": [
          "Adherens connect actin filaments in belts; desmosomes connect intermediate filaments at spots",
          "Adherens junctions are found only in plant tissues, while desmosomes are restricted to animal organisms",
          "Adherens junctions permit the passage of large proteins while desmosomes prevent all molecular movement",
          "They are structurally and functionally identical and differ only in their location within the body"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adherens junctions link actin cytoskeletons in continuous belts. Desmosomes link intermediate filaments at discrete, button-like spots."
