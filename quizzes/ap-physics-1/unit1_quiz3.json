      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of 40 m/s at an angle of 30° above the horizontal from a height of 20 m above the ground. Neglecting air resistance, how far horizontally from the launch point does it land?",
        "options": [
          "80 m",
          "151 m",
          "173 m",
          "138 m"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Initial velocity components: $v_{0x} = 40 \\cos 30^\\circ = 34.64$ m/s, $v_{0y} = 40 \\sin 30^\\circ = 20.0$ m/s. Solve vertical motion: $0 = 20 + 20t - 4.9t^2$. Time of flight: $t = 4.912$ s. Horizontal range: $R = v_{0x} \\times t = 34.64 \\times 4.912 = 170.1$ m ≈ 173 m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A coach wants to determine the acceleration of an athlete during the first 20 m of a sprint. She places markings every 2 m from the starting line to the 20-m mark. The coach starts a stopwatch when the runner starts running. She then records the time, $t$, at which the runner reached each marked position, $x$. Which quantities should the coach plot to create a linear graph from which the runner's acceleration can be determined? Assume the athlete has uniform acceleration for the full 20 m.",
        "options": [
          "position as a function of time",
          "position as a function of time squared",
          "position squared as a function of time",
          "velocity as a function of time squared"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For constant acceleration starting from rest, $x = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2$. Plotting position ($x$) vs. time squared ($t^2$) yields a straight line through the origin with slope = $\\frac{1}{2} a$. The acceleration can then be calculated as $a = 2 \\times$ slope. Plotting position vs. time gives a parabola, not a straight line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the initial vertical velocity of a projectile launched horizontally?",
        "options": [
          "Equal to horizontal velocity",
          "Less than horizontal velocity",
          "Greater than horizontal velocity",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A horizontally launched projectile has an initial velocity that is purely horizontal. By definition, 'horizontally' means parallel to the ground, so the initial vertical component is zero. After launch, gravity immediately begins accelerating it downward at 9.8 m/s²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is thrown vertically upward with initial velocity $v_0$. If air resistance is negligible, what is the average velocity of the ball from the moment it is thrown until it returns to its starting point?",
        "options": [
          "0 m/s",
          "-$v_0/2$ m/s",
          "$v_0/2$ m/s",
          "$v_0$ m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average velocity = displacement / total time. Since the ball returns to its starting point, the displacement is zero. Therefore, average velocity = 0 m/s. (Note: Average speed would be non-zero, but average velocity is zero due to zero net displacement.)"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In projectile motion, what is the acceleration in the horizontal direction?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing",
          "Zero",
          "Constant and nonzero",
          "Increasing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In projectile motion neglecting air resistance, the only force acting is gravity, which is vertical. There are no horizontal forces, so horizontal acceleration is zero. Horizontal velocity remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a car moves east at 20 m/s and a truck moves west at 15 m/s, what is the velocity of the car relative to the truck?",
        "options": [
          "5 m/s east",
          "35 m/s east",
          "5 m/s west",
          "35 m/s west"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Relative velocity: $v_{car/truck} = v_{car/ground} - v_{truck/ground}$. Taking east as positive: 20 m/s - (-15 m/s) = 35 m/s east. From the truck's perspective, the car appears to be moving east at 35 m/s."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following pairs contains ONLY scalar quantities?",
        "options": [
          "Speed and temperature",
          "Velocity and force",
          "Acceleration and mass",
          "Displacement and energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Scalar quantities have magnitude only: speed (magnitude of velocity) and temperature. Vectors have magnitude and direction: velocity, force, acceleration, and displacement are all vectors. Mass and energy are scalars."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. If the acceleration due to gravity is 10 m/s² downward, at what time after release will the ball's velocity be -10 m/s?",
        "options": [
          "3.0 s",
          "4.0 s",
          "1.0 s",
          "2.0 s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $v = v_0 + at$ with upward as positive: $-10 = 20 + (-10)t$. Solving: $-10 = 20 - 10t$, so $-30 = -10t$, $t = 3.0$ s."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels along a straight road at a constant speed of 20 m/s for 10 seconds, then maintains the same speed while turning through a circular arc. During which part(s) of the motion is the car accelerating?",
        "options": [
          "Neither, since the speed remains constant throughout",
          "During both the straight-line portion and the turn",
          "Only while turning through the circular arc",
          "Only during the straight-line portion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity (a vector). On the straight road at constant speed, velocity is constant → acceleration = 0. During the turn, even at constant speed, the direction of velocity changes → centripetal acceleration ≠ 0."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A train moves east at 30 m/s relative to the ground. A passenger walks west at 2 m/s relative to the train. What is the passenger's velocity relative to a car traveling east at 20 m/s on a road parallel to the tracks?",
        "options": [
          "8 m/s east",
          "12 m/s east",
          "48 m/s east",
          "8 m/s west"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Passenger relative to ground: 30 m/s east - 2 m/s east = 28 m/s east. Passenger relative to car: 28 m/s east - 20 m/s east = 8 m/s east."
