        "question": "A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at a rate of 2 m/s² for 5 seconds. Calculate the total distance covered by the car during this time.",
        "options": [
          "25 meters",
          "50 meters",
          "20 meters",
          "10 meters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $x = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2$ with $v_0 = 0$, $a = 2$ m/s², $t = 5$ s: $x = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 5^2 = 1 \\times 25 = 25$ m."

        "question": "A car travels in a straight line with an initial velocity of 15 m/s. It accelerates at 2 m/s² for 4 seconds, then maintains constant velocity for 3 seconds, and finally decelerates at 5 m/s² until stopping. What is the car's displacement during the entire journey?",

          "91 m"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Stage 1: $v_1 = 15 + 2 \\times 4 = 23$ m/s, $x_1 = 15 \\times 4 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 4^2 = 76$ m. Stage 2: $x_2 = 23 \\times 3 = 69$ m. Stage 3: Time to stop $t = 23/5 = 4.6$ s, $x_3 = 23 \\times 4.6 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-5) \\times 4.6^2 = 52.9$ m. Total: $76 + 69 + 52.9 = 197.9$ m."

          "1.00"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Particle A: $v_{avg,A} = (6-0)/3 = 2$ m/s. Particle B: $v_{avg,B} = (-2-10)/4 = -12/4 = -3$ m/s. Magnitudes: |2| = 2 m/s, |3| = 3 m/s. Ratio = 2/3 ≈ 0.67."

          "Approximately 4.24 km northeast",
          "6 km north"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "North-south displacement: 5 km north - 2 km south = 3 km north. East-west displacement: 3 km east. Magnitude: √(3² + 3²) = √18 ≈ 4.24 km. Direction is northeast (45° north of east)."

        "question": "A swimmer can swim at 2 m/s in still water. The swimmer aims directly across a river flowing at 1 m/s. If the river is 100 m wide, how much time will it take the swimmer to reach the opposite bank?",

          "50 s",
          "40 s",
          "5 × 10 s",
          "100 s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The time to cross depends only on the swimmer's velocity component perpendicular to the banks and the river width. Perpendicular velocity = 2 m/s, width = 100 m, so time = 100 / 2 = 50 s. The river current affects the swimmer's downstream displacement but not the crossing time."

        "question": "A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of 40 m/s at an angle of 30° above the horizontal from the top of a 15 m high building. Which statement correctly describes the projectile's motion?",
        "options": [
          "The projectile's speed is constant throughout its trajectory",
          "The horizontal displacement depends on the projectile's mass",
          "The vertical acceleration decreases as the projectile rises",
          "The horizontal component of velocity remains constant at 34.6 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For ideal projectile motion (no air resistance):\n1. Horizontal velocity remains constant: vₓ = v₀ cos 30° = 40 × 0.866 ≈ 34.6 m/s.\n2. Speed is not constant (vertical velocity changes).\n3. Horizontal displacement does not depend on mass.\n4. Vertical acceleration is constant (-9.8 m/s²)."

        "question": "An automotive engineer collects velocity and position data for a car moving along a straight track. The engineer then plots the velocity, v, of the car as a function of its position, x. The resulting graph is curved, not linear. Based on the shape of the curve, the engineer decides to square the velocity values to create a graph of velocity squared, v², as a function of position, x. The resulting graph is shown below.",

          "4 m/s²",
          "6 m/s²",
          "8 m/s²",
          "10 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From the kinematic equation v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀), which is linear in v² vs. x for constant acceleration. At x=0 m, v₀² = 400 → v₀ = 20 m/s. At x=50 m, v² = 1200. Using the equation: 1200 = 400 + 2a(50); 800 = 100a; a = 8 m/s²."

          "Graph with points (0, 20) and (10, 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Car moving west has negative velocity. Slowing down means acceleration is opposite to velocity (positive). Constant acceleration = +2 m/s² gives v-t graph with positive slope. Starting from negative velocity and reaching zero matches option A: slope = (0 - (-20))/10 = +2 m/s²."

          "Graph with points (0, 4) and (7, 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The v-t graph is a straight line from (0,0) to (7,28), with slope = (28-0)/(7-0) = 4 m/s². Constant slope means constant acceleration. Therefore, the a-t graph should be a horizontal line at 4 m/s², matching Option B."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The a-t graph shows constant acceleration of -3 m/s². Object slows to stop, so final velocity = 0. Using v_f = v_i + at: 0 = v_i + (-3)(10) → v_i = 30 m/s. The v-t graph is a straight line from (0, 30) to (10, 0) with slope = -3 m/s², matching Option C."
