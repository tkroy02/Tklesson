      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student stands on a moving walkway that travels at 1.5 m/s east. The student walks at 0.8 m/s west relative to the walkway. A ball is thrown horizontally at 10 m/s east relative to the ground. If the ball experiences a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s² downward, what is the ball's acceleration as observed by the student?",
        "options": [
          "9.1 m/s² in a direction below horizontal",
          "9.8 m/s² downward and 0.7 m/s² west",
          "9.8 m/s² downward and 0.7 m/s² east",
          "9.8 m/s² downward"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is invariant between inertial reference frames. Since both the student and ground are inertial frames (moving at constant velocity relative to each other), the acceleration of the ball measured by the student equals the acceleration measured from the ground. The horizontal velocity difference (0.7 m/s) does not create horizontal acceleration because both have constant horizontal velocity."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is thrown horizontally from a height of 15 m with an initial speed of 12 m/s. At the same instant, a second ball is dropped from rest from the same height. What is the distance between the balls when the second ball hits the ground?",
        "options": [
          "0 m",
          "42 m",
          "12 m",
          "21 m"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Both balls have identical vertical motion (same height, initial vertical velocity = 0, acceleration = -9.8 m/s²), so they hit the ground simultaneously after approximately 1.75 s. The horizontally thrown ball travels 12 m/s × 1.75 s = 21 m horizontally. When the dropped ball hits the ground (at x=0), the thrown ball is at x=21 m, so their separation is 21 m."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves in the xy-plane according to the position functions $x(t) = 3t^2$ and $y(t) = 4t - 2t^2$. What is the particle's displacement vector from t = 0 to t = 2 seconds?",
        "options": [
          "(3, 0) m",
          "(12, -8) m",
          "(12, 8) m",
          "(12, 0) m"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "At $t=0$: $x=0$, $y=0$. At $t=2$: $x=3(4)=12$ m, $y=4(2)-2(4)=8-8=0$ m. Displacement = final position - initial position = $(12-0, 0-0) = (12, 0)$ m."

        "question": "Which condition must be true for the equation $x = x_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a_x t^2$ to be valid?",
        "options": [
          "Variable velocity",
          "Changing mass",
          "Constant acceleration",
          "Zero displacement"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This kinematic equation is derived under the assumption of constant acceleration. If acceleration changes with time, this equation does not apply. The equation can handle variable velocity (when $a \\neq 0$), and mass is irrelevant to kinematic equations."

        "question": "An observer on a train moving at constant velocity of 30 m/s eastward sees a bird flying alongside the train at what appears to be 0 m/s relative to their window. How would an observer standing on the ground describe the bird's motion?",
        "options": [
          "Moving eastward at 30 m/s",
          "Stationary (0 m/s)",
          "Moving westward at 30 m/s",
          "Moving eastward at 60 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Relative velocity equation: $v_{bird/ground} = v_{bird/train} + v_{train/ground} = 0 + 30$ m/s east = 30 m/s east. If the bird appears stationary relative to the train, it must be moving with the same velocity as the train relative to the ground."

        "question": "Two trains approach each other on parallel tracks. Train A moves east at 25 m/s, while train B moves west at 20 m/s. A passenger in train A throws a ball horizontally at 15 m/s in the direction of train A's motion. What is the speed of the ball as observed by a passenger in train B?",

          "60 m/s",
          "10 m/s",
          "45 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ball velocity relative to ground = 15 m/s (throw) + 25 m/s (Train A) = 40 m/s east. Train B moves west at 20 m/s (which is -20 m/s east). Relative to Train B: $v_{ball/B} = 40$ m/s - (-20 m/s) = 60 m/s east. Alternatively: $v_{A/B} = 25 - (-20) = 45$ m/s, so $v_{ball/B} = 15 + 45 = 60$ m/s."

        "question": "A student claims that if she walks 5 meters forward and then 5 meters backward, her average speed and average velocity for the trip are equal. Which statement best evaluates this claim?",
        "options": [
          "Correct; both quantities equal 10m/t",
          "Incorrect; average speed is 10m/t while velocity is 0m/t",
          "Correct; both quantities equal 0m/t",
          "Incorrect; average speed is 0m/t while velocity is 10m/t"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Average speed = total distance / time = (5 m + 5 m)/t = 10 m/t. Average velocity = displacement / time = (0 m)/t = 0 m/t (since she returns to starting point). The claim is incorrect because 10/t ≠ 0."

        "question": "A student collects velocity and position data for a cart moving in one dimension. After plotting velocity squared, $v^2$, as a function of position, $x$, the student obtains the graph shown below. What is the acceleration of the cart?",

          "3.2 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For constant acceleration, $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)$, so a graph of $v^2$ vs. $x$ is linear with slope = $2a$. From the graph, the slope can be calculated using two points. Using (0 m, 4 (m/s)²) and (5 m, 12 (m/s)²): Slope = (12 - 4)/(5 - 0) = 8/5 = 1.6 (m/s)²/m. Therefore, $2a = 1.6$, so $a = 0.8$ m/s²."

At what time will the car reach the end of the on-ramp, a position of $4x$? Assume the car moves in a straight line and accelerates uniformly for the entire distance.",

          "15 s",
          "20 s",
          "30 s",
          "40 s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For constant acceleration starting from rest, $x = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2$, so position is proportional to time squared: $x \\propto t^2$. To go from position $x$ to $4x$, time must increase by factor $\\sqrt{4} = 2$. Since $t = 10$ s at position $x$, time at position $4x$ is $10 \\times 2 = 20$ s."

        "question": "A roller coaster car starts from rest at the top of a hill and begins to roll down. At a point 5 m from the top of the hill the roller coaster's speed is measured. The bottom of the hill is 45 m from the top of the hill. How will the speed of the car at the bottom of the hill, $v_{bottom}$, compare with its speed 5 m from the top of the hill, $v_{top}$? Assume the acceleration of the car is constant as it coasts down the hill.",
        "options": [
          "$v_{bottom} = 9v_{top}$",

          "$v_{bottom} = \\frac{1}{9}v_{top}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For constant acceleration starting from rest, $v^2 = 2ad$, so velocity squared is proportional to distance: $v^2 \\propto d$. The distance increases by factor 9 (from 5 m to 45 m), so $v^2$ increases by factor 9, and $v$ increases by factor $\\sqrt{9} = 3$. Thus $v_{bottom} = 3v_{top}$."

Time of flight: $t = 4.912$ s. Horizontal range: $R = v_{0x} \\times t = 34.64 \\times 4.912 = 170.1$ m ≈ 173 m."

        "question": "A coach wants to determine the acceleration of an athlete during the first 20 m of a sprint. She places markings every 2 m from the starting line to the 20-m mark. The coach starts a stopwatch when the runner starts running. She then records the time, $t$, at which the runner reached each marked position, $x$. Which quantities should the coach plot to create a linear graph from which the runner's acceleration can be determined? Assume the athlete has uniform acceleration for the full 20 m.",
        "options": [

          "position squared as a function of time",
          "velocity as a function of time squared"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For constant acceleration starting from rest, $x = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2$. Plotting position ($x$) vs. time squared ($t^2$) yields a straight line through the origin with slope = $\\frac{1}{2} a$. The acceleration can then be calculated as $a = 2 \\times$ slope. Plotting position vs. time gives a parabola, not a straight line."

          "Greater than horizontal velocity",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A horizontally launched projectile has an initial velocity that is purely horizontal. By definition, 'horizontally' means parallel to the ground, so the initial vertical component is zero. After launch, gravity immediately begins accelerating it downward at 9.8 m/s²."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average velocity = displacement / total time. Since the ball returns to its starting point, the displacement is zero. Therefore, average velocity = 0 m/s. (Note: Average speed would be non-zero, but average velocity is zero due to zero net displacement.)"

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In projectile motion neglecting air resistance, the only force acting is gravity, which is vertical. There are no horizontal forces, so horizontal acceleration is zero. Horizontal velocity remains constant."
