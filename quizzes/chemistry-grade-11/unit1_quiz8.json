    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the spatial probability distribution of an s-orbital?",
        "options": [
          "Spherical and centered on the nucleus",
          "Dumbbell-shaped with two lobes",
          "Cloverleaf-shaped with four lobes",
          "Donut-shaped with a central ring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The s-orbital ($l=0$) is unique because it is spherically symmetrical, meaning the probability of finding an electron is the same in any direction from the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many lobes are typically found in a standard p-orbital?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "4",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A p-orbital ($l=1$) consists of two lobes situated on opposite sides of the nucleus, often described as a 'dumbbell' shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of orbital is characterized by a cloverleaf shape with four lobes (excluding the $d_{z^2}$ orientation)?",
        "options": [
          "d-orbital",
          "s-orbital",
          "p-orbital",
          "f-orbital"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most d-orbitals ($l=2$) exhibit a cloverleaf pattern with four lobes of electron density, except for the $d_{z^2}$ orbital."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'radial node' in the context of an s-orbital?",
        "options": [
          "A spherical surface where the probability of finding an electron is zero",
          "The point at the exact center of the nucleus",
          "The outermost boundary of the electron cloud",
          "The region where the electron's spin is reversed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the principal quantum number $n$ increases, s-orbitals develop radial nodes—internal regions where the probability density drops to zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a p-orbital, what exists at the nucleus where the two lobes meet?",
        "options": [
          "A nodal plane",
          "A high-density electron core",
          "A spherical subshell",
          "A magnetic pole"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "P-orbitals have a nodal plane passing through the nucleus; the probability of finding a p-electron exactly at the nucleus is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a 2p orbital, a 3p orbital:",
        "options": [
          "Is larger and higher in energy",
          "Is smaller and lower in energy",
          "Has a different fundamental shape",
          "Contains fewer orientations in space"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Orbitals of the same type ($l$) become larger and have higher potential energy as the principal quantum number $n$ increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which orbital orientation is famously described as a dumbbell with a 'donut' or 'torus' around its center?",
        "options": [
          "$d_{z^2}$",
          "$p_x$",
          "$d_{xy}$",
          "$f_{xyz}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $d_{z^2}$ orbital is the exception to the cloverleaf shape of the d-subshell, featuring two lobes along the z-axis and a ring of density in the xy-plane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many total orientations (orbitals) exist within an f-subshell?",
        "options": [
          "7",
          "3",
          "5",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an f-subshell ($l=3$), the magnetic quantum number $m_l$ can take 7 values (-3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3), each representing a specific orientation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding the energy of orbitals in a multi-electron atom?",
        "options": [
          "Orbitals within the same shell (e.g., 3s, 3p, 3d) have different energies",
          "All orbitals in the same shell are degenerate",
          "The 4s orbital is always higher in energy than the 3d orbital",
          "Energy is independent of the angular momentum quantum number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In multi-electron atoms, electron-electron repulsions cause subshells within the same shell to split into different energy levels ($s < p < d < f$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The orientation of the three p-orbitals ($p_x, p_y, p_z$) are relative to each other at an angle of:",
        "options": [
          "90°",
          "180°",
          "109.5°",
          "120°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The three p-orbitals are mutually perpendicular, aligned along the Cartesian axes ($x, y, z$)."
