    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines 'First Ionization Energy'?",
        "options": [
          "The energy required to remove the most loosely held electron from a gaseous atom",
          "The energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom",
          "The energy required to move an electron from the $1s$ to the $2s$ orbital",
          "The total energy of all electrons in the valence shell"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionization energy is specifically the energy cost to remove an electron. It is always an endothermic process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general trend for first ionization energy across a period from left to right?",
        "options": [
          "It increases due to increasing effective nuclear charge",
          "It decreases because the atoms are getting larger",
          "It remains constant because the electrons are in the same shell",
          "It decreases due to increased shielding"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As protons are added, the nucleus exerts a stronger pull on the electrons, making them harder to remove."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does ionization energy typically decrease as you move down a group?",
        "options": [
          "The valence electrons are further from the nucleus and more shielded",
          "The nuclear charge decreases as you move down",
          "The atoms become more metallic and want to gain electrons",
          "The number of protons in the nucleus decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased distance (higher $n$) and shielding by core electrons reduce the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element would be expected to have the highest first ionization energy?",
        "options": [
          "Helium (He)",
          "Francium (Fr)",
          "Cesium (Cs)",
          "Radon (Rn)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helium has its electrons very close to the nucleus in the $1s$ shell with no shielding, making them extremely difficult to remove."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "There is a slight drop in ionization energy between Nitrogen and Oxygen. What causes this exception?",
        "options": [
          "Electron-electron repulsion in the newly paired $2p$ orbital of Oxygen",
          "Oxygen has a smaller atomic radius than Nitrogen",
          "Nitrogen has more shielding than Oxygen",
          "Oxygen's nucleus is less attractive than Nitrogen's"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In Nitrogen, the $p$ subshell is half-filled (stable). In Oxygen, the fourth $p$ electron must pair up, and the repulsion makes it easier to remove."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the process for the second ionization energy of Magnesium?",
        "options": [
          "$Mg^+(g) \\rightarrow Mg^{2+}(g) + e^-$",
          "$Mg(g) \\rightarrow Mg^{2+}(g) + 2e^-$",
          "$Mg(g) + e^- \\rightarrow Mg^-(g)$",
          "$Mg^{2+}(g) \\rightarrow Mg^{3+}(g) + e^-$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The second ionization energy is the energy to remove an electron from a $1+$ ion to form a $2+$ ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the second ionization energy of Sodium ($Na$) significantly higher than its first ionization energy?",
        "options": [
          "The second electron is removed from a stable, noble gas core",
          "Sodium becomes a larger ion after losing the first electron",
          "The second electron is in a higher principal energy level",
          "Sodium is an alkali metal and prefers to lose two electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sodium's first electron is in the $3s$ shell. Once lost, the next electron comes from the $2p$ shell, which is much closer to the nucleus and very stable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Successive ionization energies ($IE_1, IE_2, IE_3...$) for an unknown element are: 578, 1817, 2745, and 11577 kJ/mol. Which group does this element belong to?",
        "options": [
          "Group 13 (3A)",
          "Group 1 (1A)",
          "Group 2 (2A)",
          "Group 14 (4A)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The massive jump occurs after $IE_3$, indicating that the 4th electron is a core electron. Thus, the atom has 3 valence electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of elements has the lowest ionization energies?",
        "options": [
          "Alkali Metals",
          "Noble Gases",
          "Halogens",
          "Alkaline Earth Metals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkali metals have the largest radii and lowest effective nuclear charges in their periods, making their single valence electron easy to lose."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In general, as the atomic radius of an element increases, its ionization energy:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The further an electron is from the nucleus, the weaker the attractive force and the less energy is required to remove it."
