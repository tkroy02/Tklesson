    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the standard conditions for measuring standard reduction potentials ($E^\\circ$)?",
        "options": [
          "25\u00b0C, 1 M concentration, and 1 atm pressure",
          "0\u00b0C, 1 M concentration, and 1 atm pressure",
          "25\u00b0C, 0.1 M concentration, and 1 atm pressure",
          "100\u00b0C, 1 M concentration, and 1 atm pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard states in electrochemistry are defined as 298.15 K, 1.0 M for aqueous species, and 1.0 atm for gases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance with a very high, positive $E^\\circ$ value is a ________.",
        "options": [
          "Strong oxidizing agent",
          "Strong reducing agent",
          "Weak oxidizing agent",
          "Noble gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A high positive reduction potential means the substance is easily reduced. Since it is easily reduced, it is very effective at oxidizing other substances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The standard reduction potential of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) is exactly:",
        "options": [
          "0.00 V",
          "1.00 V",
          "-1.00 V",
          "7.00 V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The SHE serves as the universal reference point from which all other potentials are measured and is assigned a value of zero by convention."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two half-cells are connected, the one with the **more positive** reduction potential will undergo:",
        "options": [
          "Reduction",
          "Oxidation",
          "Sublimation",
          "No change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The species with the greater 'pull' for electrons (higher $E^\\circ$) will always win the tug-of-war and be reduced at the cathode."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fluorine ($F_2$) has one of the highest $E^\\circ$ values (+2.87 V). This means Fluorine is:",
        "options": [
          "Extremely easy to reduce",
          "Extremely easy to oxidize",
          "A very strong reducing agent",
          "Chemically inert"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Its high positive potential indicates it has a massive affinity for electrons, making it the strongest common oxidizing agent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Lithium ($Li^+$) has a very negative $E^\\circ$ value (-3.05 V). This indicates that:",
        "options": [
          "Lithium metal is a very strong reducing agent",
          "Lithium ions are very easy to reduce",
          "Lithium metal is a strong oxidizing agent",
          "Lithium will never react"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $Li^+$ is very hard to reduce (negative $E^\\circ$), the reverse reaction ($Li$ metal losing an electron) is extremely favorable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Standard reduction potentials are 'intensive properties.' This means that if you multiply a half-reaction by 2 to balance an equation, the $E^\\circ$ value:",
        "options": [
          "Does not change",
          "Is doubled",
          "Is squared",
          "Is halved"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Potential (voltage) is a measure of energy per unit charge. Doubling the amount of substance doesn't change the 'pressure' with which the electrons move."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the EMF series, metals located at the very bottom (most negative potentials) are generally:",
        "options": [
          "The most active metals",
          "The most noble (unreactive) metals",
          "The best oxidizing agents",
          "Liquid at room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metals like Potassium and Lithium are at the bottom because they 'hate' being reduced and 'love' being oxidized (losing electrons)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true about a substance with a negative reduction potential?",
        "options": [
          "It is more difficult to reduce than $H^+$",
          "It is easier to reduce than $H^+$",
          "It can never be reduced",
          "It is always a liquid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative value relative to the SHE (0.00 V) means the substance has a lower affinity for electrons than hydrogen ions do."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The tendency for a reduction half-reaction to occur is measured in units of:",
        "options": [
          "Volts (V)",
          "Amperes (A)",
          "Ohms (\u03a9)",
          "Joules (J)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Voltage is the unit of electromotive force (potential difference) that drives the flow of electrons."
