    "topic": "Finding actual molecular formulas",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between an empirical formula and a molecular formula?",
        "options": [
          "The molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms; the empirical formula shows the simplest ratio",
          "The empirical formula is only used for ionic compounds",
          "The molecular formula always has a higher mass than the empirical formula",
          "There is no difference; they are always the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple (including 1) of the empirical formula."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To determine a molecular formula, what piece of information is required in addition to the empirical formula?",
        "options": [
          "The molar mass of the actual compound",
          "The density of the substance",
          "The boiling point of the substance",
          "The name of the elements involved"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must compare the 'empirical formula mass' to the experimentally determined 'molar mass' to find the multiplier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the empirical formula is $CH_2$ and the molar mass is $42.0$ g/mol, what is the molecular formula? (Empirical mass $\\approx 14.0$ g/mol)",
        "options": [
          "$C_3H_6$",
          "$C_2H_4$",
          "$CH_2$",
          "$C_4H_8$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The multiplier $n = 42.0 / 14.0 = 3$. Multiplying the subscripts in $CH_2$ by 3 gives $C_3H_6$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the multiplier ($n$) if the empirical formula mass is $30.0$ g/mol and the actual molar mass is $180.0$ g/mol?",
        "options": [
          "6",
          "3",
          "1",
          "12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$180.0 / 30.0 = 6$. This means the molecular formula is 6 times larger than the empirical formula."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A compound has an empirical formula of $P_2O_5$. Which of the following could be its molecular formula?",
        "options": [
          "$P_4O_{10}$",
          "$P_2O_5$",
          "$P_6O_{15}$",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The molecular formula must be a whole-number multiple ($1, 2, 3, \\dots$) of the empirical formula. All options satisfy this."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the multiplier $n$ is calculated to be $1.02$, what is the relationship between the empirical and molecular formulas?",
        "options": [
          "They are the same",
          "The molecular formula is double the empirical",
          "The data is invalid",
          "The molecular formula is half the empirical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to experimental rounding in molar mass determination, a value very close to $1$ indicates that the empirical and molecular formulas are identical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following compounds has a molecular formula that is the same as its empirical formula?",
        "options": [
          "$H_2O$",
          "$C_6H_{12}O_6$",
          "$C_2H_2$",
          "$N_2O_4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$H_2O$ is already in its simplest ratio. The others can be simplified further ($CH_2O$, $CH$, and $NO_2$ respectively)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance with the empirical formula $CH$ has a molar mass of $78$ g/mol. What is its molecular formula? ($C=12, H=1$)",
        "options": [
          "$C_6H_6$",
          "$C_2H_2$",
          "$C_5H_5$",
          "$C_{12}H_{12}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Empirical mass of $CH = 13$ g/mol. $78 / 13 = 6$. Therefore, the formula is $C_6H_6$ (Benzene)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't we determine the molecular formula from percent composition alone?",
        "options": [
          "Different molecules can have the same ratio of atoms",
          "Percent composition does not account for the mass of the elements",
          "Percent composition only applies to ionic compounds",
          "The math is too complex without a computer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because percent composition only gives the ratio, multiple different molecules (like formaldehyde, acetic acid, and glucose) can share the same percentages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the percent composition of a compound as it changes from an empirical formula to a molecular formula?",
        "options": [
          "The percent composition remains the same",
          "The percentages double",
          "The percentage of the heaviest element increases",
          "The percentages decrease as the molecule gets larger"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the ratio of the atoms remains constant, the percentage by mass of each element does not change."
