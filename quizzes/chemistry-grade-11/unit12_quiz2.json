    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a very large equilibrium constant ($K \\gg 1$) indicate about a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "At equilibrium, the mixture consists mostly of products",
          "At equilibrium, the mixture consists mostly of reactants",
          "The reaction is extremely slow and takes years to reach equilibrium",
          "The reaction is at equilibrium when exactly half the reactants are consumed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $K$ is the ratio of products to reactants, a value much greater than 1 means the numerator (products) is much larger than the denominator (reactants)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The equilibrium constant $K_{c}$ is specifically calculated using which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Molar concentrations (mol/L)",
          "Partial pressures (atm or kPa)",
          "Total mass in grams",
          "The number of moles of catalyst added"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'c' in $K_{c}$ stands for concentration, typically expressed in Molarity (M)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The value of the equilibrium constant $K$ for a given reaction changes **only** when there is a change in:",
        "options": [
          "Temperature",
          "Initial concentration of reactants",
          "Pressure of the container",
          "Surface area of the solid reactants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature is the only factor that alters the actual value of $K$. Concentration and pressure changes may shift the equilibrium position, but the ratio defined by $K$ remains the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation correctly relates $K_{p}$ and $K_{c}$ for a gas-phase reaction?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{p} = K_{c}(RT)^{\\Delta n}$",
          "$K_{p} = K_{c} / (RT)^{\\Delta n}$",
          "$K_{p} = K_{c} + \\Delta nRT$",
          "$K_{p} = K_{c} \\cdot P \\cdot V$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This relationship is derived from the Ideal Gas Law ($PV=nRT$). $\\Delta n$ is the change in the number of moles of gas (moles of gaseous products minus moles of gaseous reactants)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under what condition would $K_{p}$ be equal to $K_{c}$?",
        "options": [
          "When the number of moles of gaseous products equals the number of moles of gaseous reactants ($\\Delta n = 0$)",
          "When the temperature is exactly $0^{\\circ}C$",
          "When the total pressure is 1.0 atm",
          "When all reactants and products are in the liquid phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $\\Delta n = 0$, then $(RT)^{0} = 1$, making $K_{p} = K_{c}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a small equilibrium constant ($K \\ll 1$) tell us about a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The reaction favors the reactants; very little product is formed",
          "The reaction is endothermic",
          "The reaction is impossible and will never occur",
          "The forward reaction is much faster than the reverse reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A small $K$ indicates that at equilibrium, the concentration of reactants is much higher than the concentration of products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the $K_{p}$ expression, the 'P' stands for:",
        "options": [
          "Partial Pressure",
          "Percentage of products",
          "Potential energy",
          "Pascal (the only unit allowed)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{p}$ uses the partial pressures of gaseous reactants and products instead of their concentrations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $K_{c} = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{20}$ for a reaction, the reaction is said to:",
        "options": [
          "Go to completion",
          "Not occur at all",
          "Be at a 1:1 balance of reactants and products",
          "Be highly unstable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An extremely large $K$ value implies that for all practical purposes, all reactants are converted into products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When calculating $\\Delta n$ for the $K_{p}$ equation, which phases are included?",
        "options": [
          "Gases only",
          "Gases and aqueous solutions",
          "Solids and liquids",
          "All reactants and products regardless of phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\Delta n$ specifically refers to the change in the number of moles of **gas**, as solids and liquids do not exert partial pressures in the same way."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $K_{c}$ for the forward reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ is 50, what is $K_{c}$ for the reverse reaction $B \\rightleftharpoons A$?",
        "options": [
          "0.02 (1/50)",
          "-50",
          "50",
          "2500 ($50^{2}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a reaction is reversed, its equilibrium constant is the reciprocal of the original constant ($K_{rev} = 1/K_{fwd}$)."
