    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Heat content at constant pressure",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following conditions must be met for the heat of a reaction ($q$) to be equal to the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$)?",
        "options": [
          "Constant pressure",
          "Constant volume",
          "Constant temperature",
          "Zero work being done"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy is defined as $H = E + PV$. At constant pressure, $\\Delta H = q_p$. This is why $\\Delta H$ is so useful for reactions in open beakers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction has a $\\Delta H$ of $-250$ kJ, the reaction is ________ and heat is ________ the system.",
        "options": [
          "Exothermic; leaving",
          "Endothermic; entering",
          "Exothermic; entering",
          "Endothermic; leaving"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative $\\Delta H$ indicates an exothermic process where energy is released from the system to the surroundings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the change in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$) calculated for a chemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{\\text{products}} - H_{\\text{reactants}}$",
          "$H_{\\text{reactants}} - H_{\\text{products}}$",
          "$H_{\\text{products}} + H_{\\text{reactants}}$",
          "$(H_{\\text{products}} \\cdot H_{\\text{reactants}}) / 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like all state functions, the change is the final state (products) minus the initial state (reactants)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an 'extensive' property, meaning its value depends on the amount of substance present?",
        "options": [
          "Enthalpy ($H$)",
          "Temperature ($T$)",
          "Density ($d$)",
          "Specific Heat ($c$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy is extensive. Burning $2$ moles of methane releases twice as much heat as burning $1$ mole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the sign of $\\Delta H$ if a chemical reaction is reversed?",
        "options": [
          "The sign is reversed (positive becomes negative, or vice versa)",
          "The sign remains the same",
          "The sign becomes zero",
          "The sign is squared"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the forward reaction is exothermic (releases heat), the reverse reaction must be endothermic (absorbs heat) by the same amount."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an endothermic reaction, the enthalpy of the system:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Becomes negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an endothermic reaction, the system absorbs heat from the surroundings, resulting in a higher enthalpy for the products than the reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents 'Standard State' conditions for enthalpy measurements?",
        "options": [
          "$1$ atm pressure and a specified temperature (usually $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$)",
          "$0$ atm pressure and $0$ K",
          "$100$ atm pressure and $100^{\\circ}\\text{C}$",
          "$1$ atm pressure and $0^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard enthalpy changes ($\\Delta H^{\\circ}$) are measured at $1$ atm and usually reported at $298.15$ K ($25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$) for comparison."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The enthalpy of vaporization ($\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$) for water is $40.7$ kJ/mol. What is $\\Delta H$ for the condensation of $1$ mole of water vapor?",
        "options": [
          "$-40.7$ kJ/mol",
          "$+40.7$ kJ/mol",
          "$-2260$ J",
          "$0$ kJ/mol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condensation is the reverse of vaporization. Since vaporization is endothermic ($+$), condensation must be exothermic ($-$) by the same magnitude."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a state function?",
        "options": [
          "Heat ($q$)",
          "Enthalpy ($H$)",
          "Internal Energy ($E$)",
          "Volume ($V$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat ($q$) depends on the path taken, whereas enthalpy ($H$) is a state function defined by the properties of the substance at a specific state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For most chemical reactions occurring in the liquid or solid phase, $\\Delta H$ is very close to $\\Delta E$. Why?",
        "options": [
          "The volume change ($\\Delta V$) is negligible, so $P\\Delta V$ work is near zero",
          "Liquids and solids have no internal energy",
          "Pressure is always zero for liquids",
          "Temperature does not change in liquid reactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $\\Delta H = \\Delta E + P\\Delta V$, if the volume change is very small (as it is for most non-gaseous reactions), the $P\\Delta V$ term vanishes and $\\Delta H \\approx \\Delta E$."
