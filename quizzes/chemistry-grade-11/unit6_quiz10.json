    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hess's Law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is:",
        "options": [
          "The same regardless of whether the reaction occurs in one step or several steps",
          "Dependent on the specific path taken by the molecules",
          "Equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of the reactants",
          "Always zero for a complete cycle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because enthalpy is a state function, the total change depends only on the initial and final states, not the intermediate pathway."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you reverse a chemical equation while applying Hess's Law, what must you do to its $\\Delta H$ value?",
        "options": [
          "Change the sign of $\\Delta H$",
          "Keep the $\\Delta H$ value exactly the same",
          "Square the $\\Delta H$ value",
          "Set the $\\Delta H$ value to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a forward reaction is exothermic, the reverse must be endothermic by the exact same magnitude."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you multiply the coefficients of a reaction by $3$ to align it with a target equation, what happens to the $\\Delta H$?",
        "options": [
          "The $\\Delta H$ value is multiplied by $3$",
          "The $\\Delta H$ value remains unchanged",
          "The $\\Delta H$ value is divided by $3$",
          "The $\\Delta H$ value is cubed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy is an extensive property; tripling the amount of reactants triples the total heat involved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is Hess's Law particularly useful in the laboratory?",
        "options": [
          "It allows us to calculate $\\Delta H$ for reactions that are too dangerous or slow to measure directly",
          "It allows us to ignore the law of conservation of energy",
          "It predicts the exact time a reaction will take to complete",
          "It eliminates the need for balanced chemical equations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Some reactions are impossible to perform in a calorimeter (like the formation of $CO$ without $CO_2$). Hess's Law lets us calculate their energy using reactions that *can* be measured."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Hess's Law problem, if a substance appears as a reactant in one step and a product in another with the same coefficient, what happens to it when the equations are added?",
        "options": [
          "It cancels out",
          "It is doubled in the final equation",
          "It is ignored in the $\\Delta H$ calculation only",
          "It turns into a catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like an algebraic variable appearing on both sides of an equals sign, intermediate species that are produced and then consumed cancel out of the net equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given: \\n1. $A \\rightarrow B \\quad \\Delta H = +100$ kJ \\n2. $B \\rightarrow C \\quad \\Delta H = -150$ kJ \\nWhat is $\\Delta H$ for $A \\rightarrow C$?",
        "options": [
          "$-50$ kJ",
          "$+250$ kJ",
          "$+50$ kJ",
          "$-250$ kJ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Summing the equations gives $A \\rightarrow C$. Summing the enthalpies: $100 + (-150) = -50$ kJ."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which principle forms the theoretical basis for Hess's Law?",
        "options": [
          "First Law of Thermodynamics",
          "Avogadro's Law",
          "Le Chatelier's Principle",
          "The Law of Definite Proportions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The First Law (Conservation of Energy) ensures that energy change is path-independent (a state function), which is the requirement for Hess's Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a target equation requires $2$ moles of $X$, but your given equation has $4$ moles of $X$, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Multiply the given equation and its $\\Delta H$ by $1/2$",
          "Multiply the given equation and its $\\Delta H$ by $2$",
          "Leave it alone and add it anyway",
          "Subtract $2$ moles from the $\\Delta H$ value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must manipulate the given steps so that they sum perfectly to the target; if you need half as much, you halve the energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If reaction 1 is endothermic ($+200$ kJ) and reaction 2 is highly exothermic ($-500$ kJ), the combined net reaction will be:",
        "options": [
          "Exothermic ($-300$ kJ)",
          "Endothermic ($+700$ kJ)",
          "Exothermic ($-700$ kJ)",
          "Endothermic ($+300$ kJ)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$200 + (-500) = -300$ kJ. A negative net $\\Delta H$ means the overall process is exothermic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When summing equations, the final net equation must match the target equation in which way?",
        "options": [
          "Exactly, including coefficients and physical states",
          "Only the reactants must match",
          "Only the products must match",
          "The states of matter do not matter as long as the formulas are correct"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because enthalpy depends on the state of matter, a target asking for $H_2O(g)$ cannot be solved using $H_2O(l)$ without an additional step for vaporization."
