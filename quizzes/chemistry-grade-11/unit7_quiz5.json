    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the essential 'bridge' required to convert from the mass of one substance to the mass of another in a chemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The mole ratio from the balanced equation",
          "The density of the substances",
          "Avogadro's number",
          "The total volume of the container"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To relate two different substances, you must use the coefficients from the balanced equation to create a mole-to-mole conversion factor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $2H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O$, what is the mole ratio of $H_2$ to $H_2O$?",
        "options": [
          "2 : 2 (or 1 : 1)",
          "2 : 1",
          "1 : 2",
          "4 : 2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficients are 2 for $H_2$ and 2 for $H_2O$. This means for every 2 moles of hydrogen consumed, 2 moles of water are produced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct sequence for a 'mass-to-mass' stoichiometry problem?",
        "options": [
          "Mass A $\\rightarrow$ Moles A $\\rightarrow$ Moles B $\\rightarrow$ Mass B",
          "Mass A $\\rightarrow$ Mass B $\\rightarrow$ Moles B",
          "Moles A $\\rightarrow$ Mass A $\\rightarrow$ Mass B $\\rightarrow$ Moles B",
          "Mass A $\\rightarrow$ Moles B $\\rightarrow$ Mass B"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must first convert the starting mass to moles, then use the mole ratio to find moles of the target substance, and finally convert those moles back to mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the balanced equation $N_2 + 3H_2 \\rightarrow 2NH_3$, how many moles of $NH_3$ can be produced from $6$ moles of $H_2$?",
        "options": [
          "4 moles",
          "2 moles",
          "6 moles",
          "12 moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ratio is $2$ moles $NH_3$ / $3$ moles $H_2$. So, $6\\text{ mol } H_2 \\cdot (2/3) = 4\\text{ moles } NH_3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are given the mass of a reactant and asked for the mass of a product, what is the first calculation you must perform?",
        "options": [
          "Divide the given mass by the molar mass of the reactant",
          "Multiply the given mass by the mole ratio",
          "Multiply the given mass by the molar mass of the product",
          "Divide the given mass by the volume of the solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first step in any stoichiometry problem starting with mass is to convert that mass into moles using the molar mass ($n = m/M$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $2Al + 3Cl_2 \\rightarrow 2AlCl_3$, how many grams of $AlCl_3$ ($M = 133.3\\text{ g/mol}$) are produced from $54.0$ g of $Al$ ($M = 27.0\\text{ g/mol}$)?",
        "options": [
          "266.6 g",
          "133.3 g",
          "54.0 g",
          "200.0 g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1. Moles $Al = 54/27 = 2\\text{ mol}$. 2. Ratio $Al$ to $AlCl_3$ is $2:2$ ($1:1$), so $2\\text{ mol } AlCl_3$ is produced. 3. Mass $= 2 \\cdot 133.3 = 266.6\\text{ g}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Law of Conservation of Mass implies that in a chemical reaction:",
        "options": [
          "The total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products",
          "The number of moles of reactants equals the number of moles of products",
          "The number of molecules always stays the same",
          "The volume of reactants equals the volume of products"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass cannot be created or destroyed; it is only rearranged. While moles and molecules may change, the total mass must remain constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you have $10.0$ g of $A$ and the mole ratio between $A$ and $B$ is $1:1$, why isn't the mass of $B$ produced also $10.0$ g?",
        "options": [
          "Because $A$ and $B$ likely have different molar masses",
          "Because the law of conservation of mass only applies to moles",
          "Because energy is converted into mass during the reaction",
          "Because some mass is always lost to the surroundings"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even if the mole count is the same, if one molecule is 'heavier' than the other, their masses will differ."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In stoichiometry, the coefficients in a balanced equation represent:",

          "The order in which reactants are added"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Coefficients define the molar proportions. They do not represent mass directly."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many grams of $O_2$ ($M = 32.0\\text{ g/mol}$) are needed to react completely with $2.0$ moles of $CH_4$ in the reaction: $CH_4 + 2O_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O$?",

          "64.0 g",
          "32.0 g",
          "16.0 g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1. Moles $CH_4 = 2.0$. 2. Ratio is $2 O_2$ per $1 CH_4$, so $4.0$ moles of $O_2$ are needed. 3. Mass $= 4.0 \\cdot 32.0 = 128.0\\text{ g}$."
