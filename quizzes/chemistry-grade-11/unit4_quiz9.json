        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The transition metal ion has vacant orbitals that accept electron pairs from ligands, making it a Lewis acid."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ligands are Lewis bases; they must have at least one lone pair of electrons to donate to the metal ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The number of donor atoms attached to the central metal ion is known as the:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bidentate ligands have two donor atoms that can simultaneously bind to the metal. Ethylenediamine uses two Nitrogen atoms to 'clamp' onto the metal."

          "Non-polar covalent bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A coordinate covalent bond occurs when both electrons in the shared pair come from the same atom (the ligand)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ligand that can bind to a metal ion through six donor atoms is called a:",

          "2",
          "6",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are four ammonia ligands, each donating one electron pair (monodentate), resulting in four coordinate bonds."

          "+4",
          "-4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cyanide ($CN^-$) has a -1 charge. Let $x$ be Fe: $x + 6(-1) = -4$, so $x = +2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Ligands that 'grip' the metal ion like a claw using multiple donor atoms are known as:",
