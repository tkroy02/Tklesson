    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements is most likely to form a stable molecule with an incomplete octet (fewer than 8 electrons)?",
        "options": [
          "Boron (B)",
          "Carbon (C)",
          "Oxygen (O)",
          "Fluorine (F)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boron and Beryllium often form stable compounds (like $BF_3$) where the central atom has only 6 or 4 electrons, respectively."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An 'expanded octet' can only occur in elements located in which part of the periodic table?",
        "options": [
          "Period 3 and below",
          "Period 2",
          "Group 1 and 2",
          "The Alkali Metals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elements in Period 3 and below have accessible $d$-orbitals in their valence shells, allowing them to accommodate more than 8 electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many electrons surround the Phosphorus atom in $PCl_5$?",
        "options": [
          "10",
          "8",
          "12",
          "5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $PCl_5$, Phosphorus forms five single bonds with Chlorine atoms, resulting in a total of 10 valence electrons (an expanded octet)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule contains an atom with an odd number of valence electrons (a free radical)?",
        "options": [
          "Nitrogen monoxide (NO)",
          "Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$)",
          "Water ($H_2O$)",
          "Methane ($CH_4$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen has 5 and Oxygen has 6 valence electrons, totaling 11. Since this is an odd number, the molecule cannot satisfy the octet rule for both atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can Nitrogen ($N$) NOT have an expanded octet, while Phosphorus ($P$) can?",
        "options": [
          "Nitrogen is in Period 2 and lacks available d-orbitals",
          "Nitrogen is more electronegative than Phosphorus",
          "Nitrogen has a smaller atomic mass",
          "Nitrogen only forms ionic bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expansion requires $d$-orbitals. Period 2 elements only have $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals, limiting them to a maximum of 8 electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the molecule $SF_6$, how many valence electrons are associated with the central Sulfur atom?",
        "options": [
          "12",
          "8",
          "10",
          "14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sulfur forms six single bonds with Fluorine, meaning it is surrounded by $6 \\times 2 = 12$ electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason some Period 3 elements expand their octet even when 8 electrons would suffice?",
        "options": [
          "To achieve formal charges closer to zero",
          "To increase the reactivity of the molecule",
          "To reduce the number of protons in the nucleus",
          "To satisfy the Duet Rule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In species like the sulfate ion ($SO_4^{2-}$), expanding the octet by forming double bonds can result in lower formal charges, making the structure more plausible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecules follows the octet rule perfectly for all atoms?",
        "options": [
          "$CCl_4$",
          "$XeF_4$",
          "$BF_3$",
          "$PCl_5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In Carbon Tetrachloride, Carbon and all four Chlorine atoms have exactly 8 electrons in their valence shells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The molecule $BeCl_2$ is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "An electron-deficient molecule",
          "An expanded octet",
          "A free radical",
          "An ionic lattice"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Beryllium in $BeCl_2$ has only 4 valence electrons, making it electron-deficient (incomplete octet)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which Xenon compound is a classic example of a noble gas with an expanded octet?",
        "options": [
          "$XeF_2$",
          "$XeHe$",
          "$Xe_2$",
          "$XeO$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Xenon can form several compounds like $XeF_2$, $XeF_4$, and $XeF_6$ where it accommodates 10, 12, or 14 electrons."
