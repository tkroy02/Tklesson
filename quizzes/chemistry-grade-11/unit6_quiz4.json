    "topic": "Conservation of energy in chemical systems",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the mathematical statement of the First Law of Thermodynamics?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta E = q + w$",
          "$\\Delta E = q - w$",
          "$\\Delta E = q \\cdot w$",
          "$\\Delta E = \\frac{q}{w}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The change in internal energy is the sum of the heat added to the system and the work done on the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Internal Energy' ($E$)?",
        "options": [
          "The sum of all kinetic and potential energies of all particles in the system",
          "Only the heat stored within the atomic nuclei",
          "The energy of the surroundings affecting the system",
          "The speed at which molecules move through space"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Internal energy account for translational, rotational, and vibrational kinetic energies, as well as the potential energy from chemical bonds and intermolecular forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system performs $50$ J of work on the surroundings and absorbs $100$ J of heat, what is $\\Delta E$?",
        "options": [
          "$+50$ J",
          "$-50$ J",
          "$+150$ J",
          "$-150$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat absorbed is positive ($+100$ J). Work done BY the system is negative ($-50$ J). $\\Delta E = 100 + (-50) = 50$ J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, the change in energy of the universe is always:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Increasing",
          "Decreasing",
          "Dependent on the temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Any energy lost by a system must be gained by the surroundings, making the total change in the universe zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a negative value for $\\Delta E$ ($\\Delta E < 0$) indicate?",
        "options": [
          "The system has lost energy to the surroundings",
          "The system has gained energy from the surroundings",
          "The reaction is endothermic",
          "The system has vanished"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative $\\Delta E$ means the final energy is lower than the initial energy, indicating a net release of energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When work is done ON the system by the surroundings (e.g., compression), what is the sign of $w$?",
        "options": [
          "Positive (+)",
          "Negative (-)",
          "Neutral (0)",
          "It depends on the pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the IUPAC convention used in chemistry, energy added to the system as work is positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system that releases heat to the surroundings has a:",
        "options": [
          "Negative $q$",
          "Positive $q$",
          "Positive $\\Delta E$ always",
          "Negative $w$ always"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat leaving the system is considered an output of energy, assigned a negative sign."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a process is 'adiabatic', it means that:",
        "options": [
          "$q = 0$ (no heat is exchanged)",
          "$w = 0$ (no work is done)",
          "$\\Delta E = 0$ (no energy change)",
          "The temperature is constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an adiabatic process, the system is so well insulated that no heat enters or leaves ($q = 0$); thus $\\Delta E = w$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would result in an increase in internal energy?",
        "options": [
          "The system absorbs heat and has work done on it",
          "The system releases heat and does work",
          "The system releases heat but has no work done",
          "The system does work while staying at a constant temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both positive $q$ and positive $w$ add energy to the system, increasing $\\Delta E$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Internal energy is a state function. This implies that:",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta E$ depends only on the initial and final states of the system",
          "Internal energy can never be measured",
          "The value of $q$ is always equal to $w$",
          "The path taken affects the total change in energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While $q$ and $w$ are path functions, their sum ($q+w$) is always the same for a specific change in state."
