    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Arrhenius theory, an acid is a substance that:",
        "options": [
          "Increases the concentration of $H^+$ ions in aqueous solution",
          "Donates a proton to another substance",
          "Accepts an electron pair to form a covalent bond",
          "Increases the concentration of $OH^-$ ions in aqueous solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Svante Arrhenius defined acids based on their ability to produce hydrogen ions ($H^+$) specifically when dissolved in water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the Brønsted-Lowry theory define a base?",
        "options": [
          "As a proton ($H^+$) acceptor",
          "As a proton ($H^+$) donor",
          "As an electron pair donor",
          "As a producer of $OH^-$ ions in water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Brønsted-Lowry theory expanded the definition beyond water, focusing on the transfer of protons ($H^+$) between substances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which theory provides the broadest definition of acids and bases by focusing on electron pairs?",
        "options": [
          "Lewis Theory",
          "Arrhenius Theory",
          "Brønsted-Lowry Theory",
          "Dalton Theory"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Lewis theory is the most inclusive because it describes acids as electron-pair acceptors and bases as electron-pair donors, even in the absence of protons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $NH_3 + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons NH_4^+ + OH^-$, water acts as a Brønsted-Lowry acid because it:",
        "options": [
          "Donates a proton ($H^+$) to $NH_3$",
          "Accepts a proton ($H^+$) from $NH_3$",
          "Produces $OH^-$ ions through dissociation",
          "Donates an electron pair to $NH_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water gives up a proton to the ammonia molecule, making water the proton donor (acid) and ammonia the proton acceptor (base)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a Lewis acid that does NOT contain hydrogen?",
        "options": [
          "$BF_3$",
          "$HCl$",
          "$NaOH$",
          "$NH_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boron trifluoride ($BF_3$) has an empty orbital that can accept an electron pair from a base like $NH_3$, making it a Lewis acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the common name for the $H_3O^+$ ion formed when an acid dissolves in water?",
        "options": [
          "Hydronium ion",
          "Hydroxide ion",
          "Hydrogen ion",
          "Hydride ion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In water, $H^+$ ions do not exist in isolation; they attach to water molecules to form $H_3O^+$, the hydronium ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An 'Amphoteric' substance is one that:",
        "options": [
          "Can act as either an acid or a base",
          "Can only exist in a vacuum",
          "Always produces a neutral solution",
          "Contains both metal and non-metal atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water is the most common amphoteric substance, as it can donate a proton (becoming $OH^-$) or accept a proton (becoming $H_3O^+$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Arrhenius theory is limited because it:",
        "options": [
          "Only applies to reactions occurring in aqueous solutions",
          "Cannot explain why $HCl$ is an acid",
          "Does not account for the mass of the proton",
          "Predicts that all bases must contain Nitrogen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Arrhenius's definition requires the presence of water, whereas Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis theories can describe gas-phase or non-aqueous reactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Lewis acid-base reaction, what type of bond is typically formed?",
        "options": [
          "Coordinate covalent bond",
          "Ionic bond",
          "Metallic bond",
          "Hydrogen bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A coordinate covalent bond (or dative bond) is formed when one atom provides both electrons for the shared pair."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a Brønsted-Lowry base but NOT an Arrhenius base?",
        "options": [
          "$NH_3$",
          "$NaOH$",
          "$KOH$",
          "$Ca(OH)_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ammonia ($NH_3$) can accept a proton (Brønsted-Lowry base) but does not contain an $OH^-$ group to release directly into solution (Arrhenius base)."
