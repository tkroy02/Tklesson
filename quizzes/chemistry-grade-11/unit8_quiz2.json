    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Inverse relationship at constant temperature",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following mathematical expressions represents Boyle's Law?",
        "options": [
          "$P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$",
          "$V_1 / T_1 = V_2 / T_2$",
          "$P_1 / T_1 = P_2 / T_2$",
          "$PV = nRT$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boyle's Law states that for a fixed amount of gas at constant temperature, the product of pressure and volume is a constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Boyle's Law describes an 'inverse relationship.' This means that as the volume of a gas increases, the pressure ________.",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Remains the same",
          "Doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an inverse relationship, one variable goes up while the other goes down. Expanding the volume gives particles more room, leading to fewer collisions and lower pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which two variables must be held constant for Boyle's Law to apply?",
        "options": [
          "Temperature and Amount of gas ($n$)",
          "Pressure and Temperature",
          "Volume and Amount of gas ($n$)",
          "Pressure and Volume"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the temperature changes or gas is added/removed, the simple inverse relationship between $P$ and $V$ no longer holds true."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sample of gas occupies $2.0$ L at $1.0$ atm. If the volume is compressed to $1.0$ L at constant temperature, what is the new pressure?",
        "options": [
          "2.0 atm",
          "0.5 atm",
          "1.0 atm",
          "4.0 atm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$: $(1.0\\text{ atm}) \\cdot (2.0\\text{ L}) = P_2 \\cdot (1.0\\text{ L})$. Solving for $P_2$ gives $2.0$ atm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you plot Pressure ($P$) versus Volume ($V$) for a gas obeying Boyle's Law, the resulting graph is a:",
        "options": [
          "Hyperbola (Curve)",
          "Straight line passing through the origin",
          "Horizontal line",
          "Vertical line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An inverse relationship produces a curve known as a hyperbola. However, a plot of $P$ versus $1/V$ would yield a straight line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the pressure of a gas if the volume is tripled at constant temperature?",
        "options": [
          "It is reduced to one-third of its original value",
          "It triples",
          "It remains the same",
          "It is reduced by half"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because they are inversely proportional, multiplying the volume by $3$ requires dividing the pressure by $3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the pressure of a gas increase when the volume is decreased?",
        "options": [
          "The gas particles collide with the walls of the container more frequently",
          "The gas particles grow in size",
          "The gas particles move faster at smaller volumes",
          "The gas particles attract each other more strongly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decreasing the volume crowds the particles into a smaller space, increasing the frequency of collisions with the walls."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which real-world example best illustrates Boyle's Law?",
        "options": [
          "The operation of a bicycle pump or a syringe",
          "A hot air balloon rising in the air",
          "A car tire appearing flat on a cold morning",
          "A soda can exploding when left in a hot car"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a syringe, pushing the plunger reduces the volume, which increases the pressure to expel the liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $P_1V_1 = k$, what does 'k' represent?",
        "options": [
          "A constant value for a specific sample of gas at a specific temperature",
          "The Kelvin temperature",
          "The Ideal Gas Constant",
          "The number of moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$k$ is the proportionality constant that remains unchanged as long as $T$ and $n$ are constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balloon with a volume of $4.0$ L at a pressure of $100$ kPa is taken underwater where the pressure is $200$ kPa. What is the new volume?",
        "options": [
          "2.0 L",
          "8.0 L",
          "4.0 L",
          "1.0 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(100) \\cdot (4.0) = (200) \\cdot V_2$. $V_2 = 400 / 200 = 2.0$ L."
