    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the trend of chemical reactivity for Alkali Metals (Group 1) as you move down the group?",
        "options": [
          "Reactivity increases because ionization energy decreases",
          "Reactivity decreases because the atomic mass increases",
          "Reactivity increases because electronegativity increases",
          "Reactivity remains constant because they all have one valence electron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As you go down Group 1, the valence electron is further from the nucleus and more shielded, making it easier to lose and increasing reactivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Halogen group (Group 17), which element is the most reactive?",
        "options": [
          "Fluorine (F)",
          "Chlorine (Cl)",
          "Iodine (I)",
          "Astatine (At)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluorine is the most reactive non-metal because its small size and high effective nuclear charge give it the strongest attraction for an additional electron."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are Noble Gases (Group 18) generally chemically inert?",
        "options": [
          "They have a completely filled valence shell (stable octet)",
          "They are too heavy to move and react with other atoms",
          "They have zero protons in their nucleus",
          "They only exist in the solid state at room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A full $s$ and $p$ subshell represents a very low-energy, stable configuration, meaning noble gases have little tendency to gain or lose electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements would react most vigorously with water?",
        "options": [
          "Cesium (Cs)",
          "Sodium (Na)",
          "Lithium (Li)",
          "Magnesium (Mg)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cesium is further down Group 1 than Sodium or Lithium; its extremely low ionization energy allows it to lose its electron explosively in water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As you move from left to right across a period, the metallic character of elements:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Increases then decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metallic character is the tendency to lose electrons. Across a period, ionization energy increases, making it harder to lose electrons and favoring non-metallic behavior."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which block of the periodic table contains the most reactive metals?",
        "options": [
          "s-block",
          "p-block",
          "d-block",
          "f-block"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $s$-block contains Group 1 and 2, which have the lowest ionization energies and therefore the highest metallic reactivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the reactivity of non-metals as you move down a group?",
        "options": [
          "It generally decreases",
          "It generally increases",
          "It remains exactly the same",
          "It depends on the number of neutrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non-metals react by gaining electrons. Moving down a group, the increasing radius and shielding make it harder for the nucleus to attract new electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Metalloids, found along the 'staircase' of the periodic table, exhibit properties that are:",
        "options": [
          "Intermediate between metals and non-metals",
          "Identical to noble gases",
          "Always highly radioactive",
          "Liquid at room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metalloids like Silicon and Germanium have physical and chemical properties that are a mix of metallic and non-metallic characteristics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of transition metals (d-block) compared to main-group metals?",
        "options": [
          "They often form colored compounds and have multiple oxidation states",
          "They are much more reactive than alkali metals",
          "They never conduct electricity or heat",
          "They only have one valence electron in all cases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Transition metals are unique because their $d$-electrons can participate in bonding, leading to various charges and complex, colored ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Predict the most likely charge for an ion of an element in Group 16.",
        "options": [
          "2-",
          "2+",
          "6+",
          "1-"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Group 16 elements have 6 valence electrons and need to gain 2 more to achieve a stable octet, resulting in a $2-$ charge."
