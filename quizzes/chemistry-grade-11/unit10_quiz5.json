    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Galvanic cell, at which electrode does oxidation always occur?",
        "options": [
          "Anode",
          "Cathode",
          "Salt bridge",
          "Voltmeter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A helpful mnemonic is 'An Ox' (Anode Oxidation) and 'Red Cat' (Reduction Cathode)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of a salt bridge in a Galvanic cell?",
        "options": [
          "To maintain electrical neutrality by allowing ions to flow",
          "To provide a path for electrons to travel between electrodes",
          "To increase the speed of the chemical reaction",
          "To prevent the two solutions from ever touching"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As electrons move, charge builds up. The salt bridge allows anions and cations to migrate, balancing the charge so the reaction can continue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which direction do electrons flow through the external wire in a Voltaic cell?",
        "options": [
          "From the Anode to the Cathode",
          "From the Cathode to the Anode",
          "From the Salt Bridge to the Anode",
          "Through the solution directly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation (loss of electrons) happens at the anode, so electrons start there and travel to the cathode where reduction (gain of electrons) occurs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a standard Galvanic cell, the Cathode is assigned a ________ charge.",
        "options": [
          "Positive (+)",
          "Negative (-)",
          "Neutral",
          "Variable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a Galvanic cell, the cathode is the positive terminal because it 'pulls' the negative electrons toward it for the reduction reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the mass of the Anode as a Galvanic cell operates (assuming it is a metal electrode)?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases",
          "It increases",
          "It remains constant",
          "It doubles immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the metal atoms at the anode are oxidized into aqueous ions ($M \\rightarrow M^{n+} + ne^{-}$), the solid electrode physically dissolves over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'spontaneous' reaction in the context of a Galvanic cell?",
        "options": [
          "A reaction that occurs naturally and produces electrical energy",
          "A reaction that requires an external battery to proceed",
          "A reaction that produces heat but no electricity",
          "A reaction that involves only noble gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Galvanic cells harness energy from reactions that want to happen on their own ($E_{cell} > 0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Standard Hydrogen Electrode' (SHE) is used in electrochemistry as a:",
        "options": [
          "Reference point with a potential defined as 0.00 V",
          "Source of unlimited protons",
          "Safety valve for pressure",
          "Filter for impurities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since we cannot measure the potential of a single half-cell, we compare everything to the SHE to build the standard reduction potential table."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are using a platinum wire as an electrode because the reactants are both aqueous (e.g., $Fe^{2+}$ and $Fe^{3+}$), the platinum is called a/an:",
        "options": [
          "Inert electrode",
          "Active electrode",
          "Reducing agent",
          "Salt bridge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An inert electrode conducts electrons but does not participate in the chemical reaction itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In cell notation, such as $Zn(s) | Zn^{2+}(aq) || Cu^{2+}(aq) | Cu(s)$, what does the double vertical line ($||$) represent?",
        "options": [
          "The salt bridge",
          "A phase boundary",
          "The voltmeter",
          "The wire"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Single lines represent a change in phase (solid to liquid), while the double line represents the physical separation/junction maintained by the salt bridge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would happen to the voltage of a Galvanic cell if the salt bridge were removed?",
        "options": [
          "The voltage would drop to zero immediately",
          "The voltage would double",
          "The voltage would stay the same but the cell would get hot",
          "The electrons would flow through the air instead"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without the salt bridge, charge would build up instantly, creating an opposing force that stops the flow of electrons and kills the current."
