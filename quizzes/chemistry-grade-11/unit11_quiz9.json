    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'Reaction Mechanism'?",
        "options": [
          "The series of elementary steps by which a chemical reaction occurs",
          "The balanced equation showing the final products only",
          "The mechanical stirring of a reaction mixture",
          "The list of catalysts used in a high-pressure reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A mechanism provides a detailed, step-by-step description of exactly which bonds break and form, and in what order."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An 'Elementary Step' is a reaction step that:",
        "options": [
          "Occurs in a single collision exactly as written in its equation",
          "Includes all reactants and products from the overall balanced equation",
          "Must be broken down into smaller sub-steps",
          "Always involves only one molecule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike the overall equation, an elementary step describes a single molecular event."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an **elementary step**, the exponents in the rate law are:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants in that step",
          "Always equal to 1",
          "Determined only by experimental trial and error",
          "Equal to the coefficients of the products"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a key rule: because an elementary step represents a single collision, its rate is directly proportional to the collision frequency of its specific reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'Reaction Intermediate'?",
        "options": [
          "A species that is produced in one step and consumed in a later step",
          "A substance that is present at the start and the end of the reaction",
          "A high-energy state at the peak of an activation energy hill",
          "A reactant that is added in the middle of the process"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intermediates are temporary; they do not appear in the overall balanced equation because they are created and then 'used up' during the mechanism."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Rate-Determining Step' of a mechanism is:",
        "options": [
          "The slowest step in the sequence",
          "The first step in the sequence",
          "The step with the lowest activation energy",
          "The step that produces the final product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like a bottleneck on a highway, the slowest step limits the overall speed at which the reaction can proceed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Molecularity' of the elementary step: $A + B \\rightarrow Products$?",
        "options": [
          "Bimolecular",
          "Unimolecular",
          "Termolecular",
          "Zero-molecular"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecularity is the number of reactant species involved in the step. Two molecules colliding is a bimolecular step."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are 'Termolecular' elementary steps extremely rare?",
        "options": [
          "The probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously with correct orientation is very low",
          "Three molecules cannot fit in a small space",
          "They require zero activation energy",
          "They only occur in solid-state reactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most reactions occur through unimolecular or bimolecular steps because three-body collisions are statistically highly improbable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a two-step mechanism, if Step 1 is slow and Step 2 is fast, the overall rate law for the reaction is determined by:",
        "options": [
          "The rate law of Step 1",
          "The rate law of Step 2",
          "The sum of the rate laws of Step 1 and Step 2",
          "The concentration of the products only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the first step is the bottleneck (slow), the whole reaction waits for it to finish. Therefore, the rate law of the slow step is the rate law of the reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you obtain the 'Overall Reaction' from a proposed mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "By adding all the elementary steps and canceling out intermediates",
          "By multiplying the steps together",
          "By looking at the rate-determining step only",
          "By ignoring the reactants and focusing on the catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Summing the steps shows the net transformation. Any species appearing as both a product and a reactant in different steps (intermediates) cancels out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A proposed mechanism is considered 'valid' if:",
        "options": [
          "The steps sum to the overall reaction AND the predicted rate law matches experimental data",
          "The reaction is exothermic",
          "It contains at least three intermediates",
          "It uses a catalyst in every step"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A mechanism is a hypothesis. It must account for the observed stoichiometry and the mathematically determined rate law."
