    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the MO diagrams for $B_2$, $C_2$, and $N_2$, why is the $\\pi_{2p}$ bonding orbital lower in energy than the $\\sigma_{2p}$ bonding orbital?",
        "options": [
          "Significant mixing between the $2s$ and $2p_z$ atomic orbitals",
          "The $\\pi$ bonds are inherently stronger than $\\sigma$ bonds",
          "The atoms have too few electrons to fill a $\\sigma$ orbital",
          "Stronger electron-electron repulsion in the $\\sigma$ system"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For these lighter elements, the energy gap between $2s$ and $2p$ is small enough that their wave functions mix, pushing the $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital higher in energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the ground-state electron configuration for the $B_2$ molecule?",
        "options": [
          "$(\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s}^*)^2 (\\pi_{2p})^2$",
          "$(\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s}^*)^2 (\\sigma_{2p})^2$",

          "$(\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\pi_{2p})^4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boron has 3 valence electrons ($2s^2 2p^1$), totaling 6 for $B_2$. The electrons fill the $2s$ MOs first, then the degenerate $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on its MO diagram, why is $B_2$ paramagnetic?",
        "options": [
          "It has two unpaired electrons in the degenerate $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals",
          "It has an odd number of total electrons",
          "The $\\sigma_{2s}^*$ orbital is only half-filled",
          "All its electrons are in anti-bonding orbitals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Hund's rule, the two electrons in the $\\pi_{2p}$ level occupy separate orbitals with parallel spins, creating a magnetic moment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the bond order of the $C_2$ molecule?",

          "1",
          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$C_2$ has 8 valence electrons: 2 in $\\sigma_{2s}$, 2 in $\\sigma_{2s}^*$, and 4 in $\\pi_{2p}$. Bond order = $\\frac{1}{2}(6 - 2) = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule has the highest bond dissociation energy and the shortest bond length among these three?",
        "options": [
          "$N_2$",
          "$C_2$",
          "$B_2$",
          "They all have the same bond length"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$N_2$ has a bond order of 3 (a triple bond), which results in a very strong and short bond compared to $B_2$ (order 1) and $C_2$ (order 2)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the MO configuration of $N_2$, which orbital is the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sigma_{2p}$",
          "$\\pi_{2p}$",
          "$\\pi_{2p}^*$",
          "$\\sigma_{2s}^*$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $N_2$, the 10 valence electrons fill up to the $\\sigma_{2p}$ level, which is the last filled orbital in the diagram."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If we remove one electron from $N_2$ to form the $N_2^+$ ion, what happens to the bond order?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases to 2.5",
          "It increases to 3.5",
          "It remains 3",
          "The bond becomes twice as strong"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electron is removed from the $\\sigma_{2p}$ bonding orbital. Bond order becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(7 - 2) = 2.5$, making the bond slightly weaker than neutral $N_2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the $C_2$ molecule's magnetic property according to MO theory?",

          "Diamagnetic",
          "Paramagnetic",
          "Ferromagnetic",
          "Non-magnetic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All 8 valence electrons in $C_2$ are paired within the $\\sigma_{2s}$, $\\sigma_{2s}^*$, and $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals, so it is not attracted to a magnetic field."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The $s-p$ mixing that occurs in $B_2$ is less significant in heavier molecules like $O_2$ because:",
        "options": [
          "The energy gap between the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals increases",
          "Oxygen has no $2s$ electrons",
          "The $2p$ orbitals are already full",
          "Oxygen is a larger atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As nuclear charge increases, the $2s$ orbital is pulled closer to the nucleus much more than the $2p$, making them too different in energy to mix effectively."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many pi ($\\pi$) bonds are effectively present in the $N_2$ molecule according to MO theory?",

          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are 4 electrons in the $\\pi_{2p}$ bonding orbitals and 0 in the $\\pi_{2p}^*$ anti-bonding orbitals, resulting in 2 net $\\pi$ bonds within the triple bond."
