      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $aA + bB \\rightleftharpoons cC + dD$, what is the correct equilibrium expression ($K_{c}$)?",
        "options": [
          "K_{c} = [C]^{c}[D]^{d} / [A]^{a}[B]^{b}",
          "K_{c} = [A]^{a}[B]^{b} / [C]^{c}[D]^{d}",
          "K_{c} = (c[C] \\cdot d[D]) / (a[A] \\cdot b[B])",
          "K_{c} = [C][D] / [A][B]"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equilibrium constant is always products over reactants, with each concentration raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient."

        "question": "Which of the following are **omitted** from an equilibrium constant expression?",
        "options": [
          "Pure solids and pure liquids",
          "Gases and aqueous solutions",
          "Catalysts and intermediates",
          "Weak acids and weak bases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The concentrations of pure solids and pure liquids are essentially constant and do not change as the reaction proceeds, so they are not included in the $K$ expression."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct $K_{c}$ expression for the reaction: $CaCO_{3}(s) \\rightleftharpoons CaO(s) + CO_{2}(g)$?",
        "options": [
          "K_{c} = [CO_{2}]",
          "K_{c} = [CaO][CO_{2}] / [CaCO_{3}]",
          "K_{c} = 1 / [CO_{2}]",
          "K_{c} = [CaO] / [CaCO_{3}]"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $CaCO_{3}$ and $CaO$ are solids, they are omitted. Only the gaseous $CO_{2}$ is included."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3}(g)$, what is the $K_{c}$ expression?",
        "options": [

          "K_{c} = 2[NH_{3}] / ([N_{2}] + 3[H_{2}])"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The products are in the numerator and the reactants in the denominator. The coefficients (2 for $NH_{3}$ and 3 for $H_{2}$) become exponents."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you multiply the coefficients of a balanced chemical equation by a factor of 2, what happens to the value of the equilibrium constant $K$?",
        "options": [
          "The new K is the square of the original K ($K_{new} = K_{orig}^{2}$)",
          "The new K is double the original K ($K_{new} = 2K_{orig}$)",
          "The new K remains exactly the same",
          "The new K is the square root of the original K"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the coefficients become exponents in the $K$ expression, doubling the coefficients squares every term in the ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction involving different phases (e.g., a solid and a gas) is known as a:",

        "options": [
          "K_{c} = [H_{2}]^{2}[O_{2}]",
          "K_{c} = [H_{2}]^{2}[O_{2}] / [H_{2}O]^{2}",

          "K_{c} = [H_{2}] + [O_{2}]"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water is in the liquid phase here, so it is excluded from the expression. Only the gaseous products remain."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the $K_{p}$ expression for $2SO_{2}(g) + O_{2}(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2SO_{3}(g)$, the term for $SO_{2}$ would be written as:",
        "options": [
          "(P_{SO_{2}})^{2} in the denominator",
          "(P_{SO_{2}})^{2} in the numerator",
          "[SO_{2}]^{2} in the denominator",
          "2 \\cdot P_{SO_{2}} in the denominator"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$SO_{2}$ is a reactant, so it goes in the denominator. The coefficient 2 becomes an exponent for the partial pressure."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When writing an expression for an aqueous reaction like $HF(aq) + H_{2}O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^{+}(aq) + F^{-}(aq)$, why is $H_{2}O$ omitted?",
        "options": [
          "It is the solvent and its concentration is effectively constant",
          "It is a reactant and only products are used",
          "It has a molarity of zero",
          "Aqueous reactions do not involve water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In dilute aqueous solutions, the concentration of water is approximately $55.5 M$ and does not change significantly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the equilibrium constant for $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ is $K_{1}$, and for $B \\rightleftharpoons C$ is $K_{2}$, what is the constant for the net reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons C$?",
        "options": [
