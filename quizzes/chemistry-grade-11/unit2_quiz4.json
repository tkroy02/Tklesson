        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is core notation (noble gas notation) used in chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "To emphasize the valence electrons which are responsible for chemical behavior",
          "To show that noble gases are highly reactive",
          "To account for the mass of the nucleus",
          "To indicate the number of isotopes present"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since inner electrons rarely change during reactions, shorthand notation allows chemists to focus on the valence electrons that drive bonding."
