    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Liquid properties from intermolecular forces",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Surface Tension'?",
        "options": [
          "The energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid",
          "The pressure exerted by the liquid on its container walls",
          "The resistance of a liquid to flowing",
          "The force that pulls a liquid up a thin tube"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Surface tension results from an imbalance of intermolecular forces at the surface, where molecules are pulled inward, causing the liquid to behave as if it has a 'skin'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following substances would you expect to have the highest surface tension?",
        "options": [
          "Water ($H_2O$)",
          "Gasoline ($C_8H_{18}$)",
          "Ethyl alcohol ($C_2H_5OH$)",
          "Methane ($CH_4$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water has very strong hydrogen bonds. Stronger intermolecular forces lead to higher surface tension."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A liquid's resistance to flow is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Viscosity",
          "Capillary Action",
          "Vapor Pressure",
          "Volatility"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Viscosity is the internal friction of a liquid. Liquids like honey or motor oil have high viscosity because their molecules do not slide past each other easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the temperature usually affect the viscosity of a liquid?",
        "options": [
          "Viscosity decreases",
          "Viscosity increases",
          "Viscosity remains constant",
          "The liquid becomes a solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules, allowing them to overcome attractive forces more easily and flow faster."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of force exists between like molecules (e.g., water and water)?",
        "options": [
          "Cohesive forces",
          "Adhesive forces",
          "Frictional forces",
          "Magnetic forces"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cohesion is the attraction between identical molecules. Adhesion is the attraction between different types of molecules, such as water and glass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a glass graduated cylinder, water forms a concave (curved downward) meniscus. This is because:",
        "options": [
          "Adhesive forces between water and glass are stronger than cohesive forces",
          "Cohesive forces are stronger than adhesive forces",
          "The water is evaporating rapidly",
          "Gravity is pulling the center of the water down"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water 'climbs' the walls of the glass because it is more attracted to the polar Si-O bonds in glass than to itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mercury forms a convex (curved upward) meniscus in glass. What does this tell you?",
        "options": [
          "Cohesive forces within mercury are stronger than adhesive forces to glass",
          "Mercury has no surface tension",
          "Mercury is less dense than water",
          "Mercury is a polar molecule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mercury atoms are more strongly attracted to each other (metallic bonding) than they are to the glass, so they pull away from the walls."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Capillary action is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The rise of a liquid in a narrow tube due to adhesive and cohesive forces",
          "The process of a liquid turning into a gas",
          "The movement of electrons through a metal",
          "The pressure of a gas above a liquid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capillary action occurs when adhesion to the walls of a narrow tube pulls the liquid up, while cohesion keeps the liquid column intact."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecular shapes would likely lead to higher viscosity in a non-polar substance?",
        "options": [
          "Long, tangled chains",
          "Small, spherical molecules",
          "Single atoms",
          "Diatomic molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Longer molecules can become entangled like spaghetti, making it harder for them to slide past each other compared to small, round molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do raindrops form spherical shapes?",
        "options": [
          "Surface tension minimizes the surface area of the drop",
          "The air pressure is equal on all sides",
          "Gravity pulls them into a circle",
          "The molecules are trying to get away from the air"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A sphere has the smallest surface area for a given volume. Surface tension pulls the water inward to achieve this state of lowest energy."
