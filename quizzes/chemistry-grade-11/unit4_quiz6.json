    "topic": "Predicting properties from molecular orbitals",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the mathematical formula for calculating Bond Order in Molecular Orbital Theory?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Bonding } e^- - \\text{Anti-bonding } e^-)$",
          "$\\text{Bonding } e^- + \\text{Anti-bonding } e^-$",
          "$\\frac{\\text{Bonding } e^-}{\\text{Anti-bonding } e^-}$",
          "$\\text{Total } e^- / 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond order is half the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals and anti-bonding orbitals. It represents the net number of electron pairs holding the atoms together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'paramagnetic' substance?",
        "options": [
          "It contains unpaired electrons and is attracted to a magnetic field",
          "It contains only paired electrons and is repelled by a magnetic field",
          "It has a bond order of exactly zero",
          "It can only exist in the presence of an electric current"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Paramagnetism occurs when unpaired electrons are present. The magnetic moments of these electrons align with an external field, creating an attraction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a molecule has a bond order of 2.5, it is expected to be:",
        "options": [
          "Stronger than a double bond but weaker than a triple bond",
          "Weaker than a single bond",
          "Exactly as strong as a triple bond",
          "Unstable and non-existent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond strength increases directly with bond order. A 2.5 bond order falls between a double (2) and triple (3) bond in terms of energy and length."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which relationship between bond order and bond length is correct?",
        "options": [
          "As bond order increases, bond length decreases",
          "As bond order increases, bond length increases",
          "Bond order and bond length are not related",
          "Bond length is always half of the bond order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher bond orders mean more electron density between the nuclei, pulling them closer together and resulting in a shorter bond length."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following species is diamagnetic?",
        "options": [
          "$N_2$",
          "$O_2$",
          "$B_2$",
          "$O_2^{2-}$ (Peroxide ion)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen has 10 valence electrons, all of which are paired in bonding orbitals. While the peroxide ion is also diamagnetic, $N_2$ is the most common example in neutral diatomic molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the magnetic property of $O_2$ if it is ionized to $O_2^{2-}$?",
        "options": [
          "It changes from paramagnetic to diamagnetic",
          "It changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic",
          "It remains paramagnetic",
          "It remains diamagnetic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen ($O_2$) has two unpaired electrons in its $\\pi^*$ orbitals. Adding two electrons to form $O_2^{2-}$ pairs them up, making the ion diamagnetic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comparing $N_2$ and $N_2^+$, which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "$N_2$ has a shorter bond and is diamagnetic",
          "$N_2^+$ has a shorter bond and is paramagnetic",
          "They have the same bond length",
          "$N_2$ is paramagnetic and $N_2^+$ is diamagnetic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$N_2$ (bond order 3) is stronger/shorter than $N_2^+$ (bond order 2.5). $N_2$ has all paired electrons, while $N_2^+$ has one unpaired electron."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance that is weakly repelled by a magnetic field is called:",
        "options": [
          "Diamagnetic",
          "Paramagnetic",
          "Ferromagnetic",
          "Electromagnetic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diamagnetism is a property of all matter, but it is only observed when all electrons are paired. It results in a very weak repulsion from a magnetic field."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does removing an electron from an anti-bonding orbital affect the molecule?",
        "options": [
          "The bond order increases and the molecule becomes more stable",
          "The bond order decreases and the molecule becomes less stable",
          "The bond order remains the same",
          "The molecule immediately dissociates into atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because anti-bonding electrons work against the bond, removing them increases the net bond order and strengthens the molecule (e.g., $O_2$ to $O_2^+$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following has the highest bond dissociation energy?",
        "options": [
          "$N_2$ (Bond order 3)",
          "$O_2$ (Bond order 2)",
          "$F_2$ (Bond order 1)",
          "$H_2$ (Bond order 1)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond. Nitrogen's triple bond is exceptionally strong due to its high bond order."
