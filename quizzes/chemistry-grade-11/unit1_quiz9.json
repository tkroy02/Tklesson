    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which principle states that electrons must occupy the lowest energy orbital available before filling higher energy levels?",
        "options": [
          "The Aufbau Principle",
          "Hund's Rule",
          "The Pauli Exclusion Principle",
          "The Heisenberg Principle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Aufbau principle (from German for 'building up') dictates the sequence in which subshells are filled based on their relative energy levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Hund's Rule, how should electrons be placed in a set of degenerate orbitals (orbitals of equal energy)?",
        "options": [
          "One electron enters each orbital with parallel spins before any pairing occurs",
          "Electrons must pair up in the first orbital before moving to the next",
          "Electrons are placed randomly regardless of spin",
          "Only one electron can ever occupy a subshell at a time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hund's rule minimizes electron-electron repulsion by spreading electrons across degenerate orbitals with the same spin before pairing them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in the same atom can:",
        "options": [
          "Have the same set of four quantum numbers",
          "Occupying the same principal shell",
          "Have the same mass",
          "Exist in the same energy level"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If two electrons occupy the same orbital, they share three quantum numbers ($n, l, m_l$); therefore, they must have opposite spins ($m_s$) to remain unique."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In multi-electron atoms, why does the $4s$ orbital fill before the $3d$ orbital?",
        "options": [
          "The $4s$ orbital is lower in energy due to better penetration",
          "The $4s$ orbital can hold more electrons than the $3d$",
          "The $4s$ orbital is physically smaller than the $3d$",
          "The principal quantum number $n$ is the only factor in energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to the $(n+l)$ rule and orbital penetration, the $4s$ orbital ($4+0=4$) is lower in energy than the $3d$ orbital ($3+2=5$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the $n=3$ principal energy level?",
        "options": [
          "18",
          "8",
          "10",
          "32"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the formula $2n^2$, for $n=3$, the capacity is $2(3^2) = 18$ electrons (across $3s, 3p,$ and $3d$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements is a common exception to the Aufbau filling order to achieve a half-filled d-subshell?",
        "options": [
          "Chromium (Cr)",
          "Calcium (Ca)",
          "Iron (Fe)",
          "Zinc (Zn)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chromium adopts the $[\\text{Ar}] 4s^1 3d^5$ configuration because the half-filled d-subshell provides extra stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'degenerate' in quantum mechanics refers to orbitals that have:",
        "options": [
          "The same energy",
          "The same shape",
          "Opposite spins",
          "No electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Orbitals within the same subshell (like the three $2p$ orbitals) are degenerate, meaning they are at the same energy level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'shielding effect' describes how inner electrons:",
        "options": [
          "Reduce the effective nuclear charge felt by outer electrons",
          "Increase the attraction between the nucleus and valence shell",
          "Cause the atom to shrink in size",
          "Prevent the electron from having a spin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Core electrons repel outer electrons, effectively 'shielding' them from the full positive charge of the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many electrons are required to completely fill a $d$-subshell?",
        "options": [
          "10",
          "2",
          "6",
          "14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A $d$-subshell ($l=2$) has 5 orbitals. Since each orbital holds 2 electrons, the total capacity is 10."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An atom is in an 'excited state' if:",
        "options": [
          "One or more electrons have moved to a higher energy orbital",
          "It has gained an extra proton",
          "All its orbitals are half-filled",
          "It is at its lowest possible energy level"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When energy is absorbed, an electron can jump to a higher subshell, leaving the 'ground state' and entering an 'excited state'."
