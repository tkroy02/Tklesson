      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the role of a catalyst in a chemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It provides a new reaction pathway with a lower activation energy",
          "It increases the total kinetic energy of the reactant molecules",
          "It shifts the equilibrium position to favor the products",
          "It is a reactant that is consumed to produce more heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A catalyst lowers the energy barrier ($E_{a}$), allowing more molecules to have successful collisions at a given temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'Homogeneous Catalyst'?",
        "options": [
          "A catalyst that exists in the same phase as the reactants",
          "A catalyst that is in a different phase from the reactants",
          "A catalyst that only works in the solid state",
          "A catalyst that is made of the same element as the products"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the reactants are aqueous and the catalyst is also dissolved in the liquid, the catalysis is considered homogeneous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An example of 'Heterogeneous Catalysis' is:",
        "options": [
          "Gaseous exhaust reacting on the surface of a solid platinum catalytic converter",
          "Iodine ions speeding up the decomposition of aqueous hydrogen peroxide",
          "Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of sugar in water",
          "Enzymes breaking down starch in human saliva"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a catalytic converter, gas-phase reactants interact with a solid-phase catalyst. This difference in phases defines it as heterogeneous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can you identify a catalyst in a multi-step reaction mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "It is present as a reactant in an early step and reappears as a product in a later step",
          "It is produced in the first step and consumed in the second step",
          "It is the substance with the highest stoichiometric coefficient",
          "It is always a gas, regardless of the other reactants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike an intermediate (which is made then used), a catalyst is used then remade, resulting in no net consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the Enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$) of a reaction when a catalyst is added?",
        "options": [
          "It remains unchanged",
          "It decreases (becomes more exothermic)",
          "It increases (becomes more endothermic)",
          "It becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts only affect the kinetics (rate) of the reaction. The energy difference between the initial reactants and final products (thermodynamics) stays the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The process of a reactant molecule sticking to the surface of a solid catalyst is called:",
        "options": [
          "Adsorption",
          "Absorption",
          "Desorption",
          "Activation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adsorption is the binding of molecules to a surface, which is the first critical step in heterogeneous catalysis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a catalyst increase the rate constant $k$ in the Arrhenius equation?",
        "options": [
          "By decreasing the value of $E_{a}$",
          "By increasing the temperature $T$",
          "By increasing the value of $R$",
          "By decreasing the frequency factor $A$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Looking at $k = Ae^{-E_{a}/RT}$, as $E_{a}$ gets smaller, the negative exponent becomes less negative, making $k$ larger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an 'Enzyme'?",
        "options": [
          "A large protein molecule that acts as a biological catalyst",
          "A type of metal used in industrial electrolysis",
          "A reactant that slows down dangerous reactions",
          "A byproduct of incomplete combustion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enzymes are highly efficient and specific catalysts found in living organisms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true about a catalyst at the end of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It is chemically unchanged and can be reused",
          "It has been converted into a product",
          "It has been completely consumed by the reaction",
          "It has changed from a solid to a gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "One of the defining features of a catalyst is that it is not a reactant in the traditional sense; it emerges from the reaction in its original form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Catalyst Poisoning'?",
        "options": [
          "When a substance binds permanently to a catalyst, making it ineffective",
          "When a catalyst becomes too powerful and causes an explosion",
          "When a catalyst turns into a toxic gas",
          "When the products of a reaction react with the catalyst to form water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Impurities can sometimes block the active sites on a catalyst surface, preventing the reactants from adsorbing and effectively 'killing' the catalyst's activity."
