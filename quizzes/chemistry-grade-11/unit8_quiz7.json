    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct formula to calculate the Molar Mass ($M$) of a gas using the Ideal Gas Law variables?",
        "options": [
          "$M = mRT / PV$",
          "$M = PV / mRT$",
          "$M = mPV / RT$",
          "$M = RT / mPV$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $n = m/M$, substituting this into $PV = nRT$ and solving for $M$ gives $M = mRT/PV$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for the density ($d$) of an ideal gas?",
        "options": [
          "$d = MP / RT$",
          "$d = MRT / P$",
          "$d = P / MRT$",
          "$d = RT / MP$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density is mass/volume ($m/V$). Rearranging the Ideal Gas Law gives $m/V = MP/RT$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the temperature of a gas at constant pressure affect its density?",
        "options": [
          "The density decreases",
          "The density increases",
          "The density remains the same",
          "The density doubles every 10 degrees"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to $d = MP/RT$, temperature is in the denominator. As $T$ increases, volume increases (Charles's Law), so the same mass occupies more space, lowering density."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the density of Helium ($M = 4.00$ g/mol) at STP? (STP: $1.00$ atm, $273$ K, $R = 0.0821$)",
        "options": [
          "0.179 g/L",
          "1.25 g/L",
          "4.00 g/L",
          "22.4 g/L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$d = (4.00 \\cdot 1.00) / (0.0821 \\cdot 273) \\approx 0.179$ g/L. Alternatively, $4.00\\text{ g} / 22.4\\text{ L} = 0.179$ g/L."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2.00$ L flask contains $4.40$ g of an unknown gas at STP. What is the molar mass of the gas?",
        "options": [
          "49.3 g/mol",
          "22.0 g/mol",
          "44.0 g/mol",
          "2.20 g/mol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At STP, $1$ mole $= 22.4$ L. Moles in flask $= 2.00 / 22.4 = 0.0893$ mol. $M = 4.40\\text{ g} / 0.0893\\text{ mol} \\approx 49.3$ g/mol."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these gases would be the densest at a given temperature and pressure?",
        "options": [
          "$Cl_2$ ($M = 71.0$)",
          "$O_2$ ($M = 32.0$)",
          "$N_2$ ($M = 28.0$)",
          "$CH_4$ ($M = 16.0$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density is directly proportional to molar mass ($M$). Chlorine has the highest molar mass among the choices, so it is the densest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the pressure of a gas is doubled while the temperature is held constant, what happens to its density?",
        "options": [
          "The density doubles",
          "The density is halved",
          "The density remains the same",
          "The density quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to $d = MP/RT$, density is directly proportional to pressure. Doubling the pressure crowds the molecules into half the volume."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To determine the molar mass of a volatile liquid, a scientist vaporizes it and measures $P, V, T$ and the ________ of the vapor.",

          "Color",
          "Viscosity",
          "Boiling Point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass is the final variable needed to solve $M = mRT/PV$ (often called the Dumas method)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The units for gas density in chemistry are typically expressed as:",
        "options": [
          "g/L",
          "g/mL",
          "kg/m³",
          "mol/L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While liquids are often g/mL, gases are so thin that grams per liter (g/L) is the standard laboratory unit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a hot air balloon rise?",
        "options": [
          "The heated air inside is less dense than the cooler air outside",
          "The molar mass of air decreases when heated",
          "The air inside is under much higher pressure",
          "The balloon becomes lighter in mass when heated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing temperature increases volume, which decreases density. The lower-density hot air provides buoyancy in the higher-density cool air."
