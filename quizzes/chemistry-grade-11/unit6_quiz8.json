    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a thermochemical equation, what does the $\\Delta H$ value typically refer to?",
        "options": [
          "The enthalpy change for the molar amounts specified by the coefficients",
          "The energy required to break only the reactant bonds",
          "The heat change for exactly one gram of the limiting reactant",
          "The total internal energy of the products only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $\\Delta H$ value is tied to the stoichiometry of the equation. If the equation says $2H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O$, the $\\Delta H$ is for 2 moles of $H_2$ reacting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the coefficients of a thermochemical equation are doubled, what happens to the value of $\\Delta H$?",
        "options": [
          "It is also doubled",
          "It remains the same because it is a state function",
          "It is halved",
          "It becomes the square of the original value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy is an extensive property. If you double the amount of matter reacting, you double the total heat exchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \\rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l) \\quad \\Delta H = -890$ kJ. How much heat is released when $2$ moles of $CH_4$ are burned?",
        "options": [
          "$1780$ kJ",
          "$890$ kJ",
          "$445$ kJ",
          "$0$ kJ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the equation specifies $1$ mole of $CH_4$ releases $890$ kJ, burning $2$ moles will release $2 \\cdot 890 = 1780$ kJ."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following must be included in a thermochemical equation to make it accurate?",
        "options": [
          "The physical states (s, l, g, aq) of all reactants and products",
          "The names of the scientists who discovered the reaction",
          "The color of the products",
          "The volume of the reaction vessel"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy values differ depending on whether a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas (e.g., $H_2O(l)$ vs $H_2O(g)$)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is written as $A + B \\rightarrow C \\quad \\Delta H = +50$ kJ, what is the $\\Delta H$ for the reverse reaction $C \\rightarrow A + B$?",
        "options": [
          "$-50$ kJ",
          "$+50$ kJ",
          "$0$ kJ",
          "$+100$ kJ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reversing a reaction changes the sign of the enthalpy change."

        "question": "Consider: $N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \\rightarrow 2NH_3(g) \\quad \\Delta H = -92.2$ kJ. What is the enthalpy change per mole of $NH_3$ produced?",
        "options": [
          "$-46.1$ kJ/mol",
          "$-92.2$ kJ/mol",
          "$+46.1$ kJ/mol",
          "$-184.4$ kJ/mol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The given $\\Delta H$ is for $2$ moles of $NH_3$. To find the value per mole, divide by 2: $-92.2 / 2 = -46.1$ kJ/mol."

          "A product on the right side of the equation",
          "A negative number after the equation",
          "A subscript on the metal cation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Endothermic reactions require an input of heat, so heat acts like a reactant."

        "answer": "A",
