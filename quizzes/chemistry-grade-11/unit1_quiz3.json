    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Fundamental limits on measuring position and momentum",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that it is fundamentally impossible to simultaneously know which two properties of a particle with absolute precision?",
        "options": [
          "Position and momentum",
          "Charge and mass",
          "Energy and wavelength",
          "Spin and magnetic moment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position ($\\Delta x$) and momentum ($\\Delta p$) must be greater than or equal to $h/4\\pi$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the uncertainty principle, if we increase the precision of an electron's position measurement, what happens to the uncertainty in its momentum?",
        "options": [
          "The uncertainty in momentum increases",
          "The uncertainty in momentum decreases",
          "The uncertainty in momentum remains unchanged",
          "The momentum becomes exactly zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the product of the uncertainties is a constant minimum, improving the precision of one variable (decreasing its $\\Delta$) forces the other $\\Delta$ to increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following mathematical inequalities correctly represents Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$",
          "$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\le \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$",
          "$\\Delta x + \\Delta p = h$",
          "$E = mc^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The uncertainty principle is expressed as $\\Delta x \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$, establishing a lower limit to the product of uncertainties."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Uncertainty Principle significant for electrons but negligible for a moving car?",
        "options": [
          "The value of Planck's constant is extremely small relative to macroscopic objects",
          "Macroscopic objects do not have wave-like properties",
          "Gravity cancels out uncertainty in large-scale systems",
          "Electrons travel much faster than macroscopic objects"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $h$ is $6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s, the uncertainty is only measurable and relevant at the subatomic scale where masses are very small."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle provided the final theoretical blow to which concept in the Bohr model?",
        "options": [
          "Fixed, predictable circular orbits",
          "The existence of a nucleus",
          "The quantization of energy",
          "The transition of electrons between states"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A fixed orbit requires knowing exactly where an electron is and where it is going (momentum); Heisenberg proved this knowledge is unattainable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of the uncertainty principle, the act of 'measuring' an electron's position typically involves:",
        "options": [
          "Interacting with the electron via a photon, which alters its momentum",
          "Changing the electron's charge to make it visible",
          "Stopping the electron completely in its path",
          "Measuring the gravitational pull of the electron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To 'see' an electron, a photon must strike it. Because electrons have such low mass, the energy of the photon significantly changes the electron's velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Uncertainty Principle shifted the focus of atomic theory from 'certainty' to which of the following concepts?",
        "options": [
          "Probability",
          "Relativity",
          "Thermodynamics",
          "Static Equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since we cannot know exact paths, we must use wavefunctions to describe the probability of finding an electron in a certain region."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the uncertainty in the position of an electron is zero, what is the uncertainty in its momentum according to the principle?",
        "options": [
          "Infinite",
          "Zero",
          "Equal to Planck's constant",
          "Equal to the mass of the electron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mathematically, if $\\Delta x$ approaches zero, $\\Delta p$ must approach infinity to satisfy the inequality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following constants is central to calculating the limits of uncertainty?",
        "options": [
          "Planck's constant ($h$)",
          "The Ideal Gas constant ($R$)",
          "Avogadro's number ($N_A$)",
          "Faraday's constant ($F$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Planck's constant defines the scale at which quantum effects, including uncertainty, become significant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Uncertainty Principle implies that an electron does not have a:",
        "options": [
          "Classical trajectory",
          "Specific mass",
          "Negative charge",
          "Magnetic moment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 'trajectory' implies a series of precise positions and momenta over time, which the Uncertainty Principle forbids for subatomic particles."
