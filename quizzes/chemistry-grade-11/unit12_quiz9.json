    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the $K_{\\text{sp}}$ value represent for an ionic compound?",
        "options": [
          "The product of the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution",
          "The total mass of the solid that can dissolve in one liter of water",
          "The rate at which a solid dissolves into a solvent",
          "The ratio of solid reactant to liquid product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The solubility product constant is the equilibrium constant for the equilibrium between a solid ionic compound and its dissolved ions in a saturated solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct $K_{\\text{sp}}$ expression for the dissolution of silver chloride: $\\text{AgCl(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ag}^{+}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{Cl}^{-}\\text{(aq)}$?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = [\\text{Ag}^{+}][\\text{Cl}^{-}]$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = \\frac{[\\text{Ag}^{+}][\\text{Cl}^{-}]}{[\\text{AgCl}]}$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = [\\text{Ag}^{+}] + [\\text{Cl}^{-}]$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = \\frac{[\\text{AgCl}]}{([\\text{Ag}^{+}][\\text{Cl}^{-}])}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $\\text{AgCl}$ is a pure solid, it is excluded from the equilibrium expression. The $K_{\\text{sp}}$ is simply the product of the ion concentrations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the compound $\\text{MgF}_{2}$, which dissolves as $\\text{MgF}_{2}\\text{(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Mg}^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + 2\\text{F}^{-}\\text{(aq)}$, the $K_{\\text{sp}}$ expression is:",
        "options": [
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = [\\text{Mg}^{2+}][\\text{F}^{-}]^{2}$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = [\\text{Mg}^{2+}][\\text{F}^{-}]$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = [\\text{Mg}^{2+}]2[\\text{F}^{-}]$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = [\\text{Mg}^{2+}] + 2[\\text{F}^{-}]$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As with any equilibrium constant, the coefficient ($2$ for $\\text{F}^{-}$) becomes an exponent in the expression."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the molar solubility of a salt $\\text{AB}$ is '$s$', what is the relationship between '$s$' and $K_{\\text{sp}}$?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = s^{2}$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = s$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = 2s$",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}} = \\sqrt{s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $\\text{AB} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{A}^{+} + \\text{B}^{-}$, then $[\\text{A}^{+}] = s$ and $[\\text{B}^{-}] = s$. Therefore, $K_{\\text{sp}} = (s)(s) = s^{2}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solution is 'saturated' when:",

          "The reaction quotient $Q$ is equal to $K_{\\text{sp}}$",
          "No more solute can be added to the beaker",
          "The solution is boiling",
          "The concentration of ions is exactly $1.0$ M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Saturation is the state of equilibrium where the rate of dissolution equals the rate of precipitation ($Q = K_{\\text{sp}}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $Q < K_{\\text{sp}}$ for a specific salt in solution, what will happen?",
        "options": [
          "More solid can dissolve; no precipitate forms",
          "A precipitate will form immediately",
          "The solution is at equilibrium",
          "The temperature will decrease spontaneously"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $Q < K_{\\text{sp}}$, the solution is unsaturated, meaning more ions can be added before reaching the limit of solubility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the $K_{\\text{sp}}$ of $\\text{BaSO}_{4}$ is $1.1 \\times 10^{-10}$, what is its molar solubility ($s$)?",
        "options": [
          "$1.05 \\times 10^{-5}$ M",
          "$1.1 \\times 10^{-10}$ M",
          "$2.2 \\times 10^{-10}$ M",
          "$1.21 \\times 10^{-20}$ M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{\\text{sp}} = s^{2}$. Therefore, $s = \\sqrt{1.1 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 1.05 \\times 10^{-5}$ M."

          "$\\text{FeS}$ ($K_{\\text{sp}} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-19}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For salts with the same ion ratio ($1:1$), the smaller the $K_{\\text{sp}}$, the lower the solubility. $10^{-28}$ is the smallest value listed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a salt with the formula $\\text{X}_{2}\\text{Y}$, if the molar solubility is '$s$', the $K_{\\text{sp}}$ is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "$4s^{3}$",
          "$s^{3}$",
          "$2s^{2}$",
          "$s^{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{X}_{2}\\text{Y} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\text{X}^{+} + \\text{Y}^{2-}$. If $[\\text{Y}^{2-}] = s$, then $[\\text{X}^{+}] = 2s$. $K_{\\text{sp}} = (2s)^{2}(s) = (4s^{2})(s) = 4s^{3}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When comparing two salts with **different** formulas (e.g., $\\text{AgCl}$ vs $\\text{Ag}_{2}\\text{CrO}_{4}$), you cannot compare their solubilities by looking at $K_{\\text{sp}}$ alone because:",
        "options": [
          "The mathematical relationship between $s$ and $K_{\\text{sp}}$ depends on the stoichiometry",
          "$K_{\\text{sp}}$ is only valid for $1:1$ salts",
          "One is colored and the other is not",
          "The units of $K_{\\text{sp}}$ are different for every salt"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the exponents change based on the number of ions, a salt with a larger $K_{\\text{sp}}$ might actually be less soluble than one with a smaller $K_{\\text{sp}}$ if the formulas differ."
