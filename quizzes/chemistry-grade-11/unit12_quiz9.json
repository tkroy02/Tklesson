    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Equilibrium in saturated solutions",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the $K_{sp}$ value represent for an ionic compound?",
        "options": [
          "The product of the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution",
          "The total mass of the solid that can dissolve in one liter of water",
          "The rate at which a solid dissolves into a solvent",
          "The ratio of solid reactant to liquid product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The solubility product constant is the equilibrium constant for the equilibrium between a solid ionic compound and its dissolved ions in a saturated solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct $K_{sp}$ expression for the dissolution of silver chloride: $AgCl(s) \\rightleftharpoons Ag^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)$?",
        "options": [
          "K_{sp} = [Ag^{+}][Cl^{-}]",
          "K_{sp} = [Ag^{+}][Cl^{-}] / [AgCl]",
          "K_{sp} = [Ag^{+}] + [Cl^{-}]",
          "K_{sp} = [AgCl] / ([Ag^{+}][Cl^{-}])"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $AgCl$ is a pure solid, it is excluded from the equilibrium expression. The $K_{sp}$ is simply the product of the ion concentrations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the compound $MgF_{2}$, which dissolves as $MgF_{2}(s) \\rightleftharpoons Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2F^{-}(aq)$, the $K_{sp}$ expression is:",
        "options": [
          "K_{sp} = [Mg^{2+}][F^{-}]^{2}",
          "K_{sp} = [Mg^{2+}][F^{-}]",
          "K_{sp} = [Mg^{2+}]2[F^{-}]",
          "K_{sp} = [Mg^{2+}] + 2[F^{-}]"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As with any equilibrium constant, the coefficient (2 for $F^{-}$) becomes an exponent in the expression."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the molar solubility of a salt $AB$ is 's', what is the relationship between 's' and $K_{sp}$?",
        "options": [
          "K_{sp} = s^{2}",
          "K_{sp} = s",
          "K_{sp} = 2s",
          "K_{sp} = \\sqrt{s}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $AB \\rightleftharpoons A^{+} + B^{-}$, then $[A^{+}] = s$ and $[B^{-}] = s$. Therefore, $K_{sp} = (s)(s) = s^{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solution is 'saturated' when:",
        "options": [
          "The reaction quotient Q is equal to K_{sp}",
          "No more solute can be added to the beaker",
          "The solution is boiling",
          "The concentration of ions is exactly 1.0 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Saturation is the state of equilibrium where the rate of dissolution equals the rate of precipitation ($Q = K_{sp}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $Q < K_{sp}$ for a specific salt in solution, what will happen?",
        "options": [
          "More solid can dissolve; no precipitate forms",
          "A precipitate will form immediately",
          "The solution is at equilibrium",
          "The temperature will decrease spontaneously"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $Q < K_{sp}$, the solution is unsaturated, meaning more ions can be added before reaching the limit of solubility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the $K_{sp}$ of $BaSO_{4}$ is $1.1 \\cdot 10^{-10}$, what is its molar solubility (s)?",
        "options": [
          "1.05 \\cdot 10^{-5} M",
          "1.1 \\cdot 10^{-10} M",
          "2.2 \\cdot 10^{-10} M",
          "1.21 \\cdot 10^{-20} M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{sp} = s^{2}$. Therefore, $s = \\sqrt{1.1 \\cdot 10^{-10}} \\approx 1.05 \\cdot 10^{-5} M$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following compounds is the **least** soluble based on their $K_{sp}$ values?",
        "options": [
          "CdS (K_{sp} = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-28})",
          "PbS (K_{sp} = 3.0 \\cdot 10^{-28})",
          "ZnS (K_{sp} = 2.0 \\cdot 10^{-25})",
          "FeS (K_{sp} = 6.0 \\cdot 10^{-19})"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For salts with the same ion ratio (1:1), the smaller the $K_{sp}$, the lower the solubility. $10^{-28}$ is the smallest value listed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a salt with the formula $X_{2}Y$, if the molar solubility is 's', the $K_{sp}$ is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "4s^{3}",
          "s^{3}",
          "2s^{2}",
          "s^{2}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$X_{2}Y \\rightleftharpoons 2X^{+} + Y^{2-}$. If $[Y^{2-}] = s$, then $[X^{+}] = 2s$. $K_{sp} = (2s)^{2}(s) = (4s^{2})(s) = 4s^{3}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When comparing two salts with **different** formulas (e.g., $AgCl$ vs $Ag_{2}CrO_{4}$), you cannot compare their solubilities by looking at $K_{sp}$ alone because:",
        "options": [
          "The mathematical relationship between s and K_{sp} depends on the stoichiometry",
          "K_{sp} is only valid for 1:1 salts",
          "One is colored and the other is not",
          "The units of K_{sp} are different for every salt"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the exponents change based on the number of ions, a salt with a larger $K_{sp}$ might actually be less soluble than one with a smaller $K_{sp}$ if the formulas differ."
