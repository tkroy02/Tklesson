    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the definition of a 'Limiting Reactant'?",
        "options": [
          "The reactant that is completely consumed first and limits the amount of product formed",
          "The reactant with the smallest mass in the reaction vessel",
          "The reactant that has the smallest coefficient in the balanced equation",
          "The reactant that remains after the reaction has finished"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The limiting reactant determines how far the reaction can proceed. Once it is gone, the reaction stops."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Theoretical Yield' of a reaction is:",
        "options": [
          "The maximum amount of product that can be produced based on the limiting reactant",
          "The amount of product actually measured in the laboratory",
          "The amount of reactant that did not participate in the reaction",
          "The mass of the limiting reactant multiplied by the excess reactant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Theoretical yield is a calculated value assuming perfect conditions and $100$% conversion of the limiting reactant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Excess Reactant'?",
        "options": [
          "The reactant that is not completely used up in a chemical reaction",
          "The reactant that reacts the fastest",
          "The product that is formed in the greatest quantity",
          "A catalyst that is added in large amounts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The excess reactant is the substance left over after the limiting reactant has been entirely consumed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $2H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O$, if you have $2$ moles of $H_2$ and $2$ moles of $O_2$, which is the limiting reactant?",
        "options": [
          "$H_2$",
          "$O_2$",
          "Both are limiting",
          "Neither is limiting"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The recipe requires $2$ moles of $H_2$ for every $1$ mole of $O_2$. Since you only have $2$ moles of $H_2$, it can only react with $1$ mole of $O_2$. The $H_2$ will run out first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the limiting reactant when given masses of two reactants, what is the best first step?",
        "options": [
          "Convert both masses to moles",
          "Compare the masses directly",
          "Divide the masses by their coefficients",
          "Multiply the masses by the total volume"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Masses cannot be compared directly because substances have different molar masses. You must convert to the 'counting unit' (moles) first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $5.0$ moles of $A$ react with $5.0$ moles of $B$ in the reaction $A + 2B \\rightarrow C$, how many moles of $C$ can be formed?",
        "options": [
          "2.5 moles",
          "5.0 moles",
          "10.0 moles",
          "7.5 moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$5$ moles of $B$ would require $2.5$ moles of $A$. $5$ moles of $A$ would require $10$ moles of $B$. Since we only have $5$ moles of $B$, $B$ is limiting. Based on $B$, the yield of $C$ is $5 / 2 = 2.5$ moles."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following does NOT affect the theoretical yield of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The amount of the excess reactant",
          "The amount of the limiting reactant",
          "The stoichiometry of the balanced equation",
          "The molar mass of the product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding more excess reactant does not increase the yield because the limiting reactant has already determined the maximum product possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $10$ grams of reactant $X$ produces $5$ grams of product, but $10$ grams of reactant $Y$ produces $3$ grams of product, which is the limiting reactant?",
        "options": [
          "Reactant $Y$",
          "Reactant $X$",
          "The product",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The limiting reactant is the one that produces the *least* amount of product. In this case, $Y$ results in less product, so it must be the limiting factor."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a sandwich analogy (2 slices bread + 1 slice cheese = 1 sandwich), if you have 10 slices of bread and 8 slices of cheese, what is the limiting 'reactant'?",
        "options": [
          "The bread",
          "The cheese",
          "The sandwich",
          "The plate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "10 slices of bread can only make 5 sandwiches. 8 slices of cheese could make 8. The bread runs out first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Once the limiting reactant is identified, all subsequent stoichiometric calculations for products must be based on:",
        "options": [
          "The amount of the limiting reactant",
          "The amount of the excess reactant",
          "The average of both reactants",
          "The total mass of the system"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only the limiting reactant accurately predicts the maximum possible product formation."
