    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula should be used to calculate the energy required to melt a solid at its melting point?",
        "options": [
          "$q = m \\cdot \\Delta H_{fus}$",
          "$q = m \\cdot c \\cdot \\Delta T$",
          "$q = \\frac{m}{c \\cdot \\Delta T}$",
          "$q = m \\cdot c \\cdot \\Delta H_{vap}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the melting point, the temperature does not change ($\\Delta T = 0$), so we use the mass or moles multiplied by the latent heat of fusion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The specific heat capacity of liquid water is $4.18$ J/g°C. How much heat is needed to raise the temperature of $50.0$ g of water from $20$°C to $80$°C?",
        "options": [
          "$12,540$ J",
          "$4,180$ J",
          "$16,720$ J",
          "$250$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $q = mc\\Delta T$: $50.0\\text{ g} \\cdot 4.18\\text{ J/g°C} \\cdot (80-20)\\text{°C} = 50 \\cdot 4.18 \\cdot 60 = 12,540\\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the molar heat of fusion for water is $6.01$ kJ/mol, how much energy is required to melt $2.00$ moles of ice at $0$°C?",
        "options": [
          "$12.02$ kJ",
          "$3.00$ kJ",
          "$6.01$ kJ",
          "$18.03$ kJ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$q = n \\cdot \\Delta H_{fus} = 2.00\\text{ mol} \\cdot 6.01\\text{ kJ/mol} = 12.02\\text{ kJ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the molar heat of vaporization ($\\Delta H_{vap}$) for a substance almost always larger than its molar heat of fusion ($\\Delta H_{fus}$)?",
        "options": [
          "Vaporization requires completely overcoming intermolecular forces, while melting only partially disrupts them",
          "Gas particles are larger than liquid particles",
          "Melting occurs at a higher temperature than boiling",
          "The specific heat of a gas is always higher than that of a solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a liquid, molecules are still in contact. To turn a liquid into a gas, you must separate them entirely, which requires significantly more energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much heat is released when $10.0$ g of steam condenses to liquid water at $100$°C? ($\\Delta H_{vap} = 2260$ J/g)",
        "options": [
          "$22,600$ J",
          "$226$ J",
          "$41.8$ J",
          "$100$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condensation is the reverse of vaporization. $q = m \\cdot \\Delta H_{vap} = 10.0\\text{ g} \\cdot 2260\\text{ J/g} = 22,600\\text{ J}$. The energy is released (exothermic)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To calculate the total energy to turn ice at $-10$°C into steam at $110$°C, how many distinct calculation steps (sections of the heating curve) are required?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "3",
          "2",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The steps are: 1. Warm ice to $0$°C, 2. Melt ice, 3. Warm water to $100$°C, 4. Boil water, 5. Warm steam to $110$°C."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $100$ g piece of metal at $150$°C is dropped into $100$ g of water at $25$°C. If the specific heat of the metal is much lower than water, the final equilibrium temperature will be:",
        "options": [
          "Closer to $25$°C than $150$°C",
          "Exactly $87.5$°C (the average)",
          "Closer to $150$°C than $25$°C",
          "Higher than $150$°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water has a very high specific heat capacity, meaning it takes a lot of energy to change its temperature. The metal will lose a lot of temperature while the water only gains a little."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which process is exothermic?",

          "Sublimation",
          "Boiling",
          "Melting"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exothermic processes release heat to the surroundings. Gas turning into a solid (deposition) involves particles losing energy to settle into a lattice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the temperature of a sample of water while it is freezing?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant at $0$°C",
          "It decreases steadily",
          "It increases slightly due to the heat of fusion",
          "It fluctuates randomly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As long as liquid water is transitioning to ice, the temperature stays at the freezing point until all the liquid has solidified."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $q = m \\cdot c \\cdot \\Delta T$, what does 'c' represent?",
        "options": [
          "Specific heat capacity",
          "The speed of light",
          "The calorie count",
          "The critical temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
