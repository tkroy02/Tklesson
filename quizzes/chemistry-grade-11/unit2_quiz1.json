    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Aufbau principle, which orbital must be filled immediately after the $3p$ subshell is complete?",
        "options": [
          "$4s$",
          "$3d$",
          "$4p$",
          "$3f$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even though $n=3$ has a $d$ subshell, the $4s$ orbital is lower in energy than the $3d$ orbital and must be filled first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The $(n + l)$ rule is used to determine the relative energy of orbitals. Which of the following has the lowest energy according to this rule?",
        "options": [
          "$4s$",
          "$3d$",
          "$4p$",
          "$5s$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For $4s$, $n+l = 4+0=4$. For $3d$, $n+l = 3+2=5$. The lower value fills first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct order of filling for the following subshells?",
        "options": [
          "$1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d$",
          "$1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3d, 3p, 4s$",
          "$1s, 2s, 3s, 2p, 3p, 3d, 4s$",
          "$1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Following the Aufbau diagram (diagonal rule), $4s$ always fills before $3d$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'Aufbau' is derived from a German word meaning what?",
        "options": [
          "Building up",
          "Equal energy",
          "Lowest state",
          "Outer shell"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aufbau refers to the process of 'building up' the electron cloud from the lowest energy levels to the highest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a neutral atom of Potassium ($Z=19$), the 19th electron enters which orbital?",
        "options": [
          "$4s$",
          "$3d$",
          "$3p$",
          "$4p$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After Argon ($1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$), the next lowest energy orbital is $4s$, not $3d$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following subshells does NOT exist according to quantum mechanical rules?",
        "options": [
          "$2d$",
          "$3p$",
          "$4f$",
          "$5s$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For $n=2$, $l$ can only be $0$ or $1$ ($s$ or $p$). A $d$ orbital requires $l=2$, which only begins at $n=3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many electrons must be present in an atom before the $2s$ orbital begins to fill?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "4",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $1s$ orbital must be completely filled with 2 electrons before the Aufbau principle allows the $2s$ orbital to begin filling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When comparing orbitals with the same $(n + l)$ value, which one is filled first?",
        "options": [
          "The one with the lower $n$ value",
          "The one with the higher $l$ value",
          "The one with the higher $n$ value",
          "They are filled simultaneously"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $n+l$ is equal (e.g., $3d$ is $3+2=5$ and $4p$ is $4+1=5$), the orbital with the lower principal quantum number ($n$) is lower in energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The diagonal rule (Möller diagram) helps visualize which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "The sequence of orbital filling",
          "The shape of p-orbitals",
          "The number of neutrons in an isotope",
          "The electronegativity of halogens"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The diagonal rule is a mnemonic used to remember the specific order in which electrons fill various subshells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which subshell starts filling after the $5p$ subshell is complete?",

          "$6s$",
          "$4f$",
          "$5d$",
          "$6p$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Following the Aufbau sequence, the $6s$ orbital follows $5p$ before the $4f$ and $5d$ orbitals begin."
