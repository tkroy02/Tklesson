    "topic": "Measuring how fast reactions occur",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the 'Reaction Rate' generally defined in chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "The change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit of time",
          "The total amount of energy released during a reaction",
          "The time it takes for a reaction to reach equilibrium",
          "The ratio of the mass of products to the mass of reactants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate is a measure of speed; in chemistry, this is the speed at which reactants disappear or products appear, usually measured in $M/s$ or $mol/(L \\cdot s)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a chemical reaction, the concentration of the reactants ________ and the concentration of the products ________ over time.",
        "options": [
          "Decreases; increases",
          "Increases; decreases",
          "Decreases; remains constant",
          "Remains constant; increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reactants are consumed to form products, so their concentration drops while the products' concentration rises as the reaction proceeds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $A \\rightarrow B$, if the rate of disappearance of A is $0.050$ M/s, what is the rate of appearance of B?",
        "options": [
          "0.050 M/s",
          "-0.050 M/s",
          "0.100 M/s",
          "0.025 M/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the stoichiometry is 1:1, B appears at the exact same rate that A disappears. Note that reaction rates are always expressed as positive values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \\rightarrow 2NH_{3}(g)$, how does the rate of disappearance of $H_{2}$ compare to the rate of disappearance of $N_{2}$?",
        "options": [
          "H2 disappears 3 times as fast as N2",
          "N2 disappears 3 times as fast as H2",
          "They disappear at the same rate",
          "H2 disappears 1.5 times as fast as N2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the coefficients, 3 moles of $H_{2}$ are consumed for every 1 mole of $N_{2}$. Therefore, the rate for $H_{2}$ is $3 \\times$ higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Instantaneous Rate' of a reaction is found by:",
        "options": [
          "Calculating the slope of the tangent line to the concentration-time curve at a specific point",
          "Dividing the total change in concentration by the total time of the reaction",
          "Measuring the temperature change at the very end of the reaction",
          "Averaging the rates of the first and last five seconds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike average rate, the instantaneous rate gives the speed at one specific moment in time, represented by the derivative (slope) at that point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What usually happens to the rate of a reaction as time passes?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases as the reactants are consumed",
          "It increases as more products are formed",
          "It remains constant until the reaction ends",
          "It oscillates up and down until equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As reactant concentrations drop, there are fewer molecular collisions, which typically causes the reaction rate to slow down over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following units is most common for a reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "M/s",
          "mol/L",
          "s/M",
          "J/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reaction rates represent Molarity ($mol/L$) divided by time (seconds), resulting in $M/s$ or $M \\cdot s^{-1}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a reaction $aA + bB \\rightarrow cC + dD$, the generalized rate expression is:",
        "options": [
          "Rate = $-(1/a)\\Delta[A]/\\Delta t = (1/c)\\Delta[C]/\\Delta t$",
          "Rate = $a[A] \\cdot b[B]$",
          "Rate = $\\Delta t / \\Delta[A]$",
          "Rate = $[C][D] / [A][B]$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To get a single unique rate for the whole reaction, the individual rates of change are divided by their stoichiometric coefficients. Reactants get a negative sign because their change is negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a gas-phase reaction produces a change in the number of moles of gas, the rate can be measured by monitoring:",
        "options": [
          "The change in total pressure over time",
          "The change in the color of the solution",
          "The change in the pH of the water",
          "The change in the mass of the beaker"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Ideal Gas Law, pressure is proportional to the number of moles. Monitoring pressure is a standard way to track gas-phase kinetics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Spectrophotometry is often used to measure reaction rates by tracking:",
        "options": [
          "The absorption of light by a colored reactant or product",
          "The heat absorbed by the reaction vessel",
          "The conductivity of the ions in solution",
          "The movement of electrons through a wire"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Beer's Law ($A = \\epsilon bc$) relates absorbance to concentration. By measuring how absorbance changes over time, we can calculate the reaction rate."
