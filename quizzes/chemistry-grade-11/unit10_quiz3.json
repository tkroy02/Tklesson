    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When balancing a half-reaction in acidic solution, what substance is added to balance Oxygen atoms?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}O$",
          "$O_{2}$",
          "$OH^{-}$",
          "$H^{+}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In acidic aqueous solutions, water molecules are used to provide the necessary oxygen atoms to balance the equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After balancing Oxygen with water, how are Hydrogen atoms balanced in an acidic solution?",
        "options": [
          "By adding $H^{+}$ ions",
          "By adding $H_{2}$ gas",
          "By adding $OH^{-}$ ions",
          "By adding more $H_{2}O$ molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the solution is acidic, there is an abundance of $H^{+}$ ions available to balance the hydrogen atoms introduced by the water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the final step in balancing an individual half-reaction before combining them?",
        "options": [
          "Adding electrons ($e^{-}$) to balance the total charge",
          "Adding protons ($H^{+}$) to balance the total charge",
          "Multiplying by the molar mass of the reactants",
          "Ensuring the number of water molecules is even"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass balance must be followed by charge balance. Electrons are added to the more positive side so that the total charge is equal on both sides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the oxidation half-reaction loses 3 electrons and the reduction half-reaction gains 2 electrons, what must be done before adding them together?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 2 and the reduction by 3",
          "Add one electron to the reduction half-reaction",
          "Divide the oxidation half-reaction by 1.5",
          "Multiply both reactions by 6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The number of electrons lost must equal the number of electrons gained. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the half-reaction $MnO_{4}^{-} \\rightarrow Mn^{2+}$, how many $H^{+}$ ions are needed to balance the hydrogens in acidic solution?",
        "options": [
          "8",
          "4",
          "2",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, 4 $H_{2}O$ are added to the right to balance the 4 oxygens. This creates 8 hydrogens, requiring 8 $H^{+}$ on the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the balanced half-reaction $MnO_{4}^{-} + 8H^{+} + ?e^{-} \\rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 4H_{2}O$, how many electrons are required?",

          "5",
          "2",
          "1",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The left side has a charge of $+7$ ($-1 + 8$). The right side has a charge of $+2$. To make $+7$ equal $+2$, we must add 5 electrons ($e^{-}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an oxidation half-reaction, on which side of the equation are the electrons written?",
        "options": [
          "The product side (right)",
          "The reactant side (left)",
          "Both sides",
          "Neither side"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation is the loss of electrons, so the electrons are 'exiting' the substance and appear as products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is balanced for both mass and charge?",
        "options": [
          "$Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-} + 14H^{+} + 6e^{-} \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_{2}O$",
          "$Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-} + 14H^{+} \\rightarrow 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_{2}O$",
          "$Sn^{2+} \\rightarrow Sn^{4+} + e^{-}$",
          "$Fe^{3+} + e^{-} \\rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^{-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In option A, there are 2 Cr, 7 O, and 14 H on both sides. The charge on the left is $(-2 + 14 - 6 = +6)$ and the right is $(2 \\cdot 3 = +6)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When combining half-reactions, what should happen to the electrons?",
        "options": [
          "They should cancel out completely",
          "They should appear only on the product side",
          "They should be replaced by $OH^{-}$",
          "They should remain to show the current flow"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a full balanced redox equation, the net movement of electrons is internal; they do not appear as a net reactant or product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you balance a reaction and find $H^{+}$ ions on both sides, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Subtract the smaller number from both sides to simplify",
          "Leave them as they are to show the acid concentration",
          "Convert them all to water",
          "Multiply the entire equation by zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like algebraic terms, identical species on both sides of a chemical equation should be simplified to the net amount."
