      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the primary factor determined by the principal quantum number ($n$)?",
        "options": [
          "The distance of the electron from the nucleus",

          "1",
          "All of these are possible"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The value of $l$ is restricted to integers from $0$ to $n-1$. For $n=2$, the only allowed values for $l$ are $0$ and $1$."

          "The number of electrons that can fit in a single orbital"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$l$ defines the shape of the orbital (subshell) and is a measure of the electron's angular momentum."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which subshell is represented by the notation $4p$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficient '4' represents the principal quantum number $n=4$, and 'p' represents the angular momentum quantum number $l=1$."

          "3",
          "6",
          "18"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total number of orbitals in a main shell is calculated by $n^2$. For $n=3$, $3^2 = 9$ (one $3s$, three $3p$, and five $3d$ orbitals)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a hydrogen atom, the energy of an orbital depends solely on which quantum number?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a single-electron system like hydrogen, orbitals in the same shell (different $l$ values) are degenerate, meaning their energy is determined only by $n$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $l$ must be at most $n-1$, for $l=3$ to be allowed, $n$ must be at least $4$ ($3 \\le n-1$). "
