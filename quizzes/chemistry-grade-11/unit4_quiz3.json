          "Only a single $\\sigma_{1s}$ bonding orbital"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combining two $1s$ atomic orbitals results in one low-energy bonding orbital ($\\sigma_{1s}$) and one high-energy anti-bonding orbital ($\\sigma_{1s}^*$)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the electron configuration for the $H_2$ molecule in its ground state?",
        "options": [
          "$(\\sigma_{1s})^2$",
          "$(\\sigma_{1s})^1 (\\sigma_{1s}^*)^1$",

          "0",
          "2",
          "0.5"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond order is calculated as $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{bonding electrons} - \\text{anti-bonding electrons})$. For $H_2$: $\\frac{1}{2}(2 - 0) = 1$."

          "Its bond order is 0",
          "It has too many bonding electrons",

          "It lacks a $\\sigma_{1s}$ orbital"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $He_2$, there are 2 electrons in $\\sigma_{1s}$ and 2 in $\\sigma_{1s}^*$. The bond order is $\\frac{1}{2}(2 - 2) = 0$, meaning no net stability is gained by bonding."

          "0",
          "1.5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$H_2^+$ has only one electron, which stays in the $\\sigma_{1s}$ orbital. Bond order: $\\frac{1}{2}(1 - 0) = 0.5$."

          "$He_2$ (Bond order = 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A higher bond order generally correlates with a stronger, more stable bond and shorter bond length."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$He_2^+$ has 3 electrons total ($2+2-1$). Two go into $\\sigma_{1s}$ and the third must go into $\\sigma_{1s}^*$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement is true regarding the stability provided by bonding vs. anti-bonding orbitals?",
        "options": [
          "The destabilization from an anti-bonding orbital is slightly greater than the stabilization from a bonding orbital",
          "The stabilization from a bonding orbital is always double the destabilization of an anti-bonding orbital",
          "They provide equal and opposite amounts of energy shift",
          "Anti-bonding orbitals do not affect stability, they just hold extra electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to electron-electron repulsion, the energy increase of the anti-bonding orbital is actually slightly larger than the energy decrease of the bonding orbital."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bond order of 0 predicted by MO theory indicates that:",

          "The molecule contains a single covalent bond",
          "The molecule is highly radioactive",
          "The molecule is a solid at room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A bond order of 0 means the anti-bonding effects cancel out the bonding effects, resulting in no net attraction between atoms."
