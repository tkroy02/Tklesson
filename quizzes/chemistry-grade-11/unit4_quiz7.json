    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which model describes metallic bonding as an array of metal cations submerged in a 'sea' of shared valence electrons?",
        "options": [
          "The Electron Sea Model",
          "Valence Bond Theory",
          "The Octet Rule",
          "Crystal Field Theory"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Electron Sea Model suggests that valence electrons are delocalized and free to move throughout the entire metal lattice, explaining conductivity and malleability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Band Theory, what is formed when a massive number of atomic orbitals in a metal crystal overlap?",
        "options": [
          "Continuous energy bands",
          "Individual ionic bonds",
          "Localized hybrid orbitals",
          "Discrete atomic shells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $N$ atoms combine, they form $N$ molecular orbitals. In a bulk metal, these orbitals are so close in energy that they form a continuous 'band' of allowed energy levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which band contains the valence electrons in a ground-state metal?",
        "options": [
          "The valence band",
          "The conduction band",
          "The forbidden band",
          "The $d$-orbital band"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The valence band is the highest energy band that is occupied by electrons in the ground state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'conduction band' in a metallic solid?",
        "options": [
          "An empty or partially filled band where electrons can move freely",
          "The band where electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus",
          "A band that only exists at absolute zero",
          "The innermost electron shell of the metal atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conduction band is the range of electron energies high enough to allow electrons to move freely through the material when an electric field is applied."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are metals excellent conductors of electricity according to Band Theory?",
        "options": [
          "The valence band and conduction band overlap, allowing electrons to move easily",
          "There is a large energy gap between the bands",
          "The electrons are locked into rigid covalent bonds",
          "Metals contain no protons to interfere with electron flow"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In conductors (metals), there is no energy gap (band gap) between the valence and conduction bands, so electrons require almost no energy to become mobile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The delocalization of electrons in metals explains which physical property?",
        "options": [
          "Malleability and ductility",
          "High brittleness",
          "Low boiling points",
          "Transparency to visible light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the 'sea' of electrons is non-directional, metal atoms can slide past one another without breaking the bond, allowing the metal to be hammered or stretched."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the electrical conductivity of a metal as the temperature increases?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases because increased vibrations interfere with electron flow",
          "It increases because electrons gain more kinetic energy",
          "It stays the same because the band gap is fixed",
          "The metal becomes a superconductor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In metals, higher temperatures cause lattice cations to vibrate more vigorously, which scatters the moving electrons and increases resistance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does metallic bonding differ from covalent bonding?",
        "options": [
          "Metallic bonds are delocalized, while covalent bonds are localized between specific atoms",
          "Metallic bonds only involve $p$ orbitals",
          "Covalent bonds are much stronger in every case",
          "Metallic bonds require the transfer of electrons to non-metals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Covalent bonds involve shared pairs of electrons between specific nuclei; metallic bonds involve a shared 'pool' of electrons across the entire structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor generally increases the strength of a metallic bond?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in the number of delocalized valence electrons",
          "An increase in the atomic radius",
          "A decrease in the nuclear charge",
          "The presence of more noble gas impurities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The more electrons contributed to the 'sea,' and the smaller the cation, the stronger the electrostatic attraction within the metal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In terms of Band Theory, what is the 'Fermi Level'?",
        "options": [
          "The highest occupied energy level at absolute zero",
          "The energy level where protons are located",
          "The total energy required to melt the metal",
          "The speed at which electrons travel through the wire"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Fermi Level is a theoretical energy level that represents the top of the 'electron sea' at absolute zero temperature ($0$ K)."
