    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Le Chatelier's Principle, if more reactant is added to a system at equilibrium, the system will shift to the:",
        "options": [
          "Right (products) to consume the added reactant",
          "Left (reactants) to produce more reactant",
          "Right (products) because the equilibrium constant K has increased",
          "Left (reactants) because the reaction quotient Q has increased"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding a reactant makes $Q < K$. The system counteracts this by shifting forward to consume the excess and restore the equilibrium ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a product is continuously removed from a reaction vessel as it forms, the reaction will:",
        "options": [
          "Continue to shift toward the products (right)",
          "Shift toward the reactants (left) to restore the product",
          "Reach equilibrium much faster",
          "Stop completely because of the missing material"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Removing a product keeps $Q$ lower than $K$, forcing the reaction to stay in the 'forward' mode. This is a common industrial technique to increase yield."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equilibrium $Fe^{3+}(aq) + SCN^{-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons FeSCN^{2+}(aq)$, adding extra $SCN^{-}$ ions will cause the solution to:",
        "options": [
          "Become darker (more product formed)",
          "Become lighter (more reactant formed)",
          "Remain the same color as K is constant",
          "Turn colorless as the reaction stops"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing the concentration of a reactant ($SCN^{-}$) shifts the equilibrium to the right, increasing the concentration of the deep-red complex $FeSCN^{2+}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the value of the equilibrium constant $K$ when concentrations are changed at constant temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The value of K remains unchanged",
          "K increases if more reactant is added",
          "K decreases if more product is added",
          "K increases only if a catalyst is present"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only temperature can change the value of $K$. Concentration changes shift the *position* of equilibrium, but the system eventually settles at the same ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reactant is removed from an equilibrium system, the system will shift:",
        "options": [
          "Toward the reactants (left) to replace what was lost",
          "Toward the products (right) to maintain the forward rate",
          "Toward the products (right) because Q is now zero",
          "Nowhere, as only adding substances causes a shift"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Le Chatelier's Principle states the system tries to 'undo' the change. Removing a reactant causes a shift to the side where that reactant is produced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider the reaction: $N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3}(g)$. If $NH_{3}$ is added to the container, the concentration of $H_{2}$ will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Remain the same",
          "Drop to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding product ($NH_{3}$) causes a shift to the left (reactants). This results in the formation of more $N_{2}$ and $H_{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the effect of adding a pure solid to an equilibrium involving gases?",
        "options": [
          "No shift occurs because solids are not included in the equilibrium expression",
          "The reaction shifts away from the solid to reduce the mass",
          "The reaction shifts toward the solid to help it dissolve",
          "The value of K increases significantly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the 'concentration' of a pure solid is constant, adding more of it does not change the ratio of the $Q$ expression and thus does not cause a shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system is at equilibrium and we double the concentrations of ALL species simultaneously, the system will shift:",
        "options": [
          "Toward the side with fewer moles of particles",
          "Toward the side with more moles of particles",
          "Not at all, since the ratio remains the same",
          "Only if the reaction is exothermic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Doubling all concentrations increases the numerator and denominator by different factors if the stoichiometric coefficients are different (e.g., $2^{2} / 2^{1} = 2$), causing a shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $A(g) \\rightleftharpoons B(g)$, if we add $A$ and $B$ such that the ratio $[B]/[A]$ remains equal to $K$, what happens?",
        "options": [
          "No shift occurs",
          "The reaction shifts to the right",
          "The reaction shifts to the left",
          "The reaction stops"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the ratio of product to reactant still equals $K$ ($Q=K$), the system is still at equilibrium and no net shift is required."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In industrial processes, the 'yield' of a product is maximized by:",
        "options": [
          "Removing the product as it is formed",
          "Adding more product to the reaction vessel",
          "Decreasing the concentration of all reactants",
          "Using a very small reaction vessel"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By removing product, you ensure $Q < K$ at all times, driving the reaction forward until the reactants are nearly exhausted."
