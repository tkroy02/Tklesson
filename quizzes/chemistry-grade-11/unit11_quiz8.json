    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard form of the Arrhenius Equation?",
        "options": [
          "$k = Ae^{-E_{a}/RT}$",
          "$k = Ae^{E_{a}/RT}$",
          "$k = -E_{a}/RT + A$",
          "$k = \\ln(A) - E_{a}/RT$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This equation shows that the rate constant $k$ is an exponential function of the negative activation energy divided by the product of the gas constant and temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Arrhenius Equation, what does the 'A' represent?",

          "The Frequency Factor",
          "The Activation Energy",
          "The Absorbance of the solution",
          "The Area of the electrode"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The frequency factor $A$ accounts for the total frequency of collisions and the probability that they have the correct orientation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which plot will yield a straight line according to the logarithmic form of the Arrhenius Equation?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The linear form is $\\ln k = -\\frac{E_{a}}{R}(\\frac{1}{T}) + \\ln A$. Plotting $\\ln k$ against the reciprocal of temperature (in Kelvin) gives a straight line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The slope of an Arrhenius plot ($\\ln k$ vs. $1/T$) is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "$-E_{a}/R$",
          "$E_{a}$",
          "$-k$",
          "$R/E_{a}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Following the $y = mx + b$ format, the slope $m$ is equivalent to negative activation energy divided by the ideal gas constant $R$."

          "$62.36 (L \\cdot torr)/(mol \\cdot K)$",
          "$1.987 cal/(mol \\cdot K)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since activation energy is usually measured in Joules or kiloJoules per mole, the energy-based gas constant $8.314$ is required."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the temperature of a reaction is increased, what happens to the value of the term $e^{-E_{a}/RT}$?",
        "options": [
          "It increases, leading to a larger $k$",
          "It decreases, leading to a smaller $k$",
          "It remains constant",
          "It becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $T$ increases, the exponent $-E_{a}/RT$ becomes less negative (closer to zero), making the exponential term larger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Two-Point' form of the Arrhenius equation used to compare $k$ at two different temperatures is:",

          "$\\ln(k_{2}/k_{1}) = \\frac{E_{a}}{R}(\\frac{1}{T_{1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{2}})$",
          "$\\ln(k_{2}/k_{1}) = \\frac{E_{a}}{R}(\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}})$",
          "$k_{2}/k_{1} = (T_{2}/T_{1})^{E_{a}}$",
          "$\\ln(k_{2}/k_{1}) = -E_{a}/R \\cdot (T_{2}-T_{1})$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This integrated version allows for the calculation of $E_{a}$ by measuring the rate constant at just two different temperatures."

          "Any scale as long as it is consistent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thermodynamic and kinetic equations require absolute temperature (Kelvin) to maintain the proportionality of energy and temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two reactions have the same frequency factor $A$, the one with the **lower** activation energy will have:",
        "options": [
          "A larger rate constant $k$ at any given temperature",
          "A smaller rate constant $k$ at any given temperature",
          "No dependence on temperature",
          "A negative rate constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A lower $E_{a}$ means the 'energy hill' is easier to climb, allowing more collisions to be successful and resulting in a faster rate (larger $k$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As $T \\rightarrow \\infty$ (infinitely high temperature), what does the rate constant $k$ approach?",

          "The frequency factor $A$",
          "Zero",
          "Infinity",
          "The activation energy $E_{a}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At infinite temperature, the exponential term $e^{-E_{a}/RT}$ approaches $e^{0}$, which is $1$. Thus, $k$ approaches its theoretical maximum, the frequency factor $A$."
