        "question": "In the quantum mechanical model, what is the fundamental difference between an 'orbit' and an 'orbital'?",
        "options": [
          "An orbital is a 3D region of probability, whereas an orbit is a fixed circular path",
          "An orbit is a 3D cloud, while an orbital is a 2D planetary path",
          "Orbitals only exist in hydrogen, while orbits exist in all other atoms",
