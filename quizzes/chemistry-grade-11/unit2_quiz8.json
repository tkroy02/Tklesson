    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines 'Electron Affinity'?",
        "options": [
          "The energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom",
          "The ability of an atom to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond",
          "The energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom",
          "The distance between the nucleus and the added electron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electron affinity measures the energy change associated with the addition of an electron. A negative value indicates that energy is released."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of elements generally has the most negative (highest) electron affinities?",
        "options": [
          "Halogens (Group 17)",
          "Noble Gases (Group 18)",
          "Alkali Metals (Group 1)",
          "Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Halogens are one electron away from a stable noble gas configuration, so they release a large amount of energy when they acquire an electron."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do Noble Gases typically have positive electron affinities?",
        "options": [
          "Added electrons must occupy a new, higher energy principal shell",
          "They have the largest atomic radii in their periods",
          "They are already negatively charged",
          "Their nuclei do not contain enough protons to attract electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Noble gases have full valence shells. Adding an electron requires it to move to a higher energy level, which is energetically unfavorable and requires an input of energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Across a period from left to right, electron affinity generally becomes:",
        "options": [
          "More negative (increases)",
          "More positive (decreases)",
          "Constant",
          "Unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As effective nuclear charge increases and atomic size decreases, the nucleus exerts a stronger pull on an incoming electron."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements would release the most energy upon gaining an electron?",
        "options": [
          "Chlorine (Cl)",
          "Sodium (Na)",
          "Magnesium (Mg)",
          "Neon (Ne)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorine has a very high electron affinity. Interestingly, it is slightly more negative than Fluorine's due to Fluorine's high electron density in its small $2p$ shell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the electron affinity of Nitrogen ($1s^2 2s^2 2p^3$) less negative than that of Carbon ($1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$)?",
        "options": [
          "Nitrogen has a stable half-filled p-subshell",
          "Nitrogen has more shielding than Carbon",
          "Carbon is more electronegative than Nitrogen",
          "Nitrogen is larger than Carbon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding an electron to Nitrogen requires pairing it in a $p$-orbital that already has one electron, creating extra repulsion that offsets the nuclear attraction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Generally, as you move down a group, electron affinity becomes:",
        "options": [
          "Less negative (decreases)",
          "More negative (increases)",
          "Constant",
          "Highly positive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the atomic radius increases, the incoming electron is further from the nucleus and feels a weaker pull, releasing less energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the sign of the energy change when a second electron is added to an $O^-$ ion to form $O^{2-}$?",
        "options": [
          "Positive (Energy is absorbed)",
          "Negative (Energy is released)",
          "Zero",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding a negative electron to an already negative ion requires overcoming significant electrostatic repulsion, making the process endothermic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which subatomic particle's attraction primarily determines the electron affinity value?",
        "options": [
          "Proton",
          "Neutron",
          "Electron",
          "Positron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The attraction of the protons in the nucleus for the incoming electron is the driving force behind electron affinity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to metals, non-metals generally have:",
        "options": [
          "Higher (more negative) electron affinities",
          "Lower (less negative) electron affinities",
          "Identical electron affinities",
          "No electron affinity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non-metals have higher effective nuclear charges and smaller radii, making them much more effective at attracting additional electrons than metals."
