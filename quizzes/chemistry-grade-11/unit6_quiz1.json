        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The system is the part of the universe we focus on. For a chemist, this is typically the atoms and molecules involved in a reaction."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An open system, like an uncovered beaker, allows mass to leave or enter and heat to be transferred."

        "question": "What is the 'Surroundings' in a thermodynamic context?",
        "options": [
          "Everything in the universe that is not part of the system",
          "Only the solvent in which the reactants are dissolved",
          "The air immediately touching the reaction vessel",
          "The laboratory bench and the scientist"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The surroundings comprise the entire rest of the universe outside the system boundaries."

          "A closed system",
          "A gaseous system"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An isolated system is one where neither matter nor energy can be exchanged with the surroundings (theoretically)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a chemical reaction is the system, what is the water in an aqueous solution considered to be?",
        "options": [
          "Part of the surroundings",
          "Part of the system",
          "A catalyst",
          "An isolated component"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In most calorimetry experiments, the water acts as the surroundings that absorbs or provides the heat for the reacting species (the system)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The boundary between a system and its surroundings can be:",
        "options": [
          "Either real (physical) or imaginary",
          "Only a physical solid like glass",
          "Only a mathematical concept",
          "Always permeable to matter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boundaries can be physical (like the walls of a piston) or imaginary (like a defined volume of air in the atmosphere)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Energy entering the system from the surroundings is given what sign in thermodynamic calculations?",
        "options": [
          "Positive (+)",
          "Negative (-)",
          "Neutral (0)",
          "It depends on the mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By convention, any energy gained by the system is positive ($q > 0$ or $w > 0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an open system?",

          "A sealed pressurized oxygen tank",
          "A battery inside a remote control",
          "A bomb calorimeter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water vapor (matter) and heat (energy) can both escape from an open pot."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement correctly describes the relationship between the system, surroundings, and universe?",

          "Surroundings = System + Universe"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The universe is defined as the totality of the system under study and everything else (the surroundings)."
