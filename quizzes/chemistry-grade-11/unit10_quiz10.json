        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'Primary Cell' battery?",
        "options": [
          "A battery designed to be used once because the redox reaction is not easily reversible",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Corrosion is a redox process where iron metal is oxidized. This is why rust typically forms where oxygen and moisture are both present."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a lead-acid storage battery (car battery), what substance acts as the anode?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Galvanization uses zinc as a 'sacrificial anode.' Zinc oxidizes more easily than iron, protecting the underlying steel even if the coating is scratched."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Fuel Cell' differs from a conventional battery because it:",
        "options": [
          "Requires a continuous external supply of reactants (like $H_{2}$ and $O_{2}$)",
          "Contains a fixed amount of reactant that eventually runs out",
          "Does not involve redox reactions",
          "Produces only solid waste products"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fuel cells are open systems that produce electricity as long as fuel (the reducing agent) and an oxidizer are supplied to the electrodes."
      },
      {

        "question": "Which of the following describes 'Sacrificial Protection'?",
        "options": [
          "Attaching a more active metal (like $Mg$) to a structure to prevent it from corroding",
          "Painting a metal surface to keep it away from air",
          "Mixing two metals to create a non-reactive alloy",
          "Removing oxygen from the environment surrounding a metal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By connecting a more easily oxidized metal to a structure (like a ship's hull), the attached metal corrodes instead of the structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Lithium-ion batteries are popular for portable electronics primarily because:",
        "options": [
          "Lithium is the lightest metal and provides a high energy density",
          "Lithium is the most abundant and cheapest metal on Earth",
          "They are the only batteries that do not use electrolytes",
          "They cannot be recharged, making them safer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lithium's low mass and high reduction potential allow for lightweight batteries that can store a large amount of energy."

          "It acts as the primary oxidizing agent",
          "It prevents oxygen from reaching the metal surface",
          "It keeps the metal at a constant temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water allows ions to move between the anodic and cathodic regions on the metal surface, completing the circuit required for the redox reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a 'Secondary Cell'?",

        "options": [
          "Protects the underlying metal from further oxidation",
          "Accelerates the destruction of the metal",
          "Causes the metal to dissolve in rainwater",
          "Conducts electricity better than the metal itself"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike rust on iron, the oxide layer on aluminum is tough and adheres tightly to the surface, 'passivating' the metal against further corrosion."
