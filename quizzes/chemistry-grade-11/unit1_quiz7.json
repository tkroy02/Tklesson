    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The magnetic quantum number ($m_l$) primarily determines which property of an orbital?",
        "options": [
          "Its orientation in 3D space",
          "Its overall energy level",
          "Its geometric shape",
          "The direction of the electron's spin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The magnetic quantum number $m_l$ specifies the orientation of an orbital around the nucleus relative to an external magnetic field."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a $d$-subshell ($l = 2$), what are the possible values for the magnetic quantum number ($m_l$)?",
        "options": [
          "-2, -1, 0, +1, +2",

          "-1, 0, +1",
          "-3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The values for $m_l$ range from $-l$ to $+l$, including zero. For $l=2$, this results in 5 possible orientations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The spin quantum number ($m_s$) is unique because it:",
        "options": [
          "Does not depend on the values of $n$, $l$, or $m_l$",
          "Determines the size of the electron cloud",
          "Must always be a positive integer",
          "Only applies to atoms in the ground state"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike the first three quantum numbers which are derived from the spatial wavefunction, $m_s$ describes an intrinsic property of the electron and can only be $+1/2$ or $-1/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many distinct orientations (orbitals) are available in a $p$-subshell?",

          "3",
          "1",
          "5",
          "7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a $p$-subshell ($l=1$), $m_l$ can be -1, 0, or +1, corresponding to the $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$ orbitals."
      },
      {

          "$-1/2$",
          "0",
          "1",
          "$-1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrons have only two possible spin states, typically referred to as 'spin up' ($+1/2$) and 'spin down' ($-1/2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an $f$-subshell has $l = 3$, how many orbitals are contained within that subshell?",
        "options": [
          "7",
          "3",
          "5",
          "14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The number of orbitals in a subshell is given by $2l + 1$. For $l=3$, $2(3) + 1 = 7$ orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, two electrons occupying the same orbital must have:",
        "options": [
          "Opposite spin quantum numbers",
          "The same magnetic quantum number",
          "Identical principal quantum numbers",
          "The same angular momentum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same four quantum numbers; if $n, l,$ and $m_l$ are the same, $m_s$ must differ."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The total number of electrons that can be accommodated in a single $d$-subshell is:",

          "10",
          "2",
          "5",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A $d$-subshell has 5 orbitals ($m_l$ values). Since each orbital can hold 2 electrons, the total capacity is $5 \\times 2 = 10$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What physical evidence led to the proposal of the spin quantum number?",

          "Cathode ray deflection"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Stern-Gerlach experiment showed that a beam of silver atoms split into two distinct paths in a non-uniform magnetic field, indicating two quantized spin states."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which quantum number provides the basis for the magnetic properties of many elements?",
