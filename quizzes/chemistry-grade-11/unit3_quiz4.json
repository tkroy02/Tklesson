    "subtitle": "3.4: Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Predicting molecular geometry from electron pairs",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental premise of VSEPR theory?",
        "options": [
          "Electron pairs in the valence shell stay as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion",
          "Protons in the nucleus repel each other to determine bond angles",
          "Atoms in a molecule always attempt to form a perfect circle",
          "Electrons are attracted to other electron pairs in neighboring atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "VSEPR stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion; it posits that electron groups around a central atom will orient themselves to be at the maximum possible distance from one another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In VSEPR theory, what constitutes an 'electron group' or 'electron domain'?",
        "options": [
          "A single bond, a double bond, a triple bond, or a lone pair",
          "Only lone pairs of electrons",
          "Only the electrons involved in single covalent bonds",
          "The total number of protons and neutrons in the central atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the purposes of predicting shape, any region of electron density—whether it contains one, two, or three pairs in a bond, or a single lone pair—counts as one electron group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of electron group typically exerts the greatest repulsive force according to VSEPR theory?",
        "options": [
          "Lone pairs",
          "Single bonds",
          "Double bonds",
          "Triple bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lone pairs are held closer to the nucleus of a single atom and occupy more space than bonding pairs, leading to greater repulsion against neighboring groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a central atom is surrounded by 4 electron groups, what is its electron-group geometry?",
        "options": [
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Linear",
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Octahedral"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Four groups of electrons will move to the corners of a tetrahedron to achieve the maximum separation of $109.5^\\circ$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between 'electron-group geometry' and 'molecular geometry'?",
        "options": [
          "Molecular geometry describes only the positions of atoms, while electron-group geometry includes lone pairs",
          "They are always the same regardless of lone pairs",
          "Electron-group geometry describes the nucleus, while molecular geometry describes the electrons",
          "Molecular geometry is 2D, while electron-group geometry is 3D"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electron-group geometry looks at where all electron domains are. Molecular geometry (or shape) only describes the relative positions of the atoms themselves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A molecule with 3 bonding groups and 0 lone pairs on the central atom has what molecular shape?",
        "options": [
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Trigonal pyramidal",
          "Bent",
          "T-shaped"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With 3 groups and no lone pairs, the atoms stay in a single plane at $120^\\circ$ angles from each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the bond angles in a molecule when one or more lone pairs are present on the central atom?",
        "options": [
          "The bond angles usually decrease",
          "The bond angles usually increase",
          "The bond angles remain exactly the same as the ideal geometry",
          "The bond angles become $0^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because lone pairs repel bonding pairs more strongly than bonding pairs repel each other, they 'push' the bonds closer together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many electron groups are around the central carbon atom in $CO_2$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "4",
          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon dioxide has two double bonds. Since each double bond counts as one electron group, there are two groups in total, leading to a linear shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following geometries corresponds to having 5 electron groups?",
        "options": [
          "Trigonal bipyramidal",
          "Octahedral",
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Square planar"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Five electron domains arrange themselves with three in an equatorial plane and two in axial positions to minimize repulsion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which order of repulsive strength is correct according to VSEPR?",
        "options": [
          "Lone pair-Lone pair > Lone pair-Bonding pair > Bonding pair-Bonding pair",
          "Bonding pair-Bonding pair > Lone pair-Bonding pair > Lone pair-Lone pair",
          "Lone pair-Bonding pair > Lone pair-Lone pair > Bonding pair-Bonding pair",
          "All repulsions are equal in strength"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The repulsion between two lone pairs is the strongest, followed by a lone pair and a bond, with the repulsion between two bonds being the weakest."
