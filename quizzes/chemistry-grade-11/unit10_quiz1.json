    "topic": "Tracking electron ownership in compounds",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the oxidation number of any element in its free, uncombined state (e.g., $O_2$, $Fe$, $S_8$)?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "+1",
          "-1",
          "Equal to its group number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, the oxidation number of atoms in a pure element is always zero, as there is no net gain or loss of electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In most compounds, what is the typical oxidation number assigned to Hydrogen?",
        "options": [
          "+1 (except in metal hydrides where it is -1)",
          "-1 (always)",
          "0",
          "+2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen is usually +1 when bonded to nonmetals. However, when bonded to metals (like $LiH$), it acts as the hydride ion with an oxidation state of -1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the oxidation number of Manganese in the permanganate ion ($MnO_4^-$)?",
        "options": [
          "+7",
          "+4",
          "+6",
          "-1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen is -2. Four oxygens equal -8. Since the total charge must be -1, $Mn + (-8) = -1$, therefore $Mn = +7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound must always equal:",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "+1",
          "The charge of the most electronegative atom",
          "The total number of valence electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For any neutral molecule, the total positive and negative oxidation states must cancel each other out to equal zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the oxidation state of Sulfur in $H_2SO_4$?",
        "options": [
          "+6",
          "+4",
          "-2",
          "+2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$H$ is +1 (total +2) and $O$ is -2 (total -8). $2 + S + (-8) = 0$, so $S = +6$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which of the following substances does Oxygen NOT have an oxidation state of -2?",
        "options": [
          "$H_2O_2$ (Hydrogen peroxide)",
          "$H_2O$",
          "$CO_2$",
          "$MgO$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In peroxides, Oxygen has an oxidation state of -1. In $OF_2$, it is +2 (because Fluorine is more electronegative)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the oxidation number of Nitrogen in the nitrate ion ($NO_3^-$)?",
        "options": [
          "+5",
          "+3",
          "-3",
          "+6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Three oxygens at -2 each equal -6. $N + (-6) = -1$ (the charge of the ion), so $N = +5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fluorine is assigned an oxidation number of ________ in all of its compounds.",
        "options": [
          "-1",
          "+1",
          "0",
          "-7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the most electronegative element, Fluorine always takes a -1 oxidation state when it is part of a compound."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the oxidation number of Carbon in the carbonate ion ($CO_3^{2-}$)?",

          "+4",
          "+2",
          "+6",
          "-2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$C + 3(-2) = -2 \\rightarrow C - 6 = -2 \\rightarrow C = +4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the polyatomic ion $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$, what is the oxidation state of each Chromium atom?",

          "+6",
          "+12",
          "+3",
          "+7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$2(Cr) + 7(-2) = -2 \\rightarrow 2Cr - 14 = -2 \\rightarrow 2Cr = 12 \\rightarrow Cr = +6$."
