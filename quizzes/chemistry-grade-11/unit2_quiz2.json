    "subtitle": "2.2: Hund's Rule and Pauli Exclusion Principle",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Rules governing electron arrangement in orbitals",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which rule states that electrons will occupy degenerate orbitals singly and with parallel spins before pairing up?",
        "options": [
          "Hund's Rule",
          "The Pauli Exclusion Principle",
          "The Aufbau Principle",
          "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hund's rule minimizes electron-electron repulsion by keeping electrons in separate orbitals of the same subshell as long as possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Pauli Exclusion Principle implies that an atomic orbital can hold a maximum of how many electrons?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "6",
          "1",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because there are only two possible spin states ($+1/2$ and $-1/2$), a single orbital can only accommodate two electrons with unique quantum numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two electrons occupy the same $2s$ orbital, what must be true about them according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle?",
        "options": [
          "They must have opposite spins",
          "They must have the same spin",
          "They must have different principal quantum numbers",
          "One must be in the nucleus and the other in the shell"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To have unique sets of four quantum numbers while sharing $n, l,$ and $m_l$, the $m_s$ value must be different for each."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following electron configurations for a nitrogen atom ($Z=7$) in the $2p$ subshell follows Hund's Rule?",
        "options": [
          "One electron in each of the three $p$ orbitals with parallel spins",
          "Two electrons in the $p_x$ orbital and one in the $p_y$ orbital",
          "Three electrons in the $p_z$ orbital",
          "One electron in $p_x$, one in $p_y$, but with opposite spins"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen has three electrons in the $2p$ subshell; Hund's rule requires them to occupy separate orbitals with parallel spins to minimize repulsion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What physical property of electrons is responsible for the 'parallel spins' mentioned in Hund's Rule?",
        "options": [
          "Magnetic moment",
          "Mass",
          "Electrical charge",
          "Gravitational pull"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The spin of an electron creates a magnetic field. Parallel spins in separate orbitals align these fields to lower the system's energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many unpaired electrons are found in a ground-state Carbon atom ($Z=6$)?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "0",
          "4",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon's configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. Following Hund's rule, the two $p$ electrons occupy separate orbitals, leaving them unpaired."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which principle is being violated if an orbital diagram shows two 'up' arrows in the same box?",
        "options": [
          "The Pauli Exclusion Principle",
          "Hund's Rule",
          "The Aufbau Principle",
          "The Octet Rule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two 'up' arrows mean both electrons have the same spin ($m_s = +1/2$), giving them identical quantum numbers, which is forbidden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Degenerate orbitals are orbitals that have:",
        "options": [
          "The same energy level",
          "Different principal quantum numbers",
          "The same spin direction",
          "No capacity for electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In chemistry, 'degenerate' specifically refers to orbitals that belong to the same subshell and possess the same amount of energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an orbital diagram, what does a single 'up' arrow in a box represent?",
        "options": [
          "A single electron with a spin of $+1/2$",
          "A pair of electrons",
          "A proton in the nucleus",
          "An empty orbital"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The arrow represents one electron, and the upward direction conventionally denotes the positive spin state ($m_s = +1/2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the best reason for electrons to remain unpaired in degenerate orbitals as long as possible?",
        "options": [
          "To minimize electrostatic repulsion between electrons",
          "To increase the gravitational attraction to the nucleus",
          "To follow the alphabetical order of subshells",
          "To make the atom larger in size"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrons carry a negative charge and repel one another; staying in separate orbitals keeps them further apart and lowers energy."
