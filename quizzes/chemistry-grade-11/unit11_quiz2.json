    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Concentration, temperature, surface area, and catalysts",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the concentration of reactants generally affect the reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the rate by increasing the frequency of collisions",
          "It decreases the rate by making the molecules too crowded to move",
          "It has no effect on the rate unless the temperature also changes",
          "It increases the rate by lowering the activation energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher concentration means more particles in a given volume, leading to more frequent collisions between reactant molecules per unit of time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does increasing the temperature significantly increase the rate of most chemical reactions?",
        "options": [
          "A larger fraction of molecules have enough energy to surpass the activation energy barrier",
          "It decreases the pressure, allowing molecules to move faster",
          "It changes the reaction from endothermic to exothermic",
          "It increases the size of the atoms, making them easier to hit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy. Higher temperatures mean more molecules possess the minimum energy (Activation Energy) required for a successful collision."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by:",
        "options": [
          "Providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy",
          "Increasing the total enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$) of the reaction",
          "Being consumed to produce more heat",
          "Increasing the concentration of the products"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts lower the 'energy hill' that reactants must climb, allowing more collisions to result in a reaction without the catalyst being permanently consumed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a heterogeneous reaction involving a solid and a liquid, how does grinding the solid into a fine powder affect the rate?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the rate by increasing the available surface area",
          "It decreases the rate by reducing the mass of the solid",
          "It has no effect because the chemical identity remains the same",
          "It decreases the rate by lowering the kinetic energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More surface area allows more reactant molecules to come into contact with each other simultaneously, increasing the number of collisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In gaseous reactions, increasing the pressure is equivalent to:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing the concentration",
          "Increasing the temperature",
          "Decreasing the activation energy",
          "Adding a catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Forcing gas molecules into a smaller volume (increasing pressure) increases the number of moles per liter, which is an increase in concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Nature of Reactants' as a factor in kinetics?",
        "options": [
          "Some substances react faster due to simpler bond structures or high reactivity",
          "The color of the reactants determines how fast they absorb heat",
          "Reactants in the solid state always react faster than those in the gas state",
          "The name of the element dictates its speed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The specific chemical properties and bond strengths of the reactants play a major role in how easily those bonds are broken during a collision."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A catalyst changes the equilibrium position of a reaction.",
        "options": [
          "False; it only helps the reaction reach equilibrium faster",
          "True; it increases the yield of the products",
          "True; it makes non-spontaneous reactions spontaneous",
          "False; catalysts can only be used in exothermic reactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts affect the speed (kinetics) but not the final extent or thermodynamics of a reaction. The ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium remains unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor explains why a sugar cube dissolves slower than granulated sugar?",
        "options": [
          "Surface area",
          "Temperature",
          "Catalysis",
          "Concentration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Granulated sugar has a much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, allowing more contact with the solvent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In biological systems, catalysts are usually proteins known as:",
        "options": [
          "Enzymes",
          "Hormones",
          "Inhibitors",
          "Lipids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enzymes are highly specific biological catalysts that allow complex reactions to occur at the moderate temperatures of living organisms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance that slows down or stops a chemical reaction is called a/an:",
        "options": [
          "Inhibitor",
          "Co-catalyst",
          "Reactant",
          "Intermediate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
