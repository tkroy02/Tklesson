    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mathematical expression represents the Combined Gas Law?",
        "options": [
          "$(P_1V_1) / T_1 = (P_2V_2) / T_2$",
          "$P_1V_1T_1 = P_2V_2T_2$",
          "$P_1 / (V_1T_1) = P_2 / (V_2T_2)$",
          "$V_1 / (P_1T_1) = V_2 / (P_2T_2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The combined gas law shows that the product of pressure and volume divided by the absolute temperature is constant for a fixed amount of gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Combined Gas Law is most useful when:",
        "options": [
          "Pressure, volume, and temperature are all changing at once",
          "The number of moles of gas is changing",
          "The temperature is held constant at 0°C",
          "Calculating the molar mass of an unknown gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It allows you to solve for any one of the six variables as long as the other five are known, provided the amount of gas remains the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the temperature is held constant ($T_1 = T_2$), the Combined Gas Law simplifies to which law?",
        "options": [
          "Boyle's Law",
          "Charles's Law",
          "Gay-Lussac's Law",
          "Avogadro's Law"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $T$ is constant, it cancels out of the denominator, leaving $P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A gas sample occupies $10.0$ L at $1.0$ atm and $300$ K. If the pressure is increased to $2.0$ atm and the temperature is increased to $600$ K, what is the new volume?",
        "options": [
          "10.0 L",
          "5.0 L",
          "20.0 L",
          "2.5 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\frac{1.0 \\cdot 10.0}{300} = \\frac{2.0 \\cdot V_2}{600}$. The volume stays the same because the doubling of pressure (which would halve volume) is perfectly offset by the doubling of temperature (which would double volume)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What must you do to a temperature in Celsius before using it in the Combined Gas Law equation?",
        "options": [
          "Add 273.15 to convert it to Kelvin",
          "Multiply it by 273.15",
          "Nothing, Celsius is fine as long as it is consistent",
          "Convert it to Fahrenheit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As with all gas laws, absolute temperature (Kelvin) is required to ensure the mathematical ratios are physically accurate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If both the volume and the absolute temperature of a gas are doubled, what happens to the pressure?",
        "options": [
          "It remains the same",
          "It doubles",
          "It is reduced by half",
          "It quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From $\\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2(2V_1)}{2T_1}$, the '2' in the numerator and '2' in the denominator cancel out, leaving $P_2 = P_1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A weather balloon is released at sea level ($1.0$ atm, $27$°C) with a volume of $100$ L. High in the atmosphere, the pressure is $0.5$ atm and the temperature is $-23$°C. What is the new volume?",
        "options": [
          "166.7 L",
          "200 L",
          "83.3 L",
          "125 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$T_1 = 300$ K, $T_2 = 250$ K. $\\frac{1.0 \\cdot 100}{300} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot V_2}{250}$. $V_2 = \\frac{100 \\cdot 250}{300 \\cdot 0.5} \\approx 166.7$ L."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Combined Gas Law, if the volume is held constant, the relationship between Pressure and Temperature is:",
        "options": [
          "Direct (Gay-Lussac's Law)",
          "Inverse",
          "Exponential",
          "There is no relationship"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $V$ is constant, it cancels out, leaving $\\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2}{T_2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a gas at $100$ kPa and $200$ K is heated to $400$ K while the volume is halved, what is the new pressure?",
        "options": [
          "400 kPa",
          "200 kPa",
          "100 kPa",
          "800 kPa"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Halving the volume doubles the pressure ($200$ kPa). Then, doubling the temperature doubles the pressure again ($400$ kPa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which unit for pressure can be used in the Combined Gas Law?",
        "options": [
          "Any unit, as long as it is the same for both $P_1$ and $P_2$",
          "Only atmospheres (atm)",
          "Only kilopascals (kPa)",
          "Only mmHg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike the Ideal Gas Law (where $R$ dictates the units), the Combined Gas Law is a ratio, so any pressure units will cancel out as long as they match."
