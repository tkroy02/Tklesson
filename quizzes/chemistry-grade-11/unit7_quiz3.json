    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the definition of 'Percent Composition'?",
        "options": [
          "The percent by mass of each element in a compound",
          "The number of atoms of each element in a molecule",
          "The percentage of reactants that turn into products",
          "The volume of an element relative to the total container"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Percent composition is calculated by dividing the mass of a specific element in one mole of the compound by the total molar mass of the compound, then multiplying by 100%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an 'Empirical Formula'?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_2$",
          "$C_2H_4$",
          "$C_6H_{12}$",
          "$H_2O_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An empirical formula is the simplest whole-number ratio. $CH_2$ cannot be simplified further, whereas $C_2H_4$ and $C_6H_{12}$ both simplify to $CH_2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in determining an empirical formula from percent composition data?",
        "options": [
          "Assume a $100$ g sample and convert percentages to grams",
          "Divide the percentages by the smallest percentage",
          "Multiply the percentages by Avogadro's number",
          "Find the molar mass of the final compound"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Assuming a $100$ g sample is a mathematical convenience that allows you to treat percentages directly as mass in grams."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the percent by mass of Oxygen in $MgO$? (Atomic masses: $Mg = 24.3$, $O = 16.0$)",
        "options": [
          "39.7%",
          "60.3%",
          "50.0%",
          "16.0%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molar mass of $MgO = 24.3 + 16.0 = 40.3$ g/mol. Percent $O = (16.0 / 40.3) \\cdot 100 \\approx 39.7$ %."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After converting grams to moles in an empirical formula calculation, what is the next step?",
        "options": [
          "Divide all mole values by the smallest mole value obtained",
          "Round all mole values to the nearest whole number immediately",
          "Multiply the mole values by the molar mass",
          "Average the mole values together"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing by the smallest number of moles helps establish the simplest ratio between the elements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If your mole ratio calculation results in a value of $1.5$, what should you do to find the empirical formula?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply all subscripts by 2 to get whole numbers",
          "Round $1.5$ down to $1$",
          "Round $1.5$ up to $2$",
          "Discard the data as an experimental error"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subscripts in a formula must be whole numbers. If a ratio is $1:1.5$, multiplying by 2 gives a valid $2:3$ ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The empirical formula of a compound is $HO$. Its molar mass is $34.0$ g/mol. What is its molecular formula?",
        "options": [
          "$H_2O_2$",
          "$H_2O$",
          "$HO$",
          "$H_4O_4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The empirical mass of $HO$ is $\\approx 17.0$. Since the molar mass ($34.0$) is twice the empirical mass, we multiply the subscripts by 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: Two different compounds can have the same percent composition.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False",
          "Only if they are both gases",
          "Only if they contain the same number of atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "True. For example, Acetylene ($C_2H_2$) and Benzene ($C_6H_6$) both have the empirical formula $CH$ and thus the same percent composition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the compound $H_2SO_4$, which element contributes the most to the total mass?",

          "Oxygen",
          "Sulfur",
          "Hydrogen",
          "They all contribute equally"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Masses: $H = 2$, $S = 32$, $O = 64$. Even though there are only 4 Oxygen atoms, their combined mass of $64$ g/mol is the largest portion of the $98$ g/mol total."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

          "$NO_2$",
          "$NO_3$",
          "$N_{10}O_{25}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply the $1:2.5$ ratio by 2 to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio of $2:5$."
