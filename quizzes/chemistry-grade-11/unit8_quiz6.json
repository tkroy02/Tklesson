    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct equation for the Ideal Gas Law?",
        "options": [
          "$PV = nRT$",
          "$PT = nRV$",
          "$PV/n = T$",
          "$Pn = VRT$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Ideal Gas Law relates Pressure ($P$), Volume ($V$), amount in moles ($n$), and absolute Temperature ($T$) using the Ideal Gas Constant ($R$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which value of the Ideal Gas Constant ($R$) should be used if the pressure is measured in atmospheres (atm) and volume in liters (L)?",
        "options": [
          "$0.0821$ L·atm/(mol·K)",
          "$8.314$ J/(mol·K)",
          "$62.36$ L·torr/(mol·K)",
          "$1.987$ cal/(mol·K)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The units of $R$ must match the units used for $P$, $V$, and $T$ in the equation to ensure the units cancel correctly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the pressure of an ideal gas if the number of moles ($n$) is doubled while volume and temperature are held constant?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure doubles",
          "The pressure is halved",
          "The pressure remains the same",
          "The pressure quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to $PV = nRT$, pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles. More particles means more frequent collisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many moles of gas are present in a $2.0$ L container at $2.0$ atm and $273$ K? (Use $R = 0.0821$)",
        "options": [
          "$0.18$ mol",
          "$1.0$ mol",
          "$5.5$ mol",
          "$0.50$ mol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$n = PV / RT = (2.0 \\cdot 2.0) / (0.0821 \\cdot 273) \\approx 0.178$ mol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An 'Ideal Gas' is one that:",
        "options": [
          "Follows the gas laws perfectly under all conditions of temperature and pressure",
          "Consists of molecules that attract each other strongly",
          "Has particles that occupy a significant portion of the container volume",
          "Exists only at very high pressures and very low temperatures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An ideal gas is a theoretical construct where particles have no volume and no intermolecular attractions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are solving for Volume ($V$) using the Ideal Gas Law, the rearranged formula is:",
        "options": [
          "$V = nRT / P$",
          "$V = P / nRT$",
          "$V = nRP / T$",
          "$V = nT / RP$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dividing both sides of $PV = nRT$ by $P$ isolates $V$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What volume would $1.00$ mole of an ideal gas occupy at $101.3$ kPa and $273$ K? (Use $R = 8.314$ L·kPa/(mol·K))",
        "options": [
          "$22.4$ L",
          "$11.2$ L",
          "$44.8$ L",
          "$1.00$ L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This represents STP. $V = (1.00 \\cdot 8.314 \\cdot 273) / 101.3 \\approx 22.4$ L."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under which conditions do real gases behave MOST like ideal gases?",
        "options": [
          "High temperature and low pressure",
          "Low temperature and high pressure",
          "High temperature and high pressure",
          "Low temperature and low pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High temperature keeps molecules moving fast (overcoming attractions), and low pressure keeps them far apart (making their volume negligible)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which variable is NOT included in the Ideal Gas Law?",
        "options": [
          "Density",
          "Pressure",
          "Temperature",
          "Moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While density can be derived from the Ideal Gas Law, it is not one of the primary variables ($P, V, n, T$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $PV = nRT$, if the temperature is in Celsius, the calculation will be incorrect because:",
        "options": [
          "The ratio of the variables is only constant on an absolute temperature scale",
          "Celsius values can be zero, which would make the entire equation zero",
          "The gas constant $R$ is only defined for Fahrenheit",
          "The volume of a gas is independent of Celsius temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gas laws require the Kelvin scale because it starts at absolute zero, correctly reflecting the relationship between kinetic energy and temperature."
