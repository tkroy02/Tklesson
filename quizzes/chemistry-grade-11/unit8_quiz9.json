      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Effusion'?",
        "options": [
          "The process by which a gas escapes through a tiny opening into a vacuum",
          "The gradual mixing of two or more gases due to random molecular motion",
          "The change of a gas directly into a solid",
          "The force exerted by gas particles on the walls of a container"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Effusion specifically refers to gas passing through a hole smaller than the mean free path of the particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mathematical expression represents Graham's Law of Effusion?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{Rate}_1 / \\text{Rate}_2 = \\sqrt{M_2 / M_1}$",
          "$\\text{Rate}_1 / \\text{Rate}_2 = M_2 / M_1$",
          "$\\text{Rate}_1 \\cdot M_1 = \\text{Rate}_2 \\cdot M_2$",
          "$\\text{Rate}_1 / \\text{Rate}_2 = \\sqrt{M_1 / M_2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Graham's Law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two gases are at the same temperature, the gas with the ________ molar mass will move faster.",
        "options": [
          "Lower",
          "Higher",
          "Equal",
          "Unknown"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since kinetic energy is $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, at a constant temperature, a smaller mass ($m$) must have a higher velocity ($v$) to maintain the same energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these gases will effuse the fastest?",
        "options": [
          "$H_2$ ($M = 2.0$)",
          "$He$ ($M = 4.0$)",
          "$CH_4$ ($M = 16.0$)",
          "$O_2$ ($M = 32.0$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen has the lowest molar mass of all gases, meaning its molecules have the highest average velocity at any given temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many times faster does Helium ($M = 4$) effuse compared to Oxygen ($M = 32$)?",
        "options": [
          "2.8 times faster",
          "8 times faster",
          "4 times faster",
          "2 times faster"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ratio $= \\sqrt{32 / 4} = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.83$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The process of a perfume scent spreading across a room is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "Diffusion",
          "Effusion",
          "Compression",
          "Sublimation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to low concentration through a medium (like air)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Graham's Law, if the molar mass of Gas A is 4 times that of Gas B, then Gas B will move ________ as fast as Gas A.",
        "options": [
          "2 times",
          "4 times",
          "16 times",
          "0.5 times"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sqrt{4 / 1} = 2$. Therefore, the lighter gas (B) moves twice as fast."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do balloon manufacturers often use Mylar instead of latex for Helium balloons?",
        "options": [
          "Helium effuses through the larger pores of latex much faster",
          "Mylar is lighter than Helium",
          "Latex reacts chemically with Helium",
          "Helium is attracted to the surface of Mylar"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because Helium atoms are very small and move very fast, they can easily escape (effuse) through the microscopic gaps in latex rubber."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the rate of diffusion of a gas if the temperature is increased?",
        "options": [
          "The rate increases",
          "The rate decreases",
          "The rate remains the same",
          "The rate becomes unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing temperature increases the average kinetic energy and velocity of the molecules, leading to faster mixing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of Graham's Law, 'Rate' usually refers to:",
        "options": [
          "Amount of gas (moles or volume) moved per unit time",
          "The density of the gas",
          "The total pressure of the gas",
          "The temperature of the gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate is a measure of speed—how much gas moves from point A to point B in a specific timeframe."
