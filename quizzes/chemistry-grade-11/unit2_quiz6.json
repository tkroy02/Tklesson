    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the general trend for atomic radius across a period from left to right?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases due to increasing effective nuclear charge",
          "It increases due to the addition of more electron shells",
          "It stays the same because the principal quantum number is constant",
          "It increases due to increased electron-electron repulsion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As you move across a period, more protons are added to the nucleus without adding new shells, pulling the electron cloud closer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason atomic radius increases as you move down a group?",
        "options": [
          "The addition of new principal energy levels (shells)",
          "A decrease in the number of neutrons",
          "The effective nuclear charge increases significantly",
          "The electrons are moving faster in their orbitals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each row down a group adds a new shell ($n$ increases), which places the valence electrons much further from the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the size of a cation compare to its parent neutral atom?",
        "options": [
          "The cation is smaller than the neutral atom",
          "The cation is larger than the neutral atom",
          "They are the same size since they have the same number of protons",
          "The size depends on the isotope of the element"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cations lose electrons, often losing an entire outer shell and reducing electron-electron repulsion, allowing the nucleus to pull remaining electrons in tighter."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following species is the largest in size?",
        "options": [
          "$O^{2-}$",
          "$F^-$",
          "$Ne$",
          "$Na^+$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are isoelectronic (all have 10 electrons). Oxygen has the fewest protons (8), meaning it has the weakest pull on the electron cloud, making it the largest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Anions are always larger than their parent neutral atoms because:",
        "options": [
          "Added electrons increase electron-electron repulsion",
          "The nucleus gains a neutron to balance the charge",
          "The effective nuclear charge increases",
          "The principal quantum number $n$ decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding electrons to the same shell increases repulsion between them, causing the electron cloud to expand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element in Period 3 has the smallest atomic radius?",
        "options": [
          "Argon (Ar)",
          "Sodium (Na)",
          "Aluminum (Al)",
          "Silicon (Si)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Argon is at the far right of the period, possessing the highest effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) for that row."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the halogen group (Group 17), which element has the largest atomic radius?",
        "options": [
          "Iodine (I)",
          "Fluorine (F)",
          "Chlorine (Cl)",
          "Bromine (Br)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iodine is furthest down the group among the choices, meaning it has the most occupied electron shells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor most influences the 'shielding effect' in larger atoms?",
        "options": [
          "The number of core electrons",
          "The number of valence electrons",
          "The spin of the electrons",
          "The shape of the p-orbitals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Core electrons shield the valence electrons from the full attractive force of the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Arrange the following in order of decreasing atomic radius: $K, Li, Na$.",
        "options": [
          "$K > Na > Li$",
          "$Li > Na > K$",
          "$Na > K > Li$",
          "$K > Li > Na$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All are in Group 1; size increases as you move down the group ($n=4, 3, 2$ respectively)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the ionic radius of group 16 elements as you move from Oxygen to Tellurium?",
        "options": [
          "It increases",
          "It decreases",
          "It remains constant",
          "It decreases then increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As you go down the group, even for ions, the number of shells increases, leading to a larger radius."
