        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By convention, elements in their standard states (like $O_2(g)$ or $Fe(s)$) are the baseline for enthalpy, so their formation value is exactly zero."

          "Graphite",
          "Diamond",

          "Neither is zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Graphite is the most stable form of carbon at standard conditions, so it is the reference state."

          "A strong oxidizing agent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative formation enthalpy means energy was released when it formed; the lower the energy, the more stable the compound."

        "question": "In the summation formula, what do the variables '$n$' and '$m$' represent?",
