    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of isomerism occurs when the ligands and counter-ions in a coordination compound swap places?",
        "options": [
          "Ionization Isomerism",
          "Linkage Isomerism",
          "Geometric Isomerism",
          "Optical Isomerism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionization isomers yield different ions in solution, such as $[Co(NH_3)_5Br]SO_4$ vs. $[Co(NH_3)_5SO_4]Br$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Linkage isomerism is possible when a ligand is 'ambidentate'. What does this mean?",
        "options": [
          "The ligand can bind to the metal through more than one different atom",
          "The ligand has two identical donor atoms",
          "The ligand can only bind to the metal once",
          "The ligand is always neutral"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ambidentate ligands like $SCN^-$ can bind through the Sulfur ($M-SCN$) or the Nitrogen ($M-NCS$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In square planar or octahedral complexes, 'cis' and 'trans' isomers are examples of:",
        "options": [
          "Geometric Isomerism",
          "Linkage Isomerism",
          "Optical Isomerism",
          "Coordination Isomerism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Geometric isomers have the same atoms and bonds but different spatial arrangements (adjacent for 'cis', opposite for 'trans')."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What defines 'Optical Isomers' (Enantiomers) in coordination chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "They are non-superimposable mirror images of each other",
          "They have different chemical formulas but the same name",
          "They have different boiling points and densities",
          "One is a metal and the other is a non-metal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enantiomers are like left and right hands; they are mirror images that cannot be perfectly aligned on top of each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which geometry is most likely to exhibit optical isomerism, especially with chelating ligands?",
        "options": [
          "Octahedral",
          "Square Planar",
          "Linear",
          "Trigonal Planar"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Octahedral complexes, particularly those with bidentate ligands like $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$, frequently form chiral structures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The famous anti-cancer drug 'Cisplatin' is a geometric isomer of $[Pt(NH_3)_2Cl_2]$. Why is its 'trans' version not used for the same treatment?",
        "options": [
          "Isomers can have vastly different biological activities",
          "The trans isomer is a gas at room temperature",
          "The trans isomer has no Chlorine atoms",
          "The trans isomer is not a coordination compound"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In medicine, the specific spatial arrangement is vital; the 'cis' configuration allows the drug to bind to DNA in a way the 'trans' version cannot."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a ligand like $NO_2^-$ binds to a metal through Nitrogen in one compound and through Oxygen in another, these are:",
        "options": [
          "Linkage isomers",
          "Geometric isomers",
          "Ionization isomers",
          "Optical isomers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the point of attachment (the link) has changed, these are linkage isomers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Geometric isomerism (cis/trans) is NOT possible in which of the following geometries?",
        "options": [
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Square Planar",
          "Octahedral",
          "None; it is possible in all of these"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a tetrahedron, all positions are adjacent to each other, so 'trans' (opposite) positions do not exist."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Optical isomers are primarily distinguished by their ability to:",
        "options": [
          "Rotate the plane of polarized light",
          "Change color when heated",
          "Conduct electricity in the solid state",
          "Dissolve in non-polar solvents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enantiomers are 'optically active,' meaning they rotate polarized light in opposite directions (levorotatory vs. dextrorotatory)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a type of structural isomerism (rather than stereoisomerism)?",
        "options": [
          "Coordination Isomerism",
          "Geometric Isomerism",
          "Optical Isomerism",
          "Facial (fac) Isomerism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Structural isomers (like coordination, linkage, and ionization) involve a change in which atoms are actually bonded to each other."
