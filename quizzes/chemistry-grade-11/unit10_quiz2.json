    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Recognizing electron transfer processes",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following defines 'Oxidation' in terms of electron transfer?",
        "options": [
          "The loss of electrons",
          "The gain of electrons",
          "The gain of protons",
          "The loss of neutrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation involves a substance losing electrons, which results in an increase in its oxidation number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the oxidation number of a substance that undergoes 'Reduction'?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases (becomes more negative)",
          "It increases (becomes more positive)",
          "It remains exactly the same",
          "It becomes zero immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reduction is the gain of electrons. Since electrons are negatively charged, gaining them reduces the oxidation state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a redox reaction, the 'Reducing Agent' is the substance that:",
        "options": [
          "Is oxidized (loses electrons)",
          "Is reduced (gains electrons)",
          "Decreases its own oxidation number",
          "Accepts electrons from another atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reducing agent *causes* reduction in another substance by donating its own electrons; therefore, it is the substance being oxidized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of reaction is generally NOT a redox reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Double-replacement (precipitation)",
          "Single-replacement",
          "Combustion",
          "Synthesis involving pure elements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In most double-replacement reactions, ions simply swap partners without any change in their oxidation states."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $Zn + Cu^{2+} \\rightarrow Zn^{2+} + Cu$, which species is being oxidized?",
        "options": [
          "$Zn$",
          "$Cu^{2+}$",
          "$Zn^{2+}$",
          "$Cu$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zinc starts at an oxidation state of 0 and goes to +2, meaning it lost two electrons (Oxidation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $2Mg + O_2 \\rightarrow 2MgO$, which species is the oxidizing agent?",
        "options": [
          "$O_2$",
          "$Mg$",
          "$MgO$",
          "No oxidizing agent exists"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen is reduced (goes from 0 to -2). Because it is reduced, it acts as the oxidizing agent for the Magnesium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance that has a high affinity for electrons and causes another substance to be oxidized is called a/an:",
        "options": [
          "Oxidizing agent",
          "Reducing agent",
          "Catalyst",
          "Spectator ion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidizing agents gain electrons (are reduced) while taking them from something else."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $Fe + 2HCl \\rightarrow FeCl_2 + H_2$, what is the change in the oxidation number of Hydrogen?",
        "options": [
          "From +1 to 0",
          "From 0 to +1",
          "From -1 to 0",
          "It does not change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen in $HCl$ is +1. In $H_2$ gas, it is an element in its free state, which is 0. This is reduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must oxidation and reduction always occur together in a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons must be conserved; they cannot be created or destroyed",
          "Protons must always equal electrons in every compound",
          "Oxygen is required for all chemical reactions",
          "Reduction only happens in a vacuum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If one substance loses electrons, another substance must be present to accept them. You cannot have a 'loss' without a 'gain' elsewhere."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a classic mnemonic for remembering redox processes?",
        "options": [
          "OIL RIG (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain)",
          "PV = nRT",
          "ROY G BIV",
          "SOH CAH TOA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "OIL RIG is a widely used mnemonic to remember that Oxidation involves Loss and Reduction involves Gain of electrons."
