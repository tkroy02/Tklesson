        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs. The lone pairs push the hydrogen atoms closer together, resulting in a 'bent' or V-shape."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A bond angle significantly smaller than 109.5° (like in water) indicates the presence of two lone pairs compressing the angle."
