    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an **exothermic** reaction ($A + B \\rightleftharpoons C + heat$), increasing the temperature will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift the equilibrium to the left and decrease the value of K",
          "Shift the equilibrium to the right and increase the value of K",
          "Shift the equilibrium to the left but keep K the same",
          "Have no effect on the position of equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an exothermic reaction, heat is a product. Adding heat (increasing temperature) drives the reaction backward to consume the excess energy, which lowers the product-to-reactant ratio (K)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an **endothermic** reaction ($heat + A \\rightleftharpoons B$), what happens when the temperature is increased?",
        "options": [
          "The equilibrium shifts to the right and K increases",
          "The equilibrium shifts to the left and K decreases",
          "The equilibrium shifts to the right but K remains constant",
          "The reaction stops because it runs out of energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat is a reactant in endothermic processes. Increasing temperature is like adding more reactant, which shifts the system to the right and increases the equilibrium constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of adding a **catalyst** to a system at equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "It has no effect on the equilibrium position or the value of K",
          "It shifts the equilibrium toward the products",
          "It increases the value of K by lowering the activation energy",
          "It shifts the equilibrium toward the side with more moles of gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A catalyst speeds up the forward and reverse reactions equally. It helps a system *reach* equilibrium faster, but it does not change the concentrations once equilibrium is established."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If cooling a reaction mixture causes it to turn from blue to pink, and pink is the product, the reaction must be:",
        "options": [
          "Exothermic",
          "Endothermic",
          "Athermal (no heat change)",
          "Catalyzed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If removing heat (cooling) shifts the reaction toward the products, then heat must be a product. This defines an exothermic reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the **only** factor that can change the numerical value of the equilibrium constant K?",
        "options": [
          "Temperature",
          "Pressure",
          "Concentration",
          "Addition of a catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While other factors cause shifts in the *position* of equilibrium (changing Q), only temperature changes the actual ratio defined by K."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the Haber process ($N_{2} + 3H_{2} \\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3} + 92 kJ$), why is a moderate temperature used industrially instead of a very low one?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure the reaction occurs at a practical speed",
          "To increase the value of K to its maximum",
          "To prevent the catalyst from melting",
          "To shift the equilibrium toward the reactants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Although low temperature favors the product (exothermic), it would make the reaction too slow to be useful. A compromise temperature provides a balance between yield and speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Decreasing the temperature of an endothermic reaction will:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease the value of K",
          "Increase the value of K",
          "Not change the value of K",
          "Increase the rate of the forward reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Removing heat from an endothermic reaction (where heat is a reactant) shifts the equilibrium to the left, resulting in a smaller K."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A catalyst increases the rate of both forward and reverse reactions by:",
        "options": [
          "Lowering the activation energy for both directions",
          "Increasing the enthalpy of the reactants",
          "Providing extra thermal energy to the molecules",
          "Increasing the concentration of the activated complex"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By providing a different mechanism with a lower 'energy hill', it makes it easier for molecules to go both ways, without changing the net energy difference between start and finish."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is endothermic, a plot of $\\ln K$ vs. $1/T$ (in Kelvin) will have a:",
        "options": [
          "Negative slope",
          "Positive slope",
          "Zero slope (horizontal line)",
          "Parabolic curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $T$ increases, $1/T$ decreases. In an endothermic reaction, increasing $T$ increases $K$. This inverse relationship results in a negative slope ($-\u0394H/R$) on a van't Hoff plot."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a reaction where $\\Delta H = 0$ (no heat change), how does temperature affect the equilibrium position?",
        "options": [
          "It has no effect on the equilibrium position or K",
          "It favors the products",
          "It favors the reactants",
          "It makes the reaction irreversible"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If there is no heat absorbed or released, heat is neither a reactant nor a product. Therefore, Le Chatelier's Principle predicts no shift due to temperature changes."
