    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in drawing the Lewis structure for a complex polyatomic molecule?",
        "options": [
          "Sum the total number of valence electrons for all atoms",
          "Determine the central atom based on electronegativity",
          "Draw double bonds between all atoms initially",
          "Subtract electrons for every negative charge on the ion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To ensure the structure is valid, you must first calculate the total pool of valence electrons available for bonding and lone pairs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Lewis structure, which atom is generally chosen as the central atom?",
        "options": [
          "The least electronegative atom (excluding Hydrogen)",
          "The most electronegative atom",
          "The atom with the smallest atomic mass",
          "Always the first atom written in the chemical formula"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The least electronegative atom is typically better at sharing electrons and thus acts as the central hub for the molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How should you adjust the total valence electron count for a polyatomic ion with a $2-$ charge?",
        "options": [
          "Add 2 electrons to the total count",
          "Subtract 2 electrons from the total count",
          "Multiply the total count by 2",
          "The charge does not affect the electron count"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative charge indicates that the molecule has gained extra electrons, which must be accounted for in the Lewis structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the central atom does not have an octet after distributing all electrons as lone pairs, what is the next step?",
        "options": [
          "Form multiple bonds (double or triple) using lone pairs from terminal atoms",
          "Add more electrons to the molecule from an external source",
          "Remove electrons from the terminal atoms to satisfy the center",
          "Leave the central atom with an incomplete octet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lone pairs from terminal atoms can be shared with the central atom to form double or triple bonds to satisfy the octet rule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many total valence electrons are available for the nitrate ion ($NO_3^-$)?",
        "options": [
          "24",
          "23",
          "22",
          "26"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen has 5, three Oxygens have 18 ($3 \\times 6$), plus 1 for the negative charge: $5 + 18 + 1 = 24$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following atoms can NEVER be a central atom in a Lewis structure?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen (H)",
          "Carbon (C)",
          "Phosphorus (P)",
          "Sulfur (S)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen only needs 2 electrons to fill its valence shell (a duet), so it can only form one bond and must remain a terminal atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a single dash (—) represent in a Lewis structure?",
        "options": [
          "A shared pair of electrons (2 electrons)",
          "A single valence electron",
          "A lone pair of electrons",
          "The nucleus of the atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A line represents a covalent bond, which consists of two electrons shared between two atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Lewis structure for Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$), how many double bonds are present?",

          "2",
          "1",
          "0",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To satisfy the octets of all three atoms with only 16 valence electrons, Carbon forms a double bond with each Oxygen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When drawing the Lewis structure for Ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$), what is the arrangement of the 'backbone'?",
        "options": [
          "$C-C-O$",
          "$C-O-C$",
          "$O-C-C$",
          "$H-C-O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In organic molecules, carbons often link to each other, followed by functional groups like oxygen."

          "35",
          "45",
          "30"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phosphorus has 5 valence electrons, and five Chlorines have 35 ($5 \\times 7$). Total: $5 + 35 = 40$."
