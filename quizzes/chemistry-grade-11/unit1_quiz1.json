      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For which of the following species does the Bohr model provide the most mathematically accurate predictions?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{Li}^{2+}$",
          "Neutral Helium (He)",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Bohr model is only accurate for 'hydrogen-like' species, which possess exactly one electron. $\\text{Li}^{2+}$ has one electron."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which fundamental principle of modern physics was violated by Bohr's suggestion of 'well-defined' orbits?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heisenberg's principle states that position and momentum cannot be known simultaneously; Bohr's orbits required knowing both exactly."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What primary interaction is ignored by the Bohr model in multi-electron atoms?",

          "The charge of the proton"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bohr's equations do not account for the complex electrostatic repulsions that occur between multiple electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The splitting of spectral lines when an atom is placed in a magnetic field is known as what?",

          "The Photoelectric effect",
          "The Tyndall effect",
          "The Doppler effect"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Zeeman effect proved that energy levels were more complex than Bohr's model could explain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Bohr's model was limited because it treated the electron strictly as a:",

          "Particle with a localized position",
          "Wave with a specific frequency",
          "Massless packet of energy",
          "Stationary charge in the nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bohr ignored the wave-like nature of electrons, treating them only as particles moving in orbits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What did the 'Fine Structure' of the hydrogen spectrum reveal about Bohr's energy levels?",
        "options": [
          "Energy levels are actually composed of closely spaced sub-levels",
          "Energy levels are continuous rather than discrete",
          "Electrons do not actually occupy energy levels",
          "The nucleus changes shape during electron transitions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High-resolution spectra showed that what Bohr thought was one line was actually several, indicating subshells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scientist's hypothesis regarding the wave nature of matter directly challenged Bohr's particle-only orbits?",
        "options": [
          "Louis de Broglie",
          "John Dalton",
          "Ernest Rutherford",
          "James Chadwick"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "De Broglie proposed that all matter, including electrons, has wave properties, which Bohr's model failed to incorporate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Bohr model, what happens to an electron as it moves to an orbit further from the nucleus?",
        "options": [
          "It absorbs a specific quantum of energy",
          "It releases a specific quantum of energy",
          "Its mass increases significantly",
          "It loses its electrical charge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moving to a higher orbit requires the absorption of energy, though the model fails to explain how this works in complex atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Bohr model's inability to predict the relative intensities of spectral lines suggested that:",
        "options": [
          "The probability of transitions was not accounted for",
          "All transitions are equally likely to occur",
          "Light does not behave as a photon",
          "The nucleus is not involved in light emission"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bohr's model could predict some line positions but not why some lines were brighter (more probable) than others."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following was a successful aspect of Bohr's model that was retained in the Quantum Mechanical model?",

          "The neglect of wave mechanics"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the orbits were discarded, the fundamental idea that energy states are quantized remained core to quantum mechanics."
