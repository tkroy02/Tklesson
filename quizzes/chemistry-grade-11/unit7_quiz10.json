    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental measurement taken in gravimetric analysis?",
        "options": [
          "Mass",
          "Volume",
          "Absorbance",
          "Temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravimetric analysis relies on the high precision of an analytical balance to determine the quantity of an analyte by weighing a solid derivative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which process is commonly used in gravimetric analysis to separate the analyte from the rest of the solution?",
        "options": [
          "Precipitation",
          "Titration",
          "Distillation",
          "Chromatography"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A reagent is added to react with the analyte to form an insoluble solid (precipitate), which can then be isolated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must a precipitate be 'dried to constant mass' in a gravimetric experiment?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure all residual water or solvent has been evaporated",
          "To allow the crystals to grow larger for easier viewing",
          "To prevent the filter paper from burning",
          "To speed up the chemical reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any remaining moisture will add extra weight to the sample, leading to a falsely high calculation of the analyte's mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following properties is MOST desirable for a precipitate used in gravimetric analysis?",
        "options": [
          "Low solubility (very insoluble)",
          "High reactivity with air",
          "Small particle size that passes through filter paper",
          "An unknown chemical formula"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To be accurate, the precipitate must be as insoluble as possible so that none of the analyte remains dissolved in the solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are determining the amount of Chloride ($Cl^-$) in a sample, which reagent would be best to form a precipitate?",
        "options": [
          "Silver Nitrate ($AgNO_3$)",
          "Sodium Chloride ($NaCl$)",
          "Potassium Hydroxide ($KOH$)",
          "Hydrochloric Acid ($HCl$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Silver ions ($Ag^+$) react with chloride ions ($Cl^-$) to form $AgCl$, a very insoluble white solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of 'washing' the precipitate on the filter paper?",
        "options": [
          "To remove soluble impurities trapped in the solid",
          "To dissolve the precipitate into a new beaker",
          "To change the color of the final product",
          "To neutralize the pH of the solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Washing with a small amount of cold solvent removes any leftover dissolved ions or reagents that might dry onto the solid and add mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a gravimetric determination of $Ba^{2+}$, a student collects $1.00$ g of $BaSO_4$. How would they find the mass of Barium in the sample?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply the mass of $BaSO_4$ by the mass fraction of $Ba$ in $BaSO_4$",
          "Divide the mass of $BaSO_4$ by the volume of the solution",
          "Assume the mass of Barium is exactly $1.00$ g",
          "Subtract the mass of the filter paper from the volume"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the 'gravimetric factor' (the ratio of the molar mass of $Ba$ to the molar mass of $BaSO_4$) allows you to calculate the portion of the total mass belonging to the analyte."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these errors would lead to a calculated percent of analyte that is TOO HIGH?",
        "options": [
          "Incomplete drying of the precipitate",
          "Loss of some precipitate during filtration",
          "Using a reagent that does not react completely",
          "Using too much wash water that slightly dissolves the solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Extra mass from water makes the precipitate seem heavier than it truly is, inflating the final result."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Digestion' in the context of gravimetric analysis?",
        "options": [
          "Allowing the precipitate to sit in the mother liquor to grow larger, purer crystals",
          "Adding acid to dissolve the precipitate",
          "Burning the filter paper in a crucible",
          "Testing the solution for the presence of excess ions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Digestion (heating the solution for a period) helps small particles dissolve and re-deposit onto larger crystals, making filtration easier and more accurate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equipment is used to cool a dried sample in a moisture-free environment?",
        "options": [
          "Desiccator",
          "Oven",
          "Burette",
          "Fume Hood"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A desiccator contains a drying agent (desiccant) that prevents the hot, dry sample from absorbing moisture from the air as it cools."
