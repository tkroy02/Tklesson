        "options": [
          "Free rotation is possible around $\\sigma$ bonds, but restricted around $\\pi$ bonds",
          "Rotation is restricted for both $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ bonds",

          "$\\pi$ bonds allow for faster rotation than $\\sigma$ bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rotating a $\pi$ bond would break the side-to-side overlap of the $p$ orbitals, whereas rotating a $\sigma$ bond maintains the head-on overlap."

          "Three $\\pi$ bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen atoms are triple-bonded. The first bond is a sigma bond formed by $sp$ hybrids or $p_x$ orbitals, and the other two are pi bonds."

          "A sigma ($\\sigma$) bond",
          "A pi ($\\pi$) bond",
          "They are equal in strength",
          "The strength depends only on the atoms' masses"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sigma bonds generally have greater orbital overlap than pi bonds, making them more stable and harder to break."

          "They disappear and are replaced by $d$ orbitals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $p$ orbitals involved in pi bonding are unhybridized and must be parallel to each other and perpendicular to the internuclear axis."
