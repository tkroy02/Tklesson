      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between a 'state' in classical mechanics and a 'state' in quantum mechanics?",
        "options": [
          "Quantum states are described by probability amplitudes (wavefunctions)",
          "Quantum states describe the exact path of the particle",

          "Classical states are restricted to discrete energy values"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In quantum mechanics, a state is defined by a wavefunction ($\\psi$), which provides the probability distribution of a particle's properties rather than a definite trajectory."
      },
      {

          "The Arrhenius Equation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Schrödinger equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of quantum theory, what does the square of the wavefunction ($|\\psi|^2$) represent?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Max Born's interpretation, $|\\psi|^2$ gives the probability of finding the electron at a given point in space."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does it mean for a system to be 'quantized'?",
        "options": [
          "The system can only exist in specific, discrete energy levels",
          "The system can take on any continuous value of energy",
          "The system is only composed of protons and neutrons",
          "The system is traveling at the speed of light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Quantization refers to the phenomenon where physical properties, such as energy, occur only in fixed 'packets' or steps."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Quantum mechanics describes electrons in atoms as 'standing waves.' What is a key characteristic of these waves?",
        "options": [
          "They do not travel through space but exist in a fixed region around the nucleus",
          "They vibrate at the speed of sound",
          "They only exist when the atom is in a liquid state",
          "They carry no energy whatsoever"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Atomic orbitals are essentially three-dimensional standing waves that describe the volume of space where an electron is likely to be found."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a 'boundary condition' that must be met by a valid wavefunction in an atom?",
        "options": [
          "The wavefunction must approach zero at an infinite distance from the nucleus",
          "The wavefunction must be infinite at the center of the nucleus",
          "The electron must stay on a two-dimensional plane",
          "The wavefunction must only contain real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A valid wavefunction must be 'well-behaved,' meaning it must be finite and approach zero as distance increases, as an electron cannot be found infinitely far away."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Quantum mechanics successfully explained the stability of atoms by showing that:",
        "options": [
          "Electrons in 'stationary states' do not radiate energy while in that state",
          "Electrons are physically glued to the nucleus",
          "Centripetal force is stronger than electrostatic attraction",
          "Gravity holds the electrons in place"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Quantum theory posits that electrons exist in stable states where they do not continuously lose energy, solving the collapse problem of classical physics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'Orbital' in quantum mechanics refers to:",
        "options": [
          "A region of space with a high probability of finding an electron",
          "A circular track that the electron follows",
          "The physical shell of the nucleus",
          "The path light takes when entering an atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike the Bohr 'orbit,' an 'orbital' is a probability map or a cloud, not a path."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scientist is credited with the 'statistical interpretation' of the wavefunction?",

          "Max Born",
          "Albert Einstein",
          "Niels Bohr",
          "Gilbert Lewis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Max Born proposed that the wavefunction describes probabilities rather than the actual physical 'smearing' of the particle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Quantum mechanics is a 'non-deterministic' theory. This means:",
        "options": [
          "We can only predict the probability of an outcome, not the exact outcome itself",
          "The laws of physics do not apply to small particles",
          "Atoms are created at random intervals",
          "The mass of an electron changes depending on our mood"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non-determinism implies that even with perfect initial information, we can only calculate the likelihood of where an electron will appear."
