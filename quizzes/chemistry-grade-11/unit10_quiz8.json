          "$K = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A spontaneous reaction favors the products at equilibrium, meaning the equilibrium constant will be greater than $1$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spontaneity is defined by a positive voltage, a release of free energy (negative $\\Delta G$), and a product-favored equilibrium ($K > 1$)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship between $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}}$ and the equilibrium constant $K$ at $25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ is often simplified to:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, there is no net driving force for the reaction to move in either direction, so work potential and free energy change are both zero."

          "At equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A large positive $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ means the reaction is highly non-spontaneous; it would be an electrolytic cell, not a Galvanic one."
