    "topic": "Salt solutions as acids or bases",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A salt formed from a **Strong Acid** and a **Strong Base** (like $NaCl$) will produce a solution that is:",
        "options": [
          "Neutral (pH = 7)",
          "Acidic (pH < 7)",
          "Basic (pH > 7)",
          "Amphoteric"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ions like $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ are conjugate partners of strong species; they have no measurable tendency to react with water, leaving the pH neutral."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following salts will produce a **Basic** solution when dissolved in water?",
        "options": [
          "$KCH_3COO$ (Potassium acetate)",
          "$NH_4Cl$ (Ammonium chloride)",
          "$KNO_3$ (Potassium nitrate)",
          "$CaCl_2$ (Calcium chloride)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Potassium acetate comes from a strong base ($KOH$) and a weak acid ($CH_3COOH$). The acetate ion ($CH_3COO^-$) undergoes hydrolysis to produce $OH^-$ ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the salt $NH_4Cl$ dissolves, why does the solution become acidic?",
        "options": [
          "The $NH_4^+$ ion donates a proton to water, forming $H_3O^+$",
          "The $Cl^-$ ion reacts with water to produce $HCl$",
          "The $NH_4^+$ ion reacts with $OH^-$ to produce ammonia",
          "The salt contains hidden $HCl$ molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ammonium ($NH_4^+$) is the conjugate acid of a weak base ($NH_3$). It acts as a weak acid in water: $NH_4^+ + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons NH_3 + H_3O^+$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Anions that are conjugate bases of **Weak Acids** will generally produce solutions that are:",
        "options": [
          "Basic",
          "Acidic",
          "Neutral",
          "Highly explosive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These anions (like $F^-$, $CN^-$, or $CO_3^{2-}$) act as Brønsted-Lowry bases by accepting protons from water, releasing $OH^-$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which ion is considered a 'Spectator Ion' in terms of acid-base chemistry in water?",
        "options": [
          "$Cl^-$",
          "$F^-$",
          "$NH_4^+$",
          "$CO_3^{2-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chloride is the conjugate base of a strong acid ($HCl$). Its affinity for protons is so low that it does not affect the pH of the solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the pH of a solution of $NaNO_3$?",
        "options": [
          "7.0",
          "1.0",
          "13.0",
          "9.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$NaNO_3$ is formed from a strong base ($NaOH$) and a strong acid ($HNO_3$). Neither ion undergoes hydrolysis, so the solution remains neutral."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a salt is formed from a **Weak Acid** and a **Weak Base**, how is the pH of the solution determined?",
        "options": [
          "By comparing the Ka of the cation and the Kb of the anion",
          "The solution is always neutral",
          "The solution is always acidic",
          "The solution is always basic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $K_a > K_b$, the solution is acidic. If $K_b > K_a$, it is basic. If they are equal, it is neutral."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Small, highly charged metal cations (like $Al^{3+}$ or $Fe^{3+}$) tend to produce ________ solutions.",
        "options": [
          "Acidic",
          "Basic",
          "Neutral",
          "Inert"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These cations attract the lone pairs of water molecules so strongly that they weaken the $O-H$ bonds in the water, allowing $H^+$ to be released into the solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these salts will have the highest pH in a 0.1 M solution?",
        "options": [
          "$Na_2CO_3$",
          "$NaCl$",
          "$NH_4NO_3$",
          "$AlCl_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Na_2CO_3$ contains the carbonate ion, which is a relatively strong weak base. $NaCl$ is neutral, while the others are acidic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydrolysis is best described as a reaction between ________ and ________.",
        "options": [
          "Salt ions; water",
          "Acid; base",
          "Protons; electrons",
          "Metal; non-metal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrolysis literally means 'water splitting'—in this case, salt ions 'splitting' water molecules to produce acidity or basicity."
