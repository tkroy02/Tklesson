      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Collision Theory, which of the following is required for a collision to be 'effective' (result in a reaction)?",
        "options": [
          "Both sufficient kinetic energy and correct molecular orientation",
          "Only high kinetic energy",
          "Only the presence of a catalyst",
          "A large number of molecules in the gaseous state"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even high-energy collisions will fail if the reactive parts of the molecules do not hit each other in the correct alignment to break and form bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The minimum energy required for a collision to result in a chemical reaction is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Activation Energy ($E_{a}$)",
          "Enthalpy of Reaction ($\\Delta H$)",
          "Kinetic Energy ($KE$)",
          "Free Energy ($\\Delta G$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Activation energy is the 'threshold' or 'barrier' that molecules must overcome to transform from reactants to products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Activated Complex' (or Transition State)?",
        "options": [
          "A temporary, high-energy arrangement of atoms where old bonds are breaking and new bonds are forming",
          "The stable product formed at the end of a reaction",
          "The catalyst that speeds up the reaction",
          "The lowest energy point on a potential energy diagram"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The activated complex exists at the very peak of the activation energy barrier and is extremely unstable and short-lived."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a potential energy diagram, the distance from the energy of the reactants to the peak of the curve represents:",
        "options": [
          "The Activation Energy ($E_{a}$)",
          "The Enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$)",
          "The total energy of the products",
          "The entropy of the system"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This 'hill' represents the energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to proceed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the value of the Activation Energy ($E_{a}$) typically relate to the reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "Higher $E_{a}$ results in a slower reaction rate",
          "Higher $E_{a}$ results in a faster reaction rate",
          "The value of $E_{a}$ has no effect on the rate",
          "Lower $E_{a}$ results in a slower reaction rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A higher barrier means fewer molecules will have enough thermal energy to climb over it, leading to fewer successful collisions per second."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an **exothermic** reaction, the potential energy of the products is ________ the potential energy of the reactants.",
        "options": [
          "Lower than",
          "Higher than",
          "Equal to",
          "Exactly double"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exothermic reactions release energy to the surroundings, meaning the products are more stable and have less potential energy than the starting materials."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is reversible, the activation energy for the **reverse** reaction is:",
        "options": [
          "The energy difference between the products and the activated complex",
          "Always the same as the forward activation energy",
          "Equal to the $\\Delta H$ of the reaction",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To go backward, the products must climb the 'hill' back to the transition state. If the forward reaction is exothermic, the reverse $E_{a}$ is much higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a 10\u00b0C increase in temperature often double the reaction rate?",
        "options": [
          "It significantly increases the fraction of molecules with energy $\\ge E_{a}$",
          "It doubles the velocity of the molecules",
          "It lowers the activation energy of the reaction",
          "It changes the orientation of the molecules to be more favorable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature increases the average kinetic energy, but it disproportionately increases the number of 'high-energy' molecules that can clear the $E_{a}$ barrier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The orientation factor in collision theory is most critical for:",
        "options": [
          "Complex molecules with specific reactive sites",
          "Monatomic ions in a vacuum",
          "Spherical noble gas atoms",
          "Simple diatomic molecules like $H_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Large, complex molecules like proteins or organic compounds must collide at a very specific angle for the functional groups to interact."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the potential energy diagram of a reaction when a catalyst is added?",
        "options": [
          "The peak (activated complex) is lowered, reducing the $E_{a}$",
          "The energy of the reactants is increased",
          "The energy of the products is decreased",
          "The entire curve is shifted to the right"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts provide an alternative mechanism that has a lower energy transition state, effectively lowering the 'hill' without changing the energy of reactants or products."
