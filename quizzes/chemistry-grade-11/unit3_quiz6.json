        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The axial atoms are located at opposite poles of the central atom, creating a straight line with an angle of 180° between them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an octahedral geometry, such as $SF_6$, what are the bond angles between any two adjacent atoms?",
        "options": [

          "Trigonal pyramidal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, lone pairs occupy equatorial positions first to minimize repulsion. One lone pair results in a 'see-saw' shape."

          "T-shaped"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an octahedral arrangement, two lone pairs will position themselves 180° apart (axial) to minimize repulsion, leaving the four bonding atoms in a 'square planar' shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecules exhibits a T-shaped molecular geometry?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorine trifluoride has five electron domains (3 bonds, 2 lone pairs). The two lone pairs in equatorial positions leave the atoms in a T-shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-group geometry, why do lone pairs prefer equatorial positions over axial positions?",
        "options": [
          "Equatorial positions have more space (90° and 120° neighbors) compared to axial positions (three 90° neighbors)",
          "Axial positions are further from the nucleus",
          "The equatorial plane is more electronegative",
          "Equatorial positions have no repulsive forces"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equatorial positions experience less repulsion because they only have two 90° neighbors, whereas axial positions have three."
