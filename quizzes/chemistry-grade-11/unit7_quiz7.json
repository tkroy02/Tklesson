    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for calculating 'Percent Yield'?",
        "options": [
          "$(\\text{Actual Yield} / \\text{Theoretical Yield}) \\cdot 100$",
          "$(\\text{Theoretical Yield} / \\text{Actual Yield}) \\cdot 100$",
          "$(\\text{Actual Yield} + \\text{Theoretical Yield}) / 2$",
          "$(\\text{Actual Yield} - \\text{Theoretical Yield}) \\cdot 100$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Percent yield expresses the ratio of what was actually produced in the lab to what was mathematically predicted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Actual Yield' of a reaction is almost always ________ than the 'Theoretical Yield'.",
        "options": [
          "Less",
          "Greater",
          "Equal",
          "Double"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to factors like side reactions, loss of material during filtration, or incomplete reactions, you rarely collect the maximum possible amount."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common reason for a low percent yield in a laboratory setting?",
        "options": [
          "Product was lost while transferring between containers",
          "The reaction went to completion perfectly",
          "The limiting reactant was high purity",
          "The theoretical yield was calculated incorrectly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mechanical loss, such as product sticking to the sides of a beaker or filter paper, is a major factor in reducing actual yield."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction's theoretical yield is $50.0$ g and a student collects $40.0$ g, what is the percent yield?",
        "options": [
          "80.0%",
          "125%",
          "90.0%",
          "20.0%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(40.0 / 50.0) \\cdot 100 = 80.0$ %."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is percent yield highly important in industrial chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "It directly affects the cost and profitability of producing a chemical",
          "It determines the color of the final product",
          "It changes the molar mass of the reactants",
          "It allows scientists to ignore the law of conservation of mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In industry, even a $1$ % or $2$ % increase in yield can save millions of dollars in raw material costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What could cause a percent yield to be calculated as GREATER than $100$%?",
        "options": [
          "The product is still wet or contains impurities",
          "The limiting reactant was completely consumed",
          "The reaction produced more atoms than it started with",
          "The excess reactant was not used up"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A yield over $100$ % is physically impossible; it usually indicates the product is contaminated with solvent (water) or unreacted starting materials."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student calculates a theoretical yield of $10.0$ g. After the experiment, they find they have a $95$% yield. How much product did they collect?",
        "options": [
          "9.5 g",
          "10.5 g",
          "0.95 g",
          "95.0 g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$0.95 \\cdot 10.0\\text{ g} = 9.5\\text{ g}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Side reactions occur when:",
        "options": [
          "Reactants follow a different chemical path to form unintended products",
          "The reaction is performed in a round-bottom flask",
          "The theoretical yield is too high",
          "The limiting reactant is used in excess"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sometimes reactants produce 'by-products' instead of the desired product, which lowers the yield of the main product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which yield value is obtained through a mathematical calculation using stoichiometry?",
        "options": [
          "Theoretical Yield",
          "Actual Yield",
          "Percent Yield",
          "Net Yield"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Theoretical yield is the 'on-paper' maximum, whereas actual yield must be measured on a balance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a chemist improves a process so that the yield goes from $70$% to $90$%, the amount of waste generated usually:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher yield means more reactants are ending up in the product rather than as waste or unreacted material."
