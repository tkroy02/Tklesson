        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that if light waves could behave like particles, then particles of matter could behave like waves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The de Broglie wavelength ($\\lambda$) of a particle is inversely proportional to which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Its momentum ($p$)",
          "Its charge ($q$)",

          "The principal quantum number ($n$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The de Broglie relation is defined as $\\lambda = h/p$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $p$ is momentum ($mv$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which experimental technique provided the first direct evidence of the wave nature of electrons through diffraction patterns?",
        "options": [
          "The Davisson-Germer experiment",
          "The Millikan oil drop experiment",
          "The Rutherford gold foil experiment",
          "The Stern-Gerlach experiment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Davisson and Germer observed that electrons scattered from a nickel crystal produced a diffraction pattern, a property exclusive to waves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the wavelength of an electron as its velocity increases?",
        "options": [
          "The wavelength decreases",
          "The wavelength increases",
          "The wavelength remains constant",
          "The wavelength becomes infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to $\\lambda = h/(mv)$, as velocity ($v$) increases in the denominator, the wavelength ($\\lambda$) must decrease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do we not observe the wave nature of macroscopic objects, such as a baseball in flight?",
        "options": [
          "Their large mass results in a wavelength too small to detect",
          "Macroscopic objects do not possess momentum",
          "Only charged particles can exhibit wave properties",
          "Planck's constant is too large for macroscopic systems"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because mass is in the denominator of the de Broglie equation, the large mass of macroscopic objects results in an infinitesimal wavelength."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of wave-particle duality, what does the 'double-slit experiment' demonstrate when performed with electrons?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons create an interference pattern characteristic of waves",
          "Electrons travel in straight, predictable Newtonian paths",
          "Electrons gain mass as they pass through the slits",
          "Electrons are split into smaller subatomic charges"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even when fired one by one, electrons build up an interference pattern over time, proving they propagate as waves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation correctly represents the relationship between energy and the frequency of a photon, supporting the particle-like nature of light?",
        "options": [
          "$E = h\\nu$",
          "$E = mc^2$",
          "$F = ma$",
          "$PV = nRT$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Planck's equation $E = h\\nu$ relates energy to frequency, where the 'packet' of energy is treated as a particle called a photon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of an 'orbital' in quantum mechanics replaces Bohr's 'orbit' because electrons are viewed as:",
        "options": [
          "Three-dimensional standing waves",
          "Solid spheres of negative charge",
          "Point-mass particles in circular motion",
          "Beams of light reflected by the nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Quantum mechanics treats electrons as standing waves (wavefunctions) rather than particles on a fixed track."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an electron and a proton are moving at the same velocity, which will have the longer de Broglie wavelength?",
        "options": [
          "The electron",
          "The proton",
          "They will have the same wavelength",
          "Neither, as they are not photons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the electron has a much smaller mass than the proton, its wavelength will be significantly longer for the same velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Wave-particle duality suggests that 'matter waves' are:",

          "Physical oscillations of the electron's solid surface",
          "Sound waves produced by moving subatomic particles",
          "Electromagnetic waves identical to visible light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In quantum mechanics, the 'wave' is a mathematical probability amplitude that describes where an electron is likely to be found."
