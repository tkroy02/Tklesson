    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes a state of chemical equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "The rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction",
          "The concentrations of reactants and products are exactly equal",
          "The reaction has completely stopped and no molecules are moving",
          "The mass of the products is greater than the mass of the reactants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium is dynamic, not static. Molecules are still reacting, but because the rates are equal, there is no net change in concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a closed system at equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products:",
        "options": [
          "Remain constant over time",
          "Continue to fluctuate significantly",
          "Always sum to 1.0 M",
          "Decrease until they reach zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once equilibrium is established, as long as the conditions (temperature, pressure) remain the same, the concentrations do not change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is equilibrium described as 'Dynamic'?",
        "options": [
          "Microscopic changes continue to occur even though macroscopic properties are constant",
          "The reaction is constantly exploding and reforming",
          "The temperature of the system is constantly increasing",
          "It only occurs in reactions that involve high-energy movement"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Dynamic' refers to the fact that the forward and reverse reactions are still happening at the molecular level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction that can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions is called a/an:",
        "options": [
          "Reversible reaction",
          "Irreversible reaction",
          "Combustion reaction",
          "Spontaneous precipitation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reversible reactions are denoted by a double arrow ($\\rightleftharpoons$) and are a requirement for establishing equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the rate of the **forward** reaction as a reaction moves toward equilibrium starting from pure reactants?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases as reactants are consumed",
          "It increases as products are formed",
          "It remains constant until the end",
          "It drops to zero immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As reactant concentration drops, the frequency of collisions decreases, causing the forward rate to slow down until it matches the rising reverse rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a necessary condition for a system to reach equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "The system must be closed so no matter can enter or leave",
          "The reaction must be highly exothermic",
          "The temperature must be exactly $25^{\\circ}C$",
          "A catalyst must be present to start the process"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an open system, products or reactants could escape (like gas leaving a beaker), preventing the reverse reaction from balancing the forward one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: At equilibrium, all chemical reactions have equal amounts of reactants and products.",
        "options": [
          "False; the ratio depends on the nature of the reaction",
          "True; that is the definition of the balance point",
          "True; but only if the temperature is high",
          "False; products always have a higher concentration at equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium means equal **rates**, not equal **amounts**. Some reactions favor products heavily, while others favor reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a concentration-time graph, equilibrium is reached when:",
        "options": [
          "The lines for all species become horizontal (flat)",
          "The lines for reactants and products cross each other",
          "The product line reaches its maximum height",
          "The reactant line hits the x-axis (zero)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal lines indicate that the concentrations are no longer changing with respect to time, which defines the equilibrium state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the rate constant of the forward reaction is $k_{f}$ and the reverse is $k_{r}$, at equilibrium:",
        "options": [
          "$k_{f}[Reactants] = k_{r}[Products]$",
          "$k_{f} = k_{r}$",
          "$k_{f} + k_{r} = 1$",
          "$[Reactants] / [Products] = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate is proportional to concentration. For the rates to be equal, the product of the rate constant and concentration must be equal for both directions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system that has reached equilibrium is 'stable'. This means:",
        "options": [
          "It will stay in that state indefinitely unless disturbed",
          "It can never be changed even if you add more reactants",
          "The molecules have lost all their kinetic energy",
          "The reaction has reached its most explosive phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium is a state of minimum free energy; it persists until an external change (like temperature or concentration) forces a shift."
