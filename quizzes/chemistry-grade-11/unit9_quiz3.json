        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At 25°C, the product of the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions is always $K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-14}$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pH scale is logarithmic; pH is defined as the negative base-10 logarithm of the molar concentration of hydronium ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a neutral solution at 25°C, what are the concentrations of $[H_3O^+]$ and $[OH^-]$?",

          "Both are 7.0 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In pure water, the ions are produced in equal amounts. $\\sqrt{1.0 \\cdot 10^{-14}} = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-7} M$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the pH of a solution decreases by 1 unit (e.g., from 4 to 3), how does the $[H_3O^+]$ change?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of 10",
          "It decreases by a factor of 10",
          "It increases by 1 mole",
          "It doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the pH scale is logarithmic, each whole number change represents a ten-fold change in concentration."

          "\\text{pH} + \\text{pOH} = 14",
          "\\text{pH} \\cdot \\text{pOH} = 14",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Taking the negative log of both sides of the $K_w$ expression gives us $\\text{p}K_w = \\text{pH} + \\text{pOH} = 14$."

          "Neutral",
          "Amphoteric"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On the pH scale at 25°C, pH values less than 7 are acidic, pH 7 is neutral, and pH values greater than 7 are basic."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The negative sign in the pH formula means that higher ion concentrations result in lower pH values."
