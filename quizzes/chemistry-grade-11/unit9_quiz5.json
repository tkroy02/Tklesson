    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes a weak acid?",
        "options": [
          "It only partially dissociates into ions in aqueous solution",
          "It has a pH value greater than 7",
          "It reacts violently with water to produce heat",
          "It is always less concentrated than a strong acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak acids establish an equilibrium between the molecular form and the ionized form, with most molecules remaining undissociated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a generic weak acid $HA$, what is the correct expression for $K_a$?",
        "options": [
          "$K_a = [H_3O^+][A^-] / [HA]$",
          "$K_a = [HA] / [H_3O^+][A^-]$",
          "$K_a = [H_3O^+][A^-]$",
          "$K_a = [H_3O^+] + [A^-] - [HA]$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The acid dissociation constant is the ratio of the products of the ionization to the concentration of the unionized acid at equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Acid X has $K_a = 1.8 \\cdot 10^{-5}$ and Acid Y has $K_a = 4.5 \\cdot 10^{-4}$, which acid is stronger?",
        "options": [
          "Acid Y",
          "Acid X",
          "They have equal strength",
          "Strength cannot be determined from Ka"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A larger $K_a$ value ($10^{-4}$ is larger than $10^{-5}$) indicates a greater degree of ionization, meaning the acid is stronger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Percent Ionization'?",
        "options": [
          "([H3O+] at equilibrium / Initial [HA]) \u00d7 100",
          "(Initial [HA] / [H3O+] at equilibrium) \u00d7 100",
          "The molar mass of the acid divided by 100",
          "The total volume of the solution divided by moles of acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Percent ionization measures what fraction of the original acid molecules actually donated a proton to water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the percent ionization of a weak acid change as the solution is diluted?",
        "options": [
          "It increases",
          "It decreases",
          "It remains the same",
          "It drops to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Le Chatelier's Principle, diluting the solution shifts the equilibrium toward the side with more particles (the ions), thus increasing the percentage of acid that ionizes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term $pK_a$ is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "$-\\log(K_a)$",
          "$\\log(K_a)$",
          "$1 / K_a$",
          "$K_w / K_a$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like pH, the 'p' notation indicates the negative base-10 logarithm. A smaller $pK_a$ corresponds to a stronger acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common weak acid found in vinegar?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_3COOH$ (Acetic acid)",
          "$HCl$ (Hydrochloric acid)",
          "$H_2SO_4$ (Sulfuric acid)",
          "$HNO_3$ (Nitric acid)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acetic acid is the organic weak acid responsible for the sour taste and smell of vinegar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the $K_a$ expression, why is the concentration of liquid water ($[H_2O]$) usually omitted?",
        "options": [
          "Its concentration is essentially constant in dilute solutions",
          "It does not participate in the reaction",
          "It is a non-polar solvent",
          "It has a molarity of zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In dilute aqueous solutions, the concentration of water is approximately $55.5$ M and changes negligibly, so it is incorporated into the value of $K_a$ itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A weak acid with a very small $K_a$ will have a conjugate base that is:",
        "options": [
          "Relatively strong (for a weak base)",
          "Extremely weak",
          "A strong base like NaOH",
          "Neutral"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The weaker the acid, the more 'strongly' its conjugate base wants to attract a proton back. The product $K_a \\cdot K_b$ is always $1.0 \\cdot 10^{-14}$ at 25°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Polyprotic acids, like $H_3PO_4$, have multiple $K_a$ values. Which statement is true about these values?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{a1} > K_{a2} > K_{a3}$",
          "$K_{a1} < K_{a2} < K_{a3}$",
          "All Ka values are equal",
          "The first proton is the hardest to remove"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It is always easiest to remove the first proton from a neutral molecule. Removing subsequent protons from a negatively charged ion is much more difficult due to electrostatic attraction."
