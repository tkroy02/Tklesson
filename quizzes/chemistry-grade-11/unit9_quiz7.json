    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the behavior of a weak base in water?",
        "options": [
          "It partially reacts with water to produce $OH^-$ ions",
          "It dissociates completely into metal cations and $OH^-$",
          "It donates a proton to water to form $H_3O^+$",
          "It always has a pH lower than 7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak bases do not contain $OH^-$ ions in their formula (like $NaOH$); instead, they remove a proton from water, leaving $OH^-$ behind."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a generic weak base $B$, what is the correct $K_b$ expression?",
        "options": [
          "$K_b = [BH^+][OH^-] / [B]$",
          "$K_b = [B][OH^-] / [BH^+]$",
          "$K_b = [BH^+][H_3O^+] / [B]$",
          "$K_b = [B] / [BH^+][OH^-]$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equilibrium is $B + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons BH^+ + OH^-$. Since water is a liquid, it is excluded from the expression."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the $K_a$ of an acid and the $K_b$ of its conjugate base at 25°C?",
        "options": [
          "$K_a \\cdot K_b = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-14}$",
          "$K_a / K_b = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-14}$",
          "$K_a + K_b = 14$",
          "$K_a \\cdot K_b = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-7}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The product of the dissociation constants for a conjugate acid-base pair is always equal to the ion-product constant of water ($K_w$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a common weak base containing Nitrogen?",
        "options": [
          "$NH_3$ (Ammonia)",
          "$NaOH$ (Sodium hydroxide)",
          "$CH_3COOH$ (Acetic acid)",
          "$HCl$ (Hydrochloric acid)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ammonia and amines are classic examples of weak bases because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom can accept a proton."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a weak base has a $K_b = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-6}$, what is the $K_a$ of its conjugate acid?",
        "options": [
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-8}",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-14}",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-6}",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-7}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_a = K_w / K_b = (1.0 \\cdot 10^{-14}) / (1.0 \\cdot 10^{-6}) = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-8}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving for the pH of a weak base solution using an ICE table, the variable 'x' typically represents:",
        "options": [
          "The concentration of $OH^-$",
          "The concentration of $H_3O^+$",
          "The total pH of the solution",
          "The initial concentration of the base"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because a base produces hydroxide, solving the equilibrium expression gives $[OH^-]$, from which you can find pOH and then pH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $0.10$ M solution of a weak base has a $[OH^-] = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-3}$ M. What is the $K_b$ of this base?",
        "options": [
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-5}",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-3}",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-7}",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-2}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_b \\approx x^2 / [Base] = (1.0 \\cdot 10^{-3})^2 / 0.10 = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-6} / 0.10 = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-5}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the pH of a solution with a pOH of 4.5?",
        "options": [
          "9.5",
          "4.5",
          "7.0",
          "14.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{pH} = 14 - 4.5 = 9.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As the strength of a weak base increases, its $pK_b$ value:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Remains the same",
          "Becomes more positive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like pH and $pK_a$, the 'p' function is a negative log. A larger $K_b$ (stronger base) results in a smaller $pK_b$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following ions acts as a weak base in water?",
        "options": [
          "$F^-$",
          "$Cl^-$",
          "$NO_3^-$",
          "$Na^+$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluoride is the conjugate base of a weak acid ($HF$), so it has a measurable $K_b$. Chloride and Nitrate are conjugates of strong acids and are too weak to affect pH."
