    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the 'I' in an ICE table stand for when solving weak acid problems?",
        "options": [
          "Initial concentration",
          "Ionization constant",
          "Indicator level",
          "Isotopic mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An ICE table tracks the Initial concentration, the Change during the reaction, and the final Equilibrium concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving for the hydronium concentration ($x$) of a weak acid $HA$, the $K_a$ expression usually simplifies to which approximate form (if $x$ is small)?",
        "options": [
          "$K_a \\approx x^2 / [HA]_{initial}$",
          "$K_a \\approx x / [HA]_{initial}$",
          "$K_a \\approx x^2$",
          "$K_a \\approx [HA]_{initial} / x^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $[H_3O^+] = [A^-] = x$, the numerator is $x^2$. If the acid is weak enough, we assume $[HA]_{initial} - x \\approx [HA]_{initial}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The '5% Rule' in weak acid calculations is used to determine if:",
        "options": [
          "The approximation $[HA] - x \\approx [HA]$ is valid",
          "The acid is considered strong",
          "The solution is a buffer",
          "The temperature is 25°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the value of $x$ (the amount dissociated) is less than 5% of the initial concentration, the approximation is considered acceptable for most chemical purposes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the $[H_3O^+]$ for a $0.10$ M weak acid with $K_a = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-5}$.",
        "options": [
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-3} M",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-5} M",
          "0.10 M",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-6} M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x^2 / 0.10 = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-5} \\rightarrow x^2 = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-6} \\rightarrow x = 1.0 \\cdot 10^{-3} M$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the pH of a solution where the hydronium ion concentration ($x$) was calculated to be $1.0 \\cdot 10^{-4}$ M?",

          "7.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{pH} = -\\log(1.0 \\cdot 10^{-4}) = 4.0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the '5% Rule' fails because the acid is too concentrated or the $K_a$ is too large, what mathematical method must be used to find $x$?",
        "options": [
          "Quadratic Formula",
          "Integration",
          "Logarithmic Expansion",
          "Ideal Gas Law"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $x$ is not negligible, you must solve the full equation: $K_a = x^2 / ([HA] - x)$, which rearranges into a quadratic equation ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would result in a HIGHER percent ionization?",
        "options": [
          "A 0.001 M solution of the acid",
          "A 1.0 M solution of the acid",
          "A solution at a lower temperature",
          "Adding more of the conjugate base"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dilution (lower concentration) increases the percent ionization of a weak acid, even though the total $[H_3O^+]$ concentration decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an ICE table for the ionization of $HA$, the 'Change' row for the products ($H_3O^+$ and $A^-$) is typically represented as:",
        "options": [
          "+x",
          "-x",
          "0",
          "1.0 \\cdot 10^{-7}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the acid dissociates, the concentration of the products increases by an amount $x$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the pH of a $0.20$ M solution of a weak acid with $K_a = 2.0 \\cdot 10^{-7}$.",
        "options": [
          "3.70",
          "6.70",
          "0.70",
          "7.00"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x^2 = (0.20)(2.0 \\cdot 10^{-7}) = 4.0 \\cdot 10^{-8} \\rightarrow x = 2.0 \\cdot 10^{-4}$. $\\text{pH} = -\\log(2.0 \\cdot 10^{-4}) \\approx 3.70$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the initial concentration of $H_3O^+$ often assumed to be $0$ in these calculations, even though water autoionizes?",
        "options": [
          "The amount from water ($10^{-7} M$) is usually negligible compared to the amount from the acid",
          "The acid prevents water from autoionizing",
          "Calculators cannot handle such small numbers",
          "The pH of pure water is actually 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unless the acid is extremely dilute (near $10^{-7} M$), the contribution of $H_3O^+$ from the acid's dissociation far outweighs the contribution from the water itself."
