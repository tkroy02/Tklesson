    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for calculating 'expansion work' (P-V work) done by a gas at constant pressure?",
        "options": [
          "$w = -P \\cdot \\Delta V$",
          "$w = P \\cdot V$",
          "$w = -V \\cdot \\Delta P$",
          "$w = q + \\Delta E$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work is defined as force times distance. For a gas, this translates to pressure times change in volume. The negative sign ensures that expansion (positive $\\Delta V$) results in work done BY the system (negative $w$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a gas expands from $2.0$ L to $5.0$ L against an external pressure of $1.0$ atm, what is the work done in L·atm?",
        "options": [
          "$-3.0$ L·atm",
          "$+3.0$ L·atm",
          "$-7.0$ L·atm",
          "$0$ L·atm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $w = -P\\Delta V$: $w = -(1.0\\text{ atm}) \\cdot (5.0\\text{ L} - 2.0\\text{ L}) = -3.0\\text{ L·atm}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a reaction where the number of moles of gas increases (e.g., $2H_2O_2(l) \\rightarrow 2H_2O(l) + O_2(g)$), the system is:",
        "options": [
          "Doing work on the surroundings",
          "Having work done on it by the surroundings",
          "Performing zero work",
          "Absorbing work as heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As gas is produced, the volume increases ($\\Delta V > 0$). To expand, the system must push back the atmosphere, meaning it is doing work on the surroundings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of work ($w$) for a reaction that takes place in a rigid, sealed container where the volume cannot change?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "Equal to $q$",
          "Maximum",
          "$-P\\Delta V$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the volume is constant, $\\Delta V = 0$. Since $w = -P\\Delta V$, the work done must be zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Heat ($q$) is defined as energy transfer resulting from a difference in:",
        "options": [
          "Temperature",
          "Volume",
          "Electronegativity",
          "Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat flows spontaneously from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature until thermal equilibrium is reached."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of work being done ON a system?",
        "options": [
          "The compression of a gas by a piston",
          "The evaporation of water from a beaker",
          "The explosion of a firecracker",
          "A battery powering a lightbulb"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Compression reduces the volume ($\\Delta V$ is negative), making $w$ positive, which indicates energy is being added to the system via work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To convert L·atm to Joules, which conversion factor is used?",
        "options": [
          "$1\\text{ L·atm} = 101.325\\text{ J}$",
          "$1\\text{ L·atm} = 8.314\\text{ J}$",
          "$1\\text{ L·atm} = 4.184\\text{ J}$",
          "$1\\text{ L·atm} = 1000\\text{ J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This conversion is necessary to combine work calculated from pressure/volume with heat measured in Joules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system is at constant volume, the change in internal energy ($\\Delta E$) is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "$q_v$ (heat at constant volume)",
          "$w$ (work)",
          "$\\\\Delta H$ (enthalpy change)",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\Delta E = q + w$ and $w = 0$ at constant volume, then $\\Delta E = q_v$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a reaction where $\\Delta n_{gas} = 0$ (the moles of gas do not change), what can be said about the work done?",
        "options": [
          "The work done is approximately zero",
          "The work done is at its maximum",
          "Work is equal to the total heat of the reaction",
          "Work is positive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the number of moles of gas remains the same, there is typically no significant volume change, resulting in negligible P-V work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following processes involves $q < 0$ and $w > 0$?",
        "options": [
          "A gas is compressed while losing heat to the surroundings",
          "A gas expands while absorbing heat",
          "A gas is compressed while absorbing heat",
          "A gas expands while losing heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$q < 0$ means heat is released (exothermic), and $w > 0$ means work is done on the system (compression)."
