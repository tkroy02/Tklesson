    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ has an equilibrium constant $K_{c} = 4.0$, and the equilibrium concentration of A is $2.0 M$, what is the equilibrium concentration of B?",
        "options": [
          "8.0 M",
          "2.0 M",
          "0.5 M",
          "16.0 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $K_{c} = [B]/[A]$, we have $4.0 = [B]/2.0$. Solving for $[B]$ gives $4.0 \\cdot 2.0 = 8.0 M$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the 'I' in an ICE table stand for?",
        "options": [
          "Initial concentration",
          "Ionization constant",
          "Ideal pressure",
          "Indicator color"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ICE table tracks Initial concentration, the Change during the reaction, and the final Equilibrium concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an ICE table, if the initial concentration of a reactant is $1.0 M$ and the change is $-x$, what is the equilibrium concentration?",
        "options": [
          "1.0 - x",
          "x - 1.0",
          "1.0 + x",
          "1.0 / x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium concentration is the sum of the initial concentration and the change ($E = I + C$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $H_{2}(g) + I_{2}(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2HI(g)$, if the change in $[H_{2}]$ is $-x$, what is the change in $[HI]$?",
        "options": [
          "+2x",
          "+x",
          "-2x",
          "-x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the stoichiometry, 2 moles of $HI$ are produced for every 1 mole of $H_{2}$ consumed. Thus, the change is $+2x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When is it appropriate to use the 'Small x Approximation' in equilibrium calculations?",
        "options": [
          "When K is very small (e.g., $K < 10^{-4}$) compared to the initial concentration",
          "When the initial concentration of reactants is zero",
          "When the reaction goes to completion",
          "Only when the temperature is absolute zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $K$ is very small, the amount of reactant consumed ($x$) is negligible compared to the starting amount, simplifying the math by allowing us to assume $[Initial] - x \\approx [Initial]$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $K_{c} = [X]^{2} / [Y]$ and equilibrium concentrations are $[X] = 0.2 M$ and $[Y] = 0.1 M$, what is the value of $K_{c}$?",
        "options": [
          "0.4",
          "0.2",
          "4.0",
          "0.04"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{c} = (0.2)^{2} / 0.1 = 0.04 / 0.1 = 0.4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a $K_{p}$ calculation, if the total pressure is 10 atm and the mole fraction of gas A is 0.2, what is the partial pressure ($P_{A}$) used in the expression?",
        "options": [
          "2 atm",
          "50 atm",
          "0.2 atm",
          "8 atm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Partial pressure is calculated as $P_{A} = X_{A} \\cdot P_{total}$. So, $0.2 \\cdot 10 = 2 atm$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you solve an ICE table and get a quadratic equation $x^{2} + 5x - 6 = 0$, and the roots are $x = 1$ and $x = -6$, which value of $x$ is physically meaningful?",
        "options": [
          "x = 1",
          "x = -6",
          "Both are valid",
          "Neither is valid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Concentration and change in concentration cannot result in a negative equilibrium concentration. Usually, only the positive root makes sense in a chemical context."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The equilibrium constant for $N_{2}O_{4}(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2NO_{2}(g)$ is $K_{c}$. If the volume of the container is doubled at constant temperature, what happens to the value of $K_{c}$?",
        "options": [
          "It remains unchanged",
          "It doubles",
          "It is halved",
          "It is squared"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{c}$ is a constant at a specific temperature. While the concentrations will change due to the volume increase, the ratio ($K$) will stay the same once equilibrium is re-established."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To solve for $x$ in the expression $K = (2x)^{2} / (0.10 - x)$, if $K$ is large, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Use the quadratic formula",
          "Use the small x approximation",
          "Assume x is equal to K",
          "Ignore the numerator"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $K$ is large, $x$ is not small, so the approximation $0.10 - x \\approx 0.10$ would lead to a significant error. The quadratic formula is required."
