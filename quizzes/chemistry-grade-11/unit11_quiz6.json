    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a **First-Order** reaction, what is the formula for half-life?",
        "options": [
          "$t_{1/2} = 0.693 / k$",
          "$t_{1/2} = [A]_{0} / 2k$",
          "$t_{1/2} = 1 / (k[A]_{0})$",
          "$t_{1/2} = k / 0.693$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The half-life of a first-order reaction is derived from the integrated rate law: $\\ln(0.5) = -kt_{1/2}$. Since $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$, the formula becomes $0.693/k$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a **First-Order** reaction, if the initial concentration is doubled, the half-life will:",
        "options": [
          "Remain the same",
          "Double",
          "Be cut in half",
          "Quadruple"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A unique property of first-order kinetics is that the half-life is constant and independent of the starting concentration $[A]_{0}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a **Second-Order** reaction, how does the half-life change as the reactant is consumed (concentration decreases)?",
        "options": [
          "The half-life increases",
          "The half-life decreases",
          "The half-life remains constant",
          "The half-life becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For second-order, $t_{1/2} = 1/(k[A]_{0})$. As $[A]_{0}$ decreases over time, the denominator gets smaller, which causes the half-life to get longer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the half-life formula for a **Zero-Order** reaction?",
        "options": [
          "$t_{1/2} = [A]_{0} / 2k$",
          "$t_{1/2} = 0.693 / k$",
          "$t_{1/2} = 1 / (k[A]_{0})$",
          "$t_{1/2} = 2k / [A]_{0}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In zero-order kinetics, the half-life is directly proportional to the initial concentration. If you have more stuff, it takes longer to use up half of it because the rate is constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a first-order reaction has a rate constant $k = 0.010 s^{-1}$, what is its half-life?",
        "options": [
          "69.3 seconds",
          "0.693 seconds",
          "100 seconds",
          "0.00693 seconds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$t_{1/2} = 0.693 / 0.010 = 69.3$ seconds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many half-lives must pass for a reactant concentration to drop to 12.5% of its original value?",
        "options": [
          "3 half-lives",
          "2 half-lives",
          "4 half-lives",
          "8 half-lives"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After 1 half-life: 50%. After 2: 25%. After 3: 12.5% ($1/2^{3} = 1/8$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of reaction is the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes (like Carbon-14)?",
        "options": [
          "First-Order",
          "Zero-Order",
          "Second-Order",
          "Third-Order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Radioactive decay follows first-order kinetics, which is why isotopes have a characteristic 'half-life' that never changes regardless of the sample size."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A zero-order reaction has a half-life of 20 minutes when $[A]_{0} = 1.0 M$. If $[A]_{0}$ is changed to 2.0 M, the new half-life will be:",
        "options": [
          "40 minutes",
          "20 minutes",
          "10 minutes",
          "5 minutes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In zero-order, $t_{1/2}$ is directly proportional to $[A]_{0}$. Doubling the concentration doubles the half-life ($40$ minutes)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you observe that each successive half-life of a reaction takes twice as long as the previous one, the reaction is:",
        "options": [
          "Second-Order",
          "First-Order",
          "Zero-Order",
          "Catalyzed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a hallmark of second-order kinetics. As the concentration halves, the time to halve again doubles ($t_{1/2} \\propto 1/[A]$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The rate constant $k$ for a reaction can be determined if you only know the:",
        "options": [
          "Half-life (for a first-order reaction)",
          "Initial concentration (for a first-order reaction)",
          "Color of the solution",
          "Volume of the container"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $t_{1/2} = 0.693/k$ for first-order, knowing the time it takes for half the substance to disappear allows you to calculate $k$ directly."
