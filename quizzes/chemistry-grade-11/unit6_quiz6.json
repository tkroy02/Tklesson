      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of a calorimeter in a chemistry lab?",
        "options": [
          "To measure the amount of heat exchanged during a chemical or physical process",
          "To measure the exact volume of gas produced in a reaction",
          "To maintain a constant temperature throughout a reaction",
          "To speed up a reaction by providing a catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A calorimeter is an insulated device that allows us to track temperature changes, which are then used to calculate heat flow ($q$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'coffee-cup' calorimeter, the process occurs at constant:",

          "Pressure",
          "Volume",
          "Concentration",
          "Density"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because a coffee-cup calorimeter is open to the atmosphere, the pressure remains constant ($q_p = \\Delta H$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of calorimeter is specifically designed for combustion reactions where the volume remains constant?",
        "options": [
          "Bomb calorimeter",
          "Coffee-cup calorimeter",
          "Titration calorimeter",
          "Vacuum calorimeter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A bomb calorimeter uses a rigid steel container to ensure volume does not change, meaning the heat measured is equal to the change in internal energy ($\\Delta E$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $50.0$ g of water in a calorimeter increases from $20.0$°C to $25.0$°C, how much heat was absorbed by the water? ($c = 4.18$ J/g°C)",
        "options": [
          "$1,045$ J",
          "$209$ J",
          "$4,180$ J",
          "$5,225$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $q = mc\\Delta T$: $50.0\\text{ g} \\cdot 4.18\\text{ J/g°C} \\cdot 5.0\\text{°C} = 1,045\\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a calorimetry experiment, if the temperature of the water (the surroundings) decreases, the reaction taking place is:",
        "options": [
          "Endothermic",
          "Exothermic",
          "Adiabatic",
          "Spontaneous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the water gets colder, it means the chemical system is absorbing heat from the water, which is the definition of an endothermic process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Heat Capacity' ($C$)?",
        "options": [
          "The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of an entire object by $1$°C",
          "The amount of heat required to raise $1$ gram of a substance by $1$°C",
          "The total energy stored in the chemical bonds of a substance",
          "The maximum temperature a substance can reach before boiling"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Specific heat ($c$) is per gram; Heat Capacity ($C$) is for the whole object or device (often used for the calorimeter itself)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a calorimetry calculation, why do we often use the equation $q_{sys} = -q_{surr}$?",
        "options": [
          "Because energy is conserved; heat lost by the system is gained by the surroundings",
          "Because heat always has a negative value in chemistry",
          "To account for the mass of the calorimeter",
          "Because the temperature of the system is always negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Law of Conservation of Energy dictates that the heat change of the system must be the opposite of the heat change of its surroundings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would make a coffee-cup calorimeter more accurate?",
        "options": [
          "Using two nested Styrofoam cups and a lid to minimize heat loss",
          "Leaving the lid off to let gases escape",
          "Using a metal cup instead of Styrofoam",
          "Stirring as fast as possible with an electric mixer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Better insulation ensures that nearly all the heat exchanged stays within the water/calorimeter system, leading to a more accurate temperature reading."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Calorimeter Constant'?",
        "options": [
          "The heat capacity of the calorimeter assembly itself",
          "The temperature of the room during the experiment",
          "The mass of the water used in the calorimeter",
          "The specific heat of the reactants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High-precision calorimetry accounts for the heat absorbed by the thermometer, stirrer, and walls of the container, collectively known as the calorimeter constant ($C_{cal}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an exothermic reaction in a calorimeter, the final temperature ($T_f$) will be:",

          "Exactly $100$°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exothermic reactions release heat into the water, causing the water's temperature to rise."
