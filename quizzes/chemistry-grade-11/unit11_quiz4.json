    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the method of initial rates, if doubling the concentration of reactant A causes the rate to quadruple, what is the order with respect to A?",
        "options": [
          "Second Order",
          "First Order",
          "Zero Order",
          "Third Order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $[2]^{n} = 4$, then $n = 2$. This indicates a second-order relationship."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If doubling the concentration of a reactant has no effect on the initial rate, the reaction is ________ with respect to that reactant.",
        "options": [
          "Zero Order",
          "First Order",
          "Second Order",
          "Incomplete"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant ($Rate = k[A]^{0} = k$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the order of reactant A in a reaction with two reactants (A and B), you must choose two experiments where:",
        "options": [
          "[A] changes but [B] remains constant",
          "Both [A] and [B] change by the same factor",
          "The rate remains exactly the same",
          "The temperature is increased"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To isolate the effect of one reactant, you must keep all other concentrations constant. This follows the scientific principle of controlling variables."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Once the rate law is determined (e.g., $Rate = k[A][B]$), how is the rate constant $k$ calculated?",
        "options": [
          "By plugging the data from any single experiment into the rate law and solving for k",
          "By averaging the initial concentrations of all experiments",
          "By multiplying the overall order by the initial rate",
          "By measuring the slope of a concentration vs. time graph"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $k$ is constant for a given temperature, the data from any trial in the set should yield the same value for $k$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider this data: Trial 1: $[A]=0.1 M, Rate=0.02$. Trial 2: $[A]=0.2 M, Rate=0.04$. What is the order with respect to A?",
        "options": [
          "First Order",
          "Second Order",
          "Zero Order",
          "First Order for A, Second Order for k"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The concentration doubled ($0.1 \\rightarrow 0.2$) and the rate doubled ($0.02 \\rightarrow 0.04$). Since $2^{1} = 2$, it is first order."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider this data: Trial 1: $[B]=0.1 M, Rate=0.01$. Trial 2: $[B]=0.3 M, Rate=0.09$. What is the order with respect to B?",
        "options": [
          "Second Order",
          "First Order",
          "Third Order",
          "Zero Order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The concentration tripled ($0.1 \\rightarrow 0.3$) and the rate increased ninefold ($0.01 \\rightarrow 0.09$). Since $3^{2} = 9$, it is second order."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the calculated value of $k$ if the initial rate was measured at a higher temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The value of k would be larger",
          "The value of k would be smaller",
          "The value of k would remain the same",
          "The value of k would become zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rate constant $k$ is temperature-dependent. An increase in temperature increases the rate, which results in a larger $k$ value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction has a rate law $Rate = k[A]^{2}$ and $k = 0.5 M^{-1}s^{-1}$, what is the rate when $[A] = 2.0 M$?",
        "options": [
          "2.0 M/s",
          "1.0 M/s",
          "4.0 M/s",
          "0.5 M/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Rate = 0.5 \\cdot (2.0)^{2} = 0.5 \\cdot 4.0 = 2.0$ M/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the 'Initial' rate used rather than the rate later in the reaction?",
        "options": [
          "To avoid complications from decreasing reactant concentrations and potential reverse reactions",
          "Because the reaction is fastest at the very beginning",
          "Because catalysts only work in the first few seconds",
          "Because the product concentrations are at their maximum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $t=0$, we know the exact concentrations of reactants and the product concentration is zero, simplifying the mathematical analysis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction is found to have a rate law $Rate = k[A][B]^{0}$. This means:",
        "options": [
          "The reaction rate does not depend on the concentration of B",
          "The reaction rate is constant regardless of A or B",
          "The reaction cannot occur without B",
          "The reaction is second order overall"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any term raised to the power of zero equals 1. Therefore, changing $[B]$ has no effect on the speed of the reaction."
