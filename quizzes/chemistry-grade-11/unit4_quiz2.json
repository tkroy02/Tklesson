      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory, what happens when two atomic orbitals combine?",
        "options": [
          "They form two molecular orbitals: one bonding and one anti-bonding",
          "They merge into a single, larger atomic orbital",
          "They disappear and release energy as light",
          "They form a hybrid orbital that stays localized on one atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Law of Conservation of Orbitals states that the number of molecular orbitals formed must equal the number of atomic orbitals combined."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'Bonding' Molecular Orbital?",
        "options": [
          "Lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals, increasing stability",
          "Higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals, decreasing stability",

          "An orbital that contains no electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bonding orbitals result from constructive interference of electron waves, leading to lower energy and a stable bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is an 'Anti-bonding' Molecular Orbital typically denoted in chemical notation?",
        "options": [
          "With an asterisk (e.g., $\\sigma^*$)",
          "With a plus sign (e.g., $\\sigma^+$)",
          "With a subscript zero (e.g., $\\sigma_0$)",
          "With a double prime (e.g., $\\sigma''$)"
"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The asterisk symbol ($^*$) is the standard notation to indicate an anti-bonding orbital, which has a node between the nuclei."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Aufbau Principle in MO theory, how are electrons filled into molecular orbitals?",
        "options": [
          "From the lowest energy orbital to the highest",
          "From the highest energy orbital to the lowest",
          "All bonding orbitals must be filled before any anti-bonding orbitals",
          "Electrons are distributed alphabetically by orbital name"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like in atoms, electrons in molecules occupy the most stable (lowest energy) positions available first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What occurs at a 'node' in an anti-bonding molecular orbital?",
        "options": [
          "The probability of finding an electron is zero",
          "The electron density is at its maximum",
          "The two nuclei touch each other",
          "The energy of the orbital is zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nodes are regions created by destructive interference where the electron wave functions cancel each other out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which principle states that each molecular orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins?",

          "Pauli Exclusion Principle",
          "Hund's Rule",
          "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle",
          "Avogadro's Law"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Pauli Exclusion Principle applies to molecular orbitals just as it does to atomic orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of 'destructive interference' between two atomic electron waves?",
        "options": [
          "The formation of an anti-bonding molecular orbital",
          "The formation of a sigma bond",
          "The creation of a lone pair",
          "The ionization of the atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Destructive interference subtracts the wave functions from each other, pushing electron density away from the region between the nuclei."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an MO energy level diagram, where is the anti-bonding orbital placed relative to the bonding orbital?",
        "options": [
          "Above the bonding orbital (higher energy)",
          "Below the bonding orbital (lower energy)",
          "At the same horizontal level (degenerate)",
          "Inside the bonding orbital"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Anti-bonding orbitals are less stable and therefore always higher in energy than their corresponding bonding orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does Molecular Orbital Theory provide a better description of magnetism than Valence Bond Theory?",
        "options": [
          "It accounts for the delocalization of electrons across the entire molecule",
          "It ignores the nucleus entirely",
          "It only uses $s$ orbitals for calculations",
          "It assumes all electrons are paired in every molecule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By spreading electrons across molecular orbitals, MO theory correctly predicts the presence of unpaired electrons in molecules like $O_2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hund's Rule in the context of MO theory dictates that:",
        "options": [
          "Electrons will occupy degenerate orbitals singly before pairing up",
          "Electrons must always pair up immediately",
          "Only bonding orbitals can be degenerate",
          "Anti-bonding orbitals cannot hold more than one electron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When filling orbitals of the same energy (like $\\pi_{2p}$), electrons enter separate orbitals with parallel spins to minimize repulsion."
