          "Covalent network solid",
          "Metallic solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionic solids, like $NaCl$, consist of alternating positive and negative ions held together by strong ionic bonds."

          "Metallic solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Covalent network solids consist of atoms bonded by strong covalent bonds in a continuous 3D network, leading to extreme hardness and high melting points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are molecular solids (like ice or dry ice) generally soft and have low melting points?",
        "options": [
          "They are held together by weak intermolecular forces rather than chemical bonds",
          "They do not contain any covalent bonds",
          "The molecules are constantly vibrating too fast to stay solid",
          "They are made of non-metals which are inherently soft"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the atoms inside the molecules are strongly bonded, the molecules themselves are only held together by weak IMFs (dispersion, dipole-dipole, or H-bonding)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of solid is a good conductor of electricity in both the solid and liquid states?",

          "Covalent network solid",
          "Molecular solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metallic solids have delocalized 'sea of electrons' that are free to move regardless of the phase."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An unknown white solid is very hard and has a high melting point. It does not conduct electricity as a solid, but it does conduct when dissolved in water. It is most likely a(n):",
        "options": [
          "Ionic solid",
          "Molecular solid",
          "Metallic solid",
          "Covalent network solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionic solids have ions locked in place in the solid state (no conduction) but released when dissolved or melted (conduction)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about graphite is true, despite it being a covalent network solid?",
        "options": [
          "It conducts electricity because of delocalized electrons between layers",
          "It is the hardest known natural substance",
          "It is held together entirely by ionic bonds",
          "It has a very low melting point because it is soft"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Graphite is unique; it has 2D covalent layers held together by weak dispersion forces, and its delocalized $\\pi$ electrons allow for electrical conductivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What particles are found at the lattice points of a molecular solid?",
        "options": [
          "Molecules or Noble Gas atoms",
          "Positive and negative ions",
          "Metal cations only",
          "Non-metal atoms bonded covalently"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecular solids consist of neutral molecules (like $H_2O$, $CO_2$, or $S_8$) or individual atoms of noble gases at the lattice points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Malleability and ductility are characteristic properties of which type of solid?",

          "Covalent network solid",
          "Amorphous solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metallic bonds are non-directional; the metal atoms can slide past each other without breaking the 'sea of electrons' bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is most likely a molecular solid at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "$I_2$ (Iodine)",
          "$Fe$ (Iron)",
          "$MgO$ (Magnesium Oxide)",
          "$SiC$ (Silicon Carbide)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iodine consists of $I_2$ molecules held together by dispersion forces. Iron is metallic, $MgO$ is ionic, and $SiC$ is covalent network."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do ionic solids shatter (are brittle) when struck with a hammer?",
        "options": [
          "Like-charged ions are forced next to each other, causing repulsion",
          "The covalent bonds are too weak to hold the atoms",
          "The sea of electrons evaporates upon impact",
          "The atoms are arranged in a random, disordered fashion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A blow shifts the lattice layers so that ions of the same charge align. The resulting electrostatic repulsion causes the crystal to split or shatter."
