        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Larger molecules with more electrons have a more 'squishy' electron cloud, making it easier to form temporary dipoles."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydrogen bonding is a special, strong type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when Hydrogen is covalently bonded to which three elements?",

          "F, Cl, or Br"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Fluorine are small and highly electronegative, creating a very strong partial positive charge on the Hydrogen atom."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ammonia ($NH_3$) has Hydrogen bonded directly to Nitrogen, allowing for hydrogen bond formation between molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which intermolecular force is responsible for the fact that $I_2$ is a solid at room temperature while $F_2$ is a gas?",

          "Covalent bonding"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both are non-polar, but Iodine is much larger and has more electrons, leading to much stronger dispersion forces than Fluorine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which of the following substances would dipole-dipole forces be the most significant intermolecular force (excluding dispersion)?",
        "options": [
          "$HCl$",
          "$O_2$",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does water ($H_2O$) have a much higher boiling point than hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$)?",
        "options": [
          "Water forms strong hydrogen bonds, while $H_2S$ only has dipole-dipole forces",
          "Oxygen is heavier than Sulfur",
          "Water is an ionic compound",
          "Sulfur has more electrons than Oxygen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen bonding in water is much stronger than the dipole-dipole forces in $H_2S$, requiring more energy to separate the molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following lists the intermolecular forces in order from generally weakest to strongest?",
        "options": [

          "The number of polar bonds in a molecule"
