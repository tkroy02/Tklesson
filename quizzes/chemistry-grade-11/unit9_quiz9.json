    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Common Ion Effect'?",
        "options": [
          "The decrease in solubility or ionization of a salt/acid when a shared ion is added to the solution",
          "The increase in pH when a neutral salt is added to a strong acid",
          "The reaction between two different metal cations in a solution",
          "The process of water splitting into $H^+$ and $OH^-$ ions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding an ion that is already present in an equilibrium mixture shifts the equilibrium position according to Le Chatelier's Principle, typically reducing the dissociation of the weak electrolyte."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A buffer solution is typically composed of which two components?",
        "options": [
          "A weak acid and its conjugate base",
          "A strong acid and a strong base",
          "A weak acid and a strong acid",
          "A salt and pure water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Buffers require a weak species and its conjugate (like $CH_3COOH$ and $CH_3COO^-$) to be able to neutralize both added $H^+$ and added $OH^-$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation is most commonly used to calculate the pH of a buffer solution?",
        "options": [
          "Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation",
          "Ideal Gas Law",
          "Nernst Equation",
          "Boyle's Law"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: $\\text{pH} = pK_a + \\log([\\text{base}]/[\\text{acid}])$ is the standard for buffer calculations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the pH of a buffer if you add a small amount of a strong base?",
        "options": [
          "The pH increases very slightly",
          "The pH decreases significantly",
          "The pH increases significantly",
          "The pH remains exactly the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A buffer *resists* change, but it does not prevent it entirely. Adding a base will still cause a very small increase in pH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Buffer Capacity' refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The amount of acid or base a buffer can neutralize before the pH begins to change significantly",
          "The maximum volume of the buffer solution",
          "The speed at which the buffer reacts with an indicator",
          "The temperature at which the buffer is most stable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capacity depends on the concentrations of the buffer components. Higher concentrations mean the buffer can neutralize more added acid or base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A buffer is most effective when:",
        "options": [
          "The pH is equal to the $pK_a$ of the weak acid",
          "The concentration of the acid is ten times the base",
          "The $pK_a$ is much higher than 14",
          "Only strong acids are used"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $[\\text{base}] = [\\text{acid}]$, the $\\log(1)$ term in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation becomes 0, so $\\text{pH} = pK_a$. This is the center of the buffer's effective range."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following mixtures would function as a buffer?",
        "options": [
          "$NH_3$ and $NH_4Cl$",
          "$HCl$ and $NaCl$",
          "$NaOH$ and $KOH$",
          "$CH_3COOH$ and $HCl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ammonia ($NH_3$) is a weak base and Ammonium Chloride ($NH_4Cl$) provides its conjugate acid ($NH_4^+$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add Sodium Acetate ($NaCH_3COO$) to a solution of Acetic Acid ($CH_3COOH$), the concentration of $H_3O^+$ will:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease",
          "Increase",
          "Stay the same",
          "Double"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding the acetate ion (the common ion) shifts the equilibrium $CH_3COOH \\rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^- + H_3O^+$ to the left, consuming hydronium ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary buffer system in human blood that maintains a pH of approximately 7.4?",
        "options": [
          "Carbonic acid / Bicarbonate ($H_2CO_3 / HCO_3^-$)",
          "Hydrochloric acid / Sodium chloride",
          "Acetic acid / Acetate",
          "Ammonia / Ammonium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The bicarbonate buffer system is critical for maintaining blood pH within the narrow range necessary for survival."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the ratio of [Base]/[Acid] in a buffer is 10:1, the pH will be:",
        "options": [
          "$pK_a + 1$",
          "$pK_a - 1$",
          "$pK_a$",
          "$14 - pK_a$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\log(10) = 1$, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives $\\text{pH} = pK_a + 1$."
