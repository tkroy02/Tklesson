    "subtitle": "5.3: Relating Intermolecular Forces to Physical Properties",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Predicting properties from intermolecular forces",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Generally, how does the strength of intermolecular forces affect the boiling point of a liquid?",
        "options": [
          "Stronger IMFs lead to a higher boiling point",
          "Stronger IMFs lead to a lower boiling point",
          "IMFs only affect melting point, not boiling point",
          "There is no predictable relationship between IMFs and boiling point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boiling requires overcoming the attractions between molecules. Stronger IMFs require more thermal energy (higher temperature) to pull molecules apart into the gas phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following substances would you expect to have the highest boiling point?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_3OH$ (Methanol)",
          "$CH_4$ (Methane)",
          "$CH_3Cl$ (Chloromethane)",
          "$CH_3CH_3$ (Ethane)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methanol can form hydrogen bonds (O-H), which are significantly stronger than the dipole-dipole forces in $CH_3Cl$ or the dispersion forces in the non-polar alkanes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The phrase 'like dissolves like' refers to which property related to IMFs?",
        "options": [
          "Solubility",
          "Viscosity",
          "Surface Tension",
          "Vapor Pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substances with similar IMFs (e.g., two polar substances or two non-polar substances) tend to be soluble in each other because they can form similar attractive interactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does $n$-pentane (a straight chain) have a higher boiling point than neopentane (a branched/spherical molecule), even though they have the same formula ($C_5H_{12}$)?",
        "options": [
          "The straight chain has a larger surface area, leading to stronger London dispersion forces",
          "The straight chain is more polar",
          "The branched molecule has hydrogen bonding",
          "The straight chain has stronger covalent bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecules with larger surface areas have more points of contact for London dispersion forces to act, increasing the total attraction compared to compact, spherical isomers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a substance has a very low melting point and does not conduct electricity as a liquid, it is most likely held together by:",
        "options": [
          "Intermolecular forces (Molecular solid)",
          "Ionic bonds",
          "Metallic bonds",
          "Covalent network bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecular solids are held by relatively weak IMFs, resulting in low melting points. They lack mobile ions or electrons, so they do not conduct electricity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these gases would deviate the MOST from 'ideal' behavior at low temperatures?",
        "options": [
          "$NH_3$",
          "$H_2$",
          "$He$",
          "$N_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal gases are assumed to have no attractions. $NH_3$ has strong hydrogen bonding, which creates significant attractions between particles, causing it to deviate more than non-polar gases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which substance would be the MOST soluble in water ($H_2O$)?",
        "options": [
          "$NH_3$ (Ammonia)",
          "$C_6H_{14}$ (Hexane)",
          "$CCl_4$ (Carbon tetrachloride)",
          "$I_2$ (Iodine)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water is polar and forms hydrogen bonds. Ammonia is also polar and can hydrogen-bond with water, making it highly soluble. The other options are non-polar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As the molar mass of a series of non-polar noble gases increases (He to Xe), the boiling point:",
        "options": [
          "Increases due to increased polarizability",
          "Decreases due to gravity",
          "Stays the same because they are all non-polar",
          "Decreases because larger atoms move slower"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Larger atoms have more electrons and a more easily distorted electron cloud (higher polarizability), leading to stronger London dispersion forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A substance that is a liquid at room temperature likely has:",
        "options": [
          "Moderately strong IMFs",
          "Extremely weak IMFs",
          "Ionic bonds only",
          "No IMFs at all"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If IMFs were extremely weak, it would be a gas. If they were extremely strong (like ionic or network covalent bonds), it would likely be a solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would have the lowest vapor pressure at a given temperature?",
        "options": [
          "A substance with strong hydrogen bonds",
          "A substance with only weak dispersion forces",
          "A substance that is non-polar",
          "A substance with a low molar mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vapor pressure is the pressure of gas above a liquid. Strong IMFs hold molecules in the liquid phase more tightly, so fewer escape into the gas phase, resulting in lower vapor pressure."
