    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes an 'exothermic' process?",
        "options": [
          "A process that releases heat to the surroundings",
          "A process that absorbs heat from the surroundings",
          "A process where the temperature of the surroundings decreases",
          "A process where the system gains potential energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an exothermic process, energy flows out of the system. This usually results in a temperature increase in the surroundings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an endothermic reaction, how does the potential energy of the products compare to the reactants?",
        "options": [
          "The products have higher potential energy than the reactants",
          "The products have lower potential energy than the reactants",
          "The potential energy remains exactly the same",
          "The potential energy is converted entirely into light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Endothermic processes absorb energy, storing it as chemical potential energy. Therefore, the products are at a higher energy level than the starting materials."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a classic example of an exothermic physical change?",
        "options": [
          "Freezing liquid water into ice",
          "Melting ice into liquid water",
          "Boiling water into steam",
          "Sublimation of dry ice"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Freezing is exothermic; as liquid molecules slow down to form a solid lattice, they must release their kinetic energy to the surroundings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you touch a beaker during an endothermic reaction, how will it feel to your hand?",
        "options": [
          "Cold, because the reaction is absorbing heat from your hand",
          "Hot, because the reaction is releasing heat into your hand",
          "No different than the room temperature",
          "Vibrating, due to the rapid motion of atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Endothermic reactions draw heat from the surroundings (including your hand or the glass), causing the temperature of the surroundings to drop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The combustion of methane ($CH_4 + 2O_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O$) is a well-known:",
        "options": [
          "Exothermic reaction",
          "Endothermic reaction",
          "Phase change",
          "Non-spontaneous process"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combustion (burning) always releases energy in the form of heat and light, making it a highly exothermic process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which sign is assigned to the heat change ($q$) for an endothermic process from the system's perspective?",
        "options": [
          "Positive (+)",
          "Negative (-)",
          "Zero (0)",
          "Infinite ($\\infty$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the system is gaining energy, the value of $q$ is positive ($q > 0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Photosynthesis is an example of an endothermic process because:",
        "options": [
          "It requires the absorption of solar energy to drive the reaction",
          "It releases oxygen into the atmosphere",
          "It produces glucose, which is a fuel",
          "It occurs only during the daytime"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plants must absorb light energy to convert $CO_2$ and water into high-energy glucose molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following phase changes is endothermic?",
        "options": [
          "Evaporation",
          "Condensation",
          "Freezing",
          "Deposition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaporation requires the input of energy to overcome intermolecular forces and move molecules from the liquid to the gas phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a chemical equation, where is heat represented for an exothermic reaction?",
        "options": [
          "As a product on the right side",
          "As a reactant on the left side",
          "Above the reaction arrow",
          "It is never written in the equation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since heat is being 'produced' or released, it is treated as a product in the thermochemical equation."
      },
      {

        "question": "Breaking a chemical bond is always ________, while forming a chemical bond is always ________.",

          "Endothermic; Exothermic",
          "Exothermic; Endothermic",
          "Exothermic; Exothermic",
          "Endothermic; Endothermic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It always takes energy to pull atoms apart (endothermic), and energy is always released when atoms fall into a stable bond (exothermic)."
