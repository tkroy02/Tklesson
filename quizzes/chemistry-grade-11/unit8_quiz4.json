    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mathematical expression represents Avogadro's Law?",
        "options": [
          "$V_1 / n_1 = V_2 / n_2$",
          "$V_1n_1 = V_2n_2$",
          "$P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$",
          "$P_1 / n_1 = P_2 / n_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Avogadro's Law states that volume ($V$) is directly proportional to the number of moles ($n$) when temperature and pressure are constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Avogadro's Law, if you double the number of moles of gas in a flexible container at constant $T$ and $P$, what happens to the volume?",
        "options": [
          "The volume doubles",
          "The volume is reduced by half",
          "The volume remains the same",
          "The volume triples"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the relationship is direct, increasing the amount of matter (moles) increases the space that matter occupies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Molar Volume' of any ideal gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)?",
        "options": [
          "22.4 L",
          "1.00 L",
          "6.022 L",
          "0.0821 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $0$°C and $1$ atm, $1$ mole of any ideal gas occupies exactly $22.4$ liters."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Avogadro's Law implies that $5.0$ L of $H_2$ gas and $5.0$ L of $O_2$ gas (at the same $T$ and $P$) contain:",
        "options": [
          "The same number of molecules",
          "The same mass in grams",
          "The same number of atoms",
          "Different numbers of moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Avogadro's hypothesis states that equal volumes contain equal numbers of particles, regardless of the identity or mass of the gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which two variables must be held constant for Avogadro's Law to be valid?",
        "options": [
          "Pressure and Temperature",
          "Volume and Pressure",
          "Temperature and Moles",
          "Mass and Volume"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To observe the relationship between volume and amount, the external 'squeezing' (pressure) and 'speed' (temperature) of the particles must not change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $0.50$ moles of a gas occupy $11.2$ L at STP, how many moles are in $22.4$ L at STP?",
        "options": [
          "1.00 mole",
          "0.25 moles",
          "2.00 moles",
          "0.50 moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Doubling the volume from $11.2$ L to $22.4$ L requires doubling the moles from $0.50$ to $1.00$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does adding more gas to a flexible container (like a balloon) increase its volume at constant pressure?",
        "options": [
          "More particles result in more collisions, pushing the walls outward until internal and external pressure balance",
          "The new particles are larger than the original particles",
          "The temperature increases automatically when gas is added",
          "The particles attract each other and pull the walls outward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding moles increases the collision frequency. To maintain constant pressure, the container must expand to increase the surface area."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $2.0$ moles of $He$ occupy $44.8$ L, what volume would $2.0$ moles of $Ne$ occupy under the same conditions?",
        "options": [
          "44.8 L",
          "89.6 L",
          "22.4 L",
          "10.0 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The identity of the gas does not matter; if the number of moles and conditions are the same, the volume is the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balloon contains $1.5$ moles of air and has a volume of $30$ L. If $0.5$ moles of air leak out, what is the new volume?",
        "options": [
          "20 L",
          "10 L",
          "25 L",
          "40 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial moles $= 1.5$. Final moles $= 1.5 - 0.5 = 1.0$. $\\frac{30}{1.5} = \\frac{V_2}{1.0}$. $V_2 = 20$ L."
      },

          "Parabola"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
