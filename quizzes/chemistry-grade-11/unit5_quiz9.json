    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'Unit Cell' in a crystalline solid?",
        "options": [
          "The smallest repeating structural unit that makes up the crystal lattice",
          "The individual atom at the center of the crystal",
          "A single layer of atoms in a metallic solid",
          "The total volume of the entire crystal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A crystal is built by repeating the unit cell in three dimensions. Think of it as the 'brick' that builds the 'wall' of the crystal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many atoms are effectively contained within a single 'Simple Cubic' (Primitive) unit cell?",
        "options": [
          "1",
          "2",
          "4",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a simple cubic cell, there are atoms at the 8 corners. Each corner atom is shared by 8 adjacent cells, so $8 \\cdot (1/8) = 1$ net atom per cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'Body-Centered Cubic' (BCC) unit cell, where are the atoms located?",
        "options": [
          "At the 8 corners and one in the center of the cube",
          "At the 8 corners only",
          "At the 8 corners and the centers of the 6 faces",
          "In a single diagonal line through the cube"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A BCC lattice features one atom at each corner and one full atom resting in the very center of the unit cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Face-Centered Cubic' (FCC) unit cell contains a total of how many net atoms?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "2",
          "1",
          "14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "FCC has 8 corners ($8 \\cdot 1/8 = 1$ atom) and 6 faces ($6 \\cdot 1/2 = 3$ atoms), totaling 4 atoms per unit cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Coordination Number' in a crystal lattice refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The number of nearest-neighbor atoms touching a central atom",
          "The total number of electrons in the unit cell",
          "The number of unit cells in a gram of the substance",
          "The oxidation state of the metal ion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Coordination number describes how tightly packed the atoms are; for example, FCC has a coordination number of 12."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following cubic unit cells has the highest 'Packing Efficiency' (the most occupied space)?",
        "options": [
          "Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)",
          "Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)",
          "Simple Cubic",
          "They all have the same packing efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "FCC (and Hexagonal Closest Packing) fills approximately 74% of the available volume, the highest possible for uniform spheres."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between a crystalline solid and an amorphous solid?",
        "options": [
          "Crystalline solids have a long-range repeating pattern; amorphous solids do not",
          "Amorphous solids are always colder than crystalline solids",
          "Crystalline solids have no definite melting point",
          "Only amorphous solids contain atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crystals (like salt or diamond) have orderly lattices, while amorphous solids (like glass or plastic) have disordered, 'frozen' arrangements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An atom located on the FACE of a unit cell is shared between how many individual unit cells?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "4",
          "8",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An atom on the face is shared by the cell it's in and the one directly adjacent to that face."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Lattice Points' in a crystal represent:",
        "options": [
          "The positions of the particles (atoms, ions, or molecules) in the structure",
          "The empty spaces between the atoms",
          "The bonds between the atoms",
          "The temperature at which the crystal melts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lattice points are the coordinates in space where the constituent particles of the crystal are located."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which cubic system is the edge length ($a$) equal to $2r$ (where $r$ is the radius of the atom)?",
        "options": [
          "Simple Cubic",
          "Body-Centered Cubic",
          "Face-Centered Cubic",
          "None of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a simple cubic cell, atoms at the corners touch along the edge, so the side of the cube is simply two radii ($a = 2r$)."
