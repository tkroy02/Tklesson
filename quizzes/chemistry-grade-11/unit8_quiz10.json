    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Theoretical basis for gas behavior",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Kinetic Molecular Theory, gas particles are in constant, ________ motion.",
        "options": [
          "Random",
          "Circular",
          "Stationary",
          "Predictable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gas particles move in straight lines in all directions until they collide with something, creating a chaotic and random distribution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "KMT assumes that the actual volume of the gas particles themselves is ________ compared to the volume of the container.",
        "options": [
          "Negligible (nearly zero)",
          "Equal",
          "Larger",
          "Exactly 22.4 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because gas particles are so small and so far apart, most of the 'volume' of a gas is actually empty space."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What kind of collisions do ideal gas particles undergo, according to KMT?",
        "options": [
          "Elastic collisions",
          "Inelastic collisions",
          "Reactive collisions",
          "Sticky collisions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an elastic collision, there is no net loss of total kinetic energy. Energy can be transferred between particles, but it is not lost as heat or sound."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Temperature is a direct measure of the average ________ of the gas particles.",
        "options": [
          "Kinetic energy",
          "Potential energy",
          "Velocity",
          "Molar mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the absolute temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the particles increases ($KE_{avg} = \\frac{3}{2}RT$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an assumption of KMT regarding intermolecular forces?",
        "options": [
          "Gas particles exert no attractive or repulsive forces on each other",
          "Gas particles attract each other strongly",
          "Gas particles only attract each other at high temperatures",
          "Gas particles repel each other at low pressures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ideal gas particles are assumed to be independent, meaning they do not 'stick' to one another upon collision."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under what conditions do real gases deviate significantly from the assumptions of KMT?",
        "options": [
          "Low temperature and high pressure",
          "High temperature and low pressure",
          "High temperature and high pressure",
          "Low temperature and low pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At low temperatures, particles slow down enough for attractive forces to take effect. At high pressures, the volume of the particles themselves becomes significant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two different gases are at the same temperature, they must have the same:",
        "options": [
          "Average kinetic energy",
          "Average velocity",
          "Partial pressure",
          "Molar mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature is defined by kinetic energy. While the lighter molecules will move faster, the *average* energy across the population will be identical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does KMT explain gas pressure?",
        "options": [
          "Result of collisions of particles with the container walls",
          "Result of gravity pulling the gas down",
          "Result of the repulsive forces between molecules",
          "Result of the expansion of individual atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pressure is the macroscopic effect of billions of microscopic impacts on a surface area."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The root-mean-square (rms) speed of a gas molecule is ________ proportional to the square root of its molar mass.",
        "options": [
          "Inversely",
          "Directly",
          "Not",
          "Linearly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation $v_{rms} = \\sqrt{3RT/M}$ shows that as molar mass ($M$) increases, the speed ($v$) decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which gas would have the highest average velocity at $25$°C?",
        "options": [
          "$H_2$",
          "$O_2$",
          "$N_2$",
          "$CO_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $H_2$ has the lowest molar mass, its particles must move the fastest to have the same kinetic energy as the heavier gases at that temperature."
