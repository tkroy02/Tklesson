          "To explain molecular geometries that standard atomic orbitals cannot account for",

          "To convert covalent bonds into ionic bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hybridization mixes native atomic orbitals (like $s$ and $p$) to create new hybrid orbitals that match the observed VSEPR shapes and bond angles."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since only two of the three available $p$ orbitals are used for $sp^2$ hybrids, one $p$ orbital remains unchanged and is typically used for pi ($\\pi$) bonding."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Side-to-side overlap of unhybridized $p$ orbitals creates a $\\pi$ bond, which is the second component of a double bond."

          "No hybridization occurs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen has four electron domains (2 bonds + 2 lone pairs), which requires four $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals."
      },
      {
