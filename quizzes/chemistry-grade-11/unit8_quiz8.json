          "$P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + ...$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dalton's Law states that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual component gases."

          "1.00 atm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P_{total} = 0.50\\text{ atm} + 0.80\\text{ atm} = 1.30\\text{ atm}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Mole Fraction' ($\\chi$)?",
        "options": [
          "The ratio of the moles of one component to the total moles in the mixture",
          "The mass of one gas divided by the total mass",
          "The partial pressure divided by the temperature",
          "The number of atoms in a single molecule"

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can you calculate the partial pressure of a gas ($P_A$) if you know its mole fraction ($\\chi_A$) and the total pressure ($P_{total}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$P_A = \\chi_A \\cdot P_{total}$",
          "$P_A = \\chi_A / P_{total}$",
          "$P_A = P_{total} / \\chi_A$",
          "$P_A = \\chi_A + P_{total}$"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The partial pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the mixture."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a mixture of gases, which gas will exert the highest partial pressure?",
        "options": [
          "The gas with the highest number of moles",
          "The gas with the largest molar mass",
          "The gas with the highest density",
          "The gas with the fastest moving molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pressure depends on the number of particles (moles), not their size or identity. More moles result in more collisions and higher partial pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a gas is collected 'over water,' the total pressure measured is the sum of the pressure of the gas and the ________.",
        "options": [
          "Vapor pressure of water",
          "Atmospheric pressure",
          "Density of water",
          "Volume of the container"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water evaporates, so the space above the water contains both the collected gas and water vapor. You must subtract the vapor pressure of water to find the pressure of the 'dry' gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a gas mixture has a total pressure of $100$ kPa and contains $20$% Oxygen by mole, what is the partial pressure of Oxygen?",
        "options": [
          "20 kPa",
          "80 kPa",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P_{O_2} = 0.20 \\cdot 100\\text{ kPa} = 20\\text{ kPa}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add a second gas to a rigid container already holding a first gas (at constant temperature), the partial pressure of the first gas will:",
        "options": [
          "Remain the same",
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Drop to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the gases are non-reacting and the volume/temperature are constant, the first gas continues to collide with the walls at the same frequency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Air is approximately $78$% Nitrogen. If the atmospheric pressure is $760$ mmHg, what is the partial pressure of Nitrogen?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$0.78 \\cdot 760 = 592.8\\text{ mmHg}$."

        "question": "Dalton's Law assumes that gas particles ________.",
        "options": [
          "Do not attract or repel each other",
          "Have the same molar mass",
          "Move at the same velocity",
          "Are all diatomic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The law relies on the ideal gas assumption that particles act independently and do not interact with one another."
