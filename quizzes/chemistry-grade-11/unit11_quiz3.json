    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a general reaction $aA + bB \\rightarrow$ products, the rate law is expressed as:",
        "options": [
          "Rate = $k[A]^m[B]^n$",
          "Rate = $k[A]^a[B]^b$",
          "Rate = $[A]^m[B]^n / k$",
          "Rate = $k[A][B] / [Products]$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The exponents $m$ and $n$ must be determined experimentally and are not necessarily equal to the stoichiometric coefficients $a$ and $b$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is 'Zero Order' with respect to reactant A, how does doubling the concentration of A affect the rate?",
        "options": [
          "The rate remains unchanged",
          "The rate doubles",
          "The rate quadruples",
          "The rate is cut in half"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration of that reactant: $[2A]^0 = 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction is 'First Order' with respect to reactant B. If the concentration of B is tripled, the rate will:",
        "options": [
          "Triple",
          "Remain the same",
          "Increase by a factor of 9",
          "Decrease by a factor of 3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For first order, the rate is directly proportional to the concentration: $[3B]^1 = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the rate law is Rate = $k[A]^2$, what is the overall reaction order?",
        "options": [
          "Second order",
          "First order",
          "Zero order",
          "Third order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The overall order is the sum of all individual exponents in the rate law. Here, it is simply 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the rate of a 'Second Order' reaction if the concentration of the reactant is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of 4",
          "It doubles",
          "It triples",
          "It increases by a factor of 8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In second order, the rate is proportional to the square of the concentration: $[2]^2 = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Rate Constant' ($k$) is specific to a particular reaction and is highly dependent on:",
        "options": [
          "Temperature",
          "Initial concentration",
          "Volume of the container",
          "The time of day"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rate constant $k$ changes with temperature (as described by the Arrhenius equation) but is independent of reactant concentrations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the units for the rate constant $k$ in a **First Order** reaction?",
        "options": [
          "$s^{-1}$",
          "$M/s$",
          "$M^{-1}s^{-1}$",
          "$M^{-2}s^{-1}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a first-order reaction, $M/s = k[M]$. Solving for $k$ gives $1/s$ or $s^{-1}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the units for the rate constant $k$ in a **Second Order** reaction?",

          "$s^{-1}$",
          "$M/s$",
          "$M^{-2}s^{-1}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a second-order reaction, $M/s = k[M]^2$. Solving for $k$ gives $1/(M \\cdot s)$ or $M^{-1}s^{-1}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction has the rate law Rate = $k[A][B]^2$, and the concentration of both A and B are doubled, the rate increases by a factor of:",
        "options": [
          "8",
          "4",
          "2",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The new rate is $k[2A][2B]^2 = k(2)(4)[A][B]^2 = 8 \\times$ the original rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can the order of a reaction be a fraction or a negative number?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, they are determined experimentally and can be non-integers",
          "No, they must always be positive whole numbers",
          "No, they can only be 0, 1, or 2",
          "Only if the reaction is endothermic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While 0, 1, and 2 are most common, complex reaction mechanisms can result in fractional or even negative orders."
