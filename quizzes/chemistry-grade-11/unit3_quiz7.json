    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the bond angle in Water ($104.5^\\circ$) smaller than the ideal tetrahedral angle ($109.5^\\circ$)?",
        "options": [
          "Lone pairs occupy more space and compress the bonding pairs together",
          "Oxygen is more electronegative than Hydrogen",
          "The Hydrogen atoms are attracted to each other",
          "The $s$ and $p$ orbitals do not overlap correctly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lone pairs are held closer to the nucleus and spread out more than bonding pairs, exerting greater repulsion that 'squeezes' the bonds closer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following ranks the magnitude of electron group repulsions correctly?",
        "options": [
          "Lone pair-Lone pair > Lone pair-Bonding pair > Bonding pair-Bonding pair",
          "Bonding pair-Bonding pair > Lone pair-Bonding pair > Lone pair-Lone pair",
          "Lone pair-Bonding pair > Lone pair-Lone pair > Bonding pair-Bonding pair",
          "All electron group repulsions are equal in magnitude"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lone pairs are the most repulsive because they are not confined between two nuclei, followed by the interaction between a lone pair and a bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the molecule Formaldehyde ($CH_2O$), how does the double bond affect the $H-C-H$ bond angle?",
        "options": [
          "The $H-C-H$ angle is smaller than $120^\\circ$ because the double bond repels the single bonds more strongly",
          "The $H-C-H$ angle is exactly $120^\\circ$",
          "The $H-C-H$ angle is larger than $120^\\circ$ due to the size of the Oxygen atom",
          "The double bond has no effect on the bond angles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiple bonds contain higher electron density than single bonds and exert more repulsion, pushing the $C-H$ bonds closer together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comparing Ammonia ($NH_3$) and Water ($H_2O$), which has the smaller bond angle?",
        "options": [
          "Water, because it has two lone pairs instead of one",
          "Ammonia, because Nitrogen is less electronegative than Oxygen",
          "They have the same bond angle because both are based on a tetrahedron",
          "Ammonia, because it has more Hydrogen atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Every additional lone pair adds more repulsive force against the bonding pairs. Water (2 lone pairs) compresses the angle more than Ammonia (1 lone pair)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the bond angle as the electronegativity of the central atom increases (keeping terminal atoms the same)?",
        "options": [
          "The bond angle generally increases",
          "The bond angle generally decreases",
          "The bond angle remains constant",
          "The molecule becomes linear"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A more electronegative central atom pulls bonding electrons closer to itself, increasing electron density near the center and causing more repulsion between bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'See-saw' molecular geometry ($AX_4E$), which angles are most likely to be distorted from their ideal values?",
        "options": [
          "Both the $180^\\circ$ (axial) and $120^\\circ$ (equatorial) angles",
          "Only the $180^\\circ$ axial angle",
          "Only the $120^\\circ$ equatorial angle",
          "None, the angles remain ideal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The lone pair in the equatorial position pushes both the other equatorial bonds and the axial bonds away, distorting all ideal angles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule would you expect to have a bond angle closest to the ideal $109.5^\\circ$?",
        "options": [
          "$SiH_4$",
          "$PH_3$",
          "$H_2S$",
          "$NCl_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Silicon tetrahydride has four identical bonding pairs and no lone pairs, so it maintains a perfect tetrahedral symmetry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the size of terminal (outer) atoms affect bond angles?",
        "options": [
          "Larger terminal atoms generally increase the bond angle due to steric bulk",
          "Larger terminal atoms decrease the bond angle",
          "Terminal atom size has no effect on VSEPR shapes",
          "Larger atoms pull the central atom toward them"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steric repulsion (physical space occupied by large atoms) can force atoms further apart, increasing the bond angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the molecule $SO_2$, the $O-S-O$ angle is approximately $117^\\circ$. This distortion from $120^\\circ$ is due to:",
        "options": [
          "One lone pair on the Sulfur atom",
          "The presence of two double bonds",
          "The high electronegativity of Oxygen",
          "The $d$-orbitals of Sulfur"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sulfur has three electron domains (two bonds, one lone pair). The lone pair pushes the two bonds closer than the ideal $120^\\circ$ of a trigonal planar arrangement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecules is distorted by 'Lone Pair - Lone Pair' repulsion?",
        "options": [
          "$XeF_2$",
          "$CH_4$",
          "$CO_2$",
          "$BF_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Xenon difluoride has three lone pairs in the equatorial plane. The repulsion between these lone pairs keeps them $120^\\circ$ apart, while the bonds are pushed to a $180^\\circ$ axial arrangement."
