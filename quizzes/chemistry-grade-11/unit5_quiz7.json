    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a heating curve, what does a horizontal plateau (a flat line) represent?",
        "options": [
          "A phase change is occurring",
          "The substance is heating up rapidly",
          "The substance has reached absolute zero",
          "The container is leaking heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During a phase change, the added energy is used to break intermolecular forces rather than increasing the kinetic energy of the particles, so the temperature remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is happening to the kinetic energy of the particles during a diagonal (sloped) section of a heating curve?",
        "options": [
          "Average kinetic energy is increasing",
          "Average kinetic energy is decreasing",
          "Average kinetic energy remains constant",
          "Kinetic energy is being converted into potential energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sloped lines indicate a temperature change. Since temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy, the particles are moving faster as heat is added."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of energy is increasing during a phase change (plateau) on a heating curve?",
        "options": [
          "Potential energy",
          "Kinetic energy",
          "Nuclear energy",
          "Activation energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy added during a plateau increases the potential energy of the system as particles are pulled apart against their intermolecular attractions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a heating curve for water at $1$ atm, the first plateau occurs at $0$°C. What process is happening here?",
        "options": [
          "Melting (Fusion)",
          "Boiling (Vaporization)",
          "Sublimation",
          "Condensation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$0$°C is the normal melting point of water, where the solid turns into a liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The second plateau on a heating curve is typically much longer than the first. Why?",
        "options": [
          "It takes more energy to completely separate molecules (vaporization) than to just loosen them (melting)",
          "Gas particles have more mass than liquid particles",
          "The heater usually slows down at higher temperatures",
          "Liquid molecules are harder to stir than solid ones"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Heat of Vaporization is almost always significantly larger than the Heat of Fusion because molecules must completely overcome their intermolecular attractions to become a gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the slope of the 'liquid' section of a heating curve is steeper than the 'solid' section, what does this tell you about the specific heat capacities?",
        "options": [
          "The solid has a higher specific heat capacity than the liquid",
          "The liquid has a higher specific heat capacity than the solid",
          "Both phases have the same specific heat capacity",
          "The liquid is boiling"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A steeper slope means the temperature rises faster with the same amount of added heat, which indicates a *lower* specific heat capacity. Therefore, the flatter slope has the higher capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a cooling curve, what is the process called when a substance goes from the first plateau (gas to liquid)?",
        "options": [
          "Condensation",
          "Freezing",
          "Deposition",
          "Evaporation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A cooling curve is the reverse of a heating curve; the first plateau reached when cooling a gas represents the phase change to a liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'supercooling' as occasionally seen on a cooling curve?",
        "options": [
          "The liquid temperature drops below the freezing point without becoming a solid",
          "The substance turns directly from gas to solid",
          "The substance reaches a temperature of $0$ K",
          "The substance becomes a superconductor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Supercooling occurs when a liquid is cooled below its freezing point without a crystal seed or nucleus to start the solid formation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the boiling plateau, what two phases are present in the container?",
        "options": [
          "Liquid and Gas",
          "Solid and Liquid",
          "Solid and Gas",
          "Only Gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During any phase change represented by a plateau, both the starting phase and the ending phase exist in equilibrium until the transition is complete."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation is used to calculate the heat added during a sloped (temperature-changing) segment?",
        "options": [
          "$q = m \\cdot c \\cdot \\Delta T$",
          "$q = m \\cdot \\Delta H_{fus}$",
          "$q = P \\cdot V$",
          "$q = m \\cdot g \\cdot h$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When temperature changes, we use the specific heat capacity formula ($q = mc\\Delta T$). For plateaus, we use the heat of fusion or vaporization."
