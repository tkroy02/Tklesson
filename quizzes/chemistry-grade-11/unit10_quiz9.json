          "The temperature of the room"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The more electrons (charge) you push through the system, the more moles of ions you can reduce or oxidize."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula used to calculate the total charge ($Q$) passed through an electrolytic cell?",
        "options": [
          "$Q = I \\cdot t$ (Current \\cdot Time)",
          "$Q = V / R$ (Voltage / Resistance)",
          "$Q = m \\cdot c \\cdot \\Delta T$",
          "$Q = n \\cdot R \\cdot T$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Charge (Coulombs) is the product of current in Amperes (Coulombs per second) and time in seconds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the electrolysis of **aqueous** $NaCl$, why is $H_{2}$ gas produced at the cathode instead of sodium metal?",
        "options": [
          "Water is easier to reduce than $Na^{+}$ ions",
          "Sodium metal reacts too quickly with the glass",
          "Chlorine gas prevents sodium from forming",
          "Sodium ions are too large to reach the electrode"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In aqueous solutions, there is a competition. Since water has a more positive reduction potential than $Na^{+}$, it is reduced first, producing hydrogen gas and $OH^{-}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many moles of electrons are required to produce 1 mole of Aluminum metal from $Al^{3+}$ ions?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reduction half-reaction is $Al^{3+} + 3e^{-} \\rightarrow Al(s)$. Therefore, 3 electrons are needed for every 1 atom of Al."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
