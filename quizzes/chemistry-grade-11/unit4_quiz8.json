    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What defines the 'band gap' in a solid material?",
        "options": [
          "The energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band",
          "The physical distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons",
          "The amount of heat required to melt a semiconductor",
          "The number of protons in the conduction band"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The band gap is the 'forbidden' energy range where no electron states can exist. Its size determines the electrical conductivity of the material."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes an electrical insulator?",
        "options": [
          "A material with a very large band gap that electrons cannot easily cross",
          "A material where the valence and conduction bands overlap",
          "A material that only conducts electricity at absolute zero",
          "A material with no valence electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In insulators (like diamond or glass), the band gap is so large that thermal energy is insufficient to promote electrons into the conduction band."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the band gap of a semiconductor compare to that of an insulator?",
        "options": [
          "The semiconductor has a much smaller, manageable band gap",
          "The semiconductor has a larger band gap",
          "The semiconductor has no band gap at all",
          "The semiconductor's band gap is identical to an insulator's"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Semiconductors have a small band gap ($< 3$ eV). At room temperature, some electrons have enough thermal energy to jump the gap, allowing limited conductivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the conductivity of a semiconductor as its temperature increases?",
        "options": [
          "Conductivity increases as more electrons gain energy to jump the band gap",
          "Conductivity decreases because the material melts",
          "Conductivity decreases due to increased lattice vibrations",
          "Conductivity remains constant regardless of temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike metals, semiconductors become better conductors when heated because the thermal energy promotes more charge carriers (electrons and holes)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'doping' in the context of semiconductors?",
        "options": [
          "Intentionally adding impurities to change the electrical properties of the material",
          "Removing all valence electrons to make the material an insulator",
          "Applying a high voltage to force electrons through the band gap",
          "Cleaning the surface of a silicon wafer with acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Doping introduces atoms with more or fewer valence electrons than the host crystal, drastically increasing the number of charge carriers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An n-type semiconductor is created by adding a 'pentavalent' impurity (like Phosphorus) to Silicon. What does the 'n' stand for?",
        "options": [
          "Negative (due to extra mobile electrons)",
          "Neutral (due to balanced charges)",
          "Nucleus (due to increased proton count)",
          "Non-conductive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "n-type semiconductors have extra electrons (negative charge carriers) provided by the donor atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a p-type semiconductor, what acts as the primary charge carrier?",
        "options": [
          "Positive 'holes' (missing electrons in the valence band)",
          "Protons from the impurity nucleus",
          "Extra valence electrons",
          "Neutrons moving through the lattice"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "p-type semiconductors use 'holes' created by acceptor impurities (like Boron). Electrons move into these holes, effectively moving the positive charge through the crystal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which material is a classic example of an intrinsic semiconductor?",
        "options": [
          "Silicon",
          "Copper",
          "Sodium Chloride",
          "Aluminum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Silicon and Germanium are the most common intrinsic (pure) semiconductors used in electronics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'hole' in the valence band of a semiconductor?",
        "options": [
          "A vacant electron state that behaves like a positive charge",
          "A physical gap in the crystal lattice",
          "A place where a proton has been removed",
          "A region of zero potential energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When an electron is promoted to the conduction band, it leaves behind a vacancy or 'hole' in the valence band that can be filled by other valence electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do metals (conductors) not have a band gap?",
        "options": [
          "The valence band and conduction band overlap",
          "Metals have no valence band",
          "The conduction band is always below the valence band",
          "Metal atoms are too close together for a gap to form"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In metals, the highest occupied energy levels are in a band that is only partially filled or overlaps with an empty band, meaning electrons are always free to move."
