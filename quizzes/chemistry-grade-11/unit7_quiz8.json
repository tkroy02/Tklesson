        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula is used for dilution problems where the number of moles of solute remains constant?",
        "options": [
          "$M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$",
          "$M_1/V_1 = M_2/V_2$",
          "$M_1 + V_1 = M_2 + V_2$",
          "$P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The dilution equation works because the total moles of solute ($M \\cdot V$) stays the same even as more solvent is added."

          "500 mL"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$V = n/M = 0.02 / 0.10 = 0.2$ L. Converting to mL: $0.2 \\cdot 1000 = 200$ mL."

          "22.4 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ratio is $1:1$. You need $1.0$ mole of $HCl$. $V = n/M = 1.0/1.0 = 1.0$ L."

          "It decreases by a factor of four"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $M = n/V$, increasing $V$ while $n$ is constant results in a decrease in $M$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each $CaCl_2$ formula unit releases $2$ $Cl^-$ ions. Therefore, $2.0$ M $\\cdot 2 = 4.0$ M."
