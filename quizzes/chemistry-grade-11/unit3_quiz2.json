    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula used to calculate the formal charge of an atom in a Lewis structure?",
        "options": [
          "Valence electrons - [Unshared electrons + 1/2(Shared electrons)]",
          "Total electrons - Valence electrons",
          "Shared electrons - Unshared electrons",
          "Atomic number - Group number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This formula compares the number of electrons an isolated atom would have to the number assigned to it in a bonding environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When multiple Lewis structures can be drawn for a molecule, which structure is generally considered the most plausible?",
        "options": [
          "The structure with formal charges closest to zero",
          "The structure with the highest formal charges",
          "The structure where the least electronegative atom has a negative charge",
          "The structure with the most triple bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Structures that minimize charge separation are energetically more stable and better represent the actual molecule's state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the concept of resonance?",
        "options": [
          "The use of two or more Lewis structures to represent a single molecule that cannot be described by one structure alone",
          "The rapid vibration of atoms between different positions in a molecule",
          "The process of an atom changing its hybridization state during a reaction",
          "A molecule flipping between two different geometric isomers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resonance accounts for delocalized electrons that are shared across more than two atoms simultaneously, which a single structure cannot show."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the resonance hybrid of the carbonate ion ($CO_3^{2-}$), what is the nature of the carbon-oxygen bonds?",
        "options": [
          "All three bonds are identical and intermediate between a single and double bond",
          "One bond is a fixed double bond and two are fixed single bonds",
          "The bonds are constantly switching places very fast",
          "Two bonds are double and one is single"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Experimental evidence shows all bonds are the same length, reflecting an average (hybrid) of the resonance contributors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formal charge of the Nitrogen atom in the ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$)?",
        "options": [
          "$+1$",
          "$0$",
          "$-1$",
          "$+5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons. In $NH_4^+$, it has 0 unshared and 4 shared (assigned 4), so $5 - 4 = +1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a resonance structure, which of the following is allowed to move?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons in pi bonds and lone pairs",
          "The nuclei of the atoms",
          "Electrons in all sigma bonds",
          "The entire molecule's orientation in space"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resonance involves the delocalization of electrons (pi and lone pairs). Moving nuclei would result in an isomer, not a resonance structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which symbol is used between resonance structures to indicate they are contributors to a hybrid?",
        "options": [
          "A double-headed arrow ($\\leftrightarrow$)",
          "An equilibrium arrow ($\\rightleftharpoons$)",
          "A single arrow ($\\rightarrow$)",
          "A plus sign ($+$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This specific symbol indicates that the actual structure is a blend of the structures shown, not a reaction between them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a molecule has two resonance contributors where one has a negative charge on Oxygen and the other on Carbon, which one is more significant?",
        "options": [
          "The one with the negative charge on Oxygen",
          "The one with the negative charge on Carbon",
          "They are equally significant",
          "Neither is significant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen is more electronegative than Carbon and can better stabilize a negative formal charge, making that structure more stable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What must be the sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a neutral molecule?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "The number of valence electrons",
          "The atomic number of the central atom",
          "$+1$ or $-1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, the sum of formal charges in any species must always equal the overall charge of that species."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the ozone ($O_3$) molecule described using resonance?",
        "options": [
          "To explain why both oxygen-oxygen bonds are of equal length",
          "Because it has a cyclic structure",
          "To show that it is an unstable radical",
          "Because the atoms have different electronegativities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resonance shows that the 'double bond' character is shared across both bond positions equally, resulting in identical bond lengths."
