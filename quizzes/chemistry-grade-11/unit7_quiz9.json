    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Equivalence Point' in a titration?",
        "options": [
          "The point at which the number of moles of titrant is stoichiometrically equal to the moles of analyte",
          "The point at which the indicator changes color",
          "The point at which the pH of the solution is exactly 7.0",
          "The moment the first drop of titrant hits the flask"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equivalence point is the theoretical point where the chemical reaction is complete according to the balanced equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the lab equipment used to precisely deliver the titrant?",
        "options": [
          "Burette",
          "Beaker",
          "Volumetric Flask",
          "Graduated Cylinder"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A burette allows for the controlled, dropwise addition of liquid and provides highly accurate volume readings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'End Point' of a titration is specifically defined as the point where:",
        "options": [
          "The indicator undergoes a sharp, permanent color change",
          "All of the reactant has turned into a solid precipitate",
          "The burette runs out of liquid",
          "The solution starts to boil"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While chemists aim for the end point to match the equivalence point, the end point refers specifically to the visual cue from the indicator."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a titration between $HCl$ and $NaOH$, if $25.0$ mL of $0.10$ M $NaOH$ neutralizes $25.0$ mL of $HCl$, what is the molarity of the $HCl$?",
        "options": [
          "0.10 M",
          "0.20 M",
          "0.05 M",
          "1.0 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the mole ratio is $1:1$ and the volumes are identical, the concentrations must also be identical ($M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is a 'standard solution' necessary in a titration?",
        "options": [
          "It serves as the reference with a precisely known concentration",
          "It is used to clean the burette before the experiment",
          "It prevents the solution from becoming too acidic",
          "It is always the substance with the highest molar mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A standard solution (titrant) allows you to calculate the moles of the unknown substance using its known concentration and measured volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If it takes $50.0$ mL of $0.20$ M $NaOH$ to neutralize $25.0$ mL of $H_2SO_4$, what is the molarity of the acid? ($H_2SO_4 + 2NaOH \\rightarrow Na_2SO_4 + 2H_2O$)",
        "options": [
          "0.20 M",
          "0.40 M",
          "0.10 M",
          "0.80 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1. Moles $NaOH = 0.050 \\cdot 0.20 = 0.01$ mol. 2. Ratio is $1$ acid : $2$ base, so moles $H_2SO_4 = 0.005$. 3. $M = 0.005 / 0.025 = 0.20$ M."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which indicator is commonly used in strong acid-strong base titrations because it turns pink at the end point?",
        "options": [
          "Phenolphthalein",
          "Bromothymol Blue",
          "Methyl Orange",
          "Litmus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phenolphthalein is colorless in acidic solutions and turns a distinct light pink as the solution becomes slightly basic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When reading the volume on a burette, you should always read from the:",
        "options": [
          "Bottom of the meniscus",
          "Top of the meniscus",
          "Highest number visible",
          "Middle of the air bubble"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard procedure for all clear liquids in glass containers is to align the eye with the bottom of the curve (meniscus)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student overshoots the end point, turning the solution dark vibrant pink instead of pale pink. How will this affect the calculated molarity of the unknown acid?",
        "options": [
          "The calculated molarity will be higher than the true value",
          "The calculated molarity will be lower than the true value",
          "There will be no effect on the calculation",
          "The molarity will be exactly zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Overshooting means too much titrant was added. In the calculation, this larger volume leads to a higher calculated mole count for the unknown acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Titration is primarily a form of:",
        "options": [

          "Gravimetric analysis",
          "Qualitative analysis",
          "Combustion analysis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because titration relies on measuring volumes of solutions to determine concentration, it is classified as volumetric analysis."
