    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Half-reaction method for basic conditions",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When balancing in basic solution, what is the first step after balancing like an acidic solution?",
        "options": [
          "Add $OH^{-}$ ions to both sides to neutralize all $H^{+}$ ions",
          "Remove all $H_{2}O$ molecules from the products",
          "Add $O_{2}$ gas to the reactant side",
          "Change all electrons to protons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To convert from acidic to basic conditions, you must add enough $OH^{-}$ to neutralize the $H^{+}$. This maintains the mass balance while reflecting the actual ions present in a base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When $H^{+}$ and $OH^{-}$ are on the same side of a balanced equation, they should be combined to form:",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}O$",
          "$H_{2}$ and $O_{2}$",
          "$H_{3}O^{+}$",
          "$H_{2}O_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The neutralization reaction $H^{+} + OH^{-} \\rightarrow H_{2}O$ is used to simplify the equation after adding hydroxide ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add 4 $OH^{-}$ to the left side of an equation to neutralize $H^{+}$, what must you do to the right side?",
        "options": [
          "Add 4 $OH^{-}$ to the right side as well",
          "Add 4 $H_{2}O$ to the right side",
          "Subtract 4 electrons from the right side",
          "Do nothing to the right side"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To maintain the balance of the equation, any change made to one side (like adding ions) must be performed identically on the other side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In basic solution, which ion should NOT appear in the final, simplified net ionic equation?",
        "options": [
          "$H^{+}$",
          "$OH^{-}$",
          "$H_{2}O$",
          "$e^{-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, a basic solution has negligible $H^{+}$. The 'neutralization step' ensures that all $H^{+}$ are converted into water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose a balanced acidic half-reaction is $Ag + 2OH^{-} \\rightarrow Ag_{2}O + H_{2}O + 2e^{-}$. This reaction is already balanced for a:",
        "options": [
          "Basic solution",
          "Acidic solution",
          "Neutral vacuum",
          "Gaseous state"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The presence of $OH^{-}$ and the absence of $H^{+}$ indicates the reaction is correctly balanced for basic conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction in basic solution has 4 $H_{2}O$ on the left and 2 $H_{2}O$ on the right after neutralization, the final equation should show:",
        "options": [
          "2 $H_{2}O$ on the left",
          "6 $H_{2}O$ on the left",
          "2 $H_{2}O$ on the right",
          "No water molecules at all"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Identical molecules on opposite sides should be canceled out. $4 - 2 = 2$ remaining on the left side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reduction of $ClO^{-}$ to $Cl^{-}$ in base, the first step produces $Cl^{-} + H_{2}O$ on the right and $2H^{+}$ on the left. What is added next?",
        "options": [
          "2 $OH^{-}$ to both sides",
          "1 $OH^{-}$ to the left",
          "2 $H_{2}O$ to the right",
          "2 electrons to the right"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To neutralize the 2 $H^{+}$ on the left, you must add 2 $OH^{-}$ to both the left and the right sides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the half-reaction method used instead of just 'guessing' the coefficients?",
        "options": [
          "Redox reactions often involve oxygen and hydrogen from the solvent (water)",
          "Redox reactions do not follow the law of conservation of mass",
          "The charges of the ions always remain zero",
          "Basic solutions prevent atoms from bonding"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In aqueous redox, $H_{2}O, H^{+}$, and $OH^{-}$ often participate in the reaction even if they aren't in the skeleton equation, making simple inspection nearly impossible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The total charge on the left side of a balanced basic half-reaction is -3. What must the total charge be on the right side?",
        "options": [
          "-3",
          "0",
          "+3",
          "-1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Law of Conservation of Charge requires that the net charge be identical on both sides of the equation, regardless of what that specific number is."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are balancing a reaction in basic solution and there are no oxygen or hydrogen atoms involved, the process is:",
        "options": [
          "The same as in acidic or neutral solutions",
          "Impossible to complete",
          "Different because you must add $OH^{-}$ to everything",
          "Only possible if the temperature is 0°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The steps involving $H_{2}O, H^{+}$, and $OH^{-}$ are only necessary if Oxygen or Hydrogen are unbalanced. If only simple ions like $Fe^{2+}$ and $Zn$ are involved, you only need to balance mass and charge."
