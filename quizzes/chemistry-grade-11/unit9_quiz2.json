    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the definition of a 'Conjugate Base'?",
        "options": [
          "The species that remains after an acid has donated a proton",
          "The species formed when a base accepts a proton",
          "A substance that can act as both an acid and a base",
          "A base that has been neutralized by a strong acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a Brønsted-Lowry acid loses $H^+$, the resulting particle is capable of accepting that proton back, making it a base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the conjugate acid of the water molecule ($H_2O$)?",
        "options": [
          "$H_3O^+$",
          "$OH^-$",
          "$H_2O_2$",
          "$O^{2-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To find a conjugate acid, you must add one $H^+$ to the base. $H_2O + H^+ \\rightarrow H_3O^+$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the conjugate base of the hydrogen sulfate ion ($HSO_4^-$)?",
        "options": [
          "$SO_4^{2-}$",
          "$H_2SO_4$",
          "$OH^-$",
          "$S^{2-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To find a conjugate base, you must remove one $H^+$ from the acid. $HSO_4^- - H^+ \\rightarrow SO_4^{2-}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $HF + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons F^- + NH_4^+$, identify the two conjugate acid-base pairs.",
        "options": [
          "$HF/F^-$ and $NH_4^+/NH_3$",
          "$HF/NH_3$ and $F^-/NH_4^+$",
          "$HF/NH_4^+$ and $F^-/NH_3$",
          "$HF/H^+$ and $NH_3/OH^-$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$HF$ becomes $F^-$ (acid/base pair) and $NH_3$ becomes $NH_4^+$ (base/acid pair). Each pair differs by exactly one $H^+$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A strong acid will always have a ________ conjugate base.",
        "options": [
          "Weak",
          "Strong",
          "Neutral",
          "Amphoteric"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If an acid is 'strong,' it has a high tendency to donate its proton. Its conjugate base, therefore, has a very low tendency to attract that proton back."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following cannot function as a conjugate acid?",
        "options": [
          "$Cl^-$",
          "$NH_4^+$",
          "$H_3O^+$",
          "$H_2CO_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Cl^-$ is the conjugate base of a strong acid ($HCl$). It does not have a proton to donate, so it cannot act as an acid in this context."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the conjugate acid of $NH_3$.",

          "$NH_2^-$",
          "$NH_4OH$",
          "$N_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding $H^+$ to $NH_3$ results in the ammonium ion, $NH_4^+$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which species is the conjugate base in the following reaction? $H_2PO_4^- + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons HPO_4^{2-} + H_3O^+$",
        "options": [
          "$HPO_4^{2-}$",
          "$H_2PO_4^-$",
          "$H_2O$",
          "$H_3O^+$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$H_2PO_4^-$ is the acid that donates a proton; $HPO_4^{2-}$ is what remains after the proton is gone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two species that differ by only a single proton are known as:",
        "options": [
          "A conjugate acid-base pair",
          "An amphoteric duo",
          "Isotopes",
          "A neutral solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the fundamental definition of the relationship in the Brønsted-Lowry theory."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $K_a$ for an acid is very large, the $K_b$ for its conjugate base will be:",
        "options": [
          "Very small",
          "Very large",
          "Equal to Ka",
          "Exactly 1.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The relationship $K_a \\cdot K_b = K_w$ means they are inversely proportional. A strong acid ($high K_a$) has a very weak conjugate base ($low K_b$)."
