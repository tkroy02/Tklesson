    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Complete dissociation calculations",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is characteristic of a 'Strong Acid'?",
        "options": [
          "It dissociates completely into ions in aqueous solution",
          "It has a high pH value",
          "It only reacts with weak bases",
          "It has a very small Ka value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strong acids like $HCl$ or $HNO_3$ exist almost entirely as ions in water, meaning the initial concentration of the acid equals the concentration of $H_3O^+$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the pH of a $0.01$ M solution of $HCl$?",
        "options": [
          "2.0",
          "1.0",
          "0.01",
          "12.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $HCl$ is a strong acid, $[H_3O^+] = 0.01$ M. $\\text{pH} = -\\log(0.01) = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT one of the common strong acids?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_3COOH$ (Acetic acid)",
          "$HCl$ (Hydrochloric acid)",
          "$H_2SO_4$ (Sulfuric acid)",
          "$HNO_3$ (Nitric acid)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acetic acid is a weak acid; it only partially dissociates in water. The others listed are the 'Big Six' strong acids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a solution of $NaOH$ has a concentration of $0.001$ M, what is its pOH?",
        "options": [
          "3.0",
          "11.0",
          "1.0",
          "7.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$NaOH$ is a strong base, so $[OH^-] = 0.001$ M. $\\text{pOH} = -\\log(0.001) = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the pH of a $0.1$ M solution of $KOH$?",
        "options": [
          "13.0",
          "1.0",
          "7.0",
          "14.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{pOH} = -\\log(0.1) = 1$. Since $\\text{pH} + \\text{pOH} = 14$, the $\\text{pH} = 14 - 1 = 13$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a diprotic strong acid like $H_2SO_4$, the concentration of $H_3O^+$ in a $0.05$ M solution (assuming full dissociation of both protons) would be:",
        "options": [
          "0.10 M",
          "0.05 M",
          "0.025 M",
          "1.0 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each mole of $H_2SO_4$ releases two moles of protons. $0.05 \\cdot 2 = 0.10$ M."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these metal hydroxides is considered a strong base?",
        "options": [
          "$Ca(OH)_2$",
          "$Al(OH)_3$",
          "$NH_3$",
          "$Fe(OH)_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Group 1 and Group 2 metal hydroxides (like Calcium, Sodium, Potassium) are generally strong bases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the pH of a strong acid solution is 1.0, what is the molarity of the acid?",
        "options": [
          "0.1 M",
          "1.0 M",
          "0.01 M",
          "10 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$[H_3O^+] = 10^{-\\text{pH}} = 10^{-1} = 0.1$ M."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do strong acids conduct electricity better than weak acids of the same concentration?",
        "options": [
          "They produce a higher concentration of mobile ions",
          "They are more metallic",
          "They have a higher density",
          "They contain more electrons per molecule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conductivity depends on the presence of ions. Because strong acids dissociate fully, they provide many more ions to carry the charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $1.0 \\cdot 10^{-12}$ M solution of $HCl$ is extremely dilute. What would be the approximate pH of this solution?",
        "options": [
          "~7.0",
          "12.0",
          "2.0",
          "14.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At extremely low concentrations, the autoionization of water ($10^{-7}$ M) dominates. Adding a tiny amount of acid won't make the water basic (pH 12), it will keep it very close to neutral."
