    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Kinetic Molecular Theory, the average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "The absolute temperature (in Kelvin)",
          "The volume of the container",
          "The chemical identity of the gas",
          "The pressure exerted by the gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature is a measure of the average motion of particles. As temperature increases, the particles move faster, increasing their kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter is characterized by having both a definite shape and a definite volume?",
        "options": [
          "Solid",
          "Liquid",
          "Gas",
          "Plasma"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a solid, intermolecular forces are strong enough to lock particles into fixed positions, maintaining a constant shape and volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which state of matter are the particles far apart and their motion essentially independent of one another?",
        "options": [
          "Gas",
          "Liquid",
          "Solid",
          "Amorphous solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gas particles have enough kinetic energy to completely overcome attractive forces, allowing them to fill the entire volume of their container."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason that liquids are significantly more dense than gases?",
        "options": [
          "The particles in a liquid are much closer together",
          "Liquid particles are heavier than gas particles",
          "Gases have no mass",
          "Liquid particles move faster than gas particles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In liquids, intermolecular forces pull particles close to one another, resulting in more mass per unit volume compared to the widely dispersed particles in a gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the motion of particles in a solid?",
        "options": [
          "Vibrating about fixed positions",
          "Flowing past one another freely",
          "Moving in straight lines until they collide",
          "Occasional random jumps between containers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Particles in a solid do not have enough energy to overcome the forces holding them in place, so they simply oscillate or vibrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The ability of a substance to flow and take the shape of its container, while maintaining a constant volume, is a property of:",
        "options": [
          "Liquids",
          "Gases",
          "Solids",
          "Crystals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Liquids are fluids; their particles can slide past each other, but attractive forces keep them close enough to maintain a definite volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about the Kinetic Molecular Theory is FALSE?",
        "options": [
          "Gas particles lose energy when they collide with each other",
          "Gas particles are in constant, random motion",
          "The volume of gas particles is negligible compared to the container volume",
          "There are no significant attractive forces between ideal gas particles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Collisions in an ideal gas are assumed to be 'perfectly elastic,' meaning there is no net loss of total kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the motion of particles when a substance is cooled toward Absolute Zero ($0$ K)?",
        "options": [
          "The motion slows down and theoretically reaches a minimum",
          "The motion speeds up due to condensation",
          "The particles expand to fill the space",
          "The particles lose all their mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute Zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion theoretically reaches its lowest possible energy state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Diffusion occurs most rapidly in which state of matter?",
        "options": [
          "Gas",
          "Liquid",
          "Solid",
          "Glass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because gas particles move at high speeds and have vast empty spaces between them, they can mix with other gases very quickly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter is considered 'incompressible' for most practical purposes?",
        "options": [
          "Solids and Liquids",
          "Gases only",
          "Liquids and Gases",
          "Only Gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because particles in solids and liquids are already touching or nearly touching, applying pressure does not significantly reduce the space between them."
