    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the definition of 'vapor pressure'?",
        "options": [
          "The pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid in a closed system",
          "The force required to turn a liquid into a solid",
          "The total atmospheric pressure at sea level",
          "The pressure exerted by the liquid on the bottom of its container"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vapor pressure is a measure of the tendency of molecules to escape from the liquid phase into the gas phase at a specific temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what point does a liquid reach its 'boiling point'?",
        "options": [
          "When its vapor pressure equals the external atmospheric pressure",
          "When the temperature reaches exactly $100$°C",
          "When all the intermolecular forces are completely destroyed",
          "When the liquid starts to turn into a solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boiling occurs when molecules throughout the liquid (not just at the surface) have enough kinetic energy to form vapor bubbles, which happens when vapor pressure matches external pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the temperature of a liquid affect its vapor pressure?",
        "options": [
          "Vapor pressure increases",
          "Vapor pressure decreases",
          "Vapor pressure remains constant",
          "Vapor pressure becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to molecules, allowing a greater fraction of them to overcome intermolecular forces and enter the gas phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'normal boiling point' of a substance?",
        "options": [
          "The boiling point at a pressure of exactly $1$ atm ($760$ mmHg)",
          "The boiling point in a vacuum",
          "The temperature at which a substance freezes",
          "The boiling point at $0$°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because boiling point varies with pressure, 'normal' refers to the standardized value measured at standard atmospheric pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does water boil at a lower temperature in high-altitude cities like Denver compared to sea-level cities?",
        "options": [
          "The atmospheric pressure is lower at high altitudes",
          "The air is colder at high altitudes",
          "The intermolecular forces in water become weaker at high altitudes",
          "Oxygen levels are lower, making the water less stable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At high altitudes, there is less air pressing down. Since the external pressure is lower, the water's vapor pressure can reach that external pressure at a lower temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A liquid with very strong intermolecular forces is likely to have:",
        "options": [
          "A low vapor pressure and a high boiling point",
          "A high vapor pressure and a high boiling point",
          "A low vapor pressure and a low boiling point",
          "A high vapor pressure and a low boiling point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strong IMFs make it difficult for molecules to escape into the vapor phase (low vapor pressure), thus requiring more heat to force the liquid to boil (high boiling point)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Substances that evaporate easily at room temperature are described as:",
        "options": [
          "Volatile",
          "Viscous",
          "Ionic",
          "Insulators"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Volatile liquids (like alcohol or gasoline) have relatively weak IMFs and high vapor pressures at room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would have the highest vapor pressure at $25$°C?",
        "options": [
          "Diethyl ether (Weak IMFs)",
          "Water (Strong Hydrogen bonding)",
          "Mercury (Metallic bonding)",
          "Molten Sodium Chloride (Ionic bonding)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diethyl ether has the weakest intermolecular forces among the choices, allowing its molecules to escape into the gas phase most easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the temperature of a boiling liquid if you increase the heat supply?",
        "options": [
          "The temperature stays constant while the liquid boils faster",
          "The temperature increases until the liquid is all gone",
          "The temperature decreases because of evaporation",
          "The boiling point doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During a phase change, the added energy is used to break intermolecular forces rather than increasing the kinetic energy (temperature) of the particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pressure cooker works by increasing the pressure inside the pot. How does this affect the cooking of food?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the boiling point of water, allowing food to cook at a higher temperature",
          "It lowers the boiling point, so food cooks faster at low heat",
          "It removes all the vapor from the pot",
          "It turns the steam back into liquid water instantly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher pressure forces the water to stay liquid until it reaches a higher temperature (often above $120$°C), which significantly speeds up the cooking process."
