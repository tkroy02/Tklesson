    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines 'Electronegativity'?",
        "options": [
          "The relative ability of an atom to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond",
          "The energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom",
          "The total number of electrons in the outermost shell",
          "The distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electronegativity is a measure of the 'tug-of-war' for electrons within a chemical bond, unlike electron affinity which concerns isolated atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element is the most electronegative on the Pauling scale, with a value of approximately 4.0?",
        "options": [
          "Fluorine (F)",
          "Cesium (Cs)",
          "Oxygen (O)",
          "Helium (He)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluorine has the highest effective nuclear charge and smallest radius among the reactive elements, giving it the strongest pull on shared electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general trend for electronegativity as you move from left to right across a period?",
        "options": [
          "It increases due to an increase in effective nuclear charge",
          "It decreases because the atomic radius is getting larger",
          "It remains constant because the shielding effect is identical",
          "It increases because atoms want to become noble gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Across a period, the increase in protons ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) pulls shared electrons more strongly toward the nucleus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does electronegativity generally decrease as you move down a group?",
        "options": [
          "Increased distance and shielding reduce the nuclear attraction on shared electrons",
          "The nucleus becomes smaller and less powerful",
          "The number of valence electrons increases significantly",
          "Electrons are moving too fast to be attracted to the nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As more shells are added, the valence electrons are further from the nucleus and core electrons 'shield' the positive charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following pairs of elements would have the largest difference in electronegativity?",
        "options": [
          "Lithium (Li) and Fluorine (F)",
          "Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N)",
          "Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K)",
          "Oxygen (O) and Fluorine (F)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Large differences in electronegativity occur between elements on opposite sides of the periodic table (metals vs. non-metals)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two atoms have a very small difference in electronegativity (less than 0.5), the bond between them is likely to be:",
        "options": [
          "Non-polar covalent",
          "Ionic",
          "Polar covalent",
          "Metallic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A very small difference indicates that electrons are shared almost equally between the two atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following elements has the lowest electronegativity?",
        "options": [
          "Francium (Fr)",
          "Hydrogen (H)",
          "Carbon (C)",
          "Iron (Fe)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Francium, located at the bottom-left of the table, has the largest radius and weakest hold on its valence electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Pauling scale is used to measure electronegativity. What are the units for these values?",
        "options": [
          "They are dimensionless (no units)",
          "kJ/mol",
          "Picometers (pm)",
          "Newtons (N)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electronegativity is a relative scale comparing atoms to one another; it does not have physical units like energy or distance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of elements is usually omitted from electronegativity trends because they rarely form bonds?",
        "options": [
          "Noble Gases",
          "Alkali Metals",
          "Transition Metals",
          "Lanthanides"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most noble gases have full valence shells and do not readily share electrons, making their electronegativity undefined in most standard contexts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does electronegativity relate to the 'Shielding Effect'?",
        "options": [
          "Increased shielding decreases electronegativity",
          "Increased shielding increases electronegativity",
          "Shielding only affects atomic mass",
          "Shielding only occurs in the noble gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More core electrons shield the nucleus, reducing the 'net' pull the nucleus can exert on electrons in a bond."
