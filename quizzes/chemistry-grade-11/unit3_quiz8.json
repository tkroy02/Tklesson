    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Determining molecular polarity from geometry",
    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What two conditions must be met for a molecule to be considered polar?",
        "options": [
          "It must have polar covalent bonds and an asymmetrical geometry",
          "It must have ionic bonds and a symmetrical geometry",
          "It must contain at least one Oxygen atom and be linear",
          "It must have a net charge of zero and be perfectly symmetrical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A molecule is polar only if individual bond dipoles exist and do not cancel each other out due to the molecule's shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$) non-polar despite having polar $C=O$ bonds?",
        "options": [
          "The linear geometry causes the bond dipoles to cancel each other out",
          "Oxygen and Carbon have the same electronegativity",
          "Double bonds are never polar",
          "The molecule is too small to have a dipole moment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $CO_2$ is linear, the two equal bond dipoles point in exactly opposite directions, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecular geometries is most likely to result in a polar molecule if all terminal atoms are the same?",
        "options": [
          "Trigonal pyramidal",
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Linear"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Trigonal pyramidal molecules (like $NH_3$) are inherently asymmetrical due to the lone pair, preventing bond dipoles from canceling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a polar molecule, the end of the molecule with the more electronegative atom is designated with which symbol?",
        "options": [
          "$\\delta^-$",
          "$\\delta^+$",
          "$\\alpha$",
          "$\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The lowercase delta with a minus sign indicates a partial negative charge where electron density is higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these molecules is polar?",
        "options": [
          "$H_2O$",
          "$CCl_4$",
          "$BF_3$",
          "$CH_4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water has a bent geometry; the $O-H$ bond dipoles do not cancel, creating a significant net molecular dipole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If all terminal atoms in a tetrahedral molecule are identical (e.g., $CF_4$), the molecule is:",
        "options": [
          "Non-polar because the geometry is perfectly symmetrical",
          "Polar because Fluorine is highly electronegative",
          "Ionic because the electronegativity difference is large",
          "Polar because there are four dipoles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a perfectly symmetrical tetrahedral arrangement, the four bond dipoles pull equally in all directions, canceling out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'dipole moment' of a molecule is a vector quantity that measures:",
        "options": [
          "The magnitude and direction of molecular polarity",
          "The speed at which a molecule rotates",
          "The number of lone pairs on the central atom",
          "The energy required to break a covalent bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dipole moment represents the overall separation of charge within the molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule would be polar due to having different terminal atoms?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_3Cl$",
          "$CH_4$",
          "$Cl_2$",
          "$BeCl_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chloromethane is asymmetrical because the $C-Cl$ bond dipole is different from the $C-H$ bond dipoles, so they cannot cancel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Boron Trifluoride ($BF_3$) is non-polar. What happens to its polarity if one Fluorine is replaced with a Chlorine ($BF_2Cl$)?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes polar because the symmetry is broken",
          "It remains non-polar because it is still trigonal planar",
          "It becomes ionic",
          "The dipole moment becomes exactly zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By changing one atom, the bond dipoles are no longer equal in magnitude, resulting in a net dipole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a non-polar molecule with polar bonds?",
        "options": [
          "$CCl_4$",
          "$NH_3$",
          "$HCl$",
          "$PCl_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each $C-Cl$ bond is polar, but the tetrahedral symmetry of $CCl_4$ ensures the overall molecule has no net dipole."
