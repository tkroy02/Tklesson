    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a 'Phase Diagram' represent?",
        "options": [
          "The state of a substance at various temperatures and pressures",
          "The speed of a chemical reaction over time",
          "The arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice",
          "The energy change during a phase transition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A phase diagram plots pressure on the y-axis and temperature on the x-axis to show the conditions under which a substance exists as a solid, liquid, or gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Triple Point' on a phase diagram?",
        "options": [
          "The temperature and pressure where all three phases coexist in equilibrium",
          "The point where a substance turns directly from solid to gas",
          "The temperature at which a substance boils at $1$ atm",
          "The maximum temperature at which a liquid can exist"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the triple point, the rates of sublimation, melting, and evaporation are all balanced, allowing solid, liquid, and gas to exist simultaneously."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Critical Point' marks the end of the liquid-gas boundary line. Beyond this point, the substance is called a:",
        "options": [
          "Supercritical fluid",
          "Plasma",
          "Amorphous solid",
          "Ideal gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Beyond the critical temperature and pressure, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears, resulting in a state that has the density of a liquid but the flow of a gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a typical phase diagram, what process is occurring as you cross the line separating a solid from a gas?",
        "options": [
          "Sublimation or Deposition",
          "Melting or Freezing",
          "Vaporization or Condensation",
          "Ionization"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The boundary between solid and gas represents the conditions for sublimation (solid to gas) and deposition (gas to solid)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For most substances, the line between solid and liquid has a positive slope (leans right). What does this indicate?",
        "options": [
          "The solid phase is more dense than the liquid phase",
          "The liquid phase is more dense than the solid phase",
          "Increasing pressure always causes melting",
          "The substance cannot exist as a solid at high temperatures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A positive slope means that increasing pressure at a constant temperature favors the more compact (denser) solid phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water is unusual because its solid-liquid boundary has a negative slope (leans left). This implies that:",
        "options": [
          "Ice is less dense than liquid water",
          "Ice is more dense than liquid water",
          "Water cannot be pressurized into a solid",
          "Water boils at room temperature under high pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because ice is less dense than water (due to its open hydrogen-bonded structure), increasing pressure on ice can actually cause it to melt into the denser liquid phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are at a point on a phase diagram directly ON a boundary line, what is happening?",
        "options": [
          "Two phases are in equilibrium",
          "The substance is strictly a gas",
          "The temperature is rapidly increasing",
          "The substance is exploding"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lines represent phase boundaries where two states coexist. For example, the line between liquid and gas represents all possible boiling points at different pressures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To determine the 'Normal Boiling Point' from a phase diagram, you should find the temperature where the liquid-gas boundary crosses:",
        "options": [
          "The $1$ atm pressure line",
          "The Triple Point",
          "The Critical Point",
          "The $0$°C temperature line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'normal' boiling point is specifically defined as the boiling temperature at standard atmospheric pressure ($1$ atm or $101.3$ kPa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a substance if its temperature is increased while keeping it at a pressure BELOW its triple point pressure?",
        "options": [
          "It sublimes directly from solid to gas",
          "It melts into a liquid and then boils",
          "It stays a solid forever",
          "It turns into a supercritical fluid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Below the triple point pressure, the liquid phase is not stable. The substance will transition directly from solid to gas (like Dry Ice at room pressure)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Critical Temperature ($T_c$) is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The temperature above which a gas cannot be liquefied, no matter how much pressure is applied",
          "The temperature where all motion stops",
          "The temperature where a solid turns into a liquid",
          "The temperature of the triple point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At temperatures higher than $T_c$, the kinetic energy of the particles is so high that attractive forces cannot hold them together as a liquid, even under extreme pressure."
