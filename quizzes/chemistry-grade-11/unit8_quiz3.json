    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mathematical expression represents Charles's Law?",
        "options": [
          "$V_1 / T_1 = V_2 / T_2$",
          "$P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$",
          "$P_1 / T_1 = P_2 / T_2$",
          "$V_1T_1 = V_2T_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Charles's Law states that for a fixed amount of gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its absolute temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When performing calculations with any gas law, temperature must always be converted to which scale?",
        "options": [
          "Kelvin (K)",
          "Celsius (°C)",
          "Fahrenheit (°F)",
          "Rankine (R)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Kelvin scale is an absolute scale starting at zero. Using Celsius would result in errors (and potentially negative volumes) because it is not based on absolute particle motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Add 273.15",
          "Subtract 273.15",
          "Multiply by 273.15",
          "Divide by 273.15"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Charles's Law describes a 'direct relationship.' This means that if the absolute temperature of a gas is doubled, the volume will ________.",
        "options": [
          "Double",
          "Decrease by half",
          "Remain the same",
          "Quadruple"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a direct relationship, the variables change in the same direction. Heating gas particles makes them move faster and push outward, increasing the volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which variables are held constant in Charles's Law?",
        "options": [
          "Pressure ($P$) and amount of gas ($n$)",
          "Volume ($V$) and amount of gas ($n$)",
          "Temperature ($T$) and pressure ($P$)",
          "Volume ($V$) and temperature ($T$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Charles's Law specifically examines the $V-T$ relationship under constant pressure conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balloon has a volume of $2.0$ L at $298$ K. What will be its volume if the temperature is increased to $596$ K at constant pressure?",
        "options": [
          "4.0 L",
          "1.0 L",
          "2.0 L",
          "8.0 L"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the Kelvin temperature doubled ($298 \\rightarrow 596$), the volume must also double ($2.0 \\rightarrow 4.0$ L)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the molecules of a gas as the temperature increases?",
        "options": [
          "Their average kinetic energy increases and they move faster",
          "They become larger in size",
          "They slow down and cluster together",
          "They lose their mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy. Higher temperature means faster-moving particles that strike the container walls more often and with more force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plot of Volume ($V$) versus Kelvin Temperature ($T$) for a gas results in a:",
        "options": [
          "Straight line passing through the origin",
          "Hyperbolic curve",
          "Horizontal line",
          "Step function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Direct proportions ($y = kx$) always produce a linear graph that trends toward the origin ($0,0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Absolute Zero'?",
        "options": [
          "The temperature ($0$ K) at which the volume of an ideal gas would theoretically become zero",
          "The temperature at which water freezes ($0$°C)",
          "The pressure at sea level",
          "The boiling point of liquid nitrogen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute zero ($0$ K or $-273.15$°C) is the theoretical point where all molecular motion stops."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $600$ mL sample of nitrogen is at $27$°C. If the pressure is constant, what is the volume at $127$°C?",
        "options": [
          "800 mL",
          "2818 mL",
          "450 mL",
          "127 mL"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, convert to Kelvin: $T_1 = 300$ K, $T_2 = 400$ K. $\\frac{600}{300} = \\frac{V_2}{400}$. $V_2 = 2 \\cdot 400 = 800$ mL."
