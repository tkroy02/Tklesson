    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which integrated rate law is represented by the equation $[A]_{t} = -kt + [A]_{0}$?",
        "options": [
          "Zero Order",
          "First Order",
          "Second Order",
          "Third Order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a zero-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant decreases linearly with time. A plot of $[A]$ vs. $t$ yields a straight line with slope $-k$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a **First Order** reaction, which plot will yield a straight line?",
        "options": [
          "$\\ln[A]$ vs. time",
          "$[A]$ vs. time",
          "$1/[A]$ vs. time",
          "$\\log(1/[A])$ vs. $1/time$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The integrated rate law for first order is $\\ln[A]_{t} = -kt + \\ln[A]_{0}$. Plotting the natural log of concentration against time results in a linear relationship."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the integrated rate law for a **Second Order** reaction?",
        "options": [
          "$1/[A]_{t} = kt + 1/[A]_{0}$",
          "$[A]_{t} = -kt + [A]_{0}$",
          "$\\ln[A]_{t} = -kt + \\ln[A]_{0}$",
          "$[A]_{t}^{2} = -kt + [A]_{0}^{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Second-order kinetics involve the reciprocal of the concentration. A plot of $1/[A]$ vs. $t$ gives a straight line with a **positive** slope $k$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a plot of $1/[A]$ vs. time is linear, what is the order of the reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Second Order",
          "First Order",
          "Zero Order",
          "Third Order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The linear relationship between the reciprocal of concentration and time is the unique characteristic of a second-order reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the integrated rate law equations, the term $[A]_{0}$ represents:",
        "options": [
          "The initial concentration of reactant A at time $t = 0$",
          "The concentration of reactant A at the end of the reaction",
          "The concentration of the products",
          "The rate constant divided by the temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The subscript zero denotes the starting condition before any reaction has taken place."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The slope of a linear plot of $\\ln[A]$ vs. time for a first-order reaction is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "$-k$",
          "$k$",
          "$1/k$",
          "$-k / 2.303$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the equation is in the form $y = mx + b$ ($\\ln[A] = -kt + \\ln[A]_{0}$), the slope $m$ corresponds directly to $-k$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which reaction order has a rate that is independent of the reactant concentration?",

          "Zero Order",
          "First Order",
          "Second Order",
          "Overall Third Order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zero-order reactions proceed at a constant speed regardless of how much reactant is present, until the reactant is completely exhausted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the unit of the rate constant $k$ for a **Zero Order** reaction?",
        "options": [
          "$M \\cdot s^{-1}$",
          "$s^{-1}$",
          "$M^{-1} \\cdot s^{-1}$",
          "$M^{-2} \\cdot s^{-1}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For zero order, $Rate = k$. Since Rate is in $M/s$, $k$ must also be in $M/s$ ($M \\cdot s^{-1}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A first-order reaction has a rate constant $k = 0.020 s^{-1}$. If $[A]_{0} = 1.00 M$, what is $\\ln[A]$ after 10 seconds?",
        "options": [
          "-0.20",
          "0.80",
          "0.20",
          "-0.02"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\ln[A]_{t} = -(0.020)(10) + \\ln(1.00) = -0.20 + 0 = -0.20$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a second-order reaction, the slope of the linear plot is $0.50 M^{-1}s^{-1}$. What is the value of the rate constant $k$?",

          "0.50",
          "-0.50",
          "2.00",
          "1.00"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the second-order integrated rate law, the slope is positive $k$. Therefore, $k$ is exactly $0.50$."
