    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Decreased solubility from common ions",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Common Ion Effect' states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt ________ when a soluble salt containing a shared ion is added.",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Remains the same",
          "Doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Le Chatelier's Principle, adding an ion that is a product of the dissolution reaction shifts the equilibrium to the left, favoring the solid phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which of the following solutions would $\\text{AgCl}$ be **least** soluble?",
        "options": [
          "$0.1$ M $\\text{NaCl}$",
          "Pure water",
          "$0.1$ M $\\text{KNO}_3$",
          "$0.01$ M $\\text{HNO}_3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{NaCl}$ provides $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions. These common ions shift the $\\text{AgCl}$ equilibrium toward the solid, making it harder for the $\\text{AgCl}$ to dissolve compared to pure water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\text{BaSO}_{4}$ is added to a solution of $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}$, which ion is the 'common ion'?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}$",
          "$\\text{Ba}^{2+}$",
          "$\\text{Na}^{+}$",
          "$\\text{O}^{2-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both compounds contain the sulfate ion ($\\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}$). The presence of sulfate from the highly soluble $\\text{Na}_{2}\\text{SO}_{4}$ suppresses the dissolution of $\\text{BaSO}_{4}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the value of $K_{\\text{sp}}$ when a common ion is added to the solution at constant temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The value of $K_{\\text{sp}}$ remains unchanged",
          "The value of $K_{\\text{sp}}$ decreases",
          "The value of $K_{\\text{sp}}$ increases",
          "The value of $K_{\\text{sp}}$ becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{\\text{sp}}$ is a constant at a given temperature. While the *molar solubility* changes, the product of the ion concentrations at equilibrium must still equal the same $K_{\\text{sp}}$ value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When calculating the solubility of $\\text{CaF}_{2}$ in $0.10$ M $\\text{NaF}$, the initial concentration of $\\text{F}^{-}$ in the ICE table should be:",
        "options": [
          "$0.10$ M",
          "$0$ M",
          "$0.20$ M",
          "$0.05$ M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $\\text{NaF}$ is completely soluble, the solution already contains $0.10$ M $\\text{F}^{-}$ before any $\\text{CaF}_{2}$ begins to dissolve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The common ion effect is a practical application of:",
        "options": [
          "Le Chatelier's Principle",
          "Graham's Law",
          "Hess's Law",
          "The Arrhenius Equation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It describes how a system at equilibrium responds to the 'stress' of an added product (the common ion)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Adding $\\text{NaCl}$ to a saturated solution of $\\text{AgCl}$ will cause:",
        "options": [
          "More $\\text{AgCl}$ to precipitate out of solution",
          "More $\\text{AgCl}$ to dissolve into solution",
          "The concentration of $\\text{Ag}^{+}$ to increase",
          "No visible change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The extra $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ shifts the equilibrium $\\text{AgCl(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ag}^{+}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{Cl}^{-}\\text{(aq)}$ to the left, forming more solid $\\text{AgCl}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would **increase** the solubility of a salt like $\\text{Mg(OH)}_{2}$?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing the pH (adding $\\text{H}^{+}$)",
          "Increasing the pH (adding $\\text{OH}^{-}$)",
          "Adding $\\text{Mg(NO}_3\\text{)}_2$",
          "Lowering the temperature of an endothermic dissolution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding $\\text{H}^{+}$ removes the $\\text{OH}^{-}$ ions (forming water). This removal of a product shifts the equilibrium to the right, allowing more solid to dissolve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the presence of a common ion, the 'Small x Approximation' is:",
        "options": [
          "Usually more valid than in pure water",
          "Never valid",
          "Only valid for exothermic reactions",
          "Used to calculate the frequency factor $A$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the common ion suppresses solubility, '$x$' (the amount that dissolves) becomes even smaller, making the approximation $[\\text{Initial}] + x \\approx [\\text{Initial}]$ very accurate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add $\\text{AgNO}_{3}$ to a saturated solution of $\\text{AgCl}$, what happens to the concentration of $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases",
          "It increases",
          "It remains the same",
          "It doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding the common ion $\\text{Ag}^{+}$ shifts the equilibrium to the left. As the system moves left to form solid $\\text{AgCl}$, it consumes the $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions already in the solution."
