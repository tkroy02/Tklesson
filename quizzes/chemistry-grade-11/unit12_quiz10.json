    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Decreased solubility from common ions",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Common Ion Effect' states that the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt ________ when a soluble salt containing a shared ion is added.",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Increases",
          "Remains the same",
          "Doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Le Chatelier's Principle, adding an ion that is a product of the dissolution reaction shifts the equilibrium to the left, favoring the solid phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which of the following solutions would $AgCl$ be **least** soluble?",
        "options": [
          "0.1 M NaCl",
          "Pure water",
          "0.1 M KNO3",
          "0.01 M HNO3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$NaCl$ provides $Cl^{-}$ ions. These common ions shift the $AgCl$ equilibrium toward the solid, making it harder for the $AgCl$ to dissolve compared to pure water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $BaSO_{4}$ is added to a solution of $Na_{2}SO_{4}$, which ion is the 'common ion'?",
        "options": [
          "SO4^{2-}",
          "Ba^{2+}",
          "Na^{+}",
          "O^{2-}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both compounds contain the sulfate ion ($SO_{4}^{2-}$). The presence of sulfate from the highly soluble $Na_{2}SO_{4}$ suppresses the dissolution of $BaSO_{4}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the value of $K_{sp}$ when a common ion is added to the solution at constant temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The value of K_{sp} remains unchanged",
          "The value of K_{sp} decreases",
          "The value of K_{sp} increases",
          "The value of K_{sp} becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{sp}$ is a constant at a given temperature. While the *molar solubility* changes, the product of the ion concentrations at equilibrium must still equal the same $K_{sp}$ value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When calculating the solubility of $CaF_{2}$ in $0.10 M NaF$, the initial concentration of $F^{-}$ in the ICE table should be:",
        "options": [
          "0.10 M",
          "0 M",
          "0.20 M",
          "0.05 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $NaF$ is completely soluble, the solution already contains $0.10 M F^{-}$ before any $CaF_{2}$ begins to dissolve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The common ion effect is a practical application of:",
        "options": [
          "Le Chatelier's Principle",
          "Graham's Law",
          "Hess's Law",
          "The Arrhenius Equation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It describes how a system at equilibrium responds to the 'stress' of an added product (the common ion)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Adding $NaCl$ to a saturated solution of $AgCl$ will cause:",
        "options": [
          "More AgCl to precipitate out of solution",
          "More AgCl to dissolve into solution",
          "The concentration of Ag^{+} to increase",
          "No visible change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The extra $Cl^{-}$ shifts the equilibrium $AgCl(s) \\rightleftharpoons Ag^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq)$ to the left, forming more solid $AgCl$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would **increase** the solubility of a salt like $Mg(OH)_{2}$?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing the pH (adding H^{+})",
          "Increasing the pH (adding OH^{-})",
          "Adding Mg(NO3)2",
          "Lowering the temperature of an endothermic dissolution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding $H^{+}$ removes the $OH^{-}$ ions (forming water). This removal of a product shifts the equilibrium to the right, allowing more solid to dissolve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the presence of a common ion, the 'Small x Approximation' is:",
        "options": [
          "Usually more valid than in pure water",
          "Never valid",
          "Only valid for exothermic reactions",
          "Used to calculate the frequency factor A"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the common ion suppresses solubility, 'x' (the amount that dissolves) becomes even smaller, making the approximation $[Initial] + x \\approx [Initial]$ very accurate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add $AgNO_{3}$ to a saturated solution of $AgCl$, what happens to the concentration of $Cl^{-}$ ions?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases",
          "It increases",
          "It remains the same",
          "It doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding the common ion $Ag^{+}$ shifts the equilibrium to the left. As the system moves left to form solid $AgCl$, it consumes the $Cl^{-}$ ions already in the solution."
