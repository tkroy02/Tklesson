    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Equivalence Point' in a titration?",
        "options": [
          "The point at which the moles of acid exactly equal the moles of base",
          "The point at which the indicator changes color",
          "The point where the pH is exactly 7.0",
          "The point where the volume of titrant equals the volume of analyte"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equivalence point is a theoretical point defined by the stoichiometry of the reaction, where the reactants have been mixed in exactly the correct proportions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a titration of a **Strong Acid** with a **Strong Base**, what is the pH at the equivalence point?",
        "options": [
          "7.0",
          "1.0",
          "9.0",
          "4.5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the resulting salt does not undergo hydrolysis and water is neutral, the equivalence point for a strong-strong titration is always 7.0 at 25°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'End Point' of a titration is defined as the point where:",
        "options": [
          "The indicator changes color",
          "The reaction stops completely",
          "The pH reaches 14",
          "The moles of acid equal the moles of base"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While we aim for the end point to be as close to the equivalence point as possible, the end point is specifically the physical observation of a color change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When titrating a **Weak Acid** with a **Strong Base**, the pH at the equivalence point will be:",
        "options": [
          "Greater than 7.0",
          "Less than 7.0",
          "Exactly 7.0",
          "Exactly 1.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the equivalence point, all the acid has been converted to its conjugate base. This conjugate base undergoes hydrolysis to produce $OH^-$ ions, making the solution basic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which indicator would be most appropriate for a titration with an equivalence point at pH 9.0?",
        "options": [
          "Phenolphthalein (range 8.2–10.0)",
          "Methyl Orange (range 3.1–4.4)",
          "Bromothymol Blue (range 6.0–7.6)",
          "Litmus (range 4.5–8.3)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ideal indicator has a $pK_a$ (and color-change range) that overlaps with the pH at the equivalence point of the titration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Half-Equivalence Point'?",
        "options": [
          "The point where pH = pKa of the weak acid",
          "The point where the pH is exactly 7.0",
          "The point where the titration is 25% complete",
          "The point where the indicator first starts to flicker"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At half-equivalence, exactly half of the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base. In the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, this makes $[Base]/[Acid] = 1$, so $\\text{pH} = pK_a$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A titration curve for a **Strong Base** being added to a **Weak Acid** starts at a:",
        "options": [
          "Low pH (around 3-5) and rises",
          "Very low pH (around 0-1) and rises",
          "High pH (around 13-14) and falls",
          "Neutral pH (7) and remains flat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak acids are less acidic than strong acids, so the starting pH is higher. The curve then rises as the base is added."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The flat region of a titration curve for a weak acid/base, where the pH changes very slowly, is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Buffer region",
          "Equivalence zone",
          "Inversion point",
          "Saturation plateau"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In this region, both the weak species and its conjugate are present in significant amounts, allowing the solution to resist changes in pH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When titrating a **Weak Base** with a **Strong Acid**, the pH at the equivalence point will be:",
        "options": [
          "Less than 7.0",
          "Greater than 7.0",
          "Exactly 7.0",
          "Exactly 14.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conjugate acid produced during the titration undergoes hydrolysis to produce $H_3O^+$ ions, resulting in an acidic equivalence point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a titration calculation, if $25.0$ mL of $0.10$ M $NaOH$ neutralizes $50.0$ mL of $HCl$, what is the molarity of the $HCl$?",
        "options": [
          "0.05 M",
          "0.10 M",
          "0.20 M",
          "0.50 M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$: $(0.10\\text{ M})(25.0\\text{ mL}) = (M_2)(50.0\\text{ mL})$. $M_2 = 2.5 / 50 = 0.05$ M."
