    "subtitle": "12.5: Reaction Quotient Q: Predicting Reaction Direction",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Comparing Q to K to predict shifts",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between the Reaction Quotient ($Q$) and the Equilibrium Constant ($K$)?",
        "options": [
          "Q is calculated using initial or current concentrations, while K uses equilibrium concentrations",
          "Q uses different stoichiometric coefficients than K",
          "Q only applies to exothermic reactions, while K applies to all",
          "Q is measured in grams, while K is measured in Molarity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mathematical formula for $Q$ and $K$ is identical, but $Q$ represents the ratio of products to reactants at any point in time, not just at equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $Q < K$, in which direction will the reaction proceed to reach equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "To the right (forward), producing more products",
          "To the left (reverse), producing more reactants",
          "The reaction is already at equilibrium and will not shift",
          "The reaction will stop completely"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $Q$ is less than $K$, the ratio of products to reactants is too small. The system must form more products to increase $Q$ until it equals $K$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $Q > K$, what does this indicate about the current state of the reaction?",
        "options": [
          "There is an excess of products relative to the equilibrium state",
          "There is an excess of reactants relative to the equilibrium state",
          "The reaction has reached its maximum speed",
          "The reaction must be at a very low temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A $Q$ value larger than $K$ means the numerator (products) is too large. The reaction will shift toward the reactants (to the left) to reach equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When $Q = K$, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "The system is at equilibrium",
          "The reaction has gone to completion",
          "The forward reaction is much faster than the reverse reaction",
          "All reactants have been consumed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the current ratio of concentrations matches the equilibrium constant, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3}(g)$, how is $Q_{c}$ expressed?",
        "options": [
          "Q_{c} = [NH_{3}]_{t}^{2} / ([N_{2}]_{t}[H_{2}]_{t}^{3})",
          "Q_{c} = [N_{2}]_{t}[H_{2}]_{t}^{3} / [NH_{3}]_{t}^{2}",
          "Q_{c} = 2[NH_{3}]_{t} / ([N_{2}]_{t} + 3[H_{2}]_{t})",
          "Q_{c} = [NH_{3}]_{t} / ([N_{2}]_{t}[H_{2}]_{t})"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The expression for $Q$ follows the exact same Law of Mass Action as $K$, using the concentrations at a specific time ($t$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a container where only reactants are present ($[Products] = 0$), what is the value of $Q$?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "Infinity",
          "1",
          "Equal to K"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the concentration of products (the numerator) is zero, $Q$ must be zero. Since $0 < K$, the reaction will proceed forward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a container where only products are present ($[Reactants] = 0$), what is the value of $Q$?",
        "options": [
          "Infinity",
          "0",
          "1",
          "Equal to K"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the concentration of reactants (the denominator) is zero, the value of $Q$ becomes undefined or infinitely large. Since $Q > K$, the reaction will proceed in reverse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Does $Q$ change as a reaction proceeds toward equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, Q changes until it eventually equals K",
          "No, Q is a constant value for every reaction",
          "Yes, Q increases regardless of the starting conditions",
          "No, only the temperature can change Q"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the reaction moves forward or backward, the concentrations of species change, causing $Q$ to change until the equilibrium ratio is achieved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is at equilibrium and more reactant is added, what is the immediate effect on $Q$?",
        "options": [
          "Q becomes smaller than K",
          "Q becomes larger than K",
          "Q remains equal to K",
          "Q becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding reactant increases the denominator of the $Q$ expression, making $Q$ smaller. Because $Q < K$, the reaction will shift forward to consume the added reactant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Predict the direction: $K_{c} = 100$. Current concentrations: $[Prod] = 10 M, [React] = 2 M$.",
        "options": [
          "Shift forward (to the right) because Q = 5",
          "Shift backward (to the left) because Q = 5",
          "Shift forward (to the right) because Q = 200",
          "No shift; the system is at equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Q = 10/2 = 5$. Since $5 < 100$, $Q < K$, and the reaction must move forward to reach equilibrium."
