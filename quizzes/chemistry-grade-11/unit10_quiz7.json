        "options": [
          "$E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}} = E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cathode}} - E^{\\circ}_{\\text{anode}}$",

        "question": "A cell has a cathode with $E^{\\circ} = +0.80$ V and an anode with $E^{\\circ} = -0.76$ V. What is the $E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}}$?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$E^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}} = 0.80 - (-0.76) = 0.80 + 0.76 = 1.56$ V."

          "Explosive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative cell potential means the reaction requires an external energy source to proceed and will not happen naturally in that direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When reversing a half-reaction to show it as an oxidation, what happens to the sign of its $E^{\\circ}$ value if you are using the 'Addition Method' ($E^{\\circ}_{\\text{red}} + E^{\\circ}_{\\text{ox}}$)?",
        "options": [
          "The sign is reversed",
          "The sign remains the same",

          "The value is squared"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the standard subtraction formula handles the sign automatically, if you look at it as a sum of potentials, the oxidation potential is the negative of the reduction potential."

          "Neutral (zero)",
          "Smallest absolute value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'stronger' oxidizer (higher $E^{\\circ}$) will successfully pull electrons and undergo reduction at the cathode."

          "$-0.42$ V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Copper is the cathode, Zinc is the anode. $0.34 - (-0.76) = 1.10$ V."

          "The concentration of the electrolytes (if not $1$ M)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Voltage is an intensive property; adding more mass or surface area might increase the current (amps) or the life of the battery, but it doesn't change the potential (volts)."
      },

          "A strong acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the potential difference between the two compartments is zero, there is no driving force for electrons to move."

          "It gradually decreases",
          "It gradually increases",
          "It stays constant until it hits zero",
          "It depends only on the volume of the salt bridge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the reaction proceeds, the concentrations move away from $1$ M toward equilibrium, causing the voltage to drop (described by the Nernst Equation)."
