          "Both A and B only"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "All three conditions must hold: $f(a)$ exists, the limit exists, and they are equal."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} = 1$, so defining f(0)=1 makes the function continuous."
