        "options": ["112 m", "124 m", "98 m", "104 m"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since V = dS/dt, displacement S is the area under the V-t curve. From the graph: (1) Triangle: ½ × 8 × 3 = 12, (2) Rectangle: 4 × 8 = 32, (3) Trapezoid: ½ × (8 + 15) × 2 = 23, (4) Triangle: ½ × 6 × 15 = 45. Sum = 12 + 32 + 23 + 45 = 112 m."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acceleration $a = dV/dt$ is the slope of the V-t graph. In the first 3 seconds, the graph shows a straight line from (0,0) to (3,8). Slope = $\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{8 - 0}{3 - 0} = \\frac{8}{3} = 2.67 \\, m/s^2$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Between 9s and 15s, the velocity decreases from 15 m/s to 0 m/s. Acceleration = slope = $\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{0 - 15}{15 - 9} = \\frac{-15}{6} = -2.5 \\, m/s^2$. The negative sign indicates deceleration."
