      {

        "question": "Given the graph shown, and given that V = dS/dt, determine the value of S?",
        "image": "images/int1.png",
        "options": ["112 m", "124 m", "98 m", "104 m"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since V = dS/dt, displacement S is the area under the V-t curve. From the graph: (1) Triangle: ½ × 8 × 3 = 12, (2) Rectangle: 4 × 8 = 32, (3) Trapezoid: ½ × (8 + 15) × 2 = 23, (4) Triangle: ½ × 6 × 15 = 45. Sum = 12 + 32 + 23 + 45 = 112 m."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $a = \\frac{dV}{dt}$, where $t$ is time (in seconds), what is the value of $a$ within the first 3 seconds?",

        "options": ["2.67 $m/s^2$", "2.24 $m/s^2$", "3.15 $m/s^2$", "3.29 $m/s^2$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acceleration $a = dV/dt$ is the slope of the V-t graph. In the first 3 seconds, the graph shows a straight line from (0,0) to (3,8). Slope = $\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{8 - 0}{3 - 0} = \\frac{8}{3} = 2.67 \\, m/s^2$."

        "options": ["-2.5 $m/s^2$", "2.5 $m/s^2$", "-1.5 $m/s^2$", "1.5 $m/s^2$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Between 9s and 15s, the velocity decreases from 15 m/s to 0 m/s. Acceleration = slope = $\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{0 - 15}{15 - 9} = \\frac{-15}{6} = -2.5 \\, m/s^2$. The negative sign indicates deceleration."

          "$10 - x^2 + C$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The graph shows a parabolic curve. If the function is $f(x) = 10 - x^2$, then its antiderivative is $\\int (10 - x^2) dx = 10x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + C$, where C is the constant of integration."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The curve is $f(x) = 10 - x^2$, which intersects the x-axis at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{10}$. Area = $\\int_{-\\sqrt{10}}^{\\sqrt{10}} (10 - x^2) dx = \\left[10x - \\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-\\sqrt{10}}^{\\sqrt{10}} = 2\\left(10\\sqrt{10} - \\frac{10\\sqrt{10}}{3}\\right) = \\frac{40\\sqrt{10}}{3} \\approx 42.16$."
