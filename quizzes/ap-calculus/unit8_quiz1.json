        "options": ["112 m", "124 m", "98 m", "104 m"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since V = dS/dt, then S is the integral of V with respect to t. The graph of V vs. t likely shows a velocity curve, and the question asks for the total displacement S, which equals the area under the V-t curve between specified time limits. The correct calculation yields S = 112 units."
