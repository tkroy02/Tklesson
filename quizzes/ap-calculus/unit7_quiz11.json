    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A function f is continuous on [-3, 5] with f'(-1) = 0, f'(2) undefined, and f'(4) = 0. Which x-values must be considered when finding absolute extrema on this interval?",
        "options": ["x = -1, 2, 4", "x = -3, -1, 2, 4, 5", "x = -1, 4", "x = 2 only"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To find absolute extrema on a closed interval, evaluate the function at all critical points (where f'(x) = 0 or undefined) AND at the endpoints."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The derivative of a function g is given by g'(x) = (x+2)(x-1)². On which interval(s) is g decreasing?",
        "options": ["(-∞, -2)", "(-2, 1)", "(1, ∞)", "(-2, 1) ∪ (1, ∞)"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A function is decreasing when g'(x) < 0. Test intervals: For x < -2, g'(x) is negative; for -2 < x < 1 and x > 1, g'(x) is positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cylindrical can must hold 1000π cm³ of liquid. To minimize the cost of metal (minimize surface area), what should the ratio of height (h) to radius (r) be?",
        "options": ["h = r", "h = 2r", "h = 0.5r", "h = 4r"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From V = πr²h = 1000π, get h = 1000/r². Surface area S = 2πr² + 2πrh. Substitute h, take derivative, set to zero. Solving yields h = 2r."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the Second Derivative Test on f(x) = x³ - 3x² - 9x + 10, what can be concluded about the critical point at x = 3?",
        "options": ["Local maximum", "Local minimum", "Point of inflection", "Test is inconclusive"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "f'(x) = 3x² - 6x - 9. f''(x) = 6x - 6. f''(3) = 12 > 0, indicating concave up, therefore a local minimum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves along a line with position s(t) = t³ - 6t² + 9t + 1 for t ≥ 0. When is the particle speeding up?",
        "options": ["1 < t < 3", "t > 2", "0 < t < 1 and t > 3", "t > 3 only"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Speeding up when velocity and acceleration have the same sign. v(t) = 3t² - 12t + 9, a(t) = 6t - 12. Their signs are both positive only for t > 3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the x-coordinate of the point of inflection for the graph of y = xe^{-x/2}.",
        "options": ["x = 0", "x = 2", "x = 4", "x = 1"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Find y'' = e^{-x/2}(x/4 - 1). Set equal to zero: x/4 - 1 = 0 → x = 4. Check sign change of y'' to confirm it's an inflection point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rectangle is inscribed in the ellipse x²/36 + y²/16 = 1 with sides parallel to the axes. What is the maximum possible area?",
        "options": ["96", "72", "48", "192"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Let corner in QI be (x,y). Area A = 4xy. From ellipse, y = (4/6)√(36-x²) = (2/3)√(36-x²). Maximize A(x)=(8/3)x√(36-x²). Solving yields x=3√2, y=2√2, A=4*(3√2)*(2√2)=48."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the function f(x) = ln(x² + 4), find the interval(s) where the graph is concave upward.",
        "options": ["(-2, 2)", "(-∞, -2) ∪ (2, ∞)", "(-∞, ∞)", "(0, ∞)"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "f''(x) = (8 - 2x²)/(x²+4)². Concave upward when f''(x) > 0 → 8 - 2x² > 0 → x² < 4 → -2 < x < 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If f'(x) = (x-2)³(x+1)², how many relative extrema does the graph of f have?",
        "options": ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Critical points at x=2 (odd multiplicity 3: sign change → extremum) and x=-1 (even multiplicity 2: no sign change → no extremum). Therefore, 1 relative extremum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You have 40 feet of fencing to build three sides of a rectangular garden, with a long existing wall forming the fourth side. To maximize area, the side perpendicular to the wall should be:",
        "options": ["10 ft", "15 ft", "20 ft", "12.5 ft"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let sides perpendicular = x, side parallel = y. Constraint: 2x + y = 40. Area A = x*y = x(40-2x) = 40x - 2x². A'(x)=40-4x=0 → x=10 ft."
