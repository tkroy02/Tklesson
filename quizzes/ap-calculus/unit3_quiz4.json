      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [0,1] with f(0)=0, f(1)=1. For any countable set S ⊆ (0,1), there exists c ∈ (0,1) such that f(c) ∉ S. This statement is:",
        "options": [
          "Always true",
          "True only if f is strictly monotonic",
          "False for some f",
          "True only if S is finite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The image f([0,1]) is uncountable (connected set), while S is countable, so f([0,1]) cannot be contained in S ∪ {0,1}."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function f on [0,1] satisfies f(0)=0 and has the property that f(x) ∈ ℚ for all x ∈ ℚ. Then f must be:",
        "options": [
          "The zero function",
          "A polynomial with rational coefficients",
          "Linear",
          "Not necessarily any of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Many non-linear functions preserve rationality on rational inputs (e.g., f(x)=x²). The condition doesn't force linearity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [a,b] and let E = {x ∈ [a,b] : f(x) = sup f}. If E is disconnected, then:",
        "options": [
          "f must be constant on some subinterval",
          "There exists c where f(c) = inf f between components of E",
          "f cannot be analytic",
          "E must contain at least 3 points"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If E is disconnected, take points from different components. By IVT on the path between them (avoiding E), f takes all values between sup f and some lower value, but wait - f is constant = sup f on E, so between components f must be strictly less than sup f, then by continuity takes intermediate values."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function f on ℝ satisfies f(x+1)=f(x) and f(x+√2)=f(x) for all x. Then f must be:",
        "options": [
          "Constant",
          "Periodic with period 1",
          "Nowhere differentiable",
          "Bounded but not necessarily constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The set {m+n√2 : m,n ∈ ℤ} is dense in ℝ. Since f is continuous and constant on a dense set, f must be constant everywhere."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [0,1] with f(0)=f(1)=0. If for every y ∈ (0,1) the equation f(x)=y has at least 2 solutions, then f must have:",
        "options": [
          "A local maximum > 0",
          "A local minimum < 0",
          "At least 3 critical points",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since f takes each positive value at least twice and f(0)=f(1)=0, f must go positive in between, hence has a positive maximum. It could stay non-negative."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function f on [0,1] satisfies f(0)=0 and the functional equation f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x,y with x+y ≤ 1. Using only continuity (not measure theory), prove f(x)=cx. The key step is:",

          "Apply IVT to f(x)-cx",
          "Show f is differentiable at 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For Cauchy functional equations, one first proves f(q)=cq for rational q, then uses continuity to extend to all reals. IVT isn't directly used here."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [a,b] and let g(x) = sup{t ∈ [a,x] : f(t) = f(x)}. Then g is:",

          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "g(x) is the leftmost point where f takes the value f(x). It's non-decreasing, constant on intervals where f is constant, and continuous by the intermediate value property of f."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function f on [0,1] has the property that f(x) is transcendental for all transcendental x. Then f must be:",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Many functions preserve transcendence (e.g., f(x)=x²). The condition doesn't determine the function uniquely."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [0,1] with f(0)=0, f(1)=1. For any ε>0, there exists a polynomial p with |f(x)-p(x)|<ε for all x, and p(0)=0, p(1)=1. This is:",

          "Not determined"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The level sets are connected intervals. This means f is either strictly monotonic (each value taken once) or constant on intervals."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [a,b] and define F(x)=∫ₐˣ f(t)dt. If F has n zeros in (a,b), then f has at least:",

          "n-1 zeros",
          "n zeros",
          "n+1 zeros",
          "Cannot determine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By Rolle's Theorem applied to F, between consecutive zeros of F there is at least one zero of f' = f. So n zeros of F give at least n-1 zeros of f."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "f must be differentiable at 0",
          "f'(0) exists and equals 0",
          "f(x) = o(x) as x→0⁺",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "f(x)/x → 0 means f(x) = o(x), but this doesn't guarantee differentiability at 0 (f could oscillate wildly while still being o(x))."

          "A singleton",
          "Unbounded"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Consider g(x)=f(x)-∫₀ˣ f(t)dt. g(0)=0. If g is identically 0, done. Else, g takes both positive and negative values, so by IVT, g(c)=0 for some c>0."

          "Not determined"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Many functions preserve constructibility (e.g., f(x)=x²). The condition is very weak and doesn't determine f."

        "question": "Let f be continuous on [a,b] and let P be a property such that if f has P on two overlapping intervals, then f has P on their union. If f has P on each [x,x+ε] for some ε>0, then f has P on [a,b]. This is:",

          "The Heine-Borel Theorem"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a standard connectedness argument: the set where f has P is both open and closed in the relative topology, hence is the whole interval."
