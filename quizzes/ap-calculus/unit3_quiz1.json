          "Monotonic on a closed interval",
          "Bounded on a closed interval"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IVT requires continuity on a closed interval [a,b]."

          "At x=1.5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "f(1)=1>0, f(2)=4>0 - same sign, so IVT doesn't guarantee a root."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If f is continuous on [0,4] with f(0)=-3 and f(4)=5, IVT guarantees a root exists because:",
