Since $f'(x) > 0$ on the entire open interval $(-2,2)$, the function $f$ is increasing throughout. A relative maximum would require a sign change in $f'$ from positive to negative, which does not occur in the interior of the interval. Therefore, there are no relative maxima in $(-2,2)$."

Apply the initial condition $y(0) = 4$: $4^2 = 0^3 + 0 + C$, so $16 = C$. Thus, $y^2 = x^3 + x + 16$, and solving for $y$ (taking the positive root since $y(0) = 4 > 0$) yields $y = \\sqrt{x^3 + x + 16}$."
