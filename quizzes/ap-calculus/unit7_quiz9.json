     {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An industrial designer is creating a rectangular storage container with an open top and a fixed volume of 50 m³. The length of the base must be exactly twice the width. If the base material costs $15/m² and the side material costs $9/m², which equation represents the total cost C(x) as a function of the width x that must be minimized?",
        "options": [
          "C(x) = 30x² + 1350/x",
          "C(x) = 15x² + 900/x",
          "C(x) = 20x² + 1200/x",
          "C(x) = 25x² + 1500/x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let width = x, length = 2x, and height = h. Volume constraint: 2x²h = 50 → h = 25/x². Base cost: Area (2x²) * 15 = 30x². Side cost: Area (2 sides of xh + 2 sides of 2xh = 6xh) * 9 = 54xh. Substitute h: 54x(25/x²) = 1350/x. Total Cost: C(x) = 30x² + 1350/x."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A farmer plans to fence a rectangular area of 1.5 million ft². To divide the area into two equal portions, an internal fence is placed parallel to one of the sides. What should the length of this internal dividing fence be to minimize the total amount of fencing used?",
        "options": [
          "1500 ft",
          "1000 ft",
          "2000 ft",
          "1200 ft"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let L be the length and W be the width (and the divider). Area: LW = 1.5e6 → L = 1.5e6/W. Total fence: F = 2L + 3W. Substitute L: F(W) = 3e6/W + 3W. F'(W) = -3e6/W² + 3. Setting F'(W) = 0 yields W² = 1e6, so W = 1000. Wait, checking logic: L² = 2.25e6, L = 1500. Correct length parallel to divider is 1500 ft."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let cylinder radius = r and height = h. By Pythagoras: r² + (h/2)² = 3² → r² = 9 - h²/4. Volume V = πr²h = π(9 - h²/4)h = 9πh - πh³/4. V'(h) = 9π - 3πh²/4. Setting V'(h) = 0 → 3h²/4 = 9 → h² = 12 → h = 2√3."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Minimize squared distance D = (x-1)² + (y-4)². Substitute x = y²/2: D(y) = (y²/2 - 1)² + (y-4)². D'(y) = 2(y²/2 - 1)(y) + 2(y-4) = (y³ - 2y) + 2y - 8 = y³ - 8. Set D'(y) = 0 → y = 2. If y = 2, x = 2²/2 = 2. The point is (2, 2)."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perimeter P = 2h + 2r + πr = 30 → h = 15 - r - πr/2. Area A = 2rh + (1/2)πr². Substitute h: A(r) = 2r(15 - r - πr/2) + (1/2)πr² = 30r - 2r² - (1/2)πr². A'(r) = 30 - 4r - πr. Set A'(r) = 0 → r(4 + π) = 30 → r = 30 / (4 + π)."
