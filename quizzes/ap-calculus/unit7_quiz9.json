      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cylindrical can with both top and bottom must contain exactly 500 cm³ of liquid. If the can has radius r cm and height h cm, which relationship between h and r minimizes the surface area (and thus material used)?",
        "options": [
          "h = 2r (height equals diameter)",
          "h = r (height equals radius)",
          "h = πr (height equals circumference)",
          "h = r/2 (height half of radius)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Volume constraint: πr²h = 500 → h = 500/(πr²). Surface area S = 2πr² + 2πrh = 2πr² + 1000/r. Minimize: S'(r) = 4πr - 1000/r² = 0 → 4πr³ = 1000 → r³ = 250/π → h = 500/(πr²) = 2r."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rectangular poster must contain 50 in² of printed material. Margins are 2 inches at top and bottom, and 1 inch on each side. If w is the width of the printed area, which value of w minimizes the total area of the poster?",
        "options": [
          "5 inches",
          "6 inches",
          "8 inches",
          "10 inches"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Printed height h = 50/w. Poster dimensions: width = w + 2 (1″ each side), height = h + 4 (2″ top + 2″ bottom). Total area A = (w+2)(50/w + 4) = 98 + 2w + 96/w. A'(w) = 2 - 96/w² = 0 → w² = 48 → w = 4√3 ≈ 6.93? Wait — recalc: Actually A(w) = (w+2)(50/w+4) = 50 + 4w + 100/w + 8 = 58 + 4w + 100/w. A'(w) = 4 - 100/w² = 0 → w² = 25 → w = 5 inches. My earlier simplification had an error; corrected here."

        "question": "A 10-foot ladder leans against a vertical wall. The bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall horizontally at a constant rate of 1 ft/s. When the bottom is 6 feet from the wall, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall?",
        "options": [

          "1.5 ft/s downward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let x = distance from wall to ladder bottom, y = height of ladder top. x² + y² = 100. Differentiate: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. Given dx/dt = 1, at x = 6: y = √(100-36) = 8. So 6(1) + 8(dy/dt) = 0 → dy/dt = -6/8 = -0.75 ft/s (negative indicates downward)."

He can row at 6 km/h and run at 8 km/h. He plans to row to a point on the south bank x km downstream from A, then run the rest. What x minimizes total time?",

When man is 4 m from wall, he is 8 m from spotlight (x=8), and dx/dt = 1.5 (positive toward wall). So dy/dt = -24/64 × 1.5 = -0.5625 m/s (negative means decreasing)."
