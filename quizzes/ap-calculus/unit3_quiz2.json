    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If f is continuous on [0,1] with f(0)=0 and f(1)=1, and g is continuous on [0,1] with g(0)=1 and g(1)=0, prove that f(x)=g(x) for some x in [0,1]. Which function should we apply IVT to?",
        "options": [
          "h(x)=f(x)-g(x)",
          "h(x)=f(x)+g(x)",
          "h(x)=f(x)/g(x)",
          "h(x)=f(g(x))"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "h(0)=f(0)-g(0)=0-1=-1<0, h(1)=f(1)-g(1)=1-0=1>0. Since h is continuous, IVT guarantees h(c)=0 for some c, meaning f(c)=g(c)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function f on [0,2] satisfies f(0)=3 and f(2)=1. Which value is NOT guaranteed by IVT?",
        "options": ["2", "2.5", "0", "1.5"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "IVT guarantees all values between f(2)=1 and f(0)=3. 0 is not between 1 and 3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If f is continuous on [a,b] and takes only rational values, then f must be:",
        "options": [
          "Constant",
          "Linear",
          "Differentiable",
          "Monotonic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By IVT, if f takes two distinct values, it must take all real values between them (including irrationals). So if f takes only rational values, it cannot take two distinct values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [0,1] with f(0)=f(1). For any natural number n, there exists c in [0,1-1/n] such that f(c)=f(c+1/n). Which theorem proves this?",
        "options": [
          "Apply IVT to g(x)=f(x)-f(x+1/n)",
          "Mean Value Theorem",
          "Rolle's Theorem",
          "Extreme Value Theorem"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "g(0)=f(0)-f(1/n), g(1-1/n)=f(1-1/n)-f(1). If these have opposite signs, IVT gives g(c)=0. If same sign, consider intermediate points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function f on [-1,1] satisfies f(-1)=-2, f(0)=1, f(1)=0. How many roots does f have in (-1,1)?",
        "options": [
          "At least 1",
          "At least 2",
          "Exactly 1",
          "Exactly 2"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "f(-1)=-2<0, f(0)=1>0 → root in (-1,0). f(0)=1>0, f(1)=0 → root at x=1 or in (0,1). So at least 2 roots counting multiplicity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "[1,2]",
          "No solution guaranteed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Consider g(x)=f(x)-f(x+1) on [0,1]. g(0)=f(0)-f(1), g(1)=f(1)-f(2)=f(1)-f(0). So g(0)=-g(1). If g(0)=0, done. Else, opposite signs → IVT gives g(c)=0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function on [0,4] takes each value in its range exactly twice. What is the maximum number of roots it can have?",
        "options": ["2", "3", "4", "6"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If it takes each value twice, it must be non-monotonic. Maximum roots occur with symmetric oscillation: can have roots at 1,2,3 (three distinct roots) but careful: if it takes 0 twice, that means 2 roots maximum for that value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [a,b] and let g(x)=max{f(t): a≤t≤x}. Which is true about g?",

          "g is continuous",
          "g is differentiable",
          "g satisfies IVT",
          "g is constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The maximum function of a continuous function is continuous (though not necessarily differentiable). All continuous functions satisfy IVT."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If f is continuous on [0,1] and 0≤f(x)≤1 for all x, then f has a fixed point (f(c)=c). This is proved by:",

          "Mean Value Theorem",
          "Rolle's Theorem",
          "Extreme Value Theorem"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "g(0)=f(0)-0≥0, g(1)=f(1)-1≤0. If either is 0, done. Else, opposite signs → IVT gives g(c)=0, so f(c)=c."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function f on [0,2π] satisfies f(0)=f(2π). How many solutions does f(x)=f(x+π) have?",
        "options": [
          "At least 1",

          "Exactly 1",
          "None guaranteed"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Consider g(x)=f(x)-f(x+π) on [0,π]. g(0)=f(0)-f(π), g(π)=f(π)-f(2π)=f(π)-f(0). So g(0)=-g(π). If g(0)=0, then x=0 and x=π are solutions. Else, IVT gives one in (0,π), and by periodicity/symmetry, at least one more."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If f is continuous on [a,b] and f(x) is never 0, then f(x) must be:",
        "options": [
          "Always positive or always negative",
          "Monotonic",
          "Differentiable",
          "Constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If f takes both positive and negative values, by IVT it would have to take 0. So f must maintain the same sign."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Let f be continuous on [0,1] with f(0)=0, f(1)=1. For any y in (0,1), there exists c in (0,1) with f(c)=y. This statement is:",

          "False for some f",
          "True only if f is one-to-one"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is exactly the Intermediate Value Theorem: continuous on [0,1] with f(0)=0, f(1)=1 guarantees all intermediate values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A continuous function f on [0,2] satisfies f(0)=1, f(1)=3, f(2)=2. Which value is guaranteed to be in the range?",
        "options": ["0", "4", "2.5", "All of the above"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "IVT on [0,1]: all values between 1 and 3. IVT on [1,2]: all values between 3 and 2 (i.e., between 2 and 3). So 2.5 is guaranteed, but 0 and 4 are not."

          "f(x)<g(x) for all x",
          "No conclusion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Apply IVT to h(x)=f(x)-g(x). h(a)<0, h(b)>0, so h(c)=0 for some c, meaning f(c)=g(c)."
      },
      {

          "Exactly 1 solution",
          "At least 2 solutions",
          "No solution",
          "At least 3 solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "f(2)=2<3, f(3)=5>3 → solution in (2,3). f(3)=5>3, f(4)=3 → solution at x=4. So at least 2 solutions."

          "Differentiable",
          "Monotonic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If f takes two distinct irrational values, by IVT it would take all real values between them (including rationals). So f cannot take two distinct values."
      },

          "f is increasing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If f(x)≤0 for all x, then ∫₀¹ f(x)dx ≤ 0. Contrapositive: if integral > 0, then f(x)>0 for some x."

        "options": ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From -1 to 0: increases from -1 to 1 (local max at or before 0). From 0 to 1: decreases from 1 to -1 (local min at or after 0). So at least 2 extrema."

          "No conclusion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If all f(x)>1, then sum>3. If all f(x)<1, then sum<3. So by continuity and IVT, f must take value 1 somewhere."
