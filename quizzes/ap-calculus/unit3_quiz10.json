    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main idea behind the Squeeze Theorem?",
        "options": [
          "If a function is bounded by two other functions with the same limit, it must have that limit too",
          "If a function is continuous, its limit exists",
          "If a function oscillates, its limit doesn't exist",
          "All bounded functions have limits"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Squeeze Theorem states that if g(x) ≤ f(x) ≤ h(x) near a point, and lim g(x) = lim h(x) = L, then lim f(x) = L."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If -x² ≤ f(x) ≤ x² for all x near 0, then $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = $",
        "options": ["0", "1", "-1", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since lim(-x²) = 0 and lim(x²) = 0 as x→0, by Squeeze Theorem, lim f(x) = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": ["0", "1", "-1", "Does not exist"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "-x² ≤ x² sin(1/x) ≤ x², and both bounds → 0 as x→0, so by Squeeze Theorem, limit = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For what type of functions is the Squeeze Theorem most useful?",
        "options": [
          "Functions that oscillate or are hard to evaluate directly",
          "Polynomial functions",
          "Linear functions",
          "Constant functions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Squeeze Theorem is particularly useful for functions that oscillate or behave erratically, as it allows us to find limits without direct evaluation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 2x - 1 ≤ g(x) ≤ x² + 1 for x > 0, then $\\lim_{x \\to 1} g(x) = $",
        "options": ["0", "1", "2", "Cannot determine"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "lim(2x-1) = 1 and lim(x²+1) = 2 as x→1. Since bounds don't approach the same value, Squeeze Theorem doesn't apply directly."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "-|x| ≤ x cos(1/x²) ≤ |x|, and both bounds → 0 as x→0, so by Squeeze Theorem, limit = 0."

          "-x ≤ x³ sin(1/x) ≤ x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since -1 ≤ sin(1/x) ≤ 1, multiplying by x³ gives -x³ ≤ x³ sin(1/x) ≤ x³."

          "L'Hôpital's Rule",
          "Factorization"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The proof uses geometric inequalities: cos x ≤ sin x/x ≤ 1 for small x > 0, and Squeeze Theorem."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If f(x) = x² cos(1/x) for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = 0, is f continuous at 0?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, by Squeeze Theorem",
          "No, because it oscillates",
          "No, because the limit doesn't exist",
          "Cannot determine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "-x² ≤ x² cos(1/x) ≤ x², both bounds → 0, so lim f(x) = 0 = f(0), hence continuous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": ["0", "2", "3", "Does not exist"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1 ≤ 2 + sin(1/x) ≤ 3, so x⁴ ≤ x⁴(2 + sin(1/x)) ≤ 3x⁴. Both bounds → 0, so limit = 0."

          "Be polynomials"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The key requirement is that the upper and lower bounding functions have the same limit at the point of interest."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "-√x ≤ √x cos(1/x) ≤ √x for x > 0, and both bounds → 0 as x→0⁺, so limit = 0."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "lim(-|x|) = 0 and lim(|x|) = 0 as x→0, so by Squeeze Theorem, lim h(x) = 0."

          "f(x) = (sin x)/x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 but doesn't approach a limit, and there are no bounding functions that squeeze it to a common value."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "0 ≤ 1 + cos(1/x) ≤ 2, so 0 ≤ x²(1 + cos(1/x)) ≤ 2x². Both bounds → 0, so limit = 0."

          "f(x) must be differentiable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is exactly the Squeeze Theorem - if g(x) ≤ f(x) ≤ h(x) and both bounds → L, then f(x) → L."
