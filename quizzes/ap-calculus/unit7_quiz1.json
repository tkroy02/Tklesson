    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are inverse functions, which of the following is always true?",
        "options": [
          "$f'(x) = \\frac{1}{g'(x)}$",
          "$f(g(x)) = x$",
          "$f(x) = \\frac{1}{g(x)}$",
          "The graphs are symmetric about the x-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By definition, if $g(x)$ is the inverse of $f(x)$, then $f(g(x)) = x$ and $g(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in their respective domains. This is the fundamental property of inverse functions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the derivative of the inverse function, $(f^{-1})'(x)$, in terms of $f'$?",
        "options": [
          "$(f^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{f'(x)}$",
          "$(f^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$",
          "$(f^{-1})'(x) = f'(f^{-1}(x))$",
          "$(f^{-1})'(x) = -f'(f^{-1}(x))$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The formula for the derivative of an inverse function is $(f^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$. This is one of the most important results for inverse differentiation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(2) = 5$ and $f'(2) = 3$, what is the value of $(f^{-1})'(5)$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{3}$",
          "$3$",
          "$\\frac{1}{5}$",
          "$5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the inverse derivative formula: $(f^{-1})'(5) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(5))}$. Since $f(2) = 5$, we know $f^{-1}(5) = 2$. Therefore, $(f^{-1})'(5) = \\frac{1}{f'(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a function $f(x)$ that has an inverse, if the point $(3, 7)$ lies on the graph of $y = f(x)$, what point must lie on the graph of $y = f^{-1}(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$(3, 7)$",
          "$(7, 3)$",
          "$(-3, -7)$",
          "$(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{7})$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The graphs of a function and its inverse are symmetric about the line $y = x$. This means that if $(a, b)$ is on $f(x)$, then $(b, a)$ is on $f^{-1}(x)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x)$ is a one-to-one function and $f(4) = 6$, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "$f'(4) = \\frac{1}{6}$",
          "$f^{-1}(6) = 4$",
          "$f^{-1}(4) = 6$",
          "$f'(6) = \\frac{1}{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By definition of inverse functions, if $f(a) = b$ for a one-to-one function, then $f^{-1}(b) = a$. Therefore, if $f(4) = 6$, then $f^{-1}(6) = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which condition ensures that a function has an inverse function?",
        "options": [
          "The function is continuous",
          "The function is differentiable",
          "The function is one-to-one",
          "The function is onto"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A function has an inverse function if and only if it is one-to-one (passes the horizontal line test). This ensures that for each y-value in the range, there is exactly one x-value in the domain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x) = 2x + 3$, what is the derivative of its inverse function?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{2}$",
          "$2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2x + 3}$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2x}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For $f(x) = 2x + 3$, we have $f'(x) = 2$. The derivative of the inverse is $(f^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is constant. This makes sense since both $f(x)$ and its inverse are linear functions with constant slopes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the slopes of tangent lines at corresponding points on a function and its inverse?",
        "options": [
          "They are equal",
          "They are reciprocals",
          "They are negatives",
          "They are unrelated"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At corresponding points $(a,b)$ on $f(x)$ and $(b,a)$ on $f^{-1}(x)$, the slopes of the tangent lines are reciprocals of each other. That is, if $f'(a) = m$, then $(f^{-1})'(b) = \\frac{1}{m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $f(x)$ is differentiable and has an inverse, and $f(1) = 3$ with $f'(1) = 4$, what is the slope of the tangent line to $y = f^{-1}(x)$ at $x = 3$?",
        "options": [
          "$4$",
          "$\\frac{1}{4}$",
          "$3$",
          "$\\frac{1}{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The slope of the tangent line to $f^{-1}(x)$ at $x = 3$ is $(f^{-1})'(3)$. Using the formula: $(f^{-1})'(3) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(3))} = \\frac{1}{f'(1)} = \\frac{1}{4}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a function $f(x)$ that is increasing and differentiable on its domain, what can be said about its inverse function?",
        "options": [
          "The inverse is decreasing",
          "The inverse is also increasing",
          "The inverse has the same derivative as $f(x)$",
          "The inverse is not differentiable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $f(x)$ is increasing on its domain, then its inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ will also be increasing on its domain. The graphs are symmetric about $y = x$, so increasing behavior is preserved."
