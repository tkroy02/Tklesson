      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given that $y = \\cos^{-1}(x)$, determine $\\frac{dy}{dx}$.",
        "options": [
          "$-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$",

          "$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$",
          "$\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The derivative of $\\cos^{-1}(x)$ is $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$ for $-1 < x < 1$. This is a standard result that can be derived using implicit differentiation."

        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{3}$",
          "$3$",
          "$\\frac{1}{5}$",
          "$5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The slope of the tangent line to $f^{-1}(x)$ at $x = 5$ is $(f^{-1})'(5)$. Using the formula: $(f^{-1})'(5) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(5))} = \\frac{1}{f'(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At corresponding points $(a,b)$ on $f(x)$ and $(b,a)$ on $f^{-1}(x)$, the slopes are reciprocals. If $f'(4) = \\frac{1}{2}$, then $(f^{-1})'(f(4)) = 2$."

          "$3$"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the inverse derivative formula in reverse: $(f^{-1})'(7) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(7))} = \\frac{1}{f'(3)}$. So if $(f^{-1})'(7) = \\frac{1}{4}$, then $f'(3) = 4$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $(2, 8)$ is on $f(x)$, then $(8, 2)$ is on $f^{-1}(x)$. The slope of $f^{-1}(x)$ at $x = 8$ is $(f^{-1})'(8) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(8))} = \\frac{1}{f'(2)} = \\frac{1}{5}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The correct formula for the derivative of an inverse function is $(f^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$. This is one of the most important results in inverse differentiation."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the inverse derivative formula: $(f^{-1})'(6) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(6))}$. Since $f(1) = 6$, we know $f^{-1}(6) = 1$. Therefore, $(f^{-1})'(6) = \\frac{1}{f'(1)} = \\frac{1}{8}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We're given $(f^{-1})'(10) = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $f(4) = 10$ (so $f^{-1}(10) = 4$). Using the formula: $(f^{-1})'(10) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(10))} = \\frac{1}{f'(4)}$. So $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{f'(4)}$, meaning $f'(4) = 3$."
