      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves along the curve $y = x^2$. At what point(s) on the curve are the x and y coordinates changing at the same rate?",
        "options": ["(0,0) only", "(0.5,0.25) only", "(1,1) only", "(0,0) and (0.5,0.25)"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Differentiate both sides with respect to t: $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 2x\\frac{dx}{dt}$. Set $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{dx}{dt}$: $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2x\\frac{dx}{dt}$. If $\\frac{dx}{dt} \\neq 0$, then $1 = 2x$, so $x = 0.5$, $y = 0.25$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A right circular cylinder is inscribed in a sphere of radius R. What is the maximum possible volume of such a cylinder?",
        "options": ["$\\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3\\sqrt{3}}$", "$\\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3}$", "$\\frac{4\\pi R^3}{\\sqrt{3}}$", "$\\frac{2\\pi R^3}{3\\sqrt{3}}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let cylinder radius = r, height = h. By Pythagorean theorem: $r^2 + (h/2)^2 = R^2$. Volume $V = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi(R^2 - h^2/4)h$. Differentiate: $V' = \\pi(R^2 - 3h^2/4) = 0$ when $h = 2R/\\sqrt{3}$. Maximum volume = $\\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3\\sqrt{3}}$."

        "options": ["25 units", "50 units", "75 units", "100 units"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Revenue $R(x) = xp = 100xe^{-0.02x}$. $R'(x) = 100e^{-0.02x} - 2xe^{-0.02x} = 100e^{-0.02x}(1 - 0.02x) = 0$ when $x = 50$ units."

        "question": "A man is walking along a straight path at 4 ft/s. A searchlight on the ground 20 ft from the path follows him. How fast is the searchlight rotating when the man is 15 ft from the point on the path closest to the light?",
        "options": ["0.08 rad/s", "0.12 rad/s", "0.16 rad/s", "0.20 rad/s"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Let x = distance from closest point, θ = angle. tanθ = x/20, so sec²θ dθ/dt = (1/20) dx/dt. When x=15, dx/dt=4, and secθ = 25/20 = 1.25. Then (1.5625) dθ/dt = 0.2, so dθ/dt = 0.128 rad/s ≈ 0.13 rad/s. Wait, correction: tanθ = x/20, differentiate: sec²θ dθ/dt = (1/20) dx/dt. When x=15, hypotenuse=25, so secθ=25/20=1.25, sec²θ=1.5625. Then 1.5625 dθ/dt = 4/20=0.2, so dθ/dt=0.128 rad/s."

        "question": "The position of a particle is given by $s(t) = t^3 - 6t^2 + 9t + 1$. What is the total distance traveled in the first 4 seconds?",
        "options": ["8 units", "10 units", "12 units", "14 units"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Velocity $v(t) = 3t^2 - 12t + 9 = 3(t-1)(t-3)$. Particle changes direction at t=1 and t=3. s(0)=1, s(1)=5, s(3)=1, s(4)=5. Distance = |5-1| + |1-5| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 units. Wait, correction: s(0)=1, s(1)=5 (4 units), s(3)=1 (4 units back), s(4)=5 (4 units forward) = 12 units total."

        "options": ["40×40×20 cm", "30×30×35.6 cm", "35×35×26.1 cm", "45×45×15.8 cm"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let base = x, height = h. Volume: $x^2h = 32000$, so $h = 32000/x^2$. Surface area $A = x^2 + 4xh = x^2 + 128000/x$. $A' = 2x - 128000/x^2 = 0$ when $2x^3 = 128000$, $x^3 = 64000$, $x = 40$ cm, $h = 20$ cm."

        "options": ["50 units", "75 units", "100 units", "125 units"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average cost $AC(x) = C(x)/x = 2000/x + 10 + 0.001x^2$. $AC'(x) = -2000/x^2 + 0.002x = 0$ when $0.002x = 2000/x^2$, so $0.002x^3 = 2000$, $x^3 = 1,000,000$, $x = 100$ units."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By similar triangles, radius at height h is r = h/2. Volume $V = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (h/2)^2 h = \\frac{\\pi}{12}h^3$. $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}h^2 \\frac{dh}{dt}$. When h=6, dV/dt=2: $2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}(36)\\frac{dh}{dt}$, so $\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{2}{9\\pi}$ ft/min."

        "question": "A particle moves along the parabola $y = x^2 - 4x + 5$. At what point is the particle closest to the origin?",
        "options": ["(1,2)", "(2,1)", "(3,2)", "(4,5)"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Distance squared $D^2 = x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (x^2 - 4x + 5)^2$. Differentiate: $\\frac{d}{dx}(D^2) = 2x + 2(x^2 - 4x + 5)(2x - 4) = 2x + (2x^2 - 8x + 10)(2x - 4)$. Set = 0 and solve: This simplifies to $2x^3 - 12x^2 + 26x - 20 = 0$. Testing x=2 gives 16-48+52-20=0, so (x-2) is factor. The point is (2,1)."

        "options": ["(1,2) only", "(2,3) only", "(1,1.5) only", "(1.5,2) only"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Velocity $v(t) = 6t^2 - 18t + 12 = 6(t-1)(t-2)$. Acceleration $a(t) = 12t - 18$. Speed decreases when velocity and acceleration have opposite signs. For t<1: v>0, a<0 (speed decreases). For 1<t<1.5: v<0, a<0 (speed increases). For 1.5<t<2: v<0, a>0 (speed decreases). For t>2: v>0, a>0 (speed increases). So speed decreases on (0,1) and (1.5,2)."
