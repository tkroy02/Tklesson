        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A farmer wants to fence a rectangular area of 1800 ft² and divide it into three equal pens using fencing parallel to one side of the rectangle. Let L be the length of the side parallel to the dividing fences, and W be the other side. Which expression gives the total amount of fencing needed, and what value of L minimizes it?",
        "options": [
          "F = 2L + 7200/L; L = 60 ft",
          "F = L + 3600/L; L = 60 ft",
          "F = 3L + 1800/L; L = 30√2 ft",
          "F = 2L + 5400/L; L = 45 ft"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area: L×W=1800 → W=1800/L. Fencing: 2 lengths L (top/bottom) + 4 widths W (2 outer sides + 2 dividers). So F=2L+4W=2L+7200/L. Minimize: F'(L)=2−7200/L²=0 → L²=3600 → L=60 ft."

          "15√2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Triangle height=5√3. By similar triangles, y=√3a. Rectangle width=10−2a, height=y=√3a. Area A=(10−2a)(√3a)=√3(10a−2a²). A'(a)=√3(10−4a)=0 → a=2.5. Width=5, height=2.5√3 → Area=12.5√3."

          "25/3 units"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let cone base be at y=c, vertex at y=5. Radius r satisfies r²=25−c², height h=5−c. Volume V=π/3(25−c²)(5−c). Substitute c=5−h: V=π/3(10h−h²)h=π/3(10h²−h³). V'(h)=π/3(20h−3h²)=0 → h=20/3 (h≠0)."

          "2.5 inches",
          "3.5 inches"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After bending, base width=12−2x, side height=x. Cross-section area A=x(12−2x)=12x−2x². A'(x)=12−4x=0 → x=3. Check endpoints: x=0 or 6 gives A=0, so x=3 maximizes."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Printed height h=96/w. Page width=w+1, page height=h+2. Area A=(w+1)(96/w+2)=98+2w+96/w. A'(w)=2−96/w²=0 → w²=48 → w=4√3."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perimeter: 2h+2b+2√(b²+t²)=20. Area A=2bh+bt. Optimize t for fixed b: ∂A/∂t=b−2bt/√(b²+t²)=0 → t=b/√3. Substitute back: A(b)=20b−b²(2+√3). A'(b)=20−2b(2+√3)=0 → b=10/(2+√3)=10(2−√3)."
