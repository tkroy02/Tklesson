    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the central bank increases the money supply, what is the most likely short‑run effect in the AD‑AS model?",
        "options": [
          "AD shifts left, lowering both price level and real GDP",
          "AD shifts right, raising both price level and real GDP",
          "SRAS shifts left, raising price level but lowering real GDP",
          "LRAS shifts right, raising real GDP with no change in price level"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increasing the money supply lowers interest rates, stimulating investment and consumption, which shifts AD to the right — raising output and prices in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be considered a positive supply shock?",
        "options": [
          "A widespread drought destroying crops",
          "A significant decline in consumer confidence",
          "A breakthrough in renewable energy technology that lowers production costs",
          "A sudden increase in government spending on infrastructure"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A positive supply shock reduces production costs or increases productivity, shifting SRAS to the right. A technological breakthrough is a classic example."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the AD‑AS model, if the economy is in an inflationary gap, the long‑run self‑correction mechanism involves:",
        "options": [
          "Wages falling, shifting SRAS right",
          "Wages rising, shifting SRAS left",
          "Government increasing spending, shifting AD right",
          "Central bank reducing money supply, shifting AD left"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In an inflationary gap (output above potential), low unemployment pushes wages up over time, increasing costs and shifting SRAS left until output returns to potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If net exports decrease due to a recession in trading partner countries, what is the short‑run effect in the domestic AD‑AS model?",
        "options": [
          "AD shifts right",
          "AD shifts left",
          "SRAS shifts right",
          "SRAS shifts left"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower net exports (X−M) reduce aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most likely effect of an increase in corporate income taxes on the SRAS curve?",
        "options": [
          "SRAS shifts right",
          "SRAS shifts left",
          "No shift in SRAS, only AD shifts",
          "LRAS shifts left"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher corporate taxes increase production costs, reducing profitability at each price level and shifting SRAS to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a period of stagflation, which of the following policy actions would be most appropriate to address both high inflation and high unemployment?",
        "options": [
          "Increase government spending to shift AD right",
          "Decrease the money supply to shift AD left",
          "Use supply‑side policies to shift SRAS right",
          "Decrease taxes on households to shift AD right"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stagflation is caused by a leftward SRAS shift. Policies that lower production costs (e.g., subsidies, deregulation) can shift SRAS right, reducing both inflation and unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If households expect higher inflation in the future, what is the likely short‑run impact on AD and SRAS?",

          "Both AD and SRAS shift left"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expectations of higher inflation may increase current spending (AD shifts right). Workers may demand higher wages now, raising costs (SRAS shifts left)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which event would cause the LRAS curve to shift to the right?",
        "options": [
          "A temporary decrease in oil prices",
          "An increase in the labor force participation rate",
          "A one‑time increase in government spending",
          "A short‑term boost in consumer confidence"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "LRAS shifts right when the economy's productive capacity increases—more labor, capital, or better technology. A larger labor force increases potential output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the economy is in long‑run equilibrium, which of the following is true?",

          "Actual output exceeds potential output",
          "The unemployment rate is below the natural rate",
          "AD intersects SRAS at a point on the LRAS curve",
          "There is cyclical unemployment present"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Long‑run equilibrium occurs where AD intersects SRAS exactly on the LRAS curve—actual GDP equals potential GDP, and unemployment is at the natural rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A significant appreciation of the domestic currency would most likely cause:",
        "options": [
          "AD to shift right due to higher exports",
          "AD to shift left due to lower exports and higher imports",
          "SRAS to shift right due to cheaper imported inputs",
          "Both AD shifts left and SRAS shifts right"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A stronger currency makes exports more expensive (AD shifts left) and imported inputs cheaper (SRAS shifts right)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government implements a large‑scale infrastructure program financed by borrowing, the initial effect in the AD‑AS model is:",

          "SRAS shifts right",
          "SRAS shifts left",
          "AD shifts right",
          "AD shifts left"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increased government spending (G) financed by borrowing raises aggregate demand, shifting AD to the right."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best illustrates the 'interest‑rate effect' in the downward slope of the AD curve?",
        "options": [
          "Higher prices reduce real wealth, so consumption falls",
          "Higher prices raise interest rates, reducing investment and consumption",
          "Higher domestic prices make exports less competitive, reducing net exports",
          "Higher prices cause firms to increase production along the SRAS curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The interest‑rate effect: higher price level increases demand for money, raises interest rates, and reduces interest‑sensitive spending (I and C)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, an increase in productivity due to worker training will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift AD right",
          "Shift SRAS right",
          "Shift LRAS right only",
          "Shift both SRAS and LRAS right"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity lowers per‑unit production costs, shifting SRAS right in the short run. LRAS also shifts right in the long run, but the question specifies short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the economy is initially at full employment and consumers become more optimistic, the long‑run result will be:",

          "Higher output and higher price level",
          "Higher output with unchanged price level",
          "Unchanged output and higher price level",
          "Unchanged output and unchanged price level"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Starting at full employment, higher optimism shifts AD right, raising prices in the short run. In the long run, wages adjust, SRAS shifts left, returning output to potential but at a higher price level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A decrease in business regulations would most directly affect:",
        "options": [
          "AD by increasing consumption",
          "SRAS by lowering production costs",
          "AD by increasing investment",
          "LRAS without affecting SRAS"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Reducing regulations lowers compliance costs, shifting SRAS right. It may also increase investment (AD shift) over time, but the most direct short‑run effect is on SRAS."

          "LRAS increases due to technological progress"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cost‑push inflation results from a leftward shift of SRAS (e.g., higher oil prices), raising the price level while output falls."

          "AD shifts left",
          "SRAS shifts right",
          "SRAS shifts left"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Selling bonds is a contractionary monetary policy that reduces the money supply, raises interest rates, and decreases investment and consumption — shifting AD left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'wealth effect' component of the AD curve refers to:",
        "options": [
          "How higher prices reduce the real value of money holdings, reducing spending",
          "How higher prices reduce the real value of financial assets, reducing consumption",

          "How lower prices reduce interest rates, stimulating investment"
        ],
        "explanation": "Wealth effect: a lower price level increases the real value of household wealth, raising consumption spending (and vice versa).",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the economy is in a recessionary gap and no policy action is taken, the long‑run adjustment will involve:",

          "Government automatically increasing spending, shifting AD right"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a recessionary gap, high unemployment puts downward pressure on wages, lowering production costs and shifting SRAS right until output returns to potential GDP."
