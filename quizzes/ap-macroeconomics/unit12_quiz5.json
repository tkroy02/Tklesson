    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country X invests heavily in education while Country Y invests equally heavily in physical infrastructure. Both countries start with identical GDP per capita. According to standard growth theory, which country is likely to experience faster sustained growth in living standards over 20 years, and why?",
        "options": [
          "Country X, because human capital improvements have stronger complementarities with technological change",
          "Country Y, because infrastructure directly increases productive capacity without time lags",
          "Both will grow at the same rate since investment rates are equal",
          "Country Y, because physical capital has immediate productivity effects while education returns are uncertain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While both investments contribute to growth, human capital (education) typically has stronger long-term effects because: 1) It enables faster adoption of new technologies, 2) It creates positive externalities (knowledge spillovers), and 3) It's less subject to diminishing returns than physical capital alone. Infrastructure helps immediately but may face congestion or maintenance issues without skilled workers to utilize it effectively."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country's real GDP grows at 4% annually, population grows at 1%, and hours worked grow at 0.5%. If capital stock grows at 5% annually, what can we conclude about the source of economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Growth is primarily extensive (from more inputs) rather than intensive (productivity gains)",
          "Total factor productivity must be negative",
          "Labor productivity is declining",
          "The capital-output ratio is definitely decreasing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Output growth (4%) exceeds the weighted growth of inputs: labor (0.5%) and capital (5%). However, with capital growing much faster than output, this suggests growth is coming largely from capital accumulation (extensive growth) rather than productivity improvements. If productivity were the main driver, we'd expect output to grow faster than the combined inputs. This pattern is characteristic of catch-up growth in developing economies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'rule of 70' is used to estimate doubling time. If a country wants to double its real GDP per capita in 14 years, what annual growth rate must it maintain?",
        "options": [
          "5%",
          "7%",
          "10%",
          "14%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the rule of 70: Doubling time = 70 ÷ growth rate. To double in 14 years: 70 ÷ 14 = 5%. This illustrates how modest differences in growth rates have dramatic long-term effects. A 5% growth rate doubles living standards every 14 years, while a 2% rate takes 35 years—a generation versus a lifetime difference."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider two policies: (1) Tax credits for business R&D spending, (2) Direct government funding of university research. Which is more likely to increase long-run aggregate supply through different channels?",
        "options": [
          "Policy 1 increases applied innovation; Policy 2 increases basic research",
          "Policy 1 is faster acting; Policy 2 has larger multiplier effects",
          "Both have identical effects on LRAS",
          "Policy 1 affects AD only; Policy 2 affects AS only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tax credits for business R&D incentivize private sector investment in applied research with commercial applications (near-term innovation). Government funding of university research supports basic science (long-term knowledge creation). Both increase LRAS but through different channels and time horizons. Applied innovation yields quicker productivity gains; basic research creates foundational knowledge for future breakthroughs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If technological progress is labor-augmenting rather than capital-augmenting, what happens to the marginal product of labor as technology improves?",
        "options": [
          "It increases, making each worker effectively more productive",
          "It decreases, as machines replace human labor",
          "It remains unchanged, as technology affects capital only",
          "It becomes negative due to technological unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Labor-augmenting technological progress makes each worker more effective (e.g., better tools, software, organization). This increases the marginal product of labor—the additional output from hiring one more worker. Even if physical capital doesn't change, workers become more productive. This contrasts with capital-augmenting progress that makes machines more efficient independently of workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country discovers it has been overestimating its real GDP growth by failing to account for environmental degradation. If pollution costs are included, what happens to measures of sustainable economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Measured growth rates decrease, revealing lower sustainable growth",
          "Growth rates increase due to better measurement",
          "Only nominal GDP is affected, not real growth measurements",
          "Environmental costs don't affect GDP by definition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Traditional GDP measures market production but ignores environmental costs (negative externalities). If pollution costs are deducted (green accounting), measured growth rates typically fall, revealing that some apparent growth was unsustainable—achieved by depleting natural capital. This highlights the difference between economic growth and sustainable development."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'productivity slowdown' observed in many advanced economies since the 1970s refers to:",
        "options": [
          "A decline in the growth rate of output per hour worked",
          "An absolute decrease in output per worker",
          "Rising unemployment despite economic growth",
          "Falling investment rates across all sectors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The productivity slowdown describes a reduction in the rate of productivity growth, not an absolute decline. For example, US labor productivity grew about 2.8% annually from 1947-1973 but only 1.6% from 1973-2007. Output per hour still increased, but more slowly. This has profound implications for living standards growth, wage increases, and fiscal sustainability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When comparing developing countries, those with better property rights enforcement typically experience:",
        "options": [
          "Higher rates of investment and technology adoption",
          "Lower growth due to excessive regulation",
          "No significant difference in growth patterns",
          "More equal income distribution but slower growth"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Secure property rights increase incentives for investment because investors can confidently expect to reap future returns. They also facilitate technology adoption by ensuring innovators can profit from their ideas. This institutional foundation explains why some resource-poor countries (like Singapore) outperform resource-rich ones with weak institutions—the 'resource curse' is fundamentally an institutional problem."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's working-age population is shrinking due to aging, what must happen for real GDP per capita to continue growing?",
        "options": [
          "Productivity growth must outpace population decline",
          "The government must run larger deficits",
          "Interest rates must fall to stimulate investment",
          "Immigration must be restricted to protect wages"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Real GDP per capita = (Real GDP) ÷ (Total Population). If working-age population shrinks, total output might fall unless productivity increases sufficiently. For per capita income to rise, output per worker must grow faster than the decline in workers per capita. This explains why aging societies like Japan and Germany prioritize productivity-enhancing policies (automation, education, innovation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Baumol effect' explains why:",
        "options": [
          "Services become relatively more expensive as economies develop",
          "Manufacturing productivity grows faster than services productivity",
          "Economic growth naturally slows in mature economies",
          "Income inequality increases with technological change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "William Baumol observed that productivity growth differs across sectors. Manufacturing enjoys rapid productivity gains (automation), while many services (education, healthcare, arts) are 'handicraft' activities resistant to automation. As manufacturing gets cheaper, spending shifts to services whose relative prices rise. This isn't inflation in the usual sense but structural change affecting growth measurement and living standards."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A developing country receives substantial foreign direct investment (FDI) in its manufacturing sector. What is the most significant potential long-term benefit beyond capital accumulation?",
        "options": [
          "Technology transfer and managerial knowledge spillovers",
          "Immediate increase in government tax revenue",
          "Reduction in import dependence",
          "Strengthening of the domestic currency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While FDI brings capital, its greatest development impact often comes from knowledge spillovers: foreign firms bring advanced technology, management practices, worker training, and quality standards. Local firms learn through observation, supplier relationships, and employee mobility. This technology transfer can have multiplier effects exceeding the direct investment value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the natural rate of unemployment increases due to structural changes in the economy, what happens to potential GDP?",
        "options": [
          "Potential GDP decreases because fewer resources are fully employable",
          "Potential GDP increases due to better job matching",
          "No effect—potential GDP depends on capital and technology, not unemployment",
          "Potential GDP becomes more volatile"
        ],
        "explanation": "Potential GDP represents output at full employment (the natural rate of unemployment). If the natural rate rises (due to skills mismatches, generous benefits, etc.), 'full employment' means more people are unemployed. Thus, potential output is lower at any given level of capital and technology. This illustrates how labor market institutions affect long-run growth, not just short-run fluctuations.",
        "answer": "A"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When calculating labor productivity growth, why might official statistics overestimate true productivity improvements during economic recoveries?",
        "options": [
          "Because firms initially increase output using underutilized capacity before hiring",
          "Due to measurement errors in hours worked data",
          "Because inflation adjustments are imperfect during business cycles",
          "Overtime hours are counted as regular hours"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In early recovery phases, firms increase output by utilizing existing capital and labor more intensively (increasing capacity utilization) before hiring new workers. This temporarily boosts measured output per hour (productivity). Once hiring catches up, productivity growth normalizes. This cyclical pattern means productivity measures should be interpreted carefully across business cycles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Lucas critique' suggests that evaluating economic policies using historical relationships is flawed because:",
        "options": [
          "Agents adjust their behavior based on policy expectations",
          "Statistical relationships are never stable over time",
          "GDP measurements are inherently unreliable",
          "Political factors dominate economic outcomes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Robert Lucas argued that people's behavior depends on their expectations of future policy. If policymakers change rules (e.g., tax rates), people adjust behavior, breaking historical statistical relationships. This critiques traditional Keynesian models and supports rational expectations. For growth policy, it means policies must be credible and consistent—announcing future investment incentives may cause immediate behavioral changes."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country shifts from an import-substitution industrialization strategy to an export-oriented strategy. What growth theory supports this change?",
        "options": [
          "Comparative advantage and gains from trade",
          "Endogenous growth through protected domestic markets",
          "Keynesian demand management",
          "Monetarist focus on price stability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Export orientation leverages comparative advantage—producing what a country does relatively efficiently and trading for other goods. This typically increases growth through: 1) Access to larger markets (economies of scale), 2) Exposure to international competition (efficiency pressures), 3) Technology transfer via global value chains. East Asian 'tiger economies' demonstrated this shift's effectiveness versus Latin America's earlier import-substitution approaches."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's investment rate is 20% of GDP and its capital-output ratio is 4, what is its potential growth rate from capital accumulation alone (ignoring depreciation and population growth)?",
        "options": [
          "5%",
          "20%",
          "80%",
          "Cannot be determined without depreciation rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the Harrod-Domar framework: Growth rate = (Investment Rate) ÷ (Capital-Output Ratio) = 20% ÷ 4 = 5%. This simplified model shows how investment translates into growth, though it ignores diminishing returns, depreciation, and other factors. In reality, sustaining 5% growth would require maintaining the 20% investment rate and constant capital productivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'total factor productivity' (TFP) growth measure that labor productivity growth does not?",
        "options": [
          "Efficiency gains from better combining all inputs, not just labor",
          "The impact of demographic changes on output",
          "Only technological progress, excluding human capital",
          "Short-run cyclical variations in output"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Labor productivity = Output ÷ Labor. TFP (the 'Solow residual') measures output growth not explained by increases in measured inputs (labor and capital). It captures: technological innovation, organizational improvements, scale economies, resource reallocation to more productive uses, and measurement errors. TFP is considered the 'quality' of growth versus 'quantity' from more inputs."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During 'creative destruction,' what happens to an economy's production possibilities frontier?",
        "options": [
          "It shifts outward as innovation creates new possibilities",
          "It shifts inward as old industries contract",
          "It rotates, changing opportunity costs between sectors",
          "It remains unchanged—creative destruction affects distribution, not capacity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Schumpeter's creative destruction describes how innovation destroys old industries while creating new ones. Net effect: the PPF shifts outward because innovation expands productive possibilities overall. The destruction (obsolescence) represents movement along the new frontier away from declining sectors, not an inward shift. This dynamic process is central to capitalist growth but creates transitional costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might high inflation undermine long-term economic growth even if it stimulates short-run output?",
        "options": [
          "It creates uncertainty that discourages long-term investment",
          "It permanently increases the natural rate of unemployment",
          "It causes permanent damage to physical capital",
          "It leads to automatic cuts in government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High inflation creates uncertainty about future prices and returns, making long-term planning difficult. Businesses hesitate to invest in capital with long payback periods. Savers shift to inflation hedges rather than productive investment. This reduces capital accumulation and technology adoption. Additionally, inflation can trigger stop-go monetary policies that create volatility. Thus, price stability supports growth by providing a predictable environment."

          "Grow rapidly to middle income then stagnate, unable to advance to high income",
          "Remain permanently at low income levels due to geographic disadvantages",
          "Experience declining growth as they become high-income economies",
          "Alternate between rapid growth and severe recessions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The middle-income trap describes economies that successfully implement basic development (moving from low to middle income) but then stagnate. Why? Initial growth comes from factor accumulation (labor, capital) and technology imitation. To reach high income requires innovation, sophisticated institutions, and moving up value chains—harder transitions. Examples: Several Latin American and Middle Eastern countries versus successful graduates like South Korea and Taiwan."
