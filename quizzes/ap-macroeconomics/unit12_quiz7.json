        "question": "Suppose a country is producing $20 million of real GDP. If the economy grows at 10 percent per year, approximately how many years will it take for real GDP to grow to $80 million?",
        "options": [
          "30",
          "7",
          "14",
          "4",
          "3.5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using the Rule of 70: Doubling time at 10% growth = 70 ÷ 10 = 7 years. From $20M to $80M requires two doublings ($20M → $40M → $80M). Two doublings at 7 years each = 14 years. Alternatively: After 7 years: $20M × 2 = $40M. After 14 years: $40M × 2 = $80M."

        "question": "Refer to the figure below (image a16.png). The country of Kemper is on its aggregate production function at point W in the figure. If the population increases with no change in capital or technology, the economy will ______",
        "image": "images/a16.png",
        "options": [
          "move to point such as Y",
          "move to point such as X",
          "remain at point W",
          "move to point such as Z",
          "either remain at point W or move to point X"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An increase in population (labor) with no change in capital or technology causes movement along the existing aggregate production function to a point with more labor and higher output, such as point X. This represents using more of the variable input (labor) while fixed inputs (capital) and technology remain unchanged. Points Y and Z are on a higher production function, which would require technological progress or capital accumulation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the labour market, an increase in labour productivity ________ the real wage rate and _______ the level of employment.",
        "options": [
          "lowers, increases",
          "raises, increases",
          "lowers, decreases",
          "raises, does not change",
          "raises, decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased labor productivity raises the marginal product of labor, making each worker more valuable to firms. This increases the demand for labor, shifting the labor demand curve rightward. The result is both a higher equilibrium real wage rate (workers get paid more due to higher productivity) and a higher level of employment (more workers are hired at the new equilibrium)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the tables shown (image a17.png). The tables show the labour market and the aggregate production function schedule for the country of Pickett. What is the Potential GDP?",
        "image": "images/a17.png",
        "options": [
          "$9 trillion",
          "$25 trillion",
          "$6 trillion",
          "$14 trillion",
          "$40 trillion"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Potential GDP occurs at full employment equilibrium in the labor market. From the labor market table, equilibrium occurs at a real wage of $30 where labor demanded (40 billion hours) equals labor supplied (40 billion hours). Using the aggregate production function table, 40 billion hours of labor produces $14 trillion of real GDP. Therefore, Potential GDP = $14 trillion."

        "question": "Which of the following statements regarding human capital is INCORRECT?",
        "options": [
          "Education is the only vehicle for the creating of human capital because training simply reinforces what has already been learned.",
          "Human capital is the fundamental source of labour productivity growth.",
          "The accumulation of human capital is the source of both increased labour productivity and technological advance.",
          "Writing and mathematics, the most basic human skills, are crucial elements in economic progress.",
          "Human capital is the accumulated skill and knowledge of human beings."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Statement A is incorrect because human capital is created through multiple channels beyond formal education: on-the-job training, apprenticeships, work experience, and even learning-by-doing. Training often teaches new, complementary skills rather than just reinforcing old ones. The other statements correctly describe human capital's role in productivity, technological progress, and economic development."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'capital deepening'?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the interest rate to encourage borrowing",
          "The process of moving capital from one industry to another",
          "Replacing human labor with robots",
          "An increase in the amount of capital per worker"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Capital deepening refers specifically to increasing the amount of physical capital (machinery, equipment, infrastructure) available per worker. This is a key process for increasing labor productivity and economic growth. While it may involve investment in automation (option C), the core definition is about the capital-labor ratio, not the specific type of capital or financing method."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause an inward shift of a nation's production possibilities curve (PPC) and a simultaneous leftward shift of its long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve?",
        "options": [
          "The widespread depletion of non-renewable natural resources",
          "A decrease in the national savings rate",
          "An increase in the real interest rate",
          "A decrease in the price level"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Depletion of natural resources reduces the economy's productive capacity—fewer inputs available for production. This decreases potential output, shifting both the PPC inward (reduced maximum possible output combinations) and the LRAS curve leftward (lower potential GDP at full employment). The other options affect investment, demand, or prices but don't directly reduce the economy's productive capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, an increase in the national debt used to fund current consumption rather than investment will most likely:",
        "options": [
          "Lead to a permanent decrease in the price level.",
          "Shift the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve to the right.",
          "Increase the standard of living for future generations.",
          "Decrease the rate of physical capital accumulation."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Debt used for consumption (rather than investment) doesn't increase productive capacity. Future generations must pay interest through taxes, reducing funds available for private investment. This 'crowds out' capital formation, slowing capital accumulation and potentially reducing future productive capacity. It doesn't directly affect price levels long-term (money neutrality) or improve standards of living."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which policy combination is most likely to promote long-run economic growth while maintaining price stability?",
        "options": [
          "A budget surplus and an expansionary monetary policy.",
          "A budget deficit and a decrease in the money supply.",
          "Increased government regulation and a decrease in the money supply.",
          "Expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A budget surplus increases national saving, providing more loanable funds for private investment (capital deepening). Combined with appropriately expansionary monetary policy (supporting demand without inflation), this promotes growth while maintaining price stability. The other combinations either reduce investment (B, C) or risk inflation (D), potentially harming long-run growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy is at full employment and the government increases spending on human capital, how will this affect the LRAS and the price level in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "LRAS shifts right; price level increases.",
          "LRAS remains the same; price level increases.",
          "LRAS shifts left; price level increases.",
          "LRAS shifts right; price level decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Investment in human capital (education, training) increases labor productivity and the economy's productive capacity. This shifts LRAS rightward (higher potential GDP). With increased supply and assuming money supply growth is controlled, the price level typically decreases or grows more slowly due to greater output relative to money supply—deflationary pressure from the supply side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A nation's central bank pursues an 'easy money' policy to stabilize a recession. What is the likely effect on the economy's long-run growth path?",
        "options": [
          "It has no effect because money is neutral in the long run.",
          "It will decrease growth by causing high inflation.",
          "It will decrease growth by discouraging personal savings.",
          "It will increase growth by lowering the cost of borrowing for capital investment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the classical dichotomy and monetary neutrality, changes in the money supply affect nominal variables (prices, wages) but not real variables (output, employment) in the long run. Easy money can help short-run stabilization but doesn't alter the long-run growth path, which is determined by real factors: technology, resources, and institutions. Excessive money growth could cause inflation (B), but moderate policy primarily affects the transition, not the steady state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "High and unpredictable inflation can hinder long-run economic growth primarily because it:",
        "options": [
          "Increases the real value of debt for businesses.",
          "Creates uncertainty for long-term investment.",
          "Leads to a decrease in the velocity of money.",
          "Reduces the purchasing power of all consumers equally."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unpredictable inflation creates uncertainty about future prices and returns, making long-term planning difficult. Businesses hesitate to invest in capital with long payback periods. Savers shift to inflation hedges rather than productive investment. This reduces capital accumulation and technology adoption. While the other effects occur, the uncertainty channel is most damaging to long-run growth as it distorts investment decisions throughout the economy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best explains why high levels of public debt can impede long-run economic growth if short-run productivity gains are insufficient?",
        "options": [
          "The government is forced to increase the money supply, leading to hyperinflation that devalues the existing capital stock.",
          "Debt servicing requirements necessitate higher future taxes or reduced public investment, which 'crowds out' private capital formation and lowers the future capital-to-labor ratio.",
          "A high debt-to-GDP ratio automatically triggers a decrease in the labor force participation rate as workers anticipate future economic stagnation.",
          "The interest payments on debt are classified as transfer payments, which have a lower multiplier effect than government purchases of goods and services."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If debt-funded spending doesn't generate enough productivity growth to cover interest costs, future governments must raise taxes or cut productive public investment (infrastructure, education) to service the debt. Higher taxes reduce private investment returns; reduced public investment lowers complementary infrastructure. Both 'crowd out' capital formation, slowing capital deepening and long-term growth. This is the core debt-overhang problem for growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy's government consistently runs a budget deficit to fund subsidies for sunset industries (declining industries with low growth potential) rather than investing in physical infrastructure or human capital. Which of the following correctly describes the long-run impact on the economy's growth path?",
        "options": [
          "The economy will experience a rightward shift of the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve due to the short-run increase in government spending.",
          "The economy will remain at its potential output, but the price level will decrease due to the efficiency of the subsidies.",
          "Misallocation leads to a lower rate of technological progress and capital deepening, causing the LRAS to shift right at a slower rate than its trading partners.",
          "The Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) will shift outward because any form of government spending increases the total resources available to the economy."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Subsidizing declining industries represents a misallocation of resources—funds go to low-productivity sectors instead of growth-enhancing investments (infrastructure, education, R&D). This reduces the economy's rate of technological progress and capital accumulation. While the LRAS may still shift right over time due to other factors, it will do so more slowly than if resources were allocated efficiently, causing relative economic decline versus better-managed economies."
