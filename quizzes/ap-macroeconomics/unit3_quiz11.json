    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a decrease in the price level lead to an increase in aggregate demand?",
        "options": [
          "Exports become more expensive",
          "Nominal wealth decreases",
          "Real wealth increases",
          "Interest rates rise"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A lower price level increases the real value (purchasing power) of money and other nominal assets. This rise in real wealth boosts consumption spending—the wealth effect—which increases aggregate demand. Additionally, lower price levels reduce interest rates (interest‑rate effect) and make exports cheaper (international‑trade effect), further raising AD."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In the figure above, as the price level increases the aggregate demand curve will",
  "image": "images/a7.png",
  "options": [
    "shift from AD₁ to AD₃.",
    "shift from AD₁ to AD₂.",
    "not shift but the aggregate demand curve will change its slope will change so that it is positively sloped.",
    "not shift.",
    "shift from AD₁ to AD₃ and then back to AD₁."
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "A change in the price level causes a movement along a fixed aggregate demand curve, not a shift of the curve itself. In the figure, an increase in the price level would move the economy upward and leftward along the same AD curve (e.g., AD₁), reducing the quantity of real GDP demanded. Shifts of the AD curve occur only when factors other than the price level—such as consumption, investment, government spending, net exports, or the money supply—change."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In the figure above, the shift in the aggregate demand curve from AD₁ to AD₂ could be result of",
  "image": "images/a7.png",
  "options": [
    "a fall in the price level.",
    "a decrease in the quantity of money.",
    "an increase in government expenditures on goods and services.",
    "an increase in taxes.",
    "a rise in the price level."
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The shift from AD₁ to AD₂ represents an increase in aggregate demand. This rightward shift could be caused by an increase in government expenditures (G), which directly raises total spending. A decrease in the money supply or an increase in taxes would shift AD leftward. Changes in the price level cause movements along the curve, not shifts."

      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In the figure above, the shift in the aggregate demand curve from AD₁ to AD₃ could be the result of",
  "image": "images/a7.png",
  "options": [
    "a decrease in the real interest rate.",
    "a decrease in the buying power of money.",
    "an increased expectation of a recession that lowers the expected rate of profit from investment.",
    "a decrease in the foreign exchange rate.",
    "an increase in the price level."
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "A shift from AD₁ to AD₃ represents a decrease in aggregate demand. Increased pessimism about the economy (e.g., an expected recession) reduces business confidence and lowers the expected profit from investment, decreasing investment spending and shifting AD leftward. A decrease in the real interest rate or a weaker foreign currency (lower exchange rate) would increase AD. A decrease in the buying power of money (due to inflation) affects real balances but is typically a movement along AD. A price level change does not shift the AD curve."

      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The aggregate demand multiplier effect says that an initial increase in expenditure plans leads to an induced",
  "options": [
    "increase in consumption expenditure.",
    "increase in production expenditure.",
    "increase in government expenditures on goods and services.",
    "decrease in the price level.",
    "increase in exports."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The multiplier effect occurs because an initial increase in spending (e.g., investment or government purchases) raises incomes, which in turn leads to higher consumption spending. This induced increase in consumption further raises aggregate demand, creating a multiplied impact on real GDP. The multiplier focuses on the chain reaction of rising consumption, not direct changes in production expenditure, government spending, price levels, or exports."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect does a decrease in aggregate demand have on inflation in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "It has no effect on inflation",
          "It reduces inflation",
          "It causes hyperinflation",
          "It increases inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve reduces both output and the price level in the short run, leading to lower inflation (or deflationary pressure). This occurs because firms lower prices to sell goods when demand falls, assuming wages and other costs are sticky downward in the very short term."
