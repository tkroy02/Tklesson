    "duration": 10,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a decrease in the price level lead to an increase in aggregate demand?",
        "options": [
          "Exports become more expensive",
          "Nominal wealth decreases",
          "Real wealth increases",
          "Interest rates rise"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A lower price level increases the real value (purchasing power) of money and other nominal assets. This rise in real wealth boosts consumption spending—the wealth effect—which increases aggregate demand. Additionally, lower price levels reduce interest rates (interest‑rate effect) and make exports cheaper (international‑trade effect), further raising AD."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect does a decrease in aggregate demand have on inflation in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "It has no effect on inflation",
          "It reduces inflation",
          "It causes hyperinflation",
          "It increases inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve reduces both output and the price level in the short run, leading to lower inflation (or deflationary pressure). This occurs because firms lower prices to sell goods when demand falls, assuming wages and other costs are sticky downward in the very short term."
