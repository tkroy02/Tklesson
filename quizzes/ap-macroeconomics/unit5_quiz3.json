      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following economists argued that fiscal policies may be necessary to bring about full employment?",
        "options": [
          "Adam Smith",
          "David Ricardo",
          "J M Keynes",
          "Karl Marx",
          "Alfred Marshall"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "John Maynard Keynes advocated for active government intervention, including fiscal policy (government spending and taxation), to manage aggregate demand and achieve full employment, especially during economic downturns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a fiscal policy measure?",
        "options": [
          "Government purchases",
          "Transfer payments",
          "Reserve ratios",
          "Taxes",
          "Crowding out"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Reserve ratios are a tool of monetary policy, controlled by the central bank. Fiscal policy involves government spending (purchases and transfers) and taxation. 'Crowding out' is an effect, not a policy tool."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fiscal policy is generally considered",
        "options": [
          "The demand-side economic policy",
          "The supply-side economic policy",
          "The microeconomic policy",
          "The central government policy",
          "The state government policy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fiscal policy is traditionally viewed as a demand‑side tool used to influence aggregate demand through changes in government spending and taxation. Supply‑side fiscal policies exist but are a subset focusing on long‑run capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following policies is related to the crowding out effect in the economy?",
        "options": [
          "Fiscal policy",
          "Monetary policy",
          "Public policy",
          "Statutory policy",
          "State policy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crowding out is a potential side effect of expansionary fiscal policy, where government borrowing to finance deficits raises interest rates, reducing private investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is associated with 'stimulating' the economy?",
        "options": [
          "Fiscal policy and Monetary policy",
          "Balance of payment surplus",
          "Expansionary fiscal policy",
          "Contractionary fiscal policy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy (increasing spending, cutting taxes) is specifically designed to stimulate the economy by boosting aggregate demand. While monetary policy can also be stimulative, the question asks for the policy type most directly associated with stimulation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the immediate impact on unemployment when expansionary fiscal policy is enacted?",
        "options": [
          "Unemployment increases",
          "Unemployment remains stable",
          "Unemployment becomes unpredictable",
          "Unemployment decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy aims to increase aggregate demand, output, and employment. In the short run, it reduces cyclical unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the government implements contractionary fiscal policy by reducing its spending, what is the effect on the aggregate demand curve?",
        "options": [
          "Contractionary fiscal policy has no effect on the AD curve since private consumption remains unchanged.",
          "A decrease in government spending leads to a vertical upward movement along the AD curve.",
          "A decrease in government spending increases consumer confidence and shifts the AD curve to the right.",
          "A decrease in government spending causes a leftward shift of the AD curve, reducing aggregate demand and lowering real GDP."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A reduction in government spending directly decreases aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve leftward, which typically lowers real GDP and the price level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of contractionary fiscal policy?",
        "options": [
          "The AD curve shifts to the right",
          "The government increases spending",
          "The government decreases taxes",
          "The government increases net taxes to reduce AD"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy involves actions that reduce aggregate demand, such as increasing taxes or cutting government spending. Increasing net taxes (taxes minus transfers) reduces disposable income and consumption, lowering AD."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is choosing to increase incentives to work, save, invest, and take risks. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "options": [
          "Demand-side fiscal policy",
          "Expanding monetary policy",
          "Increasing AD",
          "Supply-side fiscal policy"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Policies aimed at improving incentives to work, save, and invest are characteristic of supply‑side fiscal policy, which seeks to increase the economy's productive capacity (shift LRAS right)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following measures is typically associated with supply-side fiscal policy aimed at promoting long-run economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Implementing tariffs on imported goods to protect domestic industries.",
          "Expanding transfer payments to lower-income households to boost consumption.",
          "Increasing government spending on healthcare services.",
          "Reducing marginal tax rates to incentivize work, saving, and investment."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Supply‑side policies focus on improving incentives and productivity. Lower marginal tax rates encourage labor supply, saving, and investment, increasing potential output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given that the spending multiplier is calculated as 1/(1 - MPC), what happens to the spending multiplier if the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) approaches 1?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes very small, reducing the impact of fiscal policy.",
          "It remains unchanged regardless of the value of MPC.",
          "It becomes zero, eliminating any multiplier effect.",
          "It becomes very large, greatly magnifying the impact of fiscal policy."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "As MPC → 1, the denominator (1 – MPC) → 0, making the multiplier approach infinity. In practice, a very high MPC leads to a very large multiplier, amplifying the effect of fiscal policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A government facing a large public debt implements a fiscal policy that increases taxes on high-income earners while simultaneously increasing infrastructure spending by the same amount. The MOST likely impact on the economy would be:",
        "options": [
          "Decreased aggregate demand and higher unemployment",
          "Increased aggregate demand due to different multipliers",
          "Neutral effect on aggregate demand and output",
          "No change in aggregate demand but reduced debt"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The balanced‑budget multiplier is positive because the spending multiplier (1/(1–MPC)) is larger than the tax multiplier (–MPC/(1–MPC)). Even with equal dollar amounts, AD increases, as the initial spending injects more demand than the tax increase withdraws, assuming the MPC of taxpayers is less than 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of unemployment is least likely to be affected by government fiscal policy?",
        "options": [
          "Seasonal unemployment",
          "Cyclical unemployment",
          "Structural unemployment",
          "Frictional unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Frictional unemployment is short‑term unemployment due to normal job turnover and search time. It is largely unaffected by demand‑side fiscal policy, which primarily targets cyclical unemployment. Structural unemployment requires long‑term supply‑side or retraining policies."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What is the primary goal of expansionary fiscal policy during a deep recessionary gap?",
  "options": [
    "Reduce inflation",
    "Decrease government spending",
    "Increase interest rates",
    "Quickly move to full employment"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy (increased government spending, tax cuts) is used during a recessionary gap to boost aggregate demand, stimulate production, and reduce unemployment—thus moving the economy toward full employment. Reducing inflation, decreasing spending, or raising interest rates are goals of contractionary policy, not expansionary."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the term ‘fiscal policy lag’?",
        "options": [
          "Immediate economic recovery",
          "Rapid legislative approval",
          "Delays in policy effects",
          "Instantaneous policy impact"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fiscal policy lag refers to the delays between recognizing an economic problem, enacting a policy, and that policy having its full effect on the economy. These lags can reduce the effectiveness of discretionary fiscal policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in government purchases using the fiscal policy measure will lead to:",
        "options": [
          "decreasing aggregate demand",
          "no change in aggregate demand",
          "increasing aggregate demand",
          "decreasing inflation",
          "decreasing interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Government purchases (G) are a direct component of aggregate demand (AD). An increase in G shifts the AD curve to the right, increasing aggregate demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Contractionary fiscal policy causes the aggregate demand curve to:",
        "options": [
          "Shift towards the right side",
          "Remain neutral",
          "Shift towards the left side",
          "Move along the curve",
          "Insufficient information"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy (higher taxes, lower government spending) reduces aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve leftward."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Typically, fiscal policy outcomes __________",
  "options": [
    "have no time lags",
    "have time lags",
    "do not affect the economy",
    "are neutral",
    "are crucial for the supply side of the economy"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Fiscal policy is subject to significant time lags, including recognition lag, implementation lag, and impact lag. These delays can reduce its effectiveness in stabilizing the economy in the short run."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "When an economy is overheated, the best possible fiscal policy should be to:",
  "options": [
    "increase government spending and decrease taxes",
    "increase government spending and increase taxes",
    "reduce government spending and increase taxes",
    "reduce government spending and reduce taxes",
    "increase transfer payments and resort to crowding out loanable funds"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "An overheated economy is experiencing an inflationary gap (real GDP > potential GDP). Contractionary fiscal policy—reducing government spending and/or increasing taxes—lowers aggregate demand, helping to cool the economy and reduce inflationary pressures."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The expansionary fiscal policy causes the aggregate demand curve to:",
