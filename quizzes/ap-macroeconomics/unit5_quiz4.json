    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During an inflationary gap, which combination of fiscal policy actions would be most appropriate to restore full employment without exacerbating the national debt?",
        "options": [
          "Maintain tax rates and increase government spending",
          "Decrease tax rates and increase government spending",
          "Increase tax rates and reduce transfer payments",
          "Decrease tax rates and decrease transfer payments"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "To close an inflationary gap, contractionary fiscal policy is needed. Increasing tax rates and reducing transfer payments reduce disposable income and aggregate demand, cooling the economy. This approach can also improve the budget balance, limiting debt growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which combination of fiscal policy tools would be MOST effective at reducing an inflationary gap without significantly increasing the government’s budget deficit?",
        "options": [
          "Increase government infrastructure spending while decreasing sales taxes",
          "Increase income taxes while reducing transfer payments",
          "Decrease corporate taxes while increasing defense spending",
          "Maintain current tax rates while increasing unemployment benefits"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increasing income taxes reduces disposable income; reducing transfer payments further decreases spending. Both actions lower aggregate demand to close the inflationary gap while improving the budget balance (or reducing the deficit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which fiscal policy approach would be most effective in an economy experiencing both high unemployment and significant public debt concerns?",
        "options": [
          "Balanced budget with no net change in fiscal stance",
          "Across-the-board tax increases to reduce debt",
          "Immediate spending cuts to restore investor confidence",
          "Targeted spending increases with high multiplier effects"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Targeted spending on high‑multiplier projects (e.g., infrastructure, education) can stimulate demand and reduce unemployment with a smaller impact on debt due to stronger growth feedback. This balances short‑term stimulus with longer‑term debt sustainability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement most accurately explains why automatic stabilizers are generally more effective at moderating business cycles than discretionary fiscal policy?",
        "options": [
          "They permanently solve structural economic problems",
          "They target specific industries more effectively",
          "They activate immediately without implementation lags",
          "They typically have larger multiplier effects"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers (e.g., progressive taxes, unemployment benefits) respond automatically to economic conditions without legislative delays, avoiding the recognition, implementation, and decision lags that hamper discretionary policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy operating above full employment faces an inflationary gap. Which fiscal policy action is most appropriate to reduce inflationary pressures?",
        "options": [
          "Reduce regulations to increase short-run aggregate supply.",
          "Implement expansionary monetary policy through lowering interest rates.",
          "Decrease government spending or increase net taxes to shift aggregate demand left.",
          "Increase government spending to further stimulate growth."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An inflationary gap requires contractionary fiscal policy: reducing government spending or increasing net taxes lowers aggregate demand, helping to reduce inflationary pressures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of lag refers to the delay in recognizing an economic problem that requires fiscal intervention?",

          "Reduce inflation rates",
          "Lower interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy (increased spending, tax cuts) aims to boost aggregate demand to raise output and employment during a recessionary gap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following supply-side fiscal policies would MOST directly affect the short-run aggregate supply curve through labor market incentives?",

          "Increasing government infrastructure spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lower marginal income tax rates increase the incentive to work, potentially boosting labor supply and productivity, which can shift short‑run aggregate supply (SRAS) rightward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What will likely occur if the government adopts contractionary fiscal policy (through decreased spending or increased taxes) in a given year?",
        "options": [
          "Aggregate demand will increase as consumers save more, leading to economic growth and an appreciated currency.",
          "The contractionary fiscal policy will have no impact on the exchange rate since it only affects domestic government revenue.",
          "There will be a substantial increase in capital inflows as investors view fiscal contraction positively, which will immediately boost the official reserves.",
          "Aggregate demand will decline, leading to lower GDP and price levels, which can cause the currency to depreciate and make exports more competitive."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy reduces AD, lowering output and prices. This can lead to lower interest rates (if monetary policy doesn't offset) and reduced demand for the currency, causing depreciation and improving export competitiveness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following fiscal scenarios would most directly contribute to an increase in the national debt?",

          "Reducing government expenditures during economic expansion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tax cuts without corresponding spending reductions widen the budget deficit, requiring increased borrowing, which adds to the national debt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In order to reduce inflationary pressure on the economy, what fiscal policy can the government use?",

          "A balanced budget."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A budget deficit occurs when expenditures exceed revenues in a fiscal year. The national debt is the accumulation of past deficits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the 'Debt-to-GDP Ratio' if a country's national debt grows at 3% while its GDP grows at 5%?",
