    "duration": 35,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might a country's currency appreciate if there is a significant tourism boom?",
        "options": [
          "Increased demand for foreign currencies by domestic businesses",
          "Decreased foreign investments",
          "Decreased domestic spending",
          "Higher demand for the domestic currency"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Tourism is an export of services. Foreign tourists need the domestic currency to spend on hotels, restaurants, attractions, and goods. This increases demand for the domestic currency in foreign exchange markets as tourists exchange their currency for local currency. Significant tourism inflows can appreciably increase currency demand, causing appreciation, especially in tourism-dependent economies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's exports are primarily luxury goods, how might currency appreciation affect its economy?",
        "options": [
          "Export volume decreases",
          "Export volume increases sharply",
          "No change in export volume",
          "Export becomes non-existent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods typically have price-elastic demand—consumers are sensitive to price changes. Currency appreciation makes exports more expensive in foreign currency terms. For luxury goods, this can significantly reduce quantity demanded as wealthy consumers may delay purchases, buy alternatives, or reduce quantities. The export revenue loss may be substantial despite potentially smaller volume declines due to high margins."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a strong domestic economy influence its currency on a global scale?",
        "options": [
          "Strengthens the currency",
          "Makes the currency disappear",
          "Weakens the currency",
          "Has no effect"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A strong domestic economy attracts foreign investment (seeking growth opportunities) and may have higher interest rates (if the central bank tightens to prevent overheating). Both factors increase demand for the domestic currency. Additionally, strong economic performance signals stability and future returns, making the currency more attractive as a store of value and investment medium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can high inflation contribute to currency depreciation?",
        "options": [
          "By increasing currency demand",
          "By reducing purchasing power",
          "By stabilizing the currency",
          "By improving economic security"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "High inflation erodes domestic purchasing power, making domestic goods more expensive relative to foreign goods. According to purchasing power parity, the currency should depreciate to equalize price levels. Additionally, high inflation may prompt capital flight as investors seek to preserve real returns, increasing domestic currency supply in forex markets. Central banks may also lower real interest rates to combat inflation, reducing currency attractiveness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a likely outcome for net exports when a country strengthens its currency?",
        "options": [
          "Net exports decrease",
          "Net exports increase",
          "Export figures stabilize",
          "No effect on net exports"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation makes exports more expensive for foreign buyers (reducing export volumes) and imports cheaper for domestic consumers (increasing import volumes). Both effects reduce net exports (NX = X - M). The degree depends on price elasticities: if demand for exports and imports is elastic, net exports decline significantly; if inelastic, the decline may be smaller but still negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might currency depreciation benefit agricultural exports?",
        "options": [
          "Makes exports more expensive",
          "Makes exports cheaper and competitive",
          "Reduces demand for exports",
          "Increases import competition"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Agricultural products often compete in global markets with standardized prices. Depreciation makes domestic agricultural exports cheaper when priced in foreign currency, improving price competitiveness. Since agricultural demand is often price-elastic (buyers switch sources based on price), depreciation can significantly increase export volumes and market share, though revenue in domestic currency terms may not increase proportionally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following could be an indirect consequence of currency appreciation?",
        "options": [
          "Rising export volume and increased foreign demand",
          "Increased aggregate demand",
          "Surge in employment across manufacturing sectors",
          "Reduced competitiveness"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation directly reduces price competitiveness of exports and import-competing goods. This can lead to factory closures, job losses in trade-exposed sectors, and reduced investment in export industries. While consumers benefit from cheaper imports, the net effect on aggregate demand may be negative if export contraction outweighs import benefits, especially in export-oriented economies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might imports become more attractive during a period of currency appreciation?",
        "options": [
          "Imports quality decreases",
          "Imports are more expensive",
          "Domestic products become more affordable",
          "Imports are cheaper due to stronger currency"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation means each unit of domestic currency buys more foreign currency, making imported goods cheaper when converted to domestic prices. This price effect increases attractiveness of imports relative to domestically produced goods. Consumers substitute toward imports, businesses source cheaper foreign inputs, and overall import volumes tend to rise, contributing to wider trade deficits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might be a company's strategy in a rapidly depreciating currency environment?",
        "options": [
          "Reduce export volume",
          "Increase export volume",
          "Halt production",
          "Increase imports"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rapid depreciation improves export competitiveness. Exporters can either maintain foreign currency prices (earning higher domestic currency revenue per unit) or lower foreign currency prices (gaining market share). Most would increase export volume to capitalize on improved competitiveness, though they may face higher costs for imported inputs. Some might also shift marketing focus to foreign markets."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a currency depreciates due to a trade war, what is a potential initial effect?",
        "options": [
          "Rising domestic employment in export sectors",
          "Reduced competitiveness of exports",
          "Decline in domestic currency value",
          "Immediate stop to exports"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Trade wars typically involve tariffs and uncertainty, which reduce trade volumes and economic growth expectations. This can cause capital flight from affected countries as investors seek safer markets. The resulting capital outflows increase domestic currency supply in forex markets, causing depreciation. Depreciation is often an initial effect before longer-term adjustments in trade patterns and employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does currency depreciation affect the balance of trade?",
        "options": [
          "Improves trade balance as exports rise",
          "Leads to adverse trade balance",
          "Stops all trade activity",
          "No effects on trade balance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Currency depreciation typically improves the trade balance through the J-curve effect: initially, the trade balance may worsen as import bills rise (import volumes adjust slowly), but eventually exports become cheaper and imports more expensive, increasing net exports. Assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds (sum of export and import price elasticities > 1), depreciation improves the trade balance in the medium to long term."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario best describes the impact of appreciation on domestic manufacturers?",
        "options": [
          "Profit surge from more affordable imports",
          "Gain in business partnerships",
          "Increase in local material costs",
          "Income loss due to reduced export demand"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Manufacturers, especially export-oriented ones, face reduced foreign demand as their products become more expensive abroad. They may also face increased import competition domestically as foreign goods become cheaper. Both effects squeeze profits and may force downsizing or closures. While manufacturers using imported inputs benefit from lower costs, the net effect is typically negative for manufacturing employment and output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If inflation remains high in a country, how might it impact its currency's exchange rate?",
        "options": [
          "Has no impact",
          "Leads to appreciation",
          "Leads to depreciation",
          "Strengthens gradually"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Persistently high inflation erodes purchasing power and reduces real returns on domestic assets. According to purchasing power parity, the currency should depreciate to equalize price levels. Central banks may raise nominal interest rates to combat inflation, but if real interest rates (nominal minus inflation) remain low or negative, capital may flow out, further depreciating the currency. High inflation is strongly associated with currency weakness."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Currency appreciation impacts aggregate demand by...",
        "options": [
          "Minimizing domestic spending patterns",
          "Leaving it unchanged",
          "Increasing it through enhanced export competitiveness",
          "Reducing it via weaker exports"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Aggregate demand (AD) = C + I + G + NX. Appreciation reduces net exports (NX) as exports fall and imports rise. This direct reduction in AD can be partially offset if: cheaper imports increase real incomes (boosting consumption), lower inflation allows looser monetary policy, or cheaper capital imports boost investment. However, the net effect on AD is typically contractionary, especially for export-oriented economies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the net effect of decreased exports on aggregate demand?",
        "options": [
          "No effect on aggregate demand",
          "Stabilizes demand",
          "Increase in aggregate demand",
          "Decrease in aggregate demand"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Exports are a direct component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + X - M). Decreased exports directly reduce AD, all else equal. This reduction can have multiplier effects: lower export production reduces incomes, which reduces consumption, further decreasing AD. The magnitude depends on the export sector's size and the marginal propensity to consume."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a depreciating currency in one country affect its trade relationships?",
        "options": [
          "Diminishes export competitiveness",
          "Enhances import attractiveness",
          "Stabilizes global participation",
          "Makes exporting larger volumes feasible"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Depreciation improves export competitiveness by making domestic goods cheaper in foreign markets. This allows exporters to increase volumes, potentially gaining market share at competitors' expense. However, trading partners may view this as 'currency manipulation' or unfair competition, potentially leading to trade tensions, accusations of beggar-thy-neighbor policies, or retaliatory measures."

          "Decreases production costs",
          "Raises employee wages"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strong currency reduces export competitiveness, leading to lower export production. It also increases import competition domestically, potentially reducing output in import-competing industries. Both effects reduce labor demand in trade-exposed sectors, potentially causing layoffs and higher unemployment. The severity depends on the economy's trade openness and labor market flexibility."

          "Enhances production volume",
          "Reduces output to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Depreciation typically boosts output in trade-exposed industries. Export-oriented sectors increase production to meet higher foreign demand (goods are cheaper abroad). Import-competing sectors increase production as domestic goods become relatively cheaper than imports. However, industries reliant on imported inputs may face higher costs, potentially reducing output. The net effect is generally increased industrial output, especially in manufacturing."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Trade wars create uncertainty, reduce global trade volumes, and slow economic growth. Investors typically move capital away from countries involved in trade conflicts to safer havens. This capital outflow increases supply of affected currencies in forex markets, causing depreciation. Additionally, central banks in affected countries may ease monetary policy to offset growth slowdowns, further weakening their currencies."

Imported goods priced in foreign currency become more expensive when converted to domestic prices. This price increase reduces quantity demanded for imports, assuming demand is somewhat price-elastic. Consumers and businesses substitute toward domestically produced alternatives, reducing import volumes."
