    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is 0.8, and the government increases spending by $100 billion while simultaneously increasing taxes by $100 billion, what is the net effect on Aggregate Demand (AD)?",
        "options": [
          "AD increases by $500 billion.",
          "AD remains unchanged.",
          "AD increases by $100 billion.",
          "AD decreases by $400 billion."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This illustrates the balanced‑budget multiplier: when government spending and taxes increase by the same amount, AD increases by that amount. Here, ΔAD = ΔG = $100 billion, because the spending multiplier (5) is partially offset by the tax multiplier (–4), netting to a multiplier of 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Crowding Out' effect resulting from expansionary fiscal policy?",
        "options": [
          "The government takes over private industries, removing them from the competitive market.",
          "High taxes discourage individuals from working, reducing the labor supply.",
          "Increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, reducing private investment.",
          "Government spending increases the price level, reducing the real value of money."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Crowding out occurs when government borrowing to finance deficits raises interest rates, which discourages private investment spending, partially offsetting the initial stimulus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy is in a recessionary gap of $400 billion. If the MPC is 0.75, what is the minimum change in taxes required to close this gap?",
        "options": [
          "A tax increase of $133.3 billion.",
          "A tax decrease of $400 billion.",
          "A tax decrease of $100 billion.",
          "A tax decrease of $133.3 billion."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Tax multiplier = –MPC/(1 – MPC) = –0.75/0.25 = –3. To increase AD by $400 billion, ΔT = –($400 billion / 3) = –$133.3 billion (a tax cut)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the tax multiplier always smaller than the government spending multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "Taxes are only paid by a small portion of the population.",
          "Government spending is more efficient than private spending.",
          "A portion of a tax cut is saved rather than spent.",
          "Tax changes take longer for the Congress to pass."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The tax multiplier is smaller because some of the tax cut is saved (based on the MPC). The spending multiplier is 1/(1–MPC), while the tax multiplier is –MPC/(1–MPC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Laffer Curve, if a country is on the downward‑sloping portion of the curve, a decrease in tax rates will:",
        "options": [
          "Cause the budget deficit to skyrocket immediately.",
          "Decrease total tax revenue.",
          "Increase total tax revenue.",
          "Have no effect on tax revenue."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "On the downward‑sloping portion, tax rates are so high that lowering them stimulates enough economic activity to increase total tax revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an automatic stabilizer in fiscal policy?",
        "options": [
          "Open market operations by the Central Bank.",
          "A new law passed to increase infrastructure spending.",
          "Decreasing the discount rate.",
          "Progressive income taxes."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Progressive income taxes automatically reduce tax revenues more during a recession (as incomes fall) and increase them during a boom, helping to stabilize the economy without new legislation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government operates with a budget deficit, what is the most likely effect on the long‑run economic growth rate, assuming crowding out occurs?",
        "options": [
          "The growth rate will increase because of the wealth effect.",
          "The growth rate will increase because of higher current consumption.",
          "The growth rate will decrease due to lower levels of capital accumulation.",
          "The growth rate will remain constant as the deficit only affects the short run."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Crowding out reduces private investment, which lowers capital formation and productivity, reducing long‑run economic growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What occurs when the government implements a 'Contractionary Fiscal Policy' during an inflationary gap?",
        "options": [
          "The SRAS curve shifts to the right to match the AD curve.",
          "The budget moves toward a surplus and AD shifts to the left.",
          "The budget moves toward a deficit and AD shifts to the right.",
          "Interest rates fall, leading to an increase in net exports."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy (higher taxes, lower spending) reduces AD, shifting the curve leftward, and typically moves the budget toward a surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a 'Net Export Effect' potentially weaken expansionary fiscal policy?",
        "options": [
          "A budget surplus leads to lower interest rates and a depreciated currency.",
          "Higher taxes reduce the disposable income available to purchase imported goods.",
          "Increased borrowing raises interest rates, attracting foreign capital and appreciating the currency, which reduces net exports.",
          "Government spending on infrastructure encourages domestic firms to export more."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher interest rates from government borrowing attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the domestic currency and causing appreciation. This makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, reducing net exports and partially offsetting the expansionary fiscal policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Recognition Lag' in fiscal policy refers to the time it takes to:",
        "options": [
          "Identify which specific taxes should be cut.",
          "Realize that a recession or inflation is actually occurring.",
          "Pass legislation through the house and the senate.",
          "Allow the multiplier effect to fully work through the economy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Recognition lag is the delay between the start of an economic problem (e.g., recession) and policymakers recognizing that the problem exists."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Loanable Funds Market, an increase in the government's budget deficit will shift the:",
        "options": [
          "Supply of loanable funds to the left, but interest rates will decrease.",
          "Demand for loanable funds to the left.",
          "Demand for loanable funds to the right.",
          "Supply of loanable funds to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Government borrowing increases the demand for loanable funds, shifting the demand curve to the right, which raises equilibrium interest rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) is 0.1, what is the impact on GDP if government spending decreases by $20 billion?",
        "options": [
          "GDP decreases by $200 billion.",
          "GDP increases by $200 billion.",
          "GDP decreases by $180 billion.",
          "GDP decreases by $20 billion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MPS = 0.1 ⇒ MPC = 0.9. Multiplier = 1/(1 – 0.9) = 10. A $20 billion decrease in G reduces GDP by $20 billion × 10 = $200 billion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which fiscal policy action would be most effective in combating 'Stagflation' (high inflation and high unemployment)?",
        "options": [
          "Increasing taxes to reduce inflation.",
          "Increasing government spending to reduce unemployment.",
          "Supply‑side tax cuts to shift the SRAS curve to the right.",
          "Decreasing the money supply to stabilize prices."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stagflation is caused by a leftward shift of SRAS. Supply‑side policies (e.g., tax cuts on investment, deregulation) can shift SRAS rightward, reducing both inflation and unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Balanced Budget' requirement during a recession would likely:",
        "options": [
          "Make the recession worse by forcing the government to cut spending or raise taxes.",
          "Have no effect on the business cycle.",
          "Help the economy recover by reducing the national debt.",
          "Act as an automatic stabilizer to prevent deep downturns."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Forcing a balanced budget during a recession requires spending cuts or tax increases, which are contractionary and would deepen the downturn."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between the 'National Debt' and a 'Budget Deficit'?",
        "options": [
          "The deficit is a yearly shortfall, while the debt is the accumulation of all past deficits.",
          "The debt is what we owe to foreigners, while the deficit is what we owe to citizens.",
          "The debt includes only interest payments, while the deficit includes the principal.",
          "The deficit is controlled by the Central Bank, while the debt is controlled by Congress."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A budget deficit occurs when annual government spending exceeds revenues in a given year. The national debt is the total accumulated stock of outstanding government borrowing from all past deficits minus surpluses."

          "$50 billion.",
          "$45 billion.",
          "$5 billion.",
          "$5.55 billion."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Multiplier = 1/(1 – 0.9) = 10. To increase AD by $50 billion, ΔG = $50 billion / 10 = $5 billion. Note: $5.55 billion appears due to rounding; exact is $5 billion."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'Liquidity Trap,' why might expansionary fiscal policy be more effective than expansionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "The Central Bank is legally prohibited from buying government bonds during a trap.",
          "Interest rates are already near zero, so further increases in the money supply do not stimulate investment.",
          "Fiscal policy acts much faster than monetary policy in the short run.",
          "Consumers are more likely to save tax cuts during a liquidity trap."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a liquidity trap, interest rates are near zero, and monetary policy becomes ineffective because adding more money does not lower rates further. Fiscal policy directly increases AD and can be more effective."
      },

          "The SRAS curve shifts to the left as labor costs rise.",
          "Government spending (G) increases directly in the GDP calculation.",
          "Interest rates fall as people have more money to save.",
          "Disposable income increases, which then increases consumption spending."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Transfer payments increase disposable income, which raises consumption (C) and thus aggregate demand. Transfer payments are not counted directly as G in GDP; they affect C through disposable income."

        "options": [
          "Consumers use their tax cuts to buy more imported goods.",
          "It leads to higher domestic interest rates that attract foreign investors.",
          "It leads to high inflation, which reduces the global demand for domestic exports.",
