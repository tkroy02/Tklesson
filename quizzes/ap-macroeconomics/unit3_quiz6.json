    "topic": "SRAS Shifts, Sticky Wages, Technology, Resource Prices, Expectations, Productivity",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might an increase in aggregate demand not immediately translate to higher GDP production?",
        "options": [
          "Higher demand reduces supply",
          "Demand and GDP are unrelated",
          "Supply constraints prevent immediate response",
          "Demand doesn't influence production"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the short run, firms may face capacity limits or resource shortages, so increased demand may raise prices rather than output immediately."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an inverse relationship between price level and real GDP reflect in consumer demand dynamics?",
        "options": [
          "Price level has no meaningful impact on consumer purchasing decisions",
          "Lower prices increase consumer purchasing power",
          "Consumer demand remains constant regardless of price changes",
          "Higher prices boost consumer desire and spending capacity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower price levels increase the real value of income and wealth (wealth effect), raising consumption — part of why AD slopes downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect would a significant technological innovation have on both aggregate supply and aggregate demand?",
        "options": [
          "Increase only aggregate supply",
          "Increase supply, then demand",
          "Increase only aggregate demand",
          "Have no measurable impact on either curve in the short run"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Technology boosts productivity (shifts SRAS right). Higher incomes and business optimism may also increase consumption and investment (AD shifts right) over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does an increase in resource prices generally lead to a leftward shift in the SRAS curve?",
        "options": [
          "It reduces the demand for goods and services",
          "It has no effect on production as prices are flexible",
          "It increases the costs of production, lowering output",
          "It decreases production expenses for firms"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher input prices (e.g., oil, raw materials) raise per‑unit production costs, reducing the quantity firms are willing to supply at each price level — SRAS shifts left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can the concept of 'sticky wages' explain the temporary rise in employment as price levels increase?",
        "options": [
          "Wages adjust rapidly, matching price changes, stabilizing employment",
          "Firms prefer laying off workers to cutting wages when prices drop",
          "Wages adjust too slowly, allowing firms to employ more at current wage rates",
          "Employers reduce wages in line with price increases, boosting hiring"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If wages are sticky (slow to adjust), a higher price level lowers real wages temporarily, making labor cheaper in real terms, so firms hire more workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason the SRAS curve is upward sloping rather than horizontal in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "International trade policies and tariff structures that create price stability across markets",
          "Sticky wages and prices due to contracts",
          "Frequent government policy changes that affect business operations",
          "Complete flexibility of prices and wages"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "SRAS slopes upward because some wages and input prices are fixed by contracts or slow to adjust. Higher output prices raise profitability temporarily, encouraging more production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a decrease in expected future inflation affect the SRAS curve, and why?",
        "options": [
          "Makes SRAS curve steeper due to higher demand",
          "Shifts left as firms ramp up current production",
          "Shifts right as firms prepare for lower future costs",
          "Remains unchanged as expectations don't impact production"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If firms expect lower future inflation, they are less likely to raise prices and wages now, reducing current production costs — SRAS shifts right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might government regulation that raises production costs lead to a dual effect on SRAS and price level?",
        "options": [
          "Shifts SRAS left, decreases price level as supply falls",
          "Shifts SRAS left, increases price level, causing inflation",
          "Shifts SRAS right, increases price level, fostering growth",
          "Shifts SRAS right, decreases price levels, stabilizing economy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cost‑increasing regulations shift SRAS left, reducing output and raising the price level — cost‑push inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of automation improving productivity, how does SRAS shift and why does it benefit the economy?",
        "options": [
          "Remains unchanged, auto-adjusts employment levels",
          "Shifts right, increases output, and stabilizes prices",
          "Shifts right, reduces unemployment and increases overall income",
          "Shifts left, decreases costs, and reduces inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Automation lowers per‑unit costs, shifting SRAS right — higher output at lower prices in the short run, raising real GDP and living standards."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do changes in government actions factor into the movement of the SRAS curve compared to resource availability?",
        "options": [
          "Government actions have no effect on SRAS, unlike resource availability which shifts the curve",
          "Both factors similarly prompt a shift to the right regardless of circumstances",
          "Government actions affect SRAS immediately while resource changes take longer",
          "Resource availability and government actions both shift SRAS left"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Government policies (e.g., taxes, regulations) can shift SRAS quickly. Changes in resource availability (e.g., discovery of oil) may take time to affect production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the SRAS curve not affected by consumer demand in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Consumer demand permanently shifts SRAS to extreme positions",
          "Consumer demand changes lead to horizontal shifts, irrelevant to SRAS",
          "Consumer demand only affects aggregate demand, not SRAS",
          "SRAS is only affected by monetary policy, not consumer behavior"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "SRAS depends on production costs, technology, and expectations. Changes in consumer demand shift AD, causing movement along the SRAS curve, not shifting it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might an increase in the GDP deflator result in movement along the SRAS curve rather than a shift?",
        "options": [
          "GDP deflator adjustments reflect comprehensive changes in government supply-side policy implementation",
          "It indicates a change in price level, not resource factors",
          "Because it primarily measures non-domestic inflation trends",
          "It reduces government intervention in SRAS shifting mechanisms"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A change in the price level (measured by GDP deflator) causes movement along SRAS. Only changes in production costs, technology, or expectations shift SRAS."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does employment stability impact the interpretation of shifts along the SRAS curve?",
        "options": [
          "Employment stability is irrelevant to SRAS movement",
          "SRAS curves rely on erratic employment changes",
          "Constant employment implies that SRAS shifts only lead to more production",
          "Shifts often require employment adjustments to avoid price disequilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Shifting SRAS (e.g., due to cost changes) changes firms’ hiring decisions, affecting employment in the short run to reach new equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might the destruction of a key resource like coal refining capabilities force SRAS to shift?",
        "options": [
          "It unequivocally reduces consumer spending power",
          "It reduces the long-run potential output of the economy",
          "It shifts because of increased global trade barriers",
          "It directly impacts production capabilities and increases input costs"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Loss of refining capacity raises energy costs and reduces productive capacity, shifting SRAS left in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does SRAS illustrate the relationship between inflation and unemployment, and why is this trade-off short-term?",
        "options": [
          "Higher inflation leads to permanent unemployment decrease as output maxes",
          "Economic fluctuations adjust wages, resolving trade-off over time",
          "Inflation reduction immediately increases unemployment",
          "Inflation stabilizes over time, leaving the trade-off persistent"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Short‑run Phillips curve trade‑off exists because of sticky wages. In the long run, wages adjust, returning unemployment to natural rate regardless of inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does an adjustment in productivity need to combine with resource availability to effectively shift the SRAS?",
        "options": [
          "Separate effects increase redundancy in output processes",
          "They independently have minimal impact on the broader economy",
          "Integrated production capacity defines the actual output potential",
          "Combined they determine employment and consumer income"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity raises potential output only if resources (labor, capital, materials) are available to utilize the new technology — together they shift SRAS right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way do sticky resource prices influence SRAS in contrast to rapidly adjusting consumer prices?",
        "options": [
          "Sticky prices change rapidly with consumer habits altering SRAS",
          "They lead to rapid SRAS adjustments while consumer prices stall",
          "They prevent rapid SRAS shifts balancing long-term price expectations",
          "They stabilize output while consumers maintain temporary price flexibility"
        ],
        "explanation": "Sticky input prices (e.g., long‑term supply contracts) mean SRAS shifts slowly when demand changes; flexible consumer prices allow quick movement along SRAS.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can government incentives aimed at boosting productivity shift SRAS, and why might this be beneficial in a recession?",
        "options": [
          "By encouraging foreign investment, artificially inflating GDP",
          "By becoming subsidized, reducing market competition",
          "By increasing cost pressures, reducing inflation",
          "By enhancing efficiency, reducing unemployment, and promoting stable growth"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Productivity incentives (e.g., R&D tax credits) lower costs and raise potential output (SRAS shifts right), helping lower unemployment and inflation during a slump."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is consumer income not a direct shifter of the SRAS, unlike resource prices?",
        "options": [
          "Consumer income only impacts SRAS through long-term business investment decisions",
          "Higher income levels directly reduce firms' production capabilities and costs",
          "Income affects demand, not production costs or supply capabilities",
          "Income exclusively determines real GDP measurement accuracy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Consumer income influences AD (C), not the cost of production or technological capacity that determines SRAS."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What long-term economic consequence might result from continuous leftward shifts in SRAS due to resource depletion?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in global trade balances",
          "Persistent inflation with decreased real GDP potential",
          "Protective government interventions reversing shifts",
          "A stable output equilibrium without inflationary impacts"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Repeated negative supply shocks (SRAS left) cause stagflation: higher inflation and lower potential output over time."
