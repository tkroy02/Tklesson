    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Scarcity in economics refers to",
        "options": [
          "A lack of natural resources",
          "Unlimited wants and limited resources",
          "Poverty in developing nations",
          "A shortage of goods in a market",
          "Government rationing of products"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem: unlimited human wants in a world of limited resources, requiring choices and trade-offs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The opportunity cost of a decision is",
        "options": [
          "The money spent on the chosen option",
          "The total cost of all alternatives",
          "The value of the next best alternative forgone",
          "The cost of producing one more unit",
          "The explicit financial outlay of the decision"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative given up when a choice is made. It includes both explicit and implicit costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country must give up 5 tons of corn to produce 1 ton of wheat, the opportunity cost of 1 ton of wheat is",
        "options": [
          "1/5 ton of corn",
          "5 tons of corn",
          "1 ton of wheat",

          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost = what is given up / what is gained. Giving up 5 corn for 1 wheat means 1 wheat costs 5 corn."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point inside the production possibilities curve (PPC) indicates",
        "options": [
          "Efficient use of resources",
          "Unattainable production",
          "Inefficiency or unemployment",
          "Economic growth",
          "Maximum output combination"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Points inside the PPC are attainable but inefficient—resources are underutilized or unemployed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic growth is shown on a PPC diagram as",
        "options": [
          "Movement along the curve",
          "A shift of the curve outward",
          "A shift of the curve inward",
          "A point inside the curve",
          "A change in the slope of the curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic growth expands productive capacity, shifting the PPC outward. More of both goods can be produced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A straight‑line PPC implies",
        "options": [

          "Unattainable production points"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A linear PPC means resources are perfectly adaptable; opportunity cost remains constant as production shifts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of increasing opportunity costs results from",
        "options": [

          "International trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As more of one good is produced, resources less suited to that good must be used, raising opportunity cost (bowed‑out PPC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would shift a country's PPC outward?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in unemployment",
          "A reallocation of resources toward consumer goods",
          "An increase in the labor force",

          "A decline in technology"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increasing resources (labor, capital) or improving technology shifts PPC outward. Reducing unemployment moves to the curve, not shifting it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Absolute advantage is determined by",
        "options": [

          "Lower production costs in monetary terms"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Absolute advantage: who can produce more of a good with the same resources (or same output with fewer resources)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comparative advantage exists when a country can produce a good",
        "options": [
          "Using fewer resources than another country",
          "At a lower opportunity cost than another country",
          "Of higher quality than another country",
          "At a lower financial cost than another country",
          "Faster than another country"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage is about lower opportunity cost, not absolute productivity. It's the basis for mutually beneficial trade."
      },

          "Country A has comparative advantage in cars",
          "Country B has comparative advantage in trucks",
          "Neither country has comparative advantage",
          "Country B has absolute advantage in both",
          "Trade will not benefit either country"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Country B produces more cars (12>10) and more trucks (6>5) with same resources → absolute advantage in both. Need opportunity costs to find comparative advantage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mutually beneficial trade is possible when",
        "options": [

          "Each country specializes in the good where it has comparative advantage",
          "Countries have identical opportunity costs",
          "Countries produce only capital goods",
          "Trade barriers are eliminated"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Even if one country is absolutely better at both, both gain by specializing in their comparative advantage and trading."
      },

          "Random chance"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Market economies rely on decentralized decisions: consumers vote with dollars, producers seek profit, prices signal scarcity."
      },

          "Monopoly power in capitalism"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Adam Smith's metaphor: individuals pursuing self‑interest in competitive markets are led, as if by an invisible hand, to promote social good."

          "Profit as main incentive"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Command economies: government owns resources, decides what/how/for whom to produce. Prices are set, not market‑determined."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consumer goods differ from capital goods in that consumer goods",
        "options": [

          "Are only purchased by businesses"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Consumer goods satisfy wants directly (food, clothes). Capital goods (machines, tools) are used to produce other goods."

          "Higher unemployment in the short run"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Capital goods expand future productive capacity → PPC shifts outward. Sacrificing current consumption for future growth."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the production of pizzas and robots is shown on a PPC, and a country chooses more pizzas and fewer robots, in the future the PPC will",

          "Become linear"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Choosing consumption (pizzas) over investment (robots) reduces future capital stock → slows growth, may shift PPC inward relative to investing."
