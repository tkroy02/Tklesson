    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best explains why the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve is downward sloping due to the 'interest rate effect'?",
        "options": [
          "A lower price level reduces the demand for money, lowering interest rates and increasing investment spending.",
          "Higher prices make domestic goods more expensive for foreign buyers, reducing net exports.",
          "As prices rise, the real value of household wealth decreases, leading to lower consumption.",
          "Lower interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, which discourages firm production."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The interest rate effect: lower price level → lower demand for money → lower interest rates → higher investment (and consumption) spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government increases personal income taxes while simultaneously the central bank conducts open market sales of bonds, how will Aggregate Demand (AD) be affected?",
        "options": [
          "AD will definitely decrease.",
          "The effect on AD is indeterminate without knowing the magnitude of the changes.",
          "AD will remain unchanged because the effects offset each other.",
          "AD will definitely increase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher taxes reduce disposable income (C decreases). Open market sales are contractionary monetary policy (I decreases). Both shift AD left, so AD definitely decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a decrease in the price of imported raw materials, such as oil, will most likely cause which of the following shifts?",
        "options": [
          "A rightward shift of the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve.",
          "A leftward shift of the Long‑Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve.",
          "A leftward shift of the Short‑Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve.",
          "A rightward shift of the Short‑Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Lower input prices reduce production costs, shifting SRAS to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'sticky wage' theory suggests that the Short‑Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve is upward sloping because:",
        "options": [
          "Firms prefer to keep prices constant to avoid 'menu costs'.",
          "Real wages remain constant regardless of the inflation rate.",
          "Workers always have perfect information about future inflation.",
          "Nominal wages do not adjust immediately to changes in the price level due to long‑term contracts."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "With sticky nominal wages, a higher price level lowers real wages temporarily, encouraging firms to hire more and produce more — SRAS slopes upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause a rightward shift in the Long‑Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in the labor force participation rate.",
          "An increase in consumer confidence.",
          "An increase in the general price level.",
          "A temporary decrease in business taxes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "LRAS shifts right when potential output increases — more labor, capital, or better technology. A larger labor force raises potential GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy is currently in long‑run equilibrium. If there is a sharp increase in the value of the domestic currency relative to foreign currencies, what is the likely short‑run outcome?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in the price level and a decrease in real GDP.",
          "An increase in both the price level and real GDP.",
          "A decrease in the price level and an increase in real GDP.",
          "A decrease in both the price level and real GDP."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation makes exports more expensive (X↓) and imports cheaper (M↑) — AD shifts left. Cheaper imported inputs shift SRAS right, but the AD effect dominates in the short run: both price level and real GDP fall."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose an economy is experiencing a recessionary gap. In the absence of government intervention, how does the economy reach long‑run equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "Aggregate Demand eventually increases as consumers spend more.",
          "The LRAS curve shifts to the left to meet the current output.",
          "The price level rises until it reaches the initial equilibrium point.",
          "Nominal wages eventually fall, shifting the SRAS curve to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Self‑correction: high unemployment puts downward pressure on wages, lowering costs → SRAS shifts right until output returns to potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Stagflation is most likely the result of which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "A leftward shift of the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve.",
          "A rightward shift of the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve.",
          "A leftward shift of the Short‑Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve.",
          "A rightward shift of the Long‑Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stagflation = high inflation + high unemployment. It is caused by a leftward SRAS shift (e.g., oil price shock)."

        "options": [
          "The economy is in long‑run equilibrium.",
          "The economy has an inflationary gap of $50 billion.",
          "The unemployment rate is lower than the natural rate of unemployment.",
          "The economy has a recessionary gap of $50 billion."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Recessionary gap = actual GDP < potential GDP. Here, $500 bn < $550 bn, gap = $50 bn."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the expected rate of inflation will most likely lead to:",
        "options": [
          "A movement downward along the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve.",
          "A rightward shift in the Long‑Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve.",
          "A leftward shift in the Short‑Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve.",
          "A rightward shift in the Short‑Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If workers and firms expect higher inflation, they will build it into wage and price contracts, raising production costs → SRAS shifts left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding the Long‑Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve?",

          "It shifts to the right when the price level increases.",
          "Its slope is determined by the degree of wage and price stickiness.",
          "It is vertical at the full‑employment level of output.",
          "It represents the relationship between the price level and the total spending in the economy."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "LRAS is vertical at potential (full‑employment) GDP. In the long run, output is independent of the price level."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A decrease in the real interest rate will lead to which of the following changes in the AD‑AS model?",
        "options": [
          "The AD curve will shift to the right due to increased investment and consumption.",
          "The LRAS curve will shift to the left as future productivity declines.",
          "The SRAS curve will shift to the right as production costs fall.",
          "The AD curve will shift to the left due to decreased savings."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lower real interest rates stimulate borrowing for investment (I) and large consumer purchases (C), shifting AD right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the AD‑AS model, an 'inflationary gap' is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "A leftward shift of the SRAS curve that leads to higher prices and lower output.",
          "Potential output exceeding actual output and high cyclical unemployment.",
          "Actual output exceeding potential output and unemployment being below the natural rate.",
          "A situation where the price level is falling while output is rising."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inflationary gap: actual GDP > potential GDP, unemployment < natural rate, upward pressure on prices."

          "LRAS shifts right as the economy becomes more structured.",
          "SRAS shifts right, decreasing the price level and increasing real GDP.",
          "AD shifts left, decreasing both the price level and real GDP.",
          "SRAS shifts left, increasing the price level and decreasing real GDP."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher regulations increase production costs, shifting SRAS left: price level rises, real GDP falls."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy is in a recessionary gap and the government takes no action, the 'wealth effect' will eventually help move the economy toward equilibrium because:",

          "Rising interest rates will increase the return on savings.",
          "Falling wages will cause people to feel wealthier.",
          "As the price level falls, the real value of money holdings increases, encouraging more consumer spending.",
          "The government will eventually be forced to lower taxes."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Wealth effect: a lower price level increases real wealth (purchasing power of money and assets), raising consumption and shifting AD right."

          "A major technological breakthrough that increases labor productivity."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Positive supply shock lowers costs or raises productivity, shifting SRAS right. Technological breakthrough is a classic example."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the Short‑Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve when the economy moves from a short‑run inflationary equilibrium back to long‑run equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes vertical to match the LRAS curve.",
          "It shifts to the right as firms increase production to meet high demand.",
          "It remains stationary while the AD curve shifts back to the left.",
          "It shifts to the left as nominal wages rise in response to higher prices."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In an inflationary gap, low unemployment pushes up wages over time, raising costs and shifting SRAS left until output returns to potential."

          "The Interest Rate Effect."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Substitution effect relates to microeconomic consumer choice between goods, not to the macro AD slope. AD slopes down due to wealth, interest rate, and foreign purchases effects."
