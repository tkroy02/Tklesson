        "question": "What is the fundamental economic problem that all societies face?",
        "options": [
          "The allocation of resources by the government.",
          "The issue of unlimited wants with limited resources.",

          "Ensuring that everyone in society has an equal income."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Scarcity — unlimited wants but limited resources — is the central problem that forces choices about what, how, and for whom to produce."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Scarcity requires people to make choices because:",
        "options": [
          "The government regulates what can be produced.",
          "There are more resources available than people want.",
          "Human wants are unlimited, but resources are limited.",
          "Prices in the market fluctuate constantly."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Because resources are scarce relative to unlimited desires, individuals and societies must choose among alternatives."

          "Capital"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Factors of production are inputs used to produce goods/services: land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship. Money is a medium of exchange, not a direct productive input."

        ],
        "answer": "B",

        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "Increasing opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A bowed‑out PPF shows increasing opportunity costs: resources are not equally suited to producing both goods."
      },

        "question": "'Absolute advantage' is when a producer can:",
        "options": [
          "Produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer.",
          "Produce more of a good or service than competitors, using the same amount of resources.",

          "Produce a good that no one else can produce."
        ],
        "answer": "B",

        ],
        "answer": "C",

        "options": [
          "Trade allows countries to become self-sufficient.",
          "Trade allows people to specialize in activities where they have a comparative advantage.",
          "Trade allows the government to collect more taxes.",
          "Trade ensures that prices of all goods fall."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Specializing according to comparative advantage increases total output; trading allows all parties to consume beyond their own PPF."

        "question": "If Country A has a comparative advantage in producing coffee and Country B has a comparative advantage in producing computers, the theory of trade suggests:",
        "options": [
          "Country A should produce only coffee, and Country B should produce only computers, then trade.",
          "Each country should try to produce both goods equally.",
