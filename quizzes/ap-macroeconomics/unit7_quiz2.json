    "topic": "Reserve Ratio, Money Multiplier, Excess Reserves, Bank Balance Sheets, Loan Creation",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the reserve ratio and the money multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "Inverse relationship",
          "Direct relationship",
          "No relationship",
          "Exponential relationship"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The money multiplier is calculated as 1 / Reserve Ratio (or 1 / required reserve ratio). Therefore, as the reserve ratio increases, the multiplier decreases, and vice versa. This is an inverse relationship."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does loaning out excess reserves affect the economy?",
        "options": [
          "Reduces total deposits",
          "Creates new money",
          "Contracts the money supply",
          "Lowers reserve ratio"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a bank makes a loan from its excess reserves, it creates a new demand deposit for the borrower. This new deposit is money (part of M1), so the act of lending expands the total money supply through the fractional reserve banking process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do banks keep cash reserves?",
        "options": [
          "To invest in stocks",
          "To meet reserve requirements",
          "To lend more",
          "To pay taxes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Banks are legally required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposit liabilities as reserves (vault cash or deposits at the Fed). Keeping cash reserves is primarily to comply with these reserve requirements set by the central bank."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a bank's reserve requirement is 10%, what is the maximum potential increase in the money supply from an initial deposit?",
        "options": [
          "5 times the deposit",
          "4 times the deposit",
          "2 times the deposit",
          "10 times the deposit"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The simple money multiplier formula is 1 / reserve ratio. With a 10% (0.10) reserve requirement, the multiplier is 1 / 0.10 = 10. This means the maximum potential increase in the money supply is 10 times the amount of new reserves injected into the banking system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect does an increased reserve requirement have on a bank's lending ability?",
        "options": [
          "Allows unlimited loans",
          "No effect",
          "Decreases lending ability",
          "Increases lending ability"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A higher reserve requirement means banks must hold a larger fraction of their deposits as non-loanable reserves. This leaves a smaller portion of deposits available to be lent out as excess reserves, thereby decreasing the bank's potential lending capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do excess reserves impact the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "They shrink the money supply",
          "They have no impact",
          "They reserve the money supply",
          "They expand the money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Excess reserves are reserves above the required minimum. These reserves form the basis for new loans. When banks lend out excess reserves, they create new demand deposits, which directly expands the M1 money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which condition would lead to a stronger money multiplier effect?",
        "options": [
          "Fewer loans",
          "Lower reserve ratio",
          "More demand deposits",
          "Higher reserve ratio"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A lower reserve ratio means banks are required to hold a smaller fraction of deposits as reserves. This frees up more deposits to be lent out as excess reserves, leading to a larger money multiplier (1 / a smaller number = a larger multiplier) and a stronger potential expansion of the money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of banks holding too much excess reserves rather than lending them?",
        "options": [
          "Has no impact on economy",
          "Decreases economic growth",
          "Increases reserve ratio",
          "Amplifies inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If banks choose to hold large amounts of excess reserves instead of making loans, the money creation process slows down or stops. This reduces the flow of credit to businesses and consumers, which can dampen investment and consumption, thereby decreasing short-term economic growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might a bank choose to hold excess reserves?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure liquidity",
          "To maximize profits",
          "To expand the money supply",
          "To increase loans"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In times of economic uncertainty or financial stress, banks may prioritize safety and liquidity over profitability. Holding excess reserves ensures they have ample cash on hand to meet sudden withdrawal demands from depositors or other liquidity needs, even though it earns a low return."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a larger amount of excess reserves affect the potential for loan creation?",
        "options": [
          "Has no effect",
          "Decreases potential",
          "Eliminates potential",
          "Increases potential"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Excess reserves are the fuel for loan creation. A larger pool of excess reserves means banks have a greater capacity to make new loans without violating reserve requirements. This increases the potential for expanding the money supply through the lending process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a scenario where the reserve ratio is 50%, what is the impact on the money supply compared to a 20% ratio?",
        "options": [
          "No impact with either",
          "Less impact with 50% ratio",
          "Equal impact",
          "Greater impact with 50% ratio"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A 50% reserve requirement results in a money multiplier of 2 (1 / 0.5). A 20% requirement results in a multiplier of 5 (1 / 0.2). Therefore, a given injection of new reserves will lead to a smaller total expansion of the money supply under the higher (50%) reserve ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might the public holding more currency impact the calculated money supply change?",
        "options": [
          "No impact on calculations",
          "Increases calculated change",
          "Doubles the change",
          "Decreases calculated change"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The simple money multiplier assumes all money remains in the banking system as deposits. If the public holds more currency (a 'cash drain' or 'currency drain'), money leaks out of the deposit-creation process. This reduces the amount of reserves banks have to lend, making the actual money supply increase smaller than the maximum potential calculated by the simple multiplier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are bank balance sheets important to understanding money supply expansion?",
        "options": [
          "They show asset prices",
          "They predict GDP",
          "They display loans and reserves",
          "They forecast inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A bank's balance sheet provides a snapshot of its assets (like reserves and loans) and liabilities (like customer deposits). By tracking how an injection of reserves leads to an increase in both loans (an asset) and deposits (a liability) across the banking system, we can see the mechanics of money supply expansion in action."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might cause the actual money supply change to differ from the predicted change using the money multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "Banks hold more reserves",
          "Banks lose deposits",
          "Accurate reserve holdings",
          "Public not withdrawing money"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The simple money multiplier formula predicts the *maximum* possible expansion, assuming banks lend out all excess reserves. If banks choose to hold more reserves (excess reserves) than the minimum required, they lend less. This 'excess reserve holding' is a key reason the actual money supply increase is often less than the theoretical maximum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bank's ability to create loans directly depends on what factor?",
        "options": [
          "Global markets",
          "Tax rates",
          "Reserve ratio",
          "Economic growth"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The reserve ratio dictates the fraction of deposits a bank must keep as required reserves. The bank can only lend out deposits in excess of this requirement. Therefore, the reserve ratio is the direct, legal constraint that determines a bank's capacity to create new loans from a given level of deposits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when a bank loans out its excess reserves?",
        "options": [
          "Increases bank liabilities",
          "Expands the money supply",
          "Increases currency holding",
          "Reduces bank assets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a bank makes a loan, it credits the borrower's checking account, creating a new demand deposit. This deposit is immediately spendable money. Since the money supply (M1) includes demand deposits, the act of lending out excess reserves directly expands the total money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might a higher reserve requirement lead to a smaller money multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "Expands loans",
          "Limits excess reserves",
          "Reduces deposits",
          "Limits required reserves"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A higher reserve requirement means a larger portion of each deposit is locked up as required reserves, leaving a smaller portion as excess reserves available for lending. With fewer excess reserves to lend out at each stage of the money creation process, the total expansion of deposits is limited, resulting in a smaller multiplier effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the balance sheet ensure that a bank's assets and liabilities are equal?",
        "options": [
          "By ensuring accounting accuracy",
          "By tracking investments",
          "By equalizing deposits",
          "By balancing loans"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A balance sheet is a fundamental accounting statement that must, by definition, balance: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Every financial transaction (e.g., making a loan, receiving a deposit) is recorded with double-entry bookkeeping, which ensures this equation always holds true, providing an accurate financial picture."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does a demand deposit play in fractional reserve banking?",
        "options": [
          "Decreases liabilities",
          "Distributes profits",
          "Creates shareholder value",
          "Increases reserves"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When a customer makes a demand deposit (e.g., deposits cash into a checking account), the bank's reserves increase. These new reserves provide the base from which the bank can create new loans, following the fractional reserve rule. The deposit itself is a liability for the bank, but the corresponding increase in reserves (an asset) enables lending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a possible effect of a decreasing demand for bank loans?",
        "options": [
          "Increases excess reserves",
          "Reduces reserve ratio",
          "Strengthens money multiplier",
          "Causes bank failures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If businesses and consumers are unwilling to borrow (due to low confidence, high existing debt, or poor economic prospects), banks will be unable to lend out their excess reserves. This leads to an accumulation of excess reserves on bank balance sheets, as the money creation process stalls."
