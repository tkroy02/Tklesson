    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As the demand for foreign currency increases, what happens to the domestic currency?",
        "options": [
          "It remains stable",
          "It appreciates",
          "It becomes obsolete",
          "It depreciates"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Increased demand for foreign currency means domestic residents are selling domestic currency to buy foreign currency. This increases the supply of domestic currency in the foreign exchange market, causing the domestic currency to depreciate relative to the foreign currency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following are true about the effects of a currency depreciating except:",
        "options": [
          "Imports become more expensive for domestic consumers.",
          "It leads to an immediate decrease in the country’s aggregate demand.",
          "It can lead to an increase in net exports.",
          "Exports become cheaper for foreign buyers."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Currency depreciation does not necessarily lead to an immediate decrease in aggregate demand. In fact, through the net export channel (NX = X - M), depreciation can stimulate aggregate demand by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive, potentially increasing net exports. The J-curve effect suggests trade balance may initially worsen before improving, but aggregate demand is not automatically reduced."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the official reserves account function when the United States experiences a balance of payments deficit?",
        "options": [
          "It records an inflow of capital investments from foreign countries.",
          "It indicates a rise in U.S. investments abroad.",
          "It always runs a surplus regardless of the current account balance.",
          "It adjusts by adding foreign currencies to balance the deficit."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By accounting identity: Current Account + Capital Account + Official Reserves Account = 0. When there is a balance of payments deficit (sum of current and capital accounts is negative), the official reserves account must run a surplus (positive) to balance the equation. This typically involves the central bank selling foreign reserves and buying domestic currency to support the currency value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of an appreciation of the euro on the supply of euros in the FOREX market?",
        "options": [
          "Decreases quantity supplied",
          "Increases quantity demanded",
          "Increases quantity supplied",
          "No change in quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Appreciation refers to an increase in the exchange rate value of the euro. As the euro appreciates (becomes more valuable), there is movement along the supply curve: euro holders are willing to supply more euros to the FOREX market because each euro now buys more foreign currency. This represents an increase in the quantity supplied, not a shift of the supply curve itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the supply of a currency when its exchange rate increases?",
        "options": [
          "Supply becomes unpredictable",
          "Supply remains constant",
          "Supply increases",
          "Supply decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When a currency's exchange rate increases (appreciates), there is movement along the upward-sloping supply curve: the quantity supplied increases. Holders of the currency are more willing to sell it when it can buy more foreign goods, services, or assets. The supply curve itself doesn't shift unless there are changes in factors like interest rates, inflation expectations, or economic outlook."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following statements about the U.S. Balance of Payments Accounts are true except:",
        "options": [
          "A current account deficit means that the United States has received more American dollars from abroad than it has sent out.",
          "An inflow in the capital account reflects foreign investment in U.S. assets.",
          "Adjustments by the Federal Reserve in the Official Reserves Account are made to balance the overall balance of payments.",
          "The current account records transactions involving goods, services, and income flows."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Statement A is incorrect. A current account deficit means the U.S. is spending more on foreign goods, services, and income payments than it is receiving from abroad—it is sending more dollars out than receiving. This deficit must be financed by a capital account surplus (capital inflows), meaning foreigners are investing in U.S. assets, bringing dollars back into the country."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Political instability in Country X leads to capital flight. What is the most likely effect on Country X's currency in the foreign exchange market?",
        "options": [
          "Appreciation as domestic goods become more attractive",
          "Depreciation as investors sell domestic assets",
          "Appreciation as domestic interest rates rise",
          "No change as central bank intervention offsets effects"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Capital flight means investors are selling Country X's assets and converting the proceeds to foreign currency. This increases the supply of Country X's currency in the FOREX market as investors sell it to buy foreign currencies, causing the domestic currency to depreciate. Unless the central bank intervenes (using reserves to buy domestic currency), depreciation will occur."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A protective tariff on imported software raises the domestic price from $100 to $110 per unit and reduces imports by 35,000 units. If the tariff is $10 per unit, what is the total tariff revenue collected?",
        "options": [
          "$1,000,000",
          "$350,000",
          "$700,000",
          "$175,000"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tariff revenue = Tariff per unit × Quantity imported after tariff. With imports reduced by 35,000 units, we need to know the post-tariff import quantity. The tariff is $10, raising price from $100 to $110. If we assume the 35,000 reduction represents the decrease in imports, we need the starting quantity to calculate final quantity. However, if the question implies imports fall TO 35,000 units, then revenue = $10 × 35,000 = $350,000. This assumes 35,000 is the quantity imported after the tariff."

        "question": "If the British pound depreciates against the Japanese yen, which statement accurately describes the economic impact?",
        "options": [
          "Japanese firms face higher costs when investing in Britain",
          "British manufacturers gain competitive advantage in Japan",
          "British consumers find Japanese imports more affordable",
          "Britain's terms of trade with Japan improve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pound depreciation means each pound buys fewer yen. British goods become cheaper when priced in yen (more competitive in Japan), while Japanese goods become more expensive when priced in pounds (less affordable in Britain). This gives British manufacturers a competitive advantage in Japanese markets. Terms of trade (export prices/import prices) would likely worsen for Britain."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would a depreciation of the U.S. dollar affect the balance of payments current account and capital account?",
        "options": [
          "Current account worsens, capital account improves",
          "Current account worsens, capital account varies",
          "Current account improves, capital account worsens",
          "Current account improves, capital account varies"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Dollar depreciation makes U.S. exports cheaper and imports more expensive. After the J-curve period, this typically improves the current account (higher net exports). The capital account effect varies: depreciation might attract capital seeking cheap assets (improving capital account) or deter capital due to currency risk (worsening capital account). There's no automatic inverse relationship; both can improve simultaneously."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a likely result of capital inflow due to higher real interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Increased inflation",
          "Currency depreciation",
          "Decreased investment",
          "Currency appreciation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher real interest rates attract foreign capital seeking better returns. Investors need the domestic currency to buy domestic assets, increasing demand for the currency in FOREX markets, causing currency appreciation. This appreciation can reduce inflation by making imports cheaper but may also reduce net exports."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is experiencing an increase in the price of domestic steel. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in the country's production of automobiles",
          "Implementation of a protective tariff on imported steel",
          "A decrease in the global supply of steel",
          "A reduction in the country's export subsidies for steel"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A protective tariff on imported steel raises the price of foreign steel, allowing domestic producers to raise their prices while remaining competitive. Increased automobile production (A) would increase demand for steel, potentially raising prices, but the question specifies 'most likely cause'—tariffs directly raise domestic steel prices by reducing import competition. Global supply decrease (C) would affect both domestic and imported steel prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario is most likely to attract inbound capital flows into a country?",
        "options": [
          "When domestic interest rates are significantly lowered to boost export competitiveness.",
          "When the country's currency depreciates continuously irrespective of interest rates.",
          "When the current account is in persistent deficit regardless of global conditions.",
          "When the country offers higher real interest rates compared to other nations."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher real interest rates make domestic assets more attractive to foreign investors, leading to capital inflows. Lower interest rates (A) would discourage capital inflows. Continuous depreciation (B) suggests capital flight or weak fundamentals. Persistent current account deficits (C) require capital inflows to finance them but don't automatically attract them—investors need attractive returns or confidence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to net exports when the domestic currency appreciates?",
        "options": [
          "Net exports increase",
          "Domestic demand increases",
          "Net exports decrease",
          "No change in net exports"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation makes domestic goods more expensive for foreigners (exports decrease) and foreign goods cheaper for domestic consumers (imports increase). Both effects reduce net exports (NX = X - M). This can decrease aggregate demand unless offset by other components (C, I, G)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a surplus in the Current Account indicate?",
        "options": [
          "Currency depreciation",
          "Capital inflows exceed outflows",
          "Exports exceed imports",
          "Imports exceed exports"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A current account surplus means the value of exports of goods and services plus net income from abroad exceeds the value of imports plus net transfers abroad. This is often summarized as 'exports exceed imports' in the trade balance component. A current account surplus is typically associated with a capital account deficit (capital outflows exceed inflows)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the real interest rate in the United States rises relative to Japan, which sequence of events would most likely occur?",
        "options": [
          "Capital flows to Japan → dollar depreciates → US net exports rise",
          "Capital flows to Japan → dollar appreciates → US net exports fall",
          "Capital flows to US → dollar depreciates → US net exports rise",
          "Capital flows to US → dollar appreciates → US net exports fall"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher U.S. real interest rates attract Japanese capital to U.S. assets → capital flows to U.S. → increased demand for dollars in FOREX markets → dollar appreciates → U.S. exports become more expensive for Japanese buyers, imports become cheaper for U.S. consumers → U.S. net exports fall. This illustrates the trade-off between attracting capital and maintaining export competitiveness."

        "question": "What happens if the Fed decreases the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "The dollar appreciates relative to foreign currencies",
          "The dollar depreciates relative to foreign currencies",
          "U.S. net exports increase",
          "Foreign demand for U.S. goods increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Contractionary monetary policy (decreasing money supply) raises domestic interest rates. Higher interest rates attract foreign capital seeking better returns, increasing demand for dollars in foreign exchange markets. This causes the dollar to appreciate. While a stronger dollar tends to reduce net exports (making U.S. goods more expensive abroad), the initial direct effect is currency appreciation."

    "A balance of payments deficit means more dollars were sent out than foreign currency came in.",
    "The Fed adjusts deficits or surpluses in the current and capital account.",
    "The Fed credits the account to balance a deficit in the balance of payments."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Statement A is incorrect because the official reserves account does NOT record trade in goods and services. That function belongs to the current account. The official reserves account records changes in a country's holdings of foreign currencies, gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and its reserve position at the IMF. It is used by the central bank to intervene in foreign exchange markets and to settle balance of payments imbalances."

        "options": [
          "The US dollar will experience a J-curve effect, initially appreciating before depreciating",
          "The US dollar will depreciate against other currencies",
          "The US dollar will appreciate against other currencies",
          "The US dollar's value will remain constant due to the interest rate parity condition"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Expansionary monetary policy (increasing money supply, lowering interest rates) makes dollar-denominated assets less attractive. Lower interest rates reduce capital inflows or may cause capital outflows as investors seek higher returns elsewhere. This decreases demand for dollars in foreign exchange markets, causing the dollar to depreciate. The J-curve refers to trade balance adjustment, not currency value patterns."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is choosing to adopt a contractionary monetary policy, which results in higher domestic interest rates and an appreciation of its currency. What economic activity directly causes this outcome?",
        "options": [
          "A surge in consumer spending triggered by lower borrowing costs, which would generally lead to currency depreciation.",
          "A dramatic drop in foreign demand for domestic exports, which is not directly linked to the monetary policy change.",
          "A decrease in the money supply by the central bank, which raises domestic interest rates and attracts foreign investment.",
          "An increase in the money supply that paradoxically raises domestic interest rates despite a contractionary intent."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Contractionary monetary policy involves decreasing the money supply, which raises domestic interest rates (through reduced liquidity and tighter credit conditions). Higher interest rates attract foreign capital as investors seek better returns on domestic assets. This increased demand for the domestic currency in foreign exchange markets causes currency appreciation. This is the standard transmission mechanism from monetary policy to exchange rates."
