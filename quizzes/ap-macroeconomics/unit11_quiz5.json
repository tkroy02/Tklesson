    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the exchange rate for the euro decreases, what is the likely effect on European exports?",
        "options": [
          "Their demand decreases",
          "Their supply decreases",
          "They become cheaper",
          "They become more expensive"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A decrease in the euro exchange rate means euro depreciation (fewer foreign currency units per euro). This makes European goods cheaper for foreign buyers when priced in foreign currency, increasing their price competitiveness abroad."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When American consumers develop a preference for German cars, what is the impact on the exchange rate for the euro?",
        "options": [
          "The euro appreciates",
          "The exchange rate fluctuates randomly",
          "The euro depreciates",
          "The euro remains the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased American demand for German cars requires Americans to buy euros to pay German manufacturers. This increases demand for euros in the foreign exchange market, causing euro appreciation (more dollars per euro)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose US inflation rates are higher than in the UK. How might this affect the GBP/USD exchange rate?",
        "options": [
          "Both currencies depreciate",
          "No effect on exchange rates",
          "The USD appreciates against the GBP",
          "The GBP appreciates against the USD"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "According to purchasing power parity, countries with higher inflation should experience currency depreciation. With US inflation higher than UK inflation, the USD would depreciate relative to GBP, meaning GBP appreciates against USD (more dollars per pound)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If speculation in the currency market anticipates a rise in US interest rates, what action might investors take?",
        "options": [
          "Buy more GBP",
          "Sell all currency holdings",
          "Buy more EUR",
          "Buy more USD"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Expected higher US interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Investors would buy USD now to invest in these assets before rates rise, anticipating capital gains and higher yields, driving up demand for dollars."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets generally causes American exports to be:",
        "options": [
          "More competitive",
          "Cheaper abroad",
          "Ignored",
          "More expensive abroad"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Dollar appreciation means foreign buyers need more of their currency to buy dollars, making American goods more expensive when priced in foreign currency. This reduces price competitiveness of US exports in foreign markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a stronger dollar influence the price of imports for American consumers?",
        "options": [
          "Imports become more expensive",
          "Imports remain the same in cost",
          "Imports are banned",
          "Imports become cheaper"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A stronger dollar means each dollar buys more foreign currency, making imported goods cheaper when converted to dollars. This increases American consumers' purchasing power for foreign goods and services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If European investors expect the dollar to depreciate, they are likely to:",
        "options": [
          "Buy more dollars",
          "Hold onto dollars",
          "Buy more euros",
          "Invest in American assets"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Expecting dollar depreciation, European investors would sell dollar assets to avoid capital losses and convert to euros or other currencies expected to hold value better. This is a defensive move against expected currency weakness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in US income levels generally affect the demand for foreign currencies?",
        "options": [
          "Increases the demand",
          "Decreases the demand",
          "Does not affect the demand",
          "Leads to a loss of interest in foreign products"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher US income increases demand for imports (normal goods), requiring Americans to buy foreign currencies to pay for these imports. This increases demand for foreign currencies in the forex market, putting downward pressure on the dollar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect would high inflation in Europe have on the US dollar relative to the euro?",

          "Appreciate the USD",
          "Stabilize both currencies"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "High European inflation reduces euro purchasing power, making European goods less competitive. This reduces demand for euros in trade and may prompt capital flight from euro assets to dollar assets, causing euro depreciation and dollar appreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the dollar appreciates, what is the likely effect on the US trade balance?",
        "options": [
          "Trade deficit increases",
          "Trade balance becomes irrelevant",
          "No change",
          "Trade surplus increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dollar appreciation makes US exports more expensive and imports cheaper, reducing export volumes and increasing import volumes. This worsens the trade balance, typically increasing the trade deficit or reducing the surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does consumer preference for domestic over foreign goods affect the exchange rate of the local currency?",

          "Appreciates the local currency",
          "Causes currency to disappear",
          "Depreciates the local currency",
          "Has no effect"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Preference for domestic goods reduces import demand, decreasing demand for foreign currencies. Also, if foreign consumers prefer these domestic goods, export demand increases. Both effects increase demand for the local currency, causing appreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An expected increase in European interest rates might cause the euro to:",

          "Appreciate",
          "Remain stable",
          "Depreciate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Expected higher European interest rates make euro-denominated assets more attractive. Investors buy euros now to invest in these assets, anticipating higher returns. This increased demand causes euro appreciation in advance of the actual rate increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If European GDP growth outpaces that of the US, how might this affect the euro relative to the dollar?",
        "options": [
          "Weaken the euro",
          "Appreciate the euro",
          "Stabilize the euro",
          "Depreciate the euro"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Stronger European growth attracts foreign investment seeking higher returns, increasing capital inflows to Europe. Investors need euros to buy European assets, increasing demand for euros and causing euro appreciation relative to the dollar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "High consumer demand for foreign technology in the US would likely lead to:",

          "Trade restrictions",
          "Appreciation of foreign currencies",
          "No change",
          "Depreciation of foreign currencies"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "High US demand for foreign technology increases imports, requiring Americans to buy foreign currencies to pay for these goods. This increases demand for those currencies in forex markets, causing appreciation of foreign currencies against the dollar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the dollar depreciates, what becomes easier for American companies operating overseas?",

          "Conducting domestic business",
          "Not facing any changes",
          "Selling more products abroad",
          "Financial crisis management"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Dollar depreciation makes American products cheaper in foreign markets when priced in foreign currency. This improves price competitiveness, making it easier for US companies to increase export sales and market share abroad."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario is most likely to lead to an appreciation of the dollar?",

          "Higher US interest rates",
          "Increased US demand for imports",
          "Fewer foreign investments in the US",
          "Lower US interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher US interest rates attract foreign capital seeking better returns. Investors need dollars to invest in US assets, increasing demand for dollars in forex markets. This capital inflow causes dollar appreciation, assuming other factors constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What impact does speculation of a stronger euro have on the currency market?",

          "Strengthens other currencies",
          "Lowers the euro's value",
          "Has no impact"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Speculation becomes self-fulfilling: if traders expect euro appreciation, they buy euros now to profit from expected price increases. This increased buying pressure actually drives up the euro's value in the present, confirming the speculation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In times of economic uncertainty in the US, what might investors do with their dollars?",

          "Hold onto their dollars"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "During US economic uncertainty, investors seek safer assets elsewhere (flight to quality). They sell dollar assets and convert to currencies of more stable economies, causing capital outflows and dollar depreciation as supply increases in forex markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might a significant rise in American consumer income levels affect foreign currency exchange rates?",

          "Lead to currency abolition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher American incomes increase consumption, including imports (assuming normal goods). To purchase more imports, Americans need more foreign currencies, increasing demand for those currencies in forex markets and putting upward pressure on their values."
