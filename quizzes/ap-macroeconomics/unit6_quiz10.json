    "topic": "Functions of Money, Liquidity, Monetary Base, M1 vs. M2, Commodity vs. Fiat Money",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scenarios best illustrates the medium of exchange function of money?",
        "options": [
          "Buying a sweater with cash",
          "Setting a price for a new car",
          "A farmer trading wheat for a cow",
          "Depositing money into a savings account"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Money acts as a medium of exchange when it is used directly in a transaction to buy goods or services. Option A shows cash facilitating a purchase. Option B illustrates unit of account, C illustrates barter (absence of money), and D illustrates store of value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the unit of account function of money aid in consumer decision-making?",
        "options": [
          "By allowing consumers to save money for future purchases and investments",
          "By distributing goods and services among different groups of people",
          "By providing a direct means to barter goods and services",
          "By enabling price comparisons across products"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "As a unit of account, money provides a common standard of value. This allows consumers to easily compare the prices (and thus the relative value) of different products, which is fundamental to rational decision-making."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of eggs increases relative to cheese, what function of money is being affected in terms of understanding their value?",
        "options": [
          "None of the above",
          "Medium of exchange",
          "Store of value",
          "Unit of account"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The unit of account function allows us to measure and express the relative values of goods. When the price ratio changes, money is the tool we use to quantify and understand that change in value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might liquidity be considered an essential characteristic of money?",
        "options": [
          "It guarantees a fixed interest rate",
          "It ensures that money does not lose its value over time",
          "It makes money flexible for non-monetary uses",
          "It allows money to be quickly converted into cash"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into the economy's medium of exchange (cash) without loss of value. For money to function effectively as a medium of exchange, it must be immediately and readily spendable—i.e., perfectly liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of money in the monetary base concerning bank reserves?",
        "options": [
          "It is used solely for buying foreign currency",
          "It acts as a medium of exchange internationally",
          "It serves as a final settlement of transactions",
          "It sets the value for precious metals"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The monetary base (currency + bank reserves) provides the foundation for the banking system. Bank reserves, held as deposits at the central bank, are the ultimate means of settling transactions between banks, ensuring the stability of the payments system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does M2 expand the definition of money compared to M1?",
        "options": [
          "By adding savings and time deposits",
          "By including foreign currency holdings and international reserves",
          "By excluding coins",
          "By adding barter transactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "M2 is a broader monetary aggregate. It includes all of M1 (the most liquid money: cash and checkable deposits) plus \"near-monies\" like savings deposits, small-denomination time deposits (CDs), and retail money market mutual funds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does the concept of store of value support long-term savings?",
        "options": [
          "It provides an immediate conversion to other currencies",
          "It offers high rates of interest",
          "It allows for frequent financial transactions",
          "It maintains purchasing power over time"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The store of value function means money can be saved and retrieved in the future to make purchases. For it to effectively support long-term savings, it must reasonably preserve its purchasing power, meaning its value does not erode significantly due to inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy primarily uses gold and oil as currency, what type of money is being utilized?",
        "options": [
          "Commodity money",
          "Cryptocurrency",
          "Digital money",
          "Fiat money"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Commodity money is a good that has intrinsic value in non-monetary uses (like gold for jewelry or oil for energy) and is also used as a medium of exchange. Fiat money, in contrast, has value only by government decree."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are credit cards not considered part of the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "They are a form of savings deposits",
          "They represent a short-term loan",
          "They cannot be used for transactions",
          "They are included in M0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A credit card transaction creates a short-term liability (debt) for the user, not an asset. The money supply measures assets held by the public. The actual payment, when made from a checking account (part of M1), is what transfers money."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does the monetary base differ from M1 regarding what it includes?",
        "options": [
          "The monetary base includes physical currency and bank reserves",
          "M1 excludes traveler's checks",
          "The monetary base includes savings deposits",
          "M1 includes large time deposits and stocks"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The monetary base (MB or M0) is the narrowest measure, consisting of physical currency in circulation plus bank reserves (vault cash and deposits at the Fed). M1 includes currency in circulation and checkable deposits but excludes bank reserves held by institutions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is most likely to happen if money could not serve as a store of value?",
        "options": [
          "Bartering would become the primary form of exchange",
          "People would have trouble saving for the future",
          "Prices of goods and services would remain constant",
          "Money would lose its function as a medium of exchange"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If money rapidly lost value (failed as a store of value), people would be unwilling to hold it for any length of time. This would severely disrupt the ability to save and plan for future expenses, though it might not immediately destroy its use in immediate transactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might occur if M1 is dramatically increased without changes to the economy's output?",
        "options": [
          "Deflation",
          "Decrease in demand for goods",
          "Inflation",
          "Stabilization of prices"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "According to the quantity theory of money, a rapid increase in the money supply (like M1) without a corresponding increase in the production of goods and services leads to 'too much money chasing too few goods,' resulting in a general rise in prices—inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which combination best describes M2?",
        "options": [
          "M0 plus credit card limits",
          "M1 plus barter transactions",
          "Coins plus checking accounts",
          "M1 plus savings deposits and mutual funds"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "M2 = M1 + Savings deposits + Small-denomination time deposits + Retail money market mutual funds. It encompasses all highly liquid assets that are close substitutes for transaction money."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these examples does NOT exemplify the function of money as a unit of account?",
        "options": [
          "Bartering a loaf of bread for a dozen eggs",
          "Setting a rental price for a property",
          "Budgeting for monthly expenses",
          "Comparing the price of two different cars"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Barter involves the direct exchange of goods without using money as an intermediate measure of value. Options B, C, and D all involve using money as a common measure to establish price, plan spending, or compare value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does money functioning as a medium of exchange improve economic efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "By providing a reliable way to save for future needs",
          "By establishing a universal measurement of value",
          "By simplifying the barter system",
          "By eliminating all forms of credit"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Money solves the 'double coincidence of wants' problem inherent in barter. By providing a universally accepted payment method, it drastically reduces transaction costs and search time, making trade far more efficient."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What characteristic of commodity money makes it different from fiat money?",
        "options": [
          "Commodity money cannot be used for transactions",
          "Commodity money is issued by governments",
          "Commodity money is abstract and digital",
          "Commodity money has intrinsic value"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The key distinction is intrinsic value. Commodity money (e.g., gold, salt) has value in non-monetary uses. Fiat money (e.g., dollar bills) has value only because of government decree and public trust."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the monetary base generally not used in transactions directly?",
        "options": [
          "It is specifically for foreign exchanges",
          "It only includes checking accounts",
          "It involves bank reserves",
          "It is made up of electronic funds only"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A large component of the monetary base is bank reserves, which are deposits held by commercial banks at the central bank. These are used for interbank settlements and are not directly accessible or spendable by the general public for everyday transactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the concept of unit of account contribute to transparency in the marketplace?",
        "options": [
          "By creating opportunities for mass production",
          "By encouraging barter transactions",
          "By ensuring low inflation rates",
          "By allowing precise and comparable price listings"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The unit of account function means all prices are quoted in the same monetary units (e.g., dollars). This standardization makes market prices clear, easy to understand, and directly comparable, promoting informed choices and efficient markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important for money to fulfill the function of a store of value during inflation?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure liquid assets are available",
          "To maintain purchasing power over time",
          "To promote foreign investment",
          "To keep prices stable in the market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "High inflation erodes purchasing power. For money to be an effective store of value, people must trust that the money they save today will be able to buy a similar amount of goods and services in the future. This trust is undermined if inflation is high and unpredictable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What distinguishes M1 from the broader category M2 in terms of liquidity?",
        "options": [
          "M2 is narrower than M1",
          "M2 allows for immediate currency exchange",
          "M1 is more liquid than M2",
          "M1 includes stocks and bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Liquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be used for transactions. M1 contains only the most liquid assets: cash and assets that can be directly spent (checkable deposits). M2 adds less liquid 'near-monies' (like savings accounts), making M1 the more liquid aggregate."
