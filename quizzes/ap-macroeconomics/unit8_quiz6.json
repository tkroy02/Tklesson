    "topic": "Money Supply, Price Level, Interest Rates, Monetary Neutrality, Quantity Theory of Money (MV=PY), Types of Inflation",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is likely to occur if the money supply is increased rapidly over a sustained period while the economy is at full employment?",
        "options": [
          "Decreased price level",
          "Increased inflation rate",
          "Increased real GDP",
          "Decreased nominal wages"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the economy is at full employment (on the LRAS), output is at its potential and cannot sustainably increase. According to the Quantity Theory (MV=PY), if M increases and Y is fixed at potential, the primary long-run effect is an increase in P—inflation. In the short run, it might stimulate output, but in the long run, only prices rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in the money supply affect the price level and interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Both price level and interest rates increase",
          "Price level decreases, interest rates increase",
          "Both price level and interest rates decrease",
          "Price level increases, interest rates decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the short run, an increase in the money supply lowers the equilibrium nominal interest rate (in the money market). The lower interest rate stimulates spending, increasing Aggregate Demand, which puts upward pressure on the price level. So, the short-run sequence is: M↑ → i↓ → AD↑ → P↑. In the long run, prices rise proportionally, and interest rates return to their original real level (monetary neutrality)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumer demand increases significantly, which type of inflation is likely to occur?",
        "options": [
          "Monetary neutrality effects",
          "Deflation",
          "Demand-pull inflation",
          "Cost-push inflation from supply constraints"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Demand-pull inflation is caused by increases in Aggregate Demand that outpace the economy's ability to produce (when AD > AS at full employment). A significant increase in consumer demand (C) is a direct component of AD and, if the economy is near capacity, will 'pull' the price level upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor does not directly lead to cost-push inflation?",
        "options": [
          "Natural disasters that disrupt supply chains",
          "Resource shortages",
          "Increased consumer savings",
          "Rising production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cost-push inflation is caused by a decrease in Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS), which shifts the SRAS curve leftward. This is triggered by increases in the cost of production inputs (e.g., wages, oil). Increased consumer savings reduces consumption (C), which is a component of Aggregate Demand. This would decrease AD, potentially causing deflation or reducing demand-pull inflation, not causing cost-push inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When aggregate demand (AD) shifts to the right and short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) shifts to the left simultaneously, which outcome is most likely in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Higher price level and an indeterminate change in real GDP",
          "Higher price level and higher real GDP",
          "Lower price level and an indeterminate change in real GDP",
          "Lower price level and lower real GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A rightward AD shift increases both price level and real GDP. A leftward SRAS shift increases price level but decreases real GDP. Their effects on the price level reinforce each other (definitely higher). Their effects on real GDP oppose each other; the net change depends on which shift is larger and is therefore indeterminate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do cost-push inflation and demand-pull inflation combined affect the wage-price spiral?",
        "options": [
          "They help stabilize employment levels and reduce economic uncertainty",
          "They reduce inflation overall",
          "They have no combined effect",
          "They create instability and worsen inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A wage-price spiral is a self-reinforcing cycle where higher prices lead workers to demand higher wages, which increases production costs, leading firms to raise prices further. Both demand-pull inflation (which initially raises prices) and cost-push inflation (which can be initiated by wage hikes) can trigger or feed into this spiral. Their combination can be particularly destabilizing, making inflation persistent and difficult to control."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to real GDP according to the theory of monetary neutrality when there is a long-term increase in money supply?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases slightly",
          "It remains unchanged",
          "It becomes unstable",
          "It increases proportionally"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The theory of monetary neutrality states that changes in the money supply affect only nominal variables (like the price level and nominal wages) in the long run, not real variables (like real GDP, real wages, or unemployment). Real GDP is determined by real factors (resources, technology). Therefore, in the long run, real GDP returns to its potential level, unchanged by the money supply increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "With constant velocity and real output, what does an increase in the money supply directly influence according to the quantity theory of money?",
        "options": [
          "Increase in real wages",
          "Decrease in unemployment",
          "Increase in nominal prices",
          "Decrease in nominal prices"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The equation of exchange is M*V = P*Y. If velocity (V) and real output (Y) are held constant, then an increase in the money supply (M) must be matched by a proportional increase in the price level (P). This is the core prediction of the Quantity Theory of Money: in the long run, money supply growth determines the inflation rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might households not increase their consumption despite a rise in money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Prices rise proportionally",
          "Their nominal wages decrease significantly",
          "Real output decreases substantially",
          "Their real wages decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This describes monetary neutrality in the long run. If the money supply increases and all prices (including wages) eventually rise by the same proportion, households' real purchasing power (real wages, real wealth) is unchanged. There is no real incentive to change consumption behavior because their ability to buy goods and services is the same as before."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the velocity of money and inflation under the quantity theory?",
        "options": [
          "If velocity decreases, inflation increases",
          "If velocity increases, inflation decreases",
          "If velocity increases, inflation increases",
          "Velocity has no effect on inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From M*V = P*Y, solving for P gives P = (M*V)/Y. Holding M and Y constant, an increase in velocity (V) means more spending is occurring with the same money stock, which increases the price level (P), causing inflation. Conversely, a decrease in V would put downward pressure on prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario is most likely to lead to a decrease in the price level?",
        "options": [
          "Decrease in money supply",
          "Decrease in aggregate supply",
          "Increase in aggregate demand",
          "Increase in money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A decrease in the money supply is a contractionary monetary policy. It reduces Aggregate Demand (shifts AD left), which, assuming an upward-sloping SRAS, leads to a lower equilibrium price level. The other options (decrease in AS, increase in AD, increase in MS) all put upward pressure on the price level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does monetary neutrality influence employment levels in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "Employment levels decrease significantly",
          "Employment levels increase significantly",
          "Employment levels fluctuate unpredictably",
          "Employment levels remain unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Monetary neutrality posits that money is a 'veil'—it affects nominal but not real variables in the long run. Employment is a real variable determined by labor market conditions (the natural rate of unemployment). Therefore, changes in the money supply do not permanently alter the employment level; it returns to the natural rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the immediate impact on interest rates if the Federal Reserve decreases the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Interest rates decrease",
          "Interest rates become unpredictable",
          "Interest rates remain unchanged",
          "Interest rates increase"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the money market, the interest rate is the price that balances the supply and demand for money. A decrease in the money supply (leftward shift of the supply curve) creates a shortage at the original interest rate. To equilibrate, the price (interest rate) must rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the economy is experiencing cost-push inflation, what is one likely outcome?",
        "options": [
          "Unemployment increases",
          "Real GDP increases",
          "Nominal GDP decreases",
          "Price levels decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cost-push inflation is caused by a leftward shift of the SRAS curve. This leads to a higher price level (inflation) and a lower level of real output. Lower output typically means firms need fewer workers, leading to an increase in unemployment—a situation known as stagflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a likely long-term effect on an economy if the money supply grows faster than real output?",
        "options": [
          "Inflation will decrease",
          "Inflation will increase",
          "Nominal GDP will decrease",
          "Real GDP will increase"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Quantity Theory of Money in growth rates is: %ΔM + %ΔV ≈ %ΔP + %ΔY. If money supply growth (%ΔM) exceeds real output growth (%ΔY), and assuming velocity is stable (%ΔV ≈ 0), then inflation (%ΔP) must be positive and increase. Sustained excessive money growth causes sustained inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does an increase in both the money supply and in aggregate demand typically cause?",
        "options": [
          "Higher inflation",
          "Higher unemployment",
          "Economic recession",
          "Lower commodity prices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An increase in the money supply is a key driver of increased Aggregate Demand. When AD increases (shifts right), especially if the economy is near full employment, it creates upward pressure on the price level, leading to demand-pull inflation. The two increases are closely linked and reinforce the inflationary outcome."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When does the theory of monetary neutrality apply most effectively in an economy?",
        "options": [
          "During an economic recession",
          "During hyperinflation",
          "When the economy is at full employment",
          "In the short run"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monetary neutrality is a long-run concept. It applies most clearly when the economy is at its long-run equilibrium—at full employment (on the LRAS). At this point, any increase in AD from monetary expansion is fully absorbed by price increases, with no lasting effect on real output or employment. In a recession with idle resources, monetary policy can have real effects in the short run."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect would a sudden increase in money supply have under the quantity theory if output does not change?",
        "options": [
          "Decrease in velocity",
          "Increase in price level",
          "Decrease in output",
          "Increase in real GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Quantity Theory equation is M*V = P*Y. If M increases and Y is fixed (output does not change), and assuming V is stable in the short run, the equation can only balance if P increases proportionally. The immediate effect is an increase in the price level."

        "options": [
          "When government spending decreases significantly",
          "When unemployment rates increase substantially",
          "Increased money supply and consumer demand",
          "When production costs fall across industries"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Demand-pull inflation is caused by excessive Aggregate Demand relative to supply. An increase in the money supply (which lowers interest rates and stimulates spending) and a direct increase in consumer demand (C) are both factors that shift the AD curve to the right, creating the conditions for demand-pull inflation, especially when the economy is near capacity."

          "Increasing money supply",
          "Unchanging price levels"
        ],
        "explanation": "The velocity of money (V) is largely determined by institutional and technological factors affecting how often money changes hands—things like payment systems, banking habits, and financial innovation. For V to remain constant in the long term, these underlying patterns of consumer and business financial behavior must be stable ('static'). Significant changes in behavior (e.g., a shift to digital payments) can alter velocity.",
