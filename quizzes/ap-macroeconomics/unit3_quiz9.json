      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is not a component of Aggregate Demand?",
        "options": [
          "Consumption",
          "Investment",
          "Saving",
          "Net Exports",
          "Government Expenditures"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Aggregate Demand = C + I + G + (X − M). Saving is a leakage, not a spending component of AD."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following events will shift the Aggregate Supply curve to the left?",
        "options": [
          "real wages rise.",
          "inflation expectations decrease.",
          "land costs fall.",
          "a fall in interest rates.",
          "None of the Above"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher real wages increase production costs, shifting SRAS left. Lower inflation expectations and lower land costs shift SRAS right. Interest rates affect AD, not AS directly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Stagflation results from",
        "options": [
          "a shift of the AD curve to the right.",
          "a shift of the AD curve to the left.",
          "a shift of the AS curve to the right.",
          "a shift of the AS curve to the left."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Stagflation = high inflation + high unemployment. It's caused by a leftward shift of AS (e.g., oil price shock)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements about the long‑run Aggregate Supply curve is true?",
        "options": [
          "No matter how much prices increase, output remains the same.",
          "Output is at its potential level.",
          "The economy must be at its natural rate of unemployment.",
          "All input costs have time to fully adjust.",
          "All of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "LRAS is vertical at potential GDP, where unemployment is at the natural rate, and all prices and wages have fully adjusted — all statements are true."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following does NOT affect potential GDP?",
        "options": {
          "A": "the quantity of money",
          "B": "the quantity of labor employed",
          "C": "the quantity of capital and human capital",
          "D": "the amount of entrepreneurial talent available",
          "E": "the quantity of land and natural resources"
        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Potential GDP is determined by real factors of production and the economy's long-run productive capacity. These include labor, capital (physical and human), entrepreneurial talent, and natural resources. The quantity of money is a nominal variable that affects price levels and nominal GDP in the short run, but does not change the economy's underlying ability to produce goods and services in the long run."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "______ increases the quantity of real GDP supplied and is shown as a movement along the AS curve.",
  "options": [
    "A decrease in the quantity of money",
    "A decrease in consumption expenditure",
    "A fall in the expected rate of profit",
    "A rise in the price level",
    "An increase in potential GDP"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "A rise in the price level leads to a movement along the Aggregate Supply curve (AS), increasing the quantity of real GDP supplied. This reflects the short-run positive relationship between the price level and the quantity of output supplied. The other options would shift the AS or AD curves, not cause movement along AS."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Potential GDP",
  "options": [
    "increases as the price level increases because firms supply more goods and services.",
    "decreases as the price level increases because people demand fewer goods and services.",
    "might either increase or decrease as the price level increases, depending on whether aggregate demand increases or decreases.",
    "is independent of the price level.",
    "never changes."
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Potential GDP represents the economy's maximum sustainable output level when all resources are fully employed. It is determined by real factors of production (labor, capital, technology, etc.), not by the price level. In the long run, the aggregate supply curve (LRAS) is vertical, showing that potential GDP is unaffected by changes in the price level."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The aggregate supply curve shifts rightward when",
  "options": [
    "potential GDP decreases.",
    "the money wage rate falls.",
    "income taxes increase.",
    "government purchases increase.",
    "the money wage rate rises."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "A fall in the money wage rate reduces production costs, encouraging firms to supply more output at every price level, shifting the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to the right. Changes in potential GDP affect the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS). Income taxes and government purchases are demand-side factors. A rise in the money wage rate would shift SRAS leftward, increasing costs."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If the price level increases from 110.0 to 115.0, the quantity of",
  "options": [
    "real GDP supplied will increase.",
    "real GDP supplied will decrease.",
    "potential GDP will decrease.",
    "real GDP demanded will increase.",
    "potential GDP will increase."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "In the short run, an increase in the price level leads to a movement along the aggregate supply (AS) curve, resulting in an increase in the quantity of real GDP supplied. This is due to higher prices making it more profitable for firms to produce, given that some input costs (like wages) are temporarily sticky. Potential GDP is unaffected by price level changes in the long run."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following is True?",
  "options": [
    "Aggregate supply is another name for potential GDP.",
    "Potential GDP increases as the price level increases.",
    "At full employment, aggregate supply is equal to potential GDP.",
    "Potential GDP decreases as the price level increases.",
    "The potential GDP line has a negative slope."
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "At full employment, the economy is producing at its potential GDP, meaning that actual output equals potential output. This occurs where the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve intersects the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve at the natural rate of unemployment. Potential GDP is independent of the price level and is represented by a vertical LRAS curve."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If the costs of production increase, there is",
  "options": [
    "an increase in aggregate supply and the AS curve shifts rightward.",
    "a decrease in aggregate supply and the AS curve shifts leftward.",
    "an increase in the quantity of real GDP supplied and a movement up along the AS curve.",
    "a decrease in the quantity of real GDP supplied and a movement down along the AS curve.",
    "a decrease in aggregate supply and the AS curve shifts rightward."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "An increase in production costs (such as wages, raw materials, or taxes) reduces firms' profitability at every price level, causing the short-run aggregate supply (AS) curve to shift leftward. This represents a decrease in aggregate supply, not a movement along the AS curve, which would be caused by a change in the price level."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following shifts the aggregate supply curve leftward?",
  "options": [
    "a decrease in potential GDP",
    "a fall in the money wage rate",
    "a decrease in the price level",
    "a fall in the real wage rate",
    "an increase in potential GDP"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "A decrease in potential GDP reduces the economy's maximum sustainable output, shifting both the long-run and short-run aggregate supply curves leftward. Lower production capacity means less output is supplied at every price level. Changes in money wage rate and price level affect SRAS movement/shifts differently, but potential GDP changes shift the entire AS framework."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If potential GDP increases, then the",
  "options": [
    "aggregate supply curve shifts leftward.",
    "aggregate supply curve shifts rightward.",
    "real wage rate increases.",
    "real wage rate falls.",
    "aggregate demand curve shifts rightward."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "An increase in potential GDP means the economy's productive capacity has grown due to factors such as more capital, technological progress, or a larger labor force. This expands both long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) and short-run aggregate supply (SRAS), shifting the aggregate supply curve rightward."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A fall in the real wage rate ______ firms' profits and leads to ______ in the quantity supplied.",
  "options": [
    "raises; an increase",
    "raises; a decrease",
    "lowers; an increase",
    "lowers; a decrease",
    "does not change; no change"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "A fall in the real wage rate reduces labor costs relative to output prices, which increases firms' profit margins. Higher profitability encourages firms to hire more workers and produce more output, leading to an increase in the quantity of real GDP supplied—a movement along the aggregate supply curve when triggered by a price-level increase, or a rightward shift if the real wage drop stems from lower nominal wages."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If the price level decreases but the money wage rate does not, then firms will hire ______ labor and the quantity of real GDP supplied will ______.",
  "options": [
    "more; increase",
    "the same amount of; not change",
    "less; decrease",
    "more; not change",
    "less; increase"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "When the price level falls but the money wage rate stays the same, the real wage rate (money wage divided by price level) rises. Higher real wages increase labor costs relative to the prices firms receive for their output, reducing profitability. This leads firms to hire less labor and produce less, resulting in a decrease in the quantity of real GDP supplied—a movement up or down along the aggregate supply curve."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The change reflected in the figure might be a result of",
  "image": "images/a6.png",
  "options": [
    "a decrease in the money wage rate.",
    "a decrease in the real wage rate.",
    "an increase in the money wage rate.",
    "an increase in the real wage rate.",
    "a rise in the price level."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The figure shows a rightward shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve (AS) from AS₁ to AS₂, while potential GDP remains unchanged. This shift represents a decrease in production costs. Since the money wage rate is a key cost input for firms, a reduction in nominal wages lowers costs, enabling greater output at each price level. A decrease in the real wage could result from price changes or wage changes, but only a fall in the money wage (with other costs constant) directly shifts AS right. An increase in the money wage rate would shift AS leftward. A rise in the price level causes movement along the AS curve, not a shift."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The aggregate supply curve is",
  "options": [
    "upward sloping.",
    "downward sloping.",
    "a vertical line.",
    "a horizontal line.",
    "U-shaped."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is upward sloping, reflecting that as the price level rises, the quantity of real GDP supplied increases. This occurs because in the short run, some input prices (like wages) are sticky, so higher output prices raise profitability and encourage greater production. In contrast, the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is vertical at potential GDP."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor would shift the Aggregate Demand curve to the right?",
        "options": [
          "an increase in real incomes due to a rise in GDP.",
          "an increase in real wages.",
          "a fall in interest rates which increases investment.",
          "an appreciation of the dollar."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Lower interest rates boost investment (I) and consumption (C), shifting AD right. GDP increase is a result, not a cause. Real wage increases may affect AS. Dollar appreciation reduces net exports, shifting AD left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The international trade effect argues that an increase in the Price level reduces Aggregate Demand because",
        "options": [
          "consumers' wealth is eroded.",
          "the price level increase makes the dollar weaker which decreases net exports.",
          "the price level increase makes the dollar stronger which decreases net exports.",
          "None of the Above"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "International trade effect (foreign purchases effect): higher domestic prices make exports more expensive and imports cheaper → net exports fall → AD decreases. This assumes a fixed exchange rate or that higher inflation strengthens the currency in real terms."
