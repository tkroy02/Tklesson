    "topic": "CPI Substitution Bias, Real GDP Calculation, Unemployment Rate Limits, Interpreting Tables",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country’s CPI shows 5% inflation, but economists estimate that substitution bias accounts for 1.2 percentage points of this figure. What does this imply about the economy?",
        "options": [
          "Consumers are 1.2% worse off than the CPI suggests",
          "The central bank should raise interest rates by 5%",
          "The true cost of living increased by approximately 3.8%",
          "The economy grew 1.2% faster than official statistics show"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If substitution bias overstates inflation by 1.2 percentage points, the true increase in the cost of living is about 5% – 1.2% = 3.8%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country’s nominal GDP is $500 billion and the GDP deflator is 125, what is the country’s real GDP?",
        "options": [
          "$375 billion",
          "$400 billion",
          "$500 billion",
          "$625 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Real GDP = (Nominal GDP / GDP deflator) × 100 = ($500 billion / 125) × 100 = $400 billion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy experiences no change in its unemployment rate over a year, yet economic conditions have worsened. Which limitation of the unemployment rate best explains this paradox?",
        "options": [
          "It fails to account for underemployment",
          "It includes frictional unemployment as a negative factor",
          "It counts part‑time workers as unemployed",
          "It overestimates cyclical unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The unemployment rate counts only those actively seeking work. If workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force or accept part‑time jobs (underemployment), the rate may not rise even if conditions deteriorate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way are the GDP per capita and Aggregate Income similar?",
        "options": [
          "Both are calculated using population size",
          "Both exclude non‑market transactions",
          "Both solely focus on consumer spending",
          "Both indicate economic performance"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "GDP per capita (GDP/population) and aggregate income (total income earned in the economy) are both macro‑level indicators of economic performance, though they differ in construction and focus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 120 last year and is 126 this year, what is the inflation rate?",
        "options": [
          "6%",
          "5%",
          "3%",
          "4%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inflation rate = [(CPI_current – CPI_previous) / CPI_previous] × 100 = [(126 – 120) / 120] × 100 = 5%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The table below shows indices for real GDP and consumer prices in an economy over six quarters.\n\nDuring these six quarters the economy experienced",
        "image": "images/a1.png",
        "options": [
          "deflation and a recession",
          "disinflation when in recession",
          "disinflation when recovering from recession",
          "rising inflation when recovering from recession"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Real GDP falls in quarters 1‑3 (recession) and rises in quarters 4‑6 (recovery). The consumer price index rises throughout, but the rate of increase slows in quarters 4‑6—disinflation during recovery."
