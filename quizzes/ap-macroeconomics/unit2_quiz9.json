    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country’s CPI shows 5% inflation, but economists estimate that substitution bias accounts for 1.2 percentage points of this figure. What does this imply about the economy?",
        "options": [
          "Consumers are 1.2% worse off than the CPI suggests",
          "The central bank should raise interest rates by 5%",
          "The true cost of living increased by approximately 3.8%",
          "The economy grew 1.2% faster than official statistics show"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If substitution bias overstates inflation by 1.2 percentage points, the true increase in the cost of living is about 5% – 1.2% = 3.8%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country’s nominal GDP is $500 billion and the GDP deflator is 125, what is the country’s real GDP?",
        "options": [
          "$375 billion",
          "$400 billion",
          "$500 billion",
          "$625 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Real GDP = (Nominal GDP / GDP deflator) × 100 = ($500 billion / 125) × 100 = $400 billion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy experiences no change in its unemployment rate over a year, yet economic conditions have worsened. Which limitation of the unemployment rate best explains this paradox?",
        "options": [
          "It fails to account for underemployment",
          "It includes frictional unemployment as a negative factor",
          "It counts part‑time workers as unemployed",
          "It overestimates cyclical unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The unemployment rate counts only those actively seeking work. If workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force or accept part‑time jobs (underemployment), the rate may not rise even if conditions deteriorate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way are the GDP per capita and Aggregate Income similar?",
        "options": [
          "Both are calculated using population size",
          "Both exclude non‑market transactions",
          "Both solely focus on consumer spending",
          "Both indicate economic performance"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "GDP per capita (GDP/population) and aggregate income (total income earned in the economy) are both macro‑level indicators of economic performance, though they differ in construction and focus."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The following table shows the real GDP of an economy from 2012 to 2016.\nIf the figures were converted to index form with 2013 as the base year, what would be the value of the index (to the nearest whole number) in 2016?",
  "image": "images/a2.png",
  "options": [
    "124",
    "125",
    "126",
    "127"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Index = (Value in current year / Value in base year) × 100. With 2013 real GDP = £215bn and 2016 real GDP = £271bn, the index is (271 / 215) × 100 ≈ 126.05 → 126 when rounded."

      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The information below shows the changes in key economic indicators for a country over a period of one year.\n\nWhich one of the following can be concluded from the data?",
  "image": "images/a3.png",
  "options": [
    "External costs generated from economic activity have reduced the quality of life",
    "Real GDP per capita has fallen",
    "The distribution of income has become more unequal",
    "The standard of living of typical residents in the country has probably improved"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Real GDP growth (nominal 6% – inflation 4% ≈ 2%) exceeded population growth (1%), so real GDP per capita rose. The Gini coefficient fell 8%, indicating reduced inequality. Together, this suggests an improved standard of living for typical residents."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The table shows the Consumer Prices index for a country over a number of years. Which one of the following statements is correct?",
  "image": "images/a4.png",
  "options": [
    "A The country suffered disinflation in Year 5",
    "B The inflation rate was highest in Year 7",
    "C The only time the country suffered deflation was in Year 2",
    "D Real incomes fell between Year 1 and Year 7"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "From Year 4 to Year 5, the inflation rate fell from about 1.94% to 0.95%, which is disinflation (positive but lower inflation). Option B is incorrect because the highest inflation was in Year 3 (~5.10%). Option C is false because deflation also occurred in Year 6 (~ −1.89%). Option D cannot be concluded without data on nominal income changes."

      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A country has a Human Development Index of 0.91. This country is most likely to have",
  "options": [
    "A a high dependence on its primary sector.",
    "B a low level of life expectancy.",
    "C rapid population growth.",
    "D relatively low levels of illiteracy."
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "A high HDI (0.91) indicates advanced development in health, education, and income. Such countries typically have low illiteracy rates, high life expectancy, low population growth, and economies dominated by the tertiary (services) sector, not primary. Therefore, only option D is consistent."

      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "The table below contains index number data for an economy’s GDP, population size and its price level for the years 2005 and 2014. All three indices have 2005 for their base year. Using the data, the increase in real GDP per capita between 2005 and 2014 is approximately",
  "image": "images/a5.png",
  "options": [
    "A. 10%",
    "B. 20%",
    "C. 50%",
    "D. 100%"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Real GDP in 2014 = (GDP index 200)/(Price index 150) × 100 ≈ 133.33. Population index = 120. Real GDP per capita index = 133.33 / 120 × 100 ≈ 111.11. That's about an 11.1% increase from 2005's 100, so closest to 10%."

  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "If a country implements policies that significantly extend unemployment benefits during a recession, which labor market outcome is most likely in the short run?",
    "options": [
      "A Lower LFPR and potentially higher unemployment rate",
      "B Higher LFPR and potentially higher unemployment rate",
      "C Lower LFPR and definitely lower unemployment rate",
      "D Higher LFPR and definitely lower unemployment rate"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Extended unemployment benefits may increase labor force participation (LFPR) as more people seek work to qualify. However, they may also lead to longer job search, potentially raising the unemployment rate in the short run."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "During a period of unexpected inflation, which group is most likely to be adversely affected?",
    "options": [
      "A Borrowers, since the real cost of borrowing increases significantly.",
      "B Investors, because asset prices always decline during periods of inflation.",
      "C Firms, as higher inflation typically leads to reduced profit margins.",
      "D Fixed-income recipients, because their nominal incomes do not adjust quickly to rising prices."
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Fixed-income recipients (e.g., retirees on pensions) suffer because their nominal income is fixed, so rising prices reduce their real purchasing power during unexpected inflation."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "If consumer inflation measured by the CPI is 3% while the GDP deflator indicates an inflation rate of 2%, what is the most plausible explanation for this discrepancy?",
    "options": [
      "A Rising structural unemployment has skewed domestic production metrics.",
      "B Government spending has significantly decreased during the period.",
      "C Imported goods have experienced higher price increases than domestically produced goods.",
      "D Consumer saving rates have increased, affecting overall demand."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The CPI includes prices of imported goods, while the GDP deflator only includes domestically produced goods. Higher CPI inflation suggests import prices rose more than domestic prices."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Which of the following is a consequence of a positive output gap?",
    "options": [
      "A Increased inflationary pressure",
      "B Decreased unemployment",
      "C Stable economic growth",
      "D Lower interest rates"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A positive output gap occurs when actual GDP exceeds potential GDP, leading to overheating and increased inflationary pressure."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "An adverse weather event severely disrupts agricultural production in a region for one year. What are the expected short-run effects on the consumer price index (CPI) and the regional unemployment rate?",
    "options": [
      "A The CPI increases and the regional unemployment rate decreases.",
      "B The CPI decreases and the regional unemployment rate decreases.",
      "C The CPI increases and the regional unemployment rate increases.",
      "D The CPI decreases and the regional unemployment rate increases."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Supply shock in agriculture reduces food supply → food prices rise (CPI increases). Also, farm jobs are lost temporarily → unemployment rises in the short run."
  },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 120 last year and is 126 this year, what is the inflation rate?",
        "options": [
          "6%",
          "5%",
          "3%",
          "4%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inflation rate = [(CPI_current – CPI_previous) / CPI_previous] × 100 = [(126 – 120) / 120] × 100 = 5%."
      },
      {

          "deflation and a recession",
          "disinflation when in recession",
          "disinflation when recovering from recession",
          "rising inflation when recovering from recession"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Real GDP falls in quarters 1‑3 (recession) and rises in quarters 4‑6 (recovery). The consumer price index rises throughout, but the rate of increase slows in quarters 4‑6—disinflation during recovery."
