    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What strategic advantage does issuing bonds have for a business compared to seeking traditional bank loans?",
        "options": [
          "Expanding the company's shareholder base",
          "Eliminating required interest payments",
          "More flexible repayment terms",
          "Avoiding external credit evaluations"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Bonds often have longer maturities and fixed repayment schedules, providing more predictability and flexibility than bank loans, which may have variable rates and shorter terms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the dual impact of inflation on bondholders?",
        "options": [
          "It erodes purchasing power and may lead to higher interest rates reducing bond prices",
          "It has no significant effect on bonds",
          "It guarantees higher bond returns",
          "It decreases bond yield while increasing bond prices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inflation reduces the real value of fixed coupon payments. Also, if inflation prompts central banks to raise interest rates, bond prices fall, causing capital losses for existing bondholders."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might regulatory changes affecting banks influence the liquidity of stocks?",
        "options": [
          "Regulatory changes typically do not affect stock liquidity",
          "Regulations limit the ability to convert stocks to cash",
          "New regulations enhance short‑term volatility",
          "Increased regulation boosts stock liquidity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stricter banking regulations (e.g., higher capital requirements) can reduce market‑making activities and credit availability, potentially increasing short‑term volatility and lowering liquidity in equity markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does equity financing expose a company to external pressures unlike debt financing?",
        "options": [
          "Equity financing is devoid of interest charges",
          "Equity financing always reduces company value",
          "Debt financing does not involve repayments",
          "Shareholders in equity financing may influence company decisions"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Shareholders have voting rights and may push for changes in strategy, management, or dividends. Bondholders typically have no voting rights; their influence is limited to covenants and legal claims if the issuer defaults."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the potential for inflation influence the decision between choosing bonds versus stocks?",
        "options": [
          "Inflation affects stocks more adversely than bonds because stock prices are more volatile",
          "Paying down existing debt becomes more attractive than investing during inflationary periods",
          "Stocks inherently offer inflation‑proof value to investors",
          "Bonds lose purchasing power while stocks can outpace inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Inflation erodes the fixed payments from bonds, hurting real returns. Stocks represent claims on real assets and earnings, which may rise with inflation, offering better long‑term protection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a rapidly changing technological environment, why might stocks be more appealing than bonds?",
        "options": [
          "They can capture rapid growth in tech companies",
          "They remain completely insulated from technological disruptions",
          "They provide stable interest",
          "They offer guaranteed returns"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stocks represent ownership in companies, allowing investors to participate directly in high‑growth sectors like technology. Bonds provide fixed returns and do not benefit from equity‑like growth potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do macroeconomic conditions like government policy changes influence the bond market?",
        "options": [
          "They cause immediate price stability",
          "They lead to consistent market growth",
          "Bonds remain insulated from such changes",
          "They induce fluctuations in interest rates which affect bond attractiveness"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Fiscal and monetary policy shifts alter expectations about growth, inflation, and central‑bank interest rates, which directly affect bond yields and prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might an investor choose to diversify their portfolio with both bonds and stocks during economic uncertainty?",
        "options": [
          "To balance growth potential with steady income",
          "To maximize short‑term profits while minimizing regulatory compliance costs",
          "Only stocks provide market protection",
          "To specialize in high‑risk sectors only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diversification across asset classes (stocks for growth, bonds for income and stability) reduces overall portfolio risk and smooths returns during volatile periods."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a nominal interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "The lowest possible interest rate",
          "The advertised interest rate before inflation adjustment",
          "An interest rate based on past inflation",
          "An interest rate adjusted for inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The nominal interest rate is the stated or advertised rate of interest, not adjusted for inflation. It reflects the percentage increase in money value, not purchasing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is a real interest rate calculated?",
        "options": [
          "By subtracting nominal GDP from real GDP",
          "By adding inflation to the nominal interest rate",
          "By subtracting inflation from the nominal interest rate",
          "By doubling the nominal interest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Real interest rate ≈ Nominal interest rate – Inflation rate. It reflects the true increase in purchasing power from lending or saving."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a nominal interest rate not account for?",
        "options": [
          "Tax",
          "Principal",
          "Risk",
          "Inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The nominal rate does not account for inflation. To understand the true return or cost of borrowing, inflation must be subtracted to obtain the real interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the nominal interest rate is 5% and inflation is 2%, what is the real interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "3%",
          "5%",
          "7%",
          "2%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Real interest rate = Nominal rate – Inflation rate = 5% – 2% = 3%."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What has to happen to the nominal interest rate for the real interest rate to remain stable against rising inflation?",
  "options": [
    "It must stay the same",
    "It must decrease",
    "It must increase",
    "It must fluctuate randomly"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate – Inflation rate. If inflation rises and the real rate is to stay constant, the nominal interest rate must increase by the same amount as the increase in inflation."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What is the relationship between nominal GDP and real GDP similar to?",
  "options": [
    "Nominal and real stock prices",
    "Nominal and real exchange rates",
    "Nominal and real interest rates",
    "Nominal and real tax rates"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Nominal GDP is GDP measured at current prices, while real GDP is adjusted for inflation. Similarly, the nominal interest rate is the stated rate, while the real interest rate adjusts for inflation. Both pairs distinguish between values that include price‑level changes and those that exclude them to reflect real economic activity or true cost of borrowing."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which interest rate is more useful for predicting actual investment returns?",
  "options": [
    "Spot interest rate",
    "Real interest rate",
    "Prime rate",
    "Nominal interest rate"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The real interest rate (nominal rate minus inflation) reflects the true increase in purchasing power. For predicting actual investment returns in terms of what you can buy with the money later, the real rate is more meaningful than the nominal rate, which does not account for inflation."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If expected inflation is high, lenders are likely to do what with nominal interest rates?",
  "options": [
    "Eliminate them",
    "Raise them",
    "Keep them the same",
    "Lower them"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Lenders demand a higher nominal interest rate when they expect high inflation to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power when the loan is repaid. This ensures the real return (nominal rate minus inflation) remains acceptable."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What happens to the real interest rate if actual inflation is higher than expected?",
  "options": [
    "It increases",
    "It remains unchanged",
    "It becomes negative",
    "It decreases"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate (set based on expected inflation) – Actual inflation. If actual inflation is higher than expected, the subtraction is larger, so the real interest rate is lower than anticipated. It can even turn negative if inflation exceeds the nominal rate."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What component is added to the real interest rate to find the nominal interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "Fees",
          "Exchange rate",
          "Inflation",
          "Taxes"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Expected inflation (plus often a risk premium)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What term refers to the interest rate that reflects the true cost of borrowing?",
        "options": [
          "Prime interest rate",
          "Nominal interest rate",
          "Discount rate",
          "Real interest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The real interest rate adjusts the nominal rate for inflation, showing the actual increase in purchasing power that lenders receive and borrowers pay."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the nominal interest rate usually higher than the real interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "It is always based on the prime rate",
          "It does not consider inflation",
          "It is calculated quarterly",
          "It includes taxation rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The nominal rate includes an inflation premium to compensate lenders for expected loss of purchasing power. The real rate strips out inflation, so nominal ≥ real when inflation is positive."
