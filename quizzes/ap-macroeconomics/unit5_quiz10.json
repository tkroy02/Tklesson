      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mention the direct tax from the following –",
        "options": [
          "Corporation tax",
          "Excise duty",
          "Entertainment tax",
          "Service tax"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Corporation tax is a direct tax levied on the profits of companies, where the burden cannot be shifted to others."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these increases liabilities in the government budget?",
        "options": [
          "Direct taxes",
          "Borrowings",
          "Loan recovery",
          "Dividends from PSUs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Borrowings increase government liabilities (debt). Direct taxes and dividends are revenue receipts; loan recovery reduces assets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the government develops a tax and transfer payment policy that is aimed to minimize wealth and income inequality, this is regarded to as:",
        "options": [
          "Allocative function",
          "Distributive function",
          "Stabilization function",
          "Governance function"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The distributive (redistributive) function uses taxes and transfers to reduce inequality in income and wealth across society."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines the primary goal of the government's stabilization function?",
        "options": [
          "Redistributing income from the rich to the poor.",
          "Promoting full employment and price stability.",
          "Correcting market failures like externalities.",
          "Providing public goods like national defense."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The stabilization function aims to smooth the business cycle—reducing unemployment during recessions and controlling inflation during booms to achieve macroeconomic stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the government provides free COVID vaccination during a pandemic, this is associated with:",
        "options": [
          "Allocative function",
          "Distributive function",
          "Stabilization function",
          "Governance function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Providing public health services like free vaccinations corrects a market failure (positive externality) and allocates resources to socially beneficial goods—the allocative function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Recognition Lag' in the context of stabilization policy?",
        "options": [
          "The time it takes for Congress to pass a law.",
          "The time it takes for policymakers to realize an economic problem exists.",
          "The time it takes for a policy to actually change the GDP.",
          "The time it takes for the Central Bank to change interest rates."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Recognition lag is the delay between the onset of an economic problem (e.g., a recession) and policymakers recognizing that the problem exists, due to data collection and verification."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is considered an 'automatic stabilizer'?",
        "options": [
          "A new law passed by Congress to build a bridge.",
          "Changing the reserve requirement for banks.",
          "Progressive income taxes.",
          "A military spending increase."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Progressive income taxes automatically collect less revenue when incomes fall (and more when incomes rise), cushioning swings in disposable income without new legislation—an automatic stabilizer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the stabilization function address 'Stagflation' (high inflation + high unemployment)?",
        "options": [
          "By increasing spending to stop unemployment.",
          "By increasing taxes to stop inflation.",
          "It is difficult because stabilization tools for inflation often worsen unemployment.",
          "By doing nothing, as the market always fixes stagflation in one month."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stagflation poses a policy dilemma: contractionary policies to fight inflation raise unemployment, while expansionary policies to fight unemployment worsen inflation. Supply‑side measures or targeted policies may be needed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government's goal is to stabilize the economy by reducing a $100 billion inflationary gap and the MPC is 0.75, what should they do?",
        "options": [
          "Decrease taxes by $25 billion.",
          "Decrease spending by $25 billion.",
          "Increase taxes by $25 billion.",
          "Decrease spending by $100 billion."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Spending multiplier = 1/(1 – 0.75) = 4. To reduce AD by $100 billion, ΔG = –$100B / 4 = –$25 billion (a spending cut of $25B)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fiscal policy is a concept associated with the overarching academic concept:",
        "options": [
          "Public Finance",
          "Government Finance",
          "Monetary Policy",
          "Central Authority"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fiscal policy—government spending, taxation, and borrowing—falls under the broader academic field of Public Finance, which studies how the government raises and spends resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a period of stagnant economic growth, the government decides to fund a massive nationwide high‑speed rail project. They fund this by implementing a new 'Luxury Goods Tax' on private jets and high‑end jewelry. This policy is primarily an example of which two functions working simultaneously?",
        "options": [
          "Stabilization and Allocative",
          "Distributive and Stabilization",
          "Allocative and Distributive",
          "Governance and Allocative"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The rail project allocates resources to infrastructure (allocative function). The luxury tax targets high‑income groups, redistributing income (distributive function). Together they represent allocative and distributive functions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for a product X is inelastic. The government decides to increase the excise tax on product X. Which of the following is likely INCORRECT?",
        "options": [
          "Product X may be a demerit good",
          "Product X may be a Giffen good",
          "The incidence of tax falls on the producer",
          "The incidence of tax falls on the consumer"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With inelastic demand, consumers bear most of the tax burden; sellers can pass the tax forward through higher prices. Saying 'the incidence falls on the producer' is incorrect—it falls primarily on consumers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The government of a country currently in a recessionary gap of $400 billion is considering two different taxes to fund a stimulus project. The MPC is 0.8.<br><br>Option A: A tax on Luxury Yachts (Highly Elastic demand).<br><br>Option B: A tax on Home Heating Fuel (Highly Inelastic demand).<br><br>The government needs to raise exactly $100 billion in tax revenue to keep the budget balanced while spending that same $100 billion on infrastructure. Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the impact of these choices?",
        "options": [
          "Option A will result in higher tax revenue than Option B because yachts are more expensive.",
          "The Balanced Budget Multiplier will fail to close the recessionary gap because the tax incidence on heating fuel (Option B) reduces the disposable income of consumers more than Option A.",
          "The net effect of the spending and tax (regardless of the option) will increase GDP by exactly $100 billion, but Option A will create a larger Deadweight Loss than Option B.",
          "Option B is the better choice for the Distributive function because it targets a necessity that everyone uses."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The balanced‑budget multiplier is 1, so ΔGDP = $100 billion regardless of which tax is used. However, taxing a good with highly elastic demand (yachts) causes a large quantity reduction, creating a larger deadweight loss than taxing an inelastic good (heating fuel)."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "When a person does not pay their taxes, this is known as:",
  "options": [
    "Tax Avoidance",
    "Tax Evasion",
    "Tax Shifting",
    "Tax Arbitrage"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Tax evasion is the illegal act of deliberately avoiding paying taxes by hiding income, inflating deductions, or falsifying records. It contrasts with tax avoidance, which uses legal methods to minimize tax liability."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A company hires a team of accountants to legally restructure its operations and take advantage of overseas tax havens, thereby lowering its tax bill. This is an example of:",
  "options": [
    "Tax Evasion",
    "Tax Avoidance",
    "Tax Shifting",
    "Tax Arbitrage"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Tax avoidance involves using legal methods—such as deductions, credits, and legal loopholes—to minimize tax liability. It is permitted by law, unlike tax evasion, which is illegal concealment or misrepresentation."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All macroeconomic policies primarily aim at controlling:",
        "options": [
          "the quantity of money in circulation",
          "how and when people pay their taxes",
          "inflation and deflation",
          "budget deficit and budget surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Macroeconomic policies—both fiscal and monetary—ultimately aim to stabilize the overall economy, which means managing inflation (price stability) and avoiding deflation, along with promoting full employment and sustainable growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the basis of both the tax multiplier and the government spending multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "Interest rate",
          "Total consumption",
          "Marginal propensity to consume",
          "Marginal output"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both multipliers depend on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). The spending multiplier = 1/(1 – MPC); the tax multiplier = –MPC/(1 – MPC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do automatic stabilizers not entirely prevent economic downturns, even though they mitigate their severity?",
        "options": [
          "They focus solely on tax adjustments rather than spending measures",
          "They cannot address structural economic problems",
          "They require additional legislative action to become effective",
          "They only address supply-side issues"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers smooth cyclical fluctuations by dampening swings in disposable income, but they do not correct deep structural issues (e.g., technological change, skill mismatches) that can cause recessions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do automatic stabilizers contribute to long‑term economic stability if they cannot fully prevent recessions?",
        "options": [
          "By smoothing out fluctuations within the business cycle",
          "By directly controlling interest rates",
          "By ensuring permanent full employment",
          "By increasing technological advancements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers reduce the amplitude of booms and busts, making the business cycle less volatile. This helps maintain consumer and investor confidence, supporting steadier long‑term growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way might progressive taxes indirectly suppress hyperinflation during an economic boom?",
        "options": [
          "By reducing excess liquidity in the economy",
          "By causing a sharp decrease in unemployment",
          "By influencing central banks' interest rate decisions",
          "By increasing import tariffs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Progressive taxes automatically take a larger share of rising incomes during a boom, reducing disposable income and aggregate demand. This helps drain excess purchasing power (liquidity) that could otherwise fuel demand‑pull inflation."
