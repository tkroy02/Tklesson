    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the trade-off illustrated by the short-run Phillips curve?",
        "options": [
          "Lower inflation leads to higher unemployment",
          "Economic growth increases unemployment",
          "Fiscal policy directly impacts interest rates",
          "Higher inflation reduces real GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The short-run Phillips curve (SRPC) depicts an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. This trade-off implies that, in the short run, achieving lower inflation typically comes at the cost of higher unemployment (moving down and right on the SRPC), while achieving lower unemployment typically comes at the cost of higher inflation (moving up and left on the SRPC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the SRAS shifts left, causing higher inflation, what immediate impact does this have on the SRPC?",
        "options": [
          "The economy enters a boom",
          "The SRPC shifts left, indicating lower inflation",
          "The SRPC shifts right, indicating higher inflation",
          "The SRPC remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A leftward shift of the SRAS (e.g., from an adverse supply shock like an oil price increase) causes stagflation: higher inflation and higher unemployment simultaneously. On the Phillips curve diagram, a worse combination of inflation and unemployment for any given expected inflation is represented by a rightward shift of the SRPC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a decrease in aggregate demand affect unemployment and inflation on the Phillips Curve?",
        "options": [
          "Unemployment increases, and inflation increases",
          "Unemployment decreases, and inflation increases",
          "Unemployment increases, and inflation decreases",
          "Unemployment decreases, and inflation decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A decrease in Aggregate Demand (a leftward shift of the AD curve) leads to a recessionary gap. In the AD-AS model, this results in lower output (higher unemployment) and a lower price level (lower inflation). On the Phillips curve, this is represented by a movement down and to the right along a stable SRPC: lower inflation and higher unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the natural rate of unemployment and the long-run equilibrium in the economy?",
        "options": [
          "The natural rate leads to permanent inflation",
          "The natural rate causes hyperinflation",
          "Long-run equilibrium occurs at the natural rate of unemployment",
          "Long-run equilibrium is achieved only through fiscal policy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the long run, the economy self-corrects to potential output, where cyclical unemployment is zero. The unemployment rate at potential output is the natural rate (NRU). Therefore, long-run macroeconomic equilibrium, whether in the AD-AS model or the Phillips Curve model, occurs when the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A shift to a higher natural rate of unemployment would cause what effect on the LRPC?",
        "options": [
          "It remains unchanged",
          "It becomes horizontal",
          "It shifts to the left",
          "It shifts to the right"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Long-Run Phillips Curve (LRPC) is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment (NRU). If the NRU increases (due to factors like higher structural unemployment), the vertical LRPC shifts to the right to reflect this new, higher long-run unemployment rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy experiences stagflation, what happens to the Phillips Curve?",
        "options": [
          "The SRPC shifts left",
          "The LRPC shifts left",
          "The LRPC shifts right",
          "The SRPC shifts right"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Stagflation—simultaneously high inflation and high unemployment—cannot be represented by a point on an existing downward-sloping SRPC. It represents a worse trade-off. This is shown by a rightward (or upward) shift of the entire SRPC, indicating that for any given unemployment rate, inflation is now higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the implication of a vertical LRPC for policy makers aiming to reduce unemployment?",
        "options": [
          "Policy cannot affect the long-run rate of unemployment",
          "Both inflation and unemployment decrease",
          "Inflation increases, but unemployment is unaffected",
          "Policy can reduce unemployment without affecting inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertical LRPC illustrates the long-run neutrality of inflation with respect to unemployment. It implies that attempts to use demand-side policies (fiscal or monetary) to push unemployment below its natural rate will only succeed temporarily and will ultimately result in higher inflation, with unemployment returning to the NRU. The natural rate is determined by supply-side factors, not demand management."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do supply shocks impact the relationship depicted by the SRPC?",
        "options": [
          "They have no effect",
          "They cause movements along the SRPC",
          "They only affect the LRPC",
          "They shift the SRPC"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Supply shocks change the underlying inflation-unemployment trade-off in the short run. An adverse supply shock (like an oil price spike) worsens the trade-off, shifting the SRPC to the right. A favorable supply shock (like a technology boom) improves the trade-off, shifting the SRPC to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scenarios would lead to a movement along the SRPC?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in aggregate demand",
          "A decrease in aggregate supply",
          "A shift in expectations of inflation",
          "A fiscal policy change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A movement along a stable SRPC is caused by changes in Aggregate Demand. A decrease in AD (e.g., from contractionary policy) causes a movement down and to the right along the SRPC (lower inflation, higher unemployment). An increase in AD causes a movement up and to the left (higher inflation, lower unemployment). The other options cause shifts of the SRPC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to inflation and unemployment in the short run if aggregate demand increases suddenly?",
        "options": [
          "Inflation and unemployment both decrease",
          "Inflation decreases, and unemployment increases",
          "Inflation increases, and unemployment decreases",
          "Inflation and unemployment both increase"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A sudden increase in Aggregate Demand (e.g., from expansionary policy) creates an inflationary gap. Firms increase output to meet higher demand, hiring more workers and reducing unemployment. The increased demand also bids up prices, leading to higher inflation. This is a movement up and to the left along the SRPC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under which condition does the Phillips Curve suggest policymakers can achieve lower unemployment?",
        "options": [
          "By accepting a higher rate of inflation",
          "By increasing the natural rate of unemployment",
          "By maintaining constant aggregate demand",
          "By reducing government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The short-run Phillips curve shows a trade-off. To achieve a point with lower unemployment (moving left on the curve), the economy must move to a point with higher inflation (moving up on the curve). This suggests policymakers can temporarily reduce unemployment below the natural rate if they are willing to accept higher inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which curve's position is altered by changes in expectations of future inflation?",
        "options": [
          "Short-run Phillips Curve",
          "Long-run Phillips Curve",
          "Long-run Aggregate Supply Curve",
          "Aggregate Demand Curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The position of the Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC) is determined by the expected inflation rate. If expected inflation rises, workers demand higher wages, and firms set higher prices, leading to higher actual inflation for any given unemployment rate. This shifts the SRPC upward (or rightward)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does the natural rate of unemployment play in the Phillips Curve model?",
        "options": [
          "It is irrelevant in the long run",
          "It dictates fiscal policy direction",
          "It sets the level at which the LRPC is vertical",
          "It determines the slope of the SRPC"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The natural rate of unemployment (NRU) is the cornerstone of the long-run Phillips curve. The LRPC is a vertical line drawn at the NRU, indicating that in the long run, the unemployment rate will gravitate toward this rate regardless of the inflation rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding long-run equilibrium in the context of the Phillips Curve?",
        "options": [
          "It occurs at the intersection of the LRPC and SRPC",
          "It occurs when inflation is zero",
          "It is achieved through short-run inflation adjustments",
          "It occurs when GDP is at its highest"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Long-run equilibrium on a Phillips Curve diagram is the point where the Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC) intersects the vertical Long-Run Phillips Curve (LRPC). At this intersection, actual inflation equals expected inflation, and the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During which economic condition does inflation rise and unemployment fall according to the Phillips Curve?",
        "options": [
          "Recessionary gap",
          "Inflationary gap",
          "Stagflation",
          "Increased aggregate supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An inflationary gap exists when actual output exceeds potential output. In this condition, the economy is overheating: high demand for goods bids up prices (rising inflation), and high demand for labor reduces unemployment. This corresponds to a point on the upper-left portion of the SRPC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would cause the LRPC to shift in an economy?",
        "options": [
          "Changes in monetary policy",
          "Temporary supply shocks",
          "A steady increase in inflation expectations",
          "A change in natural rate of unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The LRPC is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment (NRU). Therefore, it shifts only if the NRU itself changes. This can happen due to supply-side factors like changes in labor market institutions (minimum wage, unionization), demographics, or skills mismatches (structural unemployment)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What result would a contractionary fiscal policy have on the Phillips Curve?",
        "options": [
          "Shifting the LRPC right",
          "Movement up the SRPC",
          "Increased inflation",
          "Movement down the SRPC"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy (higher taxes, lower spending) decreases Aggregate Demand. This reduces inflationary pressures and output, leading to lower inflation and higher unemployment in the short run. On a stable SRPC, this is represented by a movement down and to the right along the curve."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, what effect do increased expectations of inflation have?",
        "options": [
          "They reduce natural rate of unemployment",
          "They adjust the position of the SRPC",
          "They result in a higher LRPC",
          "They increase unemployment permanently"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, changes in inflation expectations do not change the natural rate of unemployment (the LRPC is fixed at the NRU). However, they do change the position of the SRPC. If expectations rise, the SRPC shifts upward; the economy ends up on a new, higher SRPC that intersects the same LRPC at a higher inflation rate."

          "Zero unemployment",
          "Inflationary gaps",
          "Recessionary gaps"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The LRPC marks the natural rate. Points to the right of the LRPC indicate an unemployment rate higher than the natural rate, meaning cyclical unemployment is positive. This signifies a recessionary gap where actual output is below potential output."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A leftward SRAS shift (adverse supply shock) causes stagflation—higher prices (inflation) and lower output (higher unemployment). This combination of higher inflation and higher unemployment for any given expected inflation rate is shown as a rightward shift of the SRPC."
