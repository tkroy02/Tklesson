    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a period of significant inflation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the relationship between nominal and real GDP?",
        "options": [
          "A Nominal GDP will overstate actual economic growth",
          "B Real and nominal GDP will move proportionally",
          "C Nominal GDP measures production more accurately",
          "D Real GDP will always be higher than nominal GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During inflation, nominal GDP rises due to higher prices, not necessarily more output. Real GDP removes price changes, so nominal GDP overstates true economic growth when inflation is high."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country A has a natural rate of unemployment of 4%, while Country B has a natural rate of 6%. Both countries are currently producing at their full-employment output levels. Which statement is most accurate?",
        "options": [
          "A Country B is experiencing a more severe recession",
          "B Country A has a higher potential GDP",
          "C Country B likely has greater structural inefficiencies",
          "D Country A must have higher cyclical unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A higher natural rate of unemployment suggests more structural or frictional unemployment, likely due to labor market inefficiencies, skills mismatches, or institutional factors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the GDP deflator help economists account for the impact of inflation when comparing economic growth across different years?",
        "options": [
          "A It subtracts the inflation rate from nominal GDP to yield a more accurate growth measure",
          "B It multiplies nominal GDP by the current year’s price index to account for inflation",
          "C It adjusts nominal GDP to remove the effects of price level changes, allowing for comparison of output in real terms",
          "D It averages the price levels of multiple years to smooth out inflationary effects"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The GDP deflator is a price index that converts nominal GDP into real GDP by removing the effects of price level changes, enabling comparisons of actual output over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of deflation on the real value of debt?",
        "options": [
          "A Real value of debt remains unchanged",
          "B Real value of debt increases",
          "C Real value of debt becomes negative",
          "D Real value of debt decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deflation increases the real value of debt because the money used to repay loans is worth more, making it harder for borrowers to repay in real terms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is potential output related to business cycles?",
        "options": [
          "A It falls during expansions",
          "B It rises during recessions",
          "C It is unaffected by business cycles",
          "D It fluctuates with GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Potential output is the level of GDP attainable when all resources are fully employed. It grows slowly over time due to technology, capital, and labor force growth, and is not affected by short-term business cycles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between CPI and GDP deflator?",
        "options": [
          "A CPI includes only services, while GDP deflator includes goods and services",
          "B CPI is used for deflating nominal GDP, while GDP deflator is used for inflating real GDP",
          "C CPI measures global inflation, while GDP deflator measures local inflation",
          "D CPI measures inflation of consumer goods, while GDP deflator measures inflation of all domestic products"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "CPI tracks price changes in a fixed basket of consumer goods and services. GDP deflator reflects price changes for all domestically produced goods and services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group is NOT considered part of the labor force?",
        "options": [
          "A Full-time workers",
          "B Part-time workers",
          "C Unemployed job seekers",
          "D Retired individuals"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The labor force consists of those employed or actively seeking work. Retired individuals, students, and discouraged workers are not in the labor force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of unemployment is most closely associated with the normal time period it takes for workers to search for new jobs during transitions?",
        "options": [
          "A Structural unemployment",
          "B Seasonal unemployment",
          "C Frictional unemployment",
          "D Cyclical unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Frictional unemployment arises from normal job search processes, such as when workers move between jobs, enter the workforce, or re-enter after absence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a consequence of unexpected inflation on savings?",
        "options": [
          "A Stable purchasing power",
          "B Decreased real value",
          "C Increased nominal value",
          "D Higher interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unexpected inflation erodes the real value of savings if nominal interest rates do not fully compensate, reducing purchasing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following statements about investment spending as a component of GDP are true except:",
        "options": [
          "A Investment spending contributes to the future productive capacity of the economy.",
          "B Investment spending includes the purchase of used capital goods because they boost current productivity.",
          "C New capital machinery, new construction, and changes in inventories are components of investment spending.",
          "D Investment spending represents current expenditures intended to increase future output."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Investment spending in GDP only includes purchases of new capital goods, not used ones, because used goods were counted in GDP when originally produced."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In a two-good economy with apples and oranges, the base year quantities are 10 apples and 5 oranges. Base year prices are \\$2 per apple and \\$3 per orange. If current year prices are \\$3 per apple and \\$4 per orange, what is the current year CPI?",
  "options": [
    "A 142.9",
    "B 135",
    "C 150",
    "D 70"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "CPI = (Current-year basket cost / Base-year basket cost) × 100. Base-year basket cost = (10×2) + (5×3) = 35. Current-year basket cost = (10×3) + (5×4) = 50. CPI = (50/35)×100 ≈ 142.9."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "An economy produced 100 units at \\$10 each in 2020 and 120 units at \\$12 each in 2021. If 2020 is the base year, what is the real GDP for 2021?",
  "options": [
    "A $1,200",
    "B $1,000",
    "C $1,100",
    "D $1,440"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Real GDP for 2021 = (Quantity in 2021) × (Price in base year 2020) = 120 units × \\$10 = \\$1,200."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "During unexpected inflation, which group is least likely to suffer losses in real purchasing power?",
  "options": [
    "A Holders of non-indexed financial assets",
    "B Borrowers with fixed nominal debt",
    "C Recipients of fixed pension payments",
    "D Fixed-interest bond investors"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Borrowers with fixed nominal debt repay loans with money that is worth less in real terms during unexpected inflation, preserving or even increasing their purchasing power relative to lenders and fixed-income recipients."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following is NOT included in the CPI basket?",
  "options": [
    "A Military equipment",
    "B Transportation services",
    "C Housing costs",
    "D Food and beverages"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "CPI tracks prices of goods and services purchased by typical urban households. Military equipment is a government purchase, not a consumer item, and is excluded from the CPI basket."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "When the government increases its spending (G), how does it affect aggregate spending and GDP?",
  "options": [
    "A Both decrease",
    "B Both increase",
    "C Only GDP increases",
    "D No effect on either"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Government spending is a direct part of aggregate expenditure (C+I+G+NX). Increasing G raises total spending in the economy, which directly increases GDP in the short run, assuming no offsetting changes in other components."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What happens to the unemployment rate if discouraged workers re-enter the labor force?",
  "options": [
    "A It becomes zero",
    "B It will decrease",
    "C It may increase",
    "D It remains unchanged"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "When discouraged workers re-enter, they are counted as unemployed and in the labor force. This can increase the unemployment rate initially, since they add to the unemployed before finding jobs."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If an economy’s real GDP has been declining for two consecutive quarters, but leading economic indicators are beginning to show positive signs, which turning point in the business cycle is the economy most likely approaching?",
  "options": [
    "A Trough",
    "B Midpoint of contraction",
    "C Peak",
    "D Midpoint of expansion"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "A trough is the lowest point in the business cycle, marking the end of a contraction and the beginning of an expansion. Leading indicators turning positive while GDP is still declining suggest the trough is near."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If a country has 150 million people in the labor force and 15 million unemployed, what is the unemployment rate?",
  "options": [
    "A 15%",
    "B 5%",
    "C 10%",
    "D 20%"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Unemployment rate = (Unemployed / Labor force) × 100 = (15 million / 150 million) × 100 = 10%."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A country’s labor force is 100 million, unemployment rate 8%. Next month, 2 million discouraged workers join the labor force and begin job hunting, but only 500,000 find jobs. What is the new unemployment rate?",
  "options": [
    "A 9.3%",
    "B 8.5%",
    "C 10.2%",
    "D 7.8%"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Initially: unemployed = 8 million, employed = 92 million. New: 2 million enter labor force, all initially unemployed. Total unemployed = 8 + 2 − 0.5 = 9.5 million. New labor force = 100 + 2 = 102 million. Unemployment rate = 9.5 / 102 ≈ 9.31%."

          "A Frictional unemployment",
          "B Seasonal unemployment",
          "C Cyclical unemployment",
          "D Structural unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Voluntarily leaving a job to search for a better one is a form of frictional unemployment—short-term joblessness due to normal labor market transitions."
