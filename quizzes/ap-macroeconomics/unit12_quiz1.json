    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the most important determinant of long-run economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Government spending",
          "Productivity growth",
          "Consumer confidence",
          "Stock market performance",
          "Trade deficits"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Productivity growth—output per worker or output per hour worked—is the fundamental driver of long-run economic growth and rising standards of living. While government spending and consumer confidence affect short-run fluctuations, sustained productivity improvements through technological progress, human capital development, and capital accumulation are what enable long-term growth."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in which of the following would most likely increase a nation's potential GDP?",
        "options": [
          "Cyclical unemployment",
          "The natural rate of unemployment",
          "The labor force participation rate",
          "Frictional unemployment",
          "Structural unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Potential GDP is determined by the economy's productive capacity at full employment. Increasing the labor force participation rate (the percentage of working-age population that is either working or seeking work) directly increases the size of the labor force, thereby increasing the economy's potential output. The other options either represent unemployment (which reduces output) or an increase in unemployment rates (which indicates underutilization of resources)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would shift a country's production possibilities curve outward?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the unemployment rate",
          "An increase in consumer spending",
          "A technological improvement in manufacturing",
          "A decrease in inflation",
          "An increase in government borrowing"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A production possibilities curve (PPC) represents an economy's maximum possible output given its resources and technology. Technological improvements increase productive efficiency, allowing more output from the same inputs, which shifts the entire PPC outward. While decreasing unemployment moves the economy closer to the PPC (from inside to on the curve), it does not shift the curve itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the rule of 70, if a country's real GDP is growing at 2% per year, how many years will it take for real GDP to double?",
        "options": [
          "20 years",
          "25 years",
          "35 years",
          "50 years",
          "70 years"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The rule of 70 states that the number of years it takes for a variable to double = 70 ÷ annual growth rate (in percentage). For a 2% growth rate: 70 ÷ 2 = 35 years. This demonstrates the power of compound growth—even small differences in growth rates lead to large differences in living standards over long periods."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following investments would have the greatest impact on long-term economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Building luxury condominiums",
          "Investing in research and development",
          "Increasing military spending",
          "Subsidizing fossil fuel consumption",
          "Funding temporary unemployment benefits"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Investment in research and development (R&D) drives technological progress, which is a key source of productivity growth and long-term economic expansion. While the other options may have short-term economic effects, R&D creates new knowledge, products, and processes that permanently increase an economy's productive capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Human capital refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The value of a country's natural resources",
          "The skills and knowledge possessed by workers",
          "The amount of physical machinery in an economy",
          "Government investments in infrastructure",
          "Corporate financial assets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Human capital comprises the skills, education, training, and health of workers. Investment in human capital (through education, job training, healthcare) increases worker productivity, which is essential for economic growth. It differs from physical capital (machinery, buildings) and natural resources, though all contribute to production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Solow growth model, which of the following leads to sustained long-run economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Increasing the savings rate",
          "Technological progress",
          "Population growth",
          "Government deficit spending",
          "Trade surpluses"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the Solow model, increases in the savings rate or population growth only lead to temporary growth spurts until the economy reaches its new steady state. Only technological progress (which increases productivity) can cause sustained long-run growth by continuously shifting the production function upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would increase labor productivity?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the minimum wage",
          "Longer working hours without additional pay",
          "Increased investment in capital equipment",
          "Higher corporate tax rates",
          "Reduced international trade"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Labor productivity (output per worker) increases when workers have more or better capital equipment to work with. This is known as capital deepening. While longer hours might increase total output, productivity is measured per unit of labor input. Better equipment allows each worker to produce more in the same amount of time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The convergence hypothesis suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "All economies will eventually have zero growth",
          "Poor countries will grow faster than rich countries and catch up",
          "Rich countries will continue to pull away from poor countries",
          "Growth rates are determined solely by natural resources",
          "Technological progress benefits all countries equally"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The convergence hypothesis (or catch-up effect) posits that poorer countries tend to grow faster than richer ones because they can adopt existing technologies from developed countries rather than inventing new ones. This allows them to catch up to the technological frontier, assuming they have similar savings rates, education levels, and institutions."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an investment in physical capital?",
        "options": [
          "Paying for employee training programs",
          "Building a new factory",
          "Funding university research",
          "Providing vaccinations to children",
          "Developing management software"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Physical capital refers to manufactured goods used in production—factories, machinery, tools, infrastructure. Building a new factory directly increases the stock of physical capital. The other options represent investments in human capital (training, healthcare) or technology (research, software development)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An outward shift of the long-run aggregate supply curve indicates:",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in potential GDP",
          "An increase in potential GDP",
          "Higher inflation in the short run",
          "Lower unemployment in the short run",
          "A recessionary gap"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve represents potential GDP—the economy's maximum sustainable output. An outward (rightward) shift of LRAS indicates an increase in potential GDP, meaning the economy can produce more goods and services at full employment. This results from factors like technological progress, capital accumulation, or growth in the labor force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would NOT contribute to economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Improved educational attainment",
          "Discovery of new natural resources",
          "Increased research and development",
          "Rising cyclical unemployment",
          "Investment in infrastructure"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Rising cyclical unemployment indicates the economy is operating below its potential (a recessionary gap), not growing. Cyclical unemployment results from insufficient aggregate demand in the short run. The other options all increase the economy's productive capacity: education improves human capital, natural resources are inputs to production, R&D drives innovation, and infrastructure is physical capital."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country A has a higher growth rate than Country B, but Country B has higher initial GDP per capita, which country will experience faster improvement in living standards?",
        "options": [
          "Country A",
          "Country B",
          "They will improve at the same rate",
          "Cannot be determined from the information",
          "It depends on inflation rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Assuming the growth rates refer to real GDP per capita, Country A's higher growth rate means its living standards (measured by GDP per capita) are increasing at a faster percentage rate. Even though Country B starts from a higher base, the power of compound growth means Country A will eventually catch up if it maintains a higher growth rate (convergence hypothesis)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which institution is most important for promoting long-run economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "A powerful military",
          "A large government bureaucracy",
          "Well-defined property rights",
          "Strict immigration controls",
          "High tariff barriers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Well-defined and enforced property rights are fundamental institutions that encourage investment, innovation, and economic activity. When people can securely own property and benefit from their investments, they are more likely to save, invest, and take entrepreneurial risks. This creates incentives for capital accumulation and technological progress, driving long-term growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country experiencing diminishing returns to capital will increase its growth rate by:",
        "options": [
          "Investing more in the same type of capital",
          "Improving technology",
          "Increasing the population growth rate",
          "Reducing taxes on capital gains",
          "Importing more consumer goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing returns to capital occurs when adding more physical capital (while holding labor and technology constant) yields smaller and smaller increases in output. To overcome this and sustain growth, the economy needs technological progress that improves how capital and labor are combined, shifting the entire production function upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best measures improvements in a nation's standard of living over time?",
        "options": [
          "Growth in nominal GDP",
          "Growth in real GDP per capita",
          "Increase in the price level",
          "Growth in government spending",
          "Decrease in the unemployment rate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Real GDP per capita (real GDP divided by population) adjusts for both inflation and population changes, making it the best standard measure of average material living standards. Nominal GDP includes inflation, government spending doesn't measure individual welfare, and unemployment rates don't account for income levels or non-market activities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Creative destruction refers to:",
        "options": [
          "Government regulation of failing industries",
          "The process where innovation makes old technologies obsolete",
          "Environmental damage caused by economic growth",
          "The business cycle of expansion and contraction",
          "International competition eliminating domestic jobs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter, creative destruction describes how technological progress and innovation continuously revolutionize the economic structure from within, destroying old industries, products, and jobs while creating new ones. This process is essential for long-term economic growth but can be disruptive in the short run."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would increase an economy's production possibilities in the future?",
        "options": [
          "Consuming all current output",
          "Investing in new capital goods",
          "Maintaining current consumption levels",
          "Importing more than exporting",
          "Increasing government transfer payments"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Investing in new capital goods (factories, machinery, infrastructure) increases the future stock of physical capital, which expands the economy's productive capacity. This requires sacrificing current consumption (saving) to fund investment. The other options either maintain or reduce future productive capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Total factor productivity measures:",
        "options": [
          "Output per worker",
          "The efficiency with which all inputs are used",
          "Capital per worker",
          "The growth rate of technology alone",
          "Labor force participation rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total factor productivity (TFP) measures how efficiently an economy uses all its inputs (labor, capital, materials) to produce output. It captures the effects of technological progress, organizational improvements, and other factors that increase output without increasing measured inputs. It's sometimes called the 'Solow residual' in growth accounting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In growth accounting, which of the following contributes to economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Growth in the labor force",
          "Increases in capital stock",
          "Technological progress",
          "All of the above",
          "Only A and B"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Growth accounting decomposes economic growth into contributions from: 1) increases in labor inputs (quantity and quality), 2) increases in capital stock, and 3) total factor productivity growth (mainly technological progress). All three factors contribute to economic growth, with technological progress often being the most important for long-term sustained growth."
