      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in capital goods investment interact with labor productivity and LRAS shifts?",
        "options": [
          "It causes immediate consumption boosts throughout the economy",
          "It decreases labor productivity and efficiency",
          "It increases labor productivity and potential output",
          "It affects only consumer prices in the short run"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "More capital (machinery, technology) raises output per worker (productivity), increasing potential GDP and shifting LRAS right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what ways can a decrease in educational system quality affect the LRAS?",
        "options": [
          "Temporarily influences consumer spending patterns and market demand",
          "No effect on LRAS",
          "Shifts LRAS left, reducing potential output",
          "Shifts LRAS to the right due to lower educational costs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Lower education quality reduces human capital, lowering productivity and potential output — LRAS shifts left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might long‑term investment in research and development impact national economic potential?",
        "options": [
          "By shifting LRAS left due to increased government spending on R&D programs",
          "By boosting potential through innovation",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "R&D leads to technological advances and higher productivity, raising potential GDP — shifting LRAS right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does an inflationary gap pose a risk to long‑term economic stability?",
        "options": [
          "Leads to immediate increased employment opportunities across all sectors",
          "Creates persistent inflation and erodes purchasing power",
          "Aligns supply exactly with demand",
          "Causes deflationary pressure in the long term"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An inflationary gap (output > potential) pushes prices up; if sustained, it can lead to accelerating inflation and economic instability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What long‑term trend might you expect if an economy frequently encounters inflationary gaps?",

          "Currency devaluation and reduced consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Repeated inflationary gaps can lead to high inflation, currency depreciation, and eventually reduced real consumption and investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider an economy experiencing a recessionary gap. Why might this scenario lead to lower consumer confidence?",
        "options": [
          "Due to increased government spending on infrastructure projects",
          "As a result of higher disposable income from tax cuts",
          "Rising unemployment and falling incomes",
          "Because of increasing wages"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Recessionary gaps mean high unemployment and declining incomes, which reduce consumer confidence and spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the AD‑AS model, why is it critical to understand the concept of output gaps?",

          "To forecast regional economic trends"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Output gaps signal whether the economy is overheating or underperforming, helping policymakers design appropriate stabilization policies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might persistent recessionary gaps affect long‑term economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "By encouraging greater foreign investment and capital inflows",
          "By eroding workforce skills and potential output",
          "By accelerating technological innovation and development",
          "By stabilizing real estate markets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Long recessions can lead to skill atrophy, lower investment, and reduced productive capacity (hysteresis), shifting LRAS left over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is achieving long‑run equilibrium in the AD‑AS model desirable for a sustainable economy?",
        "options": [
          "It suggests potential output is matched by current output",
          "It indicates equilibrium in micro‑markets globally",
          "It ensures fiscal surpluses",
          "It demonstrates trade imbalances are eliminated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Long‑run equilibrium occurs when AD intersects SRAS on LRAS — actual GDP equals potential GDP, with stable inflation and unemployment at the natural rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a surplus in GDP illustrate shifts in the equilibrium in the AD‑AS model?",
        "options": [
          "By indicating higher output than demand",
          "Via decreased wage rates",
          "Through increased unemployment rates",
          "By showing a perfect balance in supply and demand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If actual GDP > potential GDP (inflationary gap), there is excess demand, leading to upward pressure on prices — an unsustainable surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scenarios best explains how an economy can self‑correct an inflationary gap?",
        "options": [
          "Wages are artificially lowered by government intervention",
          "Government increases spending on infrastructure and social programs",
          "Foreign competition reduces significantly",
          "Higher prices reduce consumer demand"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Self‑correction: inflationary gap → low unemployment pushes wages up → SRAS shifts left → output returns to potential, price level rises further. The initial higher prices also reduce purchasing power, lowering demand over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the concept of full employment relate to inflationary and recessionary gaps?",
        "options": [
          "It represents a state where unemployment equals zero percent",
          "It prioritizes government monetary policies over fiscal approaches",
          "It ensures constant wage rates across all sectors",
          "It serves as a benchmark for identifying GDP gaps"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Full employment (natural rate of unemployment) corresponds to potential GDP. Gaps are deviations of actual GDP from potential GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might an economy experiencing an inflationary gap see a temporary boost in disposable incomes?",
        "options": [
          "As a result of increased competition",
          "Due to reduced spending on imports",
          "Due to low unemployment and rising wage rates",
          "Because of increased taxation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In an inflationary gap, low unemployment gives workers bargaining power, raising wages and disposable income temporarily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are potential long‑term fiscal consequences of unaddressed recessionary gaps in an economy?",
        "options": [
          "Economic expansion to new industries",
          "Increased individual savings",
          "Shrinking export markets",
          "Persistent budget deficits and increased national debt"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Recessionary gaps reduce tax revenue and increase automatic stabilizer spending (e.g., unemployment benefits), worsening budget deficits and raising public debt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the long‑run equilibrium position reinforce the idea of sustainable economic growth?",
        "options": [
          "By equating short‑term losses to long‑term gains",
          "By balancing imports with exports",
          "By ensuring productive capacity matches demand",
          "By reducing all forms of economic friction"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Sustainable growth occurs when increases in potential output (LRAS shifts right) are matched by AD growth, maintaining stable prices and full employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does consumer purchasing power play in shifting from an inflationary gap back to equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "By stabilizing as new markets open",
          "By reducing due to rising prices, leading to decreased demand",
          "By increasing imports significantly",
          "By boosting capital market investments"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In an inflationary gap, rising prices erode real incomes, reducing consumption demand (movement along AD) and helping return output to potential."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Why might achieving equilibrium in the AD-AS model not guarantee long-term economic prosperity?",
  "options": [
    "Global trade factors are not considered",
    "All types of economic growth become permanently stabilized",
    "Technological changes cannot be incorporated into the model",
    "It only addresses short-run fluctuations"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "The AD-AS model describes short-run and long-run equilibrium at a point in time. Long-term prosperity depends on sustained growth in potential output (LRAS shifts right), which requires factors like technological progress, capital accumulation, and human capital development — not just reaching a static equilibrium."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What impact does an inflationary gap have on consumer purchasing power?",
  "options": [
    "Decreases purchasing power",
    "Balances purchasing power",
    "Has no effect on purchasing power",
    "Increases purchasing power"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "An inflationary gap occurs when actual output exceeds potential output, driving up the price level. Higher prices erode the real value of money, reducing purchasing power unless wages rise at the same rate, which often lags in the short run."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important for policymakers to closely monitor the intersection point of SRAS and AD in relation to the LRAS?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure budget adjustments are distributed proportionally across all economic sectors",
          "To maintain favorable export surpluses in international markets",
          "To identify output and employment imbalances",
          "To guarantee compliance with international trade regulations and agreements"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The intersection relative to LRAS shows whether the economy is in an inflationary or recessionary gap — crucial for timely policy responses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an inflationary gap reflect on the overall health of an economy in the short term and the long term if unaddressed?",
        "options": [
          "Eliminates unemployment permanently and creates lasting job security",
          "Ensures continued economic prosperity",
          "Initial gains lead to eventual stagnation",
          "Rectifies itself without intervention"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Short‑term: low unemployment, high output. Long‑term if unaddressed: rising inflation, possible wage‑price spiral, eventual slowdown or recession."
