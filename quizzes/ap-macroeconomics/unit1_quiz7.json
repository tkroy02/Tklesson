    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is considered 'Capital' in the economic sense?",
        "options": [
          "A hundred‑dollar bill in a cash register.",
          "The shares of stock in a tech company.",
          "Unprocessed iron ore in the ground.",
          "A robot used on an automotive assembly line."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Capital refers to human‑made tools, machinery, and equipment used to produce other goods and services. Money, financial assets, and raw materials are not capital in the factor‑of‑production sense."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point located inside the production possibility curve indicates that:",
        "options": [
          "The combination of goods is currently unattainable.",
          "Resources are being underutilized or used inefficiently.",
          "There is a high rate of economic growth.",
          "The economy is producing at maximum efficiency."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A point inside the PPC represents an attainable but inefficient outcome—resources are either unemployed or underutilized. The economy could produce more of at least one good without sacrificing the other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic growth can be illustrated on a PPC diagram by:",
        "options": [
          "A shift of the entire curve inward.",
          "A movement along the curve from one point to another.",
          "A shift of the entire curve outward.",
          "A movement from a point inside the curve to a point on the curve."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economic growth expands an economy’s productive capacity, shifting the PPC outward—more of both goods can be produced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause a PPC to shift inward?",
        "options": [
          "The discovery of new oil reserves.",
          "An increase in the unemployment rate.",
          "A natural disaster that destroys factories and infrastructure.",
          "A change in consumer preferences from one good to another."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An inward shift represents a decrease in productive capacity, caused by loss of resources (e.g., disaster, war, depletion) or decline in technology."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A straight‑line PPC indicates that:",
        "options": [
          "The economy is in a deep recession.",
          "Resources are not scarce.",
          "There is no opportunity cost.",
          "Opportunity cost is constant as production increases."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A linear PPC means resources are equally suited to producing either good, so opportunity cost remains constant as production shifts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'Labor' resource?",
        "options": [
          "The mental and physical effort of a surgeon.",
          "A seam of coal waiting to be mined.",
          "The profit earned by a business owner.",
          "The computer used by a graphic designer."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Labor is the human effort—physical and mental—used in production. Coal is land, profit is return to entrepreneurship, a computer is capital."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Productive efficiency is achieved when:",
        "options": [
          "The most desired goods by society are being produced.",
          "An economy is producing on its PPC.",
          "The government allocates all resources.",
          "There is zero unemployment in the economy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Productive efficiency means producing the maximum output from given resources—any point on the PPC is productively efficient. Allocative efficiency (A) is about producing what society values most."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'For Whom' question in economics is most directly concerned with:",
        "options": [
          "The choice between using machines or workers.",
          "The decision to produce more capital goods than consumer goods.",
          "The distribution of income and wealth.",
          "The location of a new factory."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The 'For Whom' question asks how output is distributed among members of society—determined by income distribution, wealth, and social choices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would likely cause an outward shift in the PPC for an economy producing computers and cars?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in the minimum wage.",
          "A decision by the public to buy more cars and fewer computers.",
          "A decrease in the price of computers.",
          "An improvement in computer‑manufacturing technology."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Technological improvement increases productive capacity, shifting the PPC outward. Price changes and demand shifts move along the curve or affect allocation, not capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy is producing at a point on its PPC, it can only produce more of one good if:",
        "options": [
          "It improves its distribution system.",
          "It discovers more resources.",
          "It produces less of the other good.",
          "The government mandates higher production."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "On the PPC, resources are fully employed; producing more of one good requires reallocating resources from the other—a trade‑off."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a 'Normative' economic statement?",
        "options": [
          "Higher interest rates lead to lower levels of investment.",
          "The unemployment rate is currently 5%.",
          "The government should increase the minimum wage to help the poor.",
          "An increase in the price of a good usually leads to a decrease in quantity demanded."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Normative statements express value judgments or policy prescriptions ('should'). The other options are positive statements describing relationships or facts without judgment."
