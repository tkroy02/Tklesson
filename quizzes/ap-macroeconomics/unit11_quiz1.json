      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the exchange rate changes from 100 Japanese yen per U.S. dollar to 110 yen per dollar, what has happened to the value of the dollar?",
        "options": [
          "The dollar has appreciated by 10%",
          "The dollar has depreciated by 10%",
          "The dollar has appreciated by 9.1%",
          "The dollar has depreciated by 9.1%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the exchange rate increases from ¥100/$ to ¥110/$, each dollar buys more yen, so the dollar has appreciated. The percentage appreciation = (New rate - Old rate)/Old rate × 100% = (110 - 100)/100 × 100% = 10%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a flexible exchange rate system, if the demand for a country's currency increases due to higher foreign investment, what happens to the exchange rate and the country's exports?",
        "options": [
          "Exchange rate appreciates; exports become more expensive for foreigners",
          "Exchange rate depreciates; exports become cheaper for foreigners",
          "Exchange rate appreciates; exports become cheaper for foreigners",
          "Exchange rate depreciates; exports become more expensive for foreigners"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased foreign investment raises demand for the domestic currency in forex markets, causing appreciation. A stronger currency makes domestic goods more expensive when priced in foreign currency, reducing export competitiveness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following transactions would create demand for U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market?",

          "Payment of dividends by a U.S. company to its British shareholders"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A German company buying U.S. Treasury bonds needs dollars to make the purchase, creating demand for dollars in the forex market."
      },

        "options": [
          "Buy foreign currency and sell domestic currency",
          "Sell foreign currency and buy domestic currency",
          "Allow the currency to appreciate freely",
          "Implement contractionary monetary policy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To maintain a fixed exchange rate during a balance of payments surplus (excess demand for domestic currency), the central bank must sell domestic currency and buy foreign currency to prevent appreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The real exchange rate measures:",
        "options": [
          "The nominal exchange rate adjusted for inflation differences between countries",
          "The market-determined exchange rate without government intervention",
          "The exchange rate that equalizes purchasing power across countries",
          "The long-run equilibrium exchange rate based on fundamentals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Real exchange rate = Nominal exchange rate × (Domestic price level/Foreign price level). It measures the relative price of domestic vs. foreign goods, accounting for inflation differences."

          "Dollar depreciates as capital flows to Europe",
          "Dollar appreciates as U.S. exports become more competitive",
          "Dollar depreciates as U.S. imports become cheaper"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive, causing capital inflows from Europe. Investors sell euros to buy dollars, increasing demand for dollars and causing dollar appreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory suggests that in the long run, exchange rates should adjust to:",
        "options": [
          "Equalize nominal interest rates across countries",
          "Equalize real interest rates across countries",
          "Equalize the prices of identical baskets of goods",
          "Maintain balanced current accounts"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "PPP states that exchange rates should adjust so that a given basket of goods costs the same in different countries when expressed in a common currency."

          "Political instability in Mexico"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased U.S. demand for Mexican exports means Americans need pesos to pay for Mexican goods, increasing demand for pesos in forex markets → peso appreciates."

          "Official reserve transactions exactly offsetting the deficit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By balance of payments accounting: Current Account + Capital Account = 0. A current account deficit (negative) must be financed by a capital account surplus (positive) — net capital inflows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The J-curve effect describes:",

          "The long-term trend of increasing trade volumes with development"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The J-curve occurs because quantities of imports and exports adjust slowly to price changes, while values change immediately. After depreciation, trade balance initially worsens then improves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Bank of Japan intervenes to weaken the yen by selling yen and buying dollars in forex markets, this is an example of:",

          "A floating exchange rate with no intervention"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Selling yen for dollars increases the supply of yen in forex markets (depreciating yen) and increases Japan's domestic money supply as yen sold enter circulation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, according to the monetary approach to exchange rates, an increase in a country's money supply growth rate will cause:",

          "Currency appreciation and lower inflation",
          "Currency depreciation and higher inflation",

          "Improved trade balance through cheaper exports"
        ],
        "answer": "B",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the nominal exchange rate is £0.75/$ and the price level ratio (UK/US) is 0.8, what is the real exchange rate?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Currency crises often follow prolonged defense of an overvalued fixed rate. Central banks spend reserves buying domestic currency until reserves run out, forcing devaluation."
