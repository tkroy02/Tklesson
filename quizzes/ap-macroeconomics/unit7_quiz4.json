    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a decrease in the reserve requirement affect the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "It stabilizes the money supply",
          "It increases the money supply",
          "It decreases the money supply",
          "It has no effect on the money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A lower reserve requirement means banks are required to hold a smaller fraction of deposits as reserves. This converts some required reserves into excess reserves, which banks can then lend out. This lending creates new deposits, expanding the money supply through the money multiplier process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might be a consequence of the Federal Reserve engaging in expansionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Decrease in nominal interest rates",
          "Increase in nominal interest rates",
          "Decrease in inflation",
          "Increase in government debt"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expansionary monetary policy (e.g., buying bonds, lowering reserve requirements, lowering the discount rate) increases the money supply. In the money market, an increased supply of money leads to a lower equilibrium nominal interest rate, assuming money demand is unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve wants to combat inflation, which monetary policy might it employ?",
        "options": [
          "Selling government securities",
          "Reducing reserve requirements",
          "Buying government securities",
          "Lowering the discount rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To combat inflation (an inflationary gap), the Fed uses contractionary monetary policy. Selling government securities (an open market sale) drains reserves from the banking system, reduces the money supply, and puts upward pressure on interest rates, which helps to reduce aggregate demand and inflationary pressures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What relationship exists between real GDP and the demand for money?",
        "options": [
          "Direct relationship",
          "Inverse relationship",
          "Exponential relationship",
          "No relationship"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There is a direct (positive) relationship. A higher real GDP means more transactions are occurring in the economy (more goods and services are being bought and sold). To facilitate these increased transactions, firms and households demand to hold larger money balances for transactions purposes, shifting the money demand curve to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During periods of high transaction costs, what is likely to happen to the demand for money?",
        "options": [
          "It stabilizes",
          "It decreases",
          "It increases",
          "It becomes unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher transaction costs (e.g., difficulty converting assets to cash) make it more expensive to access funds when needed. To avoid these costs, people and businesses will choose to hold larger money balances for precautionary and transactions purposes, increasing the overall demand for money."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what situation does the opportunity cost of holding money increase?",
        "options": [
          "When there is a deflation",
          "When nominal interest rates decrease",
          "When nominal interest rates increase",
          "When inflation rates stabilize"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The opportunity cost of holding money (which pays little or no interest) is the foregone interest from holding interest-bearing assets like bonds. When nominal interest rates increase, the return on these alternative assets rises, making it more costly to hold onto cash. Therefore, the opportunity cost increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in real GDP likely affect the equilibrium nominal interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "Decreases it",
          "Leaves it unchanged",
          "Reverses it",
          "Increases it"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An increase in real GDP raises the transactions demand for money, shifting the money demand curve to the right. If the money supply is held constant by the central bank, this increase in demand for money leads to a higher equilibrium nominal interest rate in the money market."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve decreases reserve requirements, what effect does this have on the equilibrium nominal interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "Stabilizes the interest rate",
          "Eliminates the interest rate",
          "Raises the interest rate",
          "Lowers the interest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A decrease in reserve requirements is expansionary. It increases the money supply (or its growth rate). In the money market, an increase in the money supply, with demand unchanged, leads to a lower equilibrium nominal interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the buying of bonds in open market operations affect the nominal interest rate in the short term?",
        "options": [
          "Increases the interest rate",
          "Stabilizes the interest rate",
          "Neutral to the interest rate",
          "Decreases the interest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When the Fed buys bonds (an open market purchase), it pays for them by crediting the reserve accounts of banks. This injects new reserves, increasing the money supply. The increased supply of money lowers the price of money, which is the nominal interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might a central bank decide to sell government bonds?",
        "options": [
          "To increase inflation",
          "To lower real GDP",
          "To decrease inflation",
          "To stabilize government debt"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Selling bonds is a contractionary open market operation. It reduces bank reserves and the money supply, which tends to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates dampen investment and consumption spending, reducing aggregate demand. This is done to cool down an overheating economy and decrease inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If transaction costs decrease, what is a probable impact on the money market equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "Have no impact",
          "Result in a surplus of money",
          "Decrease demand for money",
          "Increase demand for money"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Lower transaction costs (e.g., easier access to funds from non-money assets) reduce the need to hold large precautionary balances of money. This decreases the overall demand for money, shifting the money demand curve to the left. With a constant money supply, this would lead to a lower equilibrium interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When investment demand increases, what is the expected change in the nominal interest rate if all other factors remain constant?",
        "options": [
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Fluctuate unpredictably",
          "Decrease",
          "Increase"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An increase in investment demand typically means businesses want to borrow more funds to finance new projects. This increases the demand for loanable funds. In the loanable funds market, increased demand with a constant supply leads to a higher real interest rate. In the money market, this activity can also signal stronger economic growth, which may increase money demand, putting upward pressure on nominal rates. The direct link is clearer in the loanable funds model: more demand for borrowing raises the price of borrowing (the interest rate)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which tool allows central banks to specifically influence short-term interest rates by providing or absorbing liquidity?",
        "options": [
          "Government borrowing",
          "Open market operations",
          "Income tax restructuring",
          "Exchange rate adjustments"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Open market operations are the Fed's primary tool for daily management of the money supply and short-term interest rates. By buying securities (providing liquidity), they push rates down. By selling securities (absorbing liquidity), they push rates up. They directly target the federal funds rate this way."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might cause a leftward shift in the money demand curve?",
        "options": [
          "Tight monetary policy",
          "Decrease in GDP",
          "Increase in transaction costs",
          "Increase in price levels"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A leftward shift in money demand means people want to hold less money at each interest rate. A decrease in real GDP reduces the number and value of transactions, decreasing the transactions demand for money. This would shift the entire money demand curve to the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following will cause a decrease in the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing nominal interest rates",
          "Increasing the discount rate",
          "Buying government securities",
          "Reducing reserve requirements"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increasing the discount rate makes it more expensive for banks to borrow reserves from the Fed. This discourages banks from borrowing to meet reserve requirements, potentially leading them to reduce lending to avoid borrowing. Reduced lending contracts the money supply. (Note: The discount rate is a less direct tool; open market sales are the primary way to decrease the money supply, but this is the correct choice among the options)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a likely result of an increased inflation expectation with no change in the real interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "No change in GDP",
          "Reduced nominal interest rate",
          "Increased nominal interest rate",
          "Decrease in investment demand"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "According to the Fisher effect, the nominal interest rate (i) adjusts to incorporate expected inflation (π^e) and the real interest rate (r): i ≈ r + π^e. If inflation expectations rise and the real rate is constant, lenders will demand, and borrowers will be willing to pay, a higher nominal rate to compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the Federal Reserve increases the discount rate, what effect does it have on the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Doubles",
          "Increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An increase in the discount rate makes it more costly for banks to borrow reserves from the Fed. Banks may respond by being more cautious with their lending to avoid needing to borrow at the higher rate. This can lead to a reduction in loans made and a consequent contraction of the money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the expected inflation rate increases, what is the effect on nominal interest rates, assuming real rates remain constant?",
        "options": [
          "Rise",
          "Become negative",
          "Unchanged",
          "Fall"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the Fisher effect. The formula Nominal Interest Rate = Real Interest Rate + Expected Inflation Rate shows a direct relationship. If expected inflation rises and the real rate is held constant, the nominal rate must rise to compensate lenders for the expected decline in the future purchasing power of repaid dollars."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of the central bank when it sells securities as part of its monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "To increase money supply",
          "To decrease money supply",
          "To balance trade deficits",
          "To set currency exchange rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Selling securities is a contractionary open market operation. When the central bank sells securities, it receives payment from banks, which reduces the reserves in the banking system. This reduction in reserves leads to a decrease in the money supply as banks have less capacity to create loans."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect does a falling nominal interest rate have on consumption and investment behaviors?",
        "options": [
          "No effect",
          "Increases investment but decreases consumption",
          "Increases both",
          "Decreases both"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Lower nominal interest rates (which typically imply lower real rates in the short run) reduce the cost of borrowing for big-ticket items (like cars and houses), encouraging consumption. They also lower the cost of capital for businesses, making new projects more profitable and stimulating investment spending. This increase in both Consumption (C) and Investment (I) is how lower rates boost Aggregate Demand (AD)."
