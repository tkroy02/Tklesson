        "question": "Assume that an economy was initially in long-run equilibrium but then experiences a change in economic conditions. Point K in the graph shown here represents the current state of an economy. Which of the following best describes the current state of this economy?",
        "image": "images/a11.png",
        "options": [
          "An economy producing on its production possibilities curve",
          "An economy that is producing beyond its production possibilities curve",
          "An economy in long-run equilibrium",
          "An economy experiencing an inflationary gap due to a negative short-run aggregate supply shock",
          "An economy experiencing a recessionary gap due to a negative aggregate demand shock"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Point K is located to the right of the Long-Run Phillips Curve (LRPC), indicating that the current unemployment rate is higher than the natural rate. This defines a recessionary gap. Furthermore, the economy's position on the Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC) with lower inflation and higher unemployment is characteristic of a negative aggregate demand shock, which causes a movement down and to the right along the SRPC."

        "question": "In the graph of the Phillips curve below, an economy moved from point 1 to point 2 to point 3. Which of the following would be the most likely reason for the movement from point 2 to point 3 shown in this graph?",
        "image": "images/a12.png",
        "options": [
          "An increase in aggregate demand",
          "A change in the natural rate of unemployment",
          "A decrease in short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)",
          "An increase in short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)",
          "A decrease in aggregate demand (AD)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The movement from point 2 to point 3 represents a shift of the entire Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC) to the right. This occurs when both inflation and unemployment increase simultaneously, a condition known as stagflation. In the AD/AS model, stagflation is caused by a decrease in Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS), typically due to factors like an oil price shock, increased production costs, or negative supply shocks. This is distinct from movements along the SRPC, which are caused by changes in Aggregate Demand (AD)."

        "question": "In the graph of the Phillips curve shown here, an economy moved from point 1 to point 2 to point 3. Which of the following would cause the movement from point 2 to point 3 shown in this graph?",
        "image": "images/a13.png",
        "options": [
          "Higher expected inflation",
          "Cheaper labor",
          "A lower natural rate of unemployment",
          "Cheaper natural resources",
          "Expansionary monetary policy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The movement from point 2 to point 3 represents a rightward shift of the entire Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC), from SRPC₁ to SRPC₂. This occurs when inflation expectations rise. After an initial period of lower unemployment and higher inflation (point 2), workers and firms adjust their expectations. Workers demand higher wages to compensate for expected future inflation, and firms raise prices accordingly. This causes the SRPC to shift upward/rightward, returning the economy to the natural rate of unemployment (LRPC) but at a permanently higher inflation rate (point 3). This illustrates the natural rate hypothesis: in the long run, there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment."

        "question": "In the graph of the Phillips curve shown here, an economy moved from point 1 to point 2 to point 3. Which of the following would best represent the movement from point 2 to point 3 shown in the graph?",
        "image": "images/a14.png",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in aggregate demand (AD)",
          "An increase in aggregate demand (AD)",
          "An increase in short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)",
          "A decrease in short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)",
          "An increase in the natural rate of unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The movement from point 2 to point 3 represents a leftward shift of the entire Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC). This occurs when both inflation and unemployment decrease simultaneously, which is characteristic of a favorable supply shock. In the AD/AS model, this is caused by an increase in Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS). Factors that could cause this include technological improvements, decreases in input prices (like cheaper oil), increased productivity, or deregulation that lowers production costs. This is the opposite of stagflation (rightward SRPC shift) and represents an improvement in the economy's trade-off between inflation and unemployment."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following results from stagflation?",
        "options": [
          "Unemployment decreases",
          "The price level decreases",
          "The aggregate supply curve shifts to the right",
          "The Phillips curve shifts to the right",
          "Real GDP increases"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Stagflation is characterized by high inflation and high unemployment simultaneously. On the Phillips Curve, this is represented by a rightward shift of the entire Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC), as the economy experiences worse outcomes for both inflation and unemployment at any given point. In the AD/AS model, stagflation is caused by a leftward shift of the SRAS curve."

        "question": "A fixed output level in the long run at full-employment output corresponds with which of the following shapes of the long-run Phillips curve?",
        "options": [
          "Horizontal",
          "Convex to the origin",
          "Concave to the origin",
          "Vertical",
          "Linear with a slope of 1"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Long-Run Phillips Curve (LRPC) is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment. According to the natural rate hypothesis, in the long run, there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The economy always returns to the natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate, so the LRPC is vertical, showing that unemployment is fixed at the natural rate in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If prices are expected to rise more slowly in the future,",
        "options": [
          "the Phillips curve will shift to the right",
          "the actual rate of inflation will increase",
          "the actual inflation rate will remain steady unless supply shocks set in",
          "the government will carry out contractionary fiscal policy to prevent this occurrence",
          "these expectations will become reality"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "According to adaptive expectations theory, inflation expectations become self-fulfilling prophecies. If people expect lower future inflation, they will adjust their behavior accordingly—workers will accept lower wage increases, firms will raise prices more slowly—and these actions will cause actual inflation to fall, making the expectations become reality."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run Phillips curve seemed to break down once again in the 1990s. A possible explanation for this breakdown is",
        "options": [
          "an increase in inflation expectations.",
          "an increase in labor productivity.",
          "a surge in oil prices.",
          "none of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "During the 1990s, the U.S. experienced low unemployment and low inflation simultaneously, violating the traditional Phillips Curve trade-off. This 'breakdown' can be explained by an increase in labor productivity due to technological advances (the information technology revolution). Higher productivity increases aggregate supply, allowing the economy to grow with less inflationary pressure, effectively shifting the SRPC leftward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A negative aggregate supply shock will result in which of the following in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in the price level and a decrease in the unemployment rate",
          "A decrease in the price level and an increase in the unemployment rate",
          "A decrease in both the price level and real output",
          "An increase in both the price level and real output",
          "An increase in both the price level and the unemployment rate"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "A negative aggregate supply shock (leftward shift of SRAS) causes stagflation: both the price level (inflation) increases and real output decreases. Since lower output typically means higher unemployment (Okun's Law), this results in higher inflation and higher unemployment simultaneously—the classic definition of stagflation."

        "question": "An increase in the purchases of newly constructed houses will result in which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Aggregate demand will decrease as a result of a decrease in the price level.",
          "Aggregate demand will increase as a result of an increase in investment spending.",
          "Aggregate demand will increase as a result of an increase in exports.",
          "Aggregate demand will not change, since consumer spending has not changed.",
          "Aggregate demand will not change, since investment spending has not changed."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Purchases of newly constructed houses are classified as residential investment (a component of Investment, I, in the GDP formula C+I+G+Xn). An increase in investment spending directly increases aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a reduction in the money supply will cause",
        "options": [
          "a rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve",
          "a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve",
          "a rightward shift in the aggregate supply curve",
          "a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve",
          "a movement along the aggregate demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A reduction in the money supply is contractionary monetary policy. This decreases the amount of money available for spending, which reduces aggregate demand. In the AD/AS model, this causes a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve, leading to lower price levels and lower real output in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in which of the following will lead to lower inflation and lower unemployment?",
        "options": [
          "Exports",
          "Aggregate demand",
          "Labor productivity",
          "Government Spending",
          "The international value of domestic currency"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An increase in labor productivity represents a positive supply shock. This shifts the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve to the right, increasing output and employment while decreasing price levels. On the Phillips Curve, this causes a leftward shift of the SRPC, showing lower inflation and lower unemployment simultaneously."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best explains how an economy could simultaneously experience high inflation and high unemployment?",
        "options": [
          "The government increases spending without increasing taxes",
          "The government increases taxes without increasing spending",
          "Inflationary expectations decline",

          "Negative supply shocks cause factor prices to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "High inflation and high unemployment together is stagflation. This occurs when there is a negative supply shock—such as a sharp increase in the price of key inputs like oil—that causes production costs to rise. This shifts the SRAS curve leftward, decreasing output (increasing unemployment) while increasing price levels (inflation)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Phillips curve, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "Unemployment decreases with an increase in inflation.",
          "The natural rate of unemployment is independent of inflation",
          "Unemployment increases with an increase in inflation.",
          "Increased automation leads to lower levels of frictional unemployment in the long run."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC) shows an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment: as inflation increases, unemployment decreases, and vice versa. This represents the short-run trade-off that policymakers face. Option B describes the Long-Run Phillips Curve (LRPC), which is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment."

          "An increase in the amount of money will lead to a proportional increase in prices"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Quantity Theory of Money, expressed as M×V = P×Y, suggests that in the long run, with velocity (V) stable and output (Y) at potential GDP, an increase in the money supply (M) will lead to a proportional increase in the price level (P), causing inflation."

          "Equivalent to real GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Velocity of money (V) is defined as the average number of times a unit of currency is spent in a given time period (typically a year). It measures how quickly money circulates through the economy. Mathematically, V = (P×Y)/M, where P is price level, Y is real output, and M is money supply."

          "There will be a movement to the left along a Phillips Curve"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An open market purchase of bonds is expansionary monetary policy that increases the money supply. This increases aggregate demand, leading to higher inflation and lower unemployment in the short run. On the Phillips Curve, this causes a movement up and to the left along the existing SRPC (from right to left)."

          "Aggregate demand to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This describes a balanced budget contraction: both government spending (G) and taxes decrease by equal amounts. The decrease in G directly reduces AD, while the decrease in taxes increases disposable income and consumption (C), increasing AD. If the balanced budget multiplier is 1, these effects exactly offset each other, leaving aggregate demand unchanged."

        "explanation": "The Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC) depicts an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment: when inflation is high, unemployment tends to be low, and vice versa. This trade-off exists in the short run due to sticky wages and prices, but disappears in the long run (vertical LRPC)."

Additionally, increased investment adds to the capital stock, which enhances the economy's productive capacity. This represents a positive supply shock that increases both short-run and long-run aggregate supply. The outcome is increased AD, SRAS, and LRAS."
