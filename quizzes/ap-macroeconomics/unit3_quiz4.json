      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy is in long-run equilibrium. If there is a significant increase in the price of imported intermediate goods used in production, which turning point or state will the economy likely experience in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "A period of rapid expansion",
          "Full employment with stable prices",
          "Demand-pull inflation",
          "Stagflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher input costs shift SRAS left, raising prices and lowering output — stagflation (inflation + unemployment)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause a movement upward along the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve rather than a shift of the curve?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in government defense spending",
          "An improvement in consumer expectations about future income",
          "An increase in the general price level",
          "A decrease in the real interest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A change in the price level causes movement along the AD curve. The other options shift the AD curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the nominal wages in an economy are 'sticky' in the short run, what happens to the real wage and firm profitability when the price level increases unexpectedly?",
        "options": [
          "Real wages fall and profitability increases.",
          "Both real wages and profitability remain unchanged.",
          "Real wages rise and profitability increases.",
          "Real wages fall and profitability decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With sticky nominal wages, higher prices reduce real wages, lowering labor costs and raising profitability in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A massive improvement in agricultural technology increases the yield of crops nationwide. How does this affect the AD-AS model in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "The AD curve shifts to the left.",
          "The SRAS curve shifts left due to oversupply.",
          "Only the price level decreases with no change in output.",
          "The LRAS curve shifts to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Technology improvements increase potential output, shifting LRAS right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a recessionary gap, the self-correction mechanism relies on which of the following adjustments in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "Nominal wages falling, which shifts SRAS to the right.",
          "LRAS shifting to the left to meet the lower output level.",
          "The government increasing taxes to balance the budget.",
          "Prices rising, which shifts AD to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Self-correction in a recession: unemployment pushes nominal wages down, lowering costs, shifting SRAS right until output returns to potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Foreign Purchases Effect' (or Net Export Effect) that contributes to the slope of the AD curve?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the price level increases the real value of wealth, boosting consumption.",
          "As the price level falls, interest rates rise, making foreign investment more attractive.",
          "As the domestic price level rises, domestic goods become relatively more expensive than foreign goods, causing net exports to fall.",
          "Higher prices lead to higher nominal wages, which reduces the demand for foreign labor."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Foreign purchases effect: higher domestic prices reduce exports and increase imports (X−M falls), lowering quantity of real GDP demanded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8. If the government increases spending by $10 billion, what is the maximum possible shift in the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve, assuming no crowding out?",
        "options": [
          "$50 billion",
          "$12.5 billion",
          "$40 billion",
          "$8 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spending multiplier = 1/(1−MPC) = 1/(0.2) = 5. AD shift = 5 × $10 billion = $50 billion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the AD-AS model, what is the immediate effect of an increase in the expected future price level?",
        "options": [
          "There is a movement downward along the SRAS curve.",
          "The LRAS curve shifts to the right.",
          "The AD curve shifts to the left.",
          "The SRAS curve shifts to the left."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "If firms and workers expect higher future prices, they build them into wage and price contracts, raising costs now — SRAS shifts left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy is in a long-run equilibrium. If there is a sudden and sharp decrease in the stock market wealth of households, what is the most likely short-run impact on the price level and real GDP?",
        "options": [
          "Price Level: Decrease; Real GDP: Decrease",
          "Price Level: Increase; Real GDP: Increase",
          "Price Level: Increase; Real GDP: Decrease",
          "Price Level: Decrease; Real GDP: Increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lower wealth reduces consumption (C), shifting AD left: price level and real GDP both fall in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best characterizes the 'Long Run' in macroeconomics?",
        "options": [
          "A period in which all prices and wages are fully flexible and have adjusted to economic shocks.",
          "A period in which the Aggregate Demand curve is vertical.",
          "A period where government intervention is most effective at shifting output.",
          "A period of exactly five to ten years."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Long run: all wages and prices are flexible; the economy is at potential output; only LRAS matters for output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy is operating at an output level beyond its potential GDP (inflationary gap), what is the most likely 'self-correction' that will occur over time?",
        "options": [
          "Wages will rise, shifting the SRAS curve to the left.",
          "The government will decrease interest rates to cool down the economy.",
          "Consumer spending will increase, shifting the AD curve further right.",
          "The price level will fall as firms compete for fewer customers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an inflationary gap, low unemployment pushes wages up, raising costs — SRAS shifts left until output returns to potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the value of the domestic currency (appreciation) will most likely lead to which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "A rightward shift of the Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve.",
          "An increase in the domestic price level.",
          "A leftward shift of the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve.",
          "A rightward shift of the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper — net exports fall, shifting AD left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scenarios would lead to an increase in the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)?",
        "options": [
          "A temporary reduction in the price of electricity.",
          "A permanent increase in the level of human capital through better education.",
          "A decrease in the corporate tax rate that only affects current year profits.",
          "An increase in the money supply by the central bank."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "LRAS increases with factors that raise potential output: more labor, capital, or better technology/education."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy is in equilibrium at the intersection of AD and SRAS, but to the left of the LRAS curve, the economy is experiencing:",
        "options": [
          "A supply-side boom and falling prices.",
          "A recessionary gap and high unemployment.",
          "Long-run equilibrium and the natural rate of unemployment.",
          "An inflationary gap and low unemployment."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium output < potential output = recessionary gap, with cyclical unemployment above the natural rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Interest Rate Effect' suggests that the AD curve is downward sloping because:",
        "options": [
          "A higher price level makes domestic goods more attractive than foreign ones.",
          "The government reduces interest rates to offset the impact of inflation.",
          "A lower price level reduces the demand for money, lowering interest rates and increasing investment.",
          "Higher interest rates make it cheaper for firms to borrow and expand."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Interest rate effect: lower price level → lower money demand → lower interest rates → higher investment (I) and consumption (C)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would shift the SRAS curve to the right but have no effect on the LRAS curve?",
        "options": [
          "A temporary decrease in the price of oil.",
          "An increase in the size of the labor force.",
          "A permanent reduction in business regulations.",
          "The discovery of a new, massive gold mine."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A temporary input price drop (e.g., oil) lowers short‑run costs (SRAS right) but does not change potential output (LRAS unchanged)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the AD-AS model, 'Demand-Pull Inflation' is best illustrated by:",
        "options": [
          "A leftward shift of the AD curve during a recession.",
          "A leftward shift of the SRAS curve due to higher oil prices.",
          "A rightward shift of the AD curve along an upward-sloping SRAS curve.",
          "A rightward shift of the LRAS curve due to growth."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Demand‑pull inflation: AD increases, moving upward along SRAS, raising both output and prices in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the price level and real GDP if there is an increase in business taxes and a decrease in consumer confidence simultaneously?",
        "options": [
          "Both the price level and real GDP will decrease.",
          "The price level will increase, and real GDP will decrease.",
          "The price level will decrease, but real GDP will increase.",
          "The effect on both is indeterminate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher business taxes shift SRAS left (raising prices, lowering GDP). Lower confidence shifts AD left (lowering prices and GDP). Both shifts lower real GDP; price level effect could be mixed but typically falls if AD shift dominates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the SRAS curve generally assumed to be horizontal at very low levels of output in some Keynesian models?",
        "options": [
          "Because there are many idle resources and unemployed workers, allowing firms to increase production without raising prices.",
          "Because workers are willing to accept wage cuts when unemployment is low.",
          "Because firms always face 'menu costs' regardless of the state of the economy.",
          "Because the price level is determined solely by the money supply."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In deep recessions, abundant idle resources mean firms can hire more without bidding up wages or prices — SRAS is flat."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an economy is in a recession and the government successfully shifts the AD curve to the right to reach the LRAS curve, what is the most likely long-run outcome for the price level and output?",
        "options": [
          "Output increases to the full-employment level and the price level rises.",
          "The LRAS curve shifts to the right to meet the new AD curve.",
