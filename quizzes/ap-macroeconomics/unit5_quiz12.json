    "subtitle": "AP Macroeconomics – Taxes, Output Gaps, Central Banking, Bailouts, and Automatic Stabilizers",
    "subject": "AP Macroeconomics",
    "topic": "Direct vs. Indirect Taxes, GDP Calculation, Recessionary/Inflationary Gaps, Fiscal vs. Monetary Stabilization, Government Bailouts, Monetary Financing, Automatic Stabilizers",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a direct tax?",
        "options": [
          "Income Tax",
          "Corporate Tax",
          "Property Tax",
          "Goods and Services Tax",
          "Gift Tax"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax—it is levied on transactions and can be passed on to consumers. Income tax, corporate tax, property tax, and gift tax are direct taxes imposed on persons or entities, where the burden typically cannot be shifted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in imports affect a nation's GDP?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in imports does not affect a nation's GDP.",
          "An increase in imports raises a nation's GDP.",
          "An increase in imports decreases a nation's GDP.",
          "An increase in imports raises or decreases a nation's GDP."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "GDP = C + I + G + (X – M). Imports (M) are subtracted in the calculation, so a rise in imports, all else equal, reduces net exports (X – M) and therefore lowers GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A recessionary gap occurs when                     .",
        "options": [
          "potential output exceeds real output",
          "real output exceeds potential output",
          "real output is equal to potential output",
          "nominal output exceeds potential output"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A recessionary gap exists when actual real GDP is below potential GDP—the economy is producing less than its full‑employment capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the most effective fiscal policy if potential GDP exceeds current GDP?",
        "options": [
          "Government spending increases.",
          "The Federal Reserve sells US Treasury bonds.",
          "The tax rate increases.",
          "The Federal Reserve buys US Treasury bonds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When potential GDP > current GDP (recessionary gap), expansionary fiscal policy—such as increasing government spending—boosts aggregate demand to close the gap. Options involving the Fed are monetary policy, not fiscal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Who/What else in the economy can perform stabilization function besides the government?",
        "options": [
          "The Central Bank",
          "The Commercial Banks",
          "National Accountants and Auditors",
          "A Party of Business Leaders"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The central bank conducts monetary policy (e.g., adjusting interest rates, open‑market operations) to stabilize output and prices—a key stabilization role alongside government fiscal policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why would a government bail out a large company from business loss?",
        "options": [
          "To eliminate the moral hazard associated with high‑risk corporate investments.",
          "To ensure that the company's shareholders receive their expected annual dividends.",
          "To mitigate systemic risk to the national economy.",
          "To allow the free market to reallocate resources to more efficient and profitable competitors."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Governments may bail out systemically important firms to prevent cascading failures that could destabilize the entire financial system and cause severe economic damage—even if it creates moral hazard."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is known to conflict with the full employment of resources?",
        "options": [
          "Price Stability",
          "Economic Growth",
          "Poverty Reduction",
          "Allocative Efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Phillips curve illustrates a short‑run trade‑off: pushing unemployment too low (toward full employment) can lead to accelerating inflation, making price stability harder to achieve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a government faces a budget deficit or a shortage of liquidity, why is 'monetary financing' (requesting the Central Bank to print money to cover government costs) generally avoided?",
        "options": [
          "It would lead to a rapid increase in the price level as the money supply outpaces the growth of real output.",
          "The increase in the money supply would cause the domestic currency to appreciate, making exports too expensive.",
          "Printing more money reduces the velocity of circulation, causing the economy to enter a deep stagnation.",
          "It would force the government to increase interest rates immediately to maintain the value of the new currency."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monetary financing (direct monetization of debt) risks hyperinflation because it increases the money supply without a corresponding rise in real output, eroding purchasing power and price stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the cause‑and‑effect relationship between GDP increase and government fiscal intake?",
        "options": [
          "GDP and fiscal intake are inversely proportional to each other",
          "Higher GDP increases tax revenue",
          "Increased GDP results in less fiscal intake for the government",
          "GDP growth causes fiscal intake to stagnate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As GDP rises, incomes, profits, and consumption increase, boosting tax revenues (fiscal intake) automatically, assuming unchanged tax rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What differentiates automatic stabilizers from discretionary fiscal policies?",
        "options": [
          "Need for legislative approval",
          "Impact on inflation",
          "Frequency of use during crises",
          "Influence on international trade"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers (e.g., progressive taxes, unemployment benefits) operate without new legislation; discretionary policies require deliberate legislative action to change spending or tax laws."
