    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Crowding Out' effect is most problematic when the economy is:",
        "options": [
          "Running a massive trade surplus.",
          "In a deep recession.",
          "Experiencing high deflation.",
          "Operating at full employment."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Crowding out—where government borrowing raises interest rates and reduces private investment—is most significant when the economy is at or near full employment, because resources (including loanable funds) are already fully utilized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is the largest source of federal revenue in the United States?",
        "options": [
          "Tariffs and excise taxes.",
          "Corporate income taxes.",
          "Estate and gift taxes.",
          "Individual income taxes."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Individual income taxes are the single largest source of federal revenue, followed by payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, and other smaller sources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Benefit Principle' of taxation suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "Taxes should be as low as possible for everyone.",
          "People should pay taxes based on the amount of government services they use.",
          "The rich should pay more because they can afford it.",
          "Taxes should only be used to benefit the poor."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The benefit principle states that taxpayers should contribute in proportion to the benefits they receive from public goods and services, similar to a user fee."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a revenue by the government?",
        "options": [
          "Cash grants-in-aid from foreign countries and international organisations",
          "Sale of government assets",
          "Fees and other receipts for services rendered by the government",
          "Dividends and profits on investments made by the government",
          "None of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "All listed items are sources of government revenue: grants‑in‑aid, asset sales, fees, and investment returns. 'None of the above' indicates that all are revenues, making it the correct answer since the question asks which is NOT revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If revenue exceed outlays, the government's budget balance is _______, and the government has a budget _______.",
        "options": [
          "negative; deficit",
          "positive; surplus",
          "positive; deficit",
          "negative; surplus",
          "zero; deficit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When revenues > outlays (spending), the budget balance is positive, indicating a budget surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Government debt is __________.",
        "options": [
          "equal to revenues minus outlays",
          "equal to revenues minus tax",
          "always increasing",
          "total amount of government borrowing",
          "the result of a rising price level"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Government debt (national debt) is the total stock of outstanding borrowing that the government has accumulated over time to finance past deficits."
      },
      {

        "question": "A 'Regressive Tax' is one where:",
        "options": [
          "The tax rate stays the same regardless of income.",
          "The tax rate increases as income increases.",
          "Everyone pays the exact same dollar amount.",
          "The tax rate decreases as income increases."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A regressive tax takes a larger percentage of income from low‑income earners than from high‑income earners, effectively meaning the tax rate decreases as income rises. Sales taxes are often regressive in practice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government wants to reduce the national debt, it must run a:",

          "Trade deficit.",
          "Budget deficit.",
          "Balanced budget.",
          "Budget surplus."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A budget surplus (revenues > spending) allows the government to repay part of its outstanding debt, reducing the national debt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a household's disposable income increases from $40,000 to $50,000 and its consumption increases from $35,000 to $42,000, what is the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)?",
        "options": [
          "0.7",
          "0.8",
          "0.3",
          "1.4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MPC = ΔConsumption / ΔDisposable Income = ($42,000 – $35,000) / ($50,000 – $40,000) = $7,000 / $10,000 = 0.7."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines 'Disposable Income'?",
        "options": [
          "Total wages earned before any deductions.",
          "Personal income minus personal current taxes.",
          "The portion of income that is saved in a bank account.",
          "Income remaining after all necessary bills and rent are paid."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Disposable income = Personal income – Personal taxes. It is the amount households have available to spend or save after paying direct taxes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) is 0.25, what is the value of the spending multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "0.75",
          "5",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MPS = 0.25 ⇒ MPC = 0.75. Spending multiplier = 1 / (1 – MPC) = 1 / 0.25 = 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The sum of MPC and MPS must always equal 1 because:",
        "options": [
          "It ensures that the multiplier is always a whole number.",
          "Consumption and saving always grow at the same rate.",
          "The government mandates a balanced ratio of spending to saving.",
          "Every additional dollar of income must be either spent or saved."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "MPC + MPS = 1 because any change in disposable income is divided between consumption and saving; the fractions spent and saved must sum to 100% of the additional dollar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT included in Personal Income?",
        "options": [
          "Transfer payments like unemployment benefits.",
          "Wages and salaries.",
          "Social Security taxes paid by employees.",
          "Dividends received from corporate stocks."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Personal income includes all income received by individuals, including wages, transfer payments, and dividends. Social Security taxes paid are deductions from income, not part of personal income received."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The use of contractionary fiscal policy leads to an increase in taxes and a decrease in government spending which can further lead to:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease in the exchange rate",
          "Decrease in investment",
          "Increase in inflation",
          "Decrease in interest rate",
          "Increase in aggregate demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy reduces aggregate demand, which can lower output and inflation. It may also reduce interest rates if demand for loanable funds falls, but crowding‑in could increase investment. However, higher taxes directly reduce disposable income and can discourage investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements is CORRECT?",
        "options": [
          "Contractionary fiscal policy increases aggregate demand",
          "Transfer payments by the government lead to reduced consumption",
          "Higher government spending creates lower aggregate demand",
          "Expansionary fiscal policy increases aggregate demand",
          "The rise of taxes the government leads to a rise in consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy (increased government spending, tax cuts, or increased transfers) raises aggregate demand. The other statements are incorrect: contractionary policy reduces AD; transfer payments usually increase consumption; higher government spending increases AD; higher taxes reduce consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements is INCORRECT about discretionary fiscal policy?",
        "options": [
          "Governments can change tax policies",
          "Governments can determine spending programs in response to fluctuations in the business cycle",
          "Taxes are linked to economic activity",
          "The government can devise policies that require ongoing decisions by policymakers",
          "Discretionary policy often has limited impacts on the economy"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Discretionary fiscal policy can have significant impacts on the economy, though its effectiveness may be limited by lags and crowding out. The statement that it 'often has limited impacts' is not universally true and is therefore incorrect in this context."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements is INCORRECT about automatic fiscal stabilizers?",
        "options": [
          "Implemented without any deliberate action by the government",
          "Taxes are linked to economic activity: Automatic 'tax cut' during an economic recession; Automatic 'tax hike' during the economic boom.",
          "Automatic fiscal stabilizers smooth out fluctuations in booms and busts",
          "Automatic fiscal stabilizers often have limited impacts on the economy",
          "Government spending responds to the business cycles"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers can have significant moderating effects on the business cycle by automatically changing tax revenues and transfer payments. Saying they 'often have limited impacts' is incorrect—they are important counter‑cyclical tools."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following correctly explains fiscal deficit?",
        "options": [
          "It is the difference between total revenue and total expenditure of the government",
          "It is the difference between total revenue and borrowings of the government",
          "It is the difference between total consumption and investment in the economy",
          "It is the difference between the aggregate demand and aggregate supply in the economy",
          "It is the difference between total public revenue and public debt in the economy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fiscal deficit = Total government expenditure – Total government revenue (excluding borrowings). It represents the amount the government must borrow in a given year."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT related to fiscal deficit?",
        "options": [
          "Revenue deficit",
          "Gross fiscal deficit",
          "Primary deficit",
          "Trade deficit",
          "Net fiscal deficit"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Trade deficit is a balance‑of‑payments concept (imports > exports), unrelated to the government’s budget. Revenue deficit, gross fiscal deficit, and primary deficit are all measures of government budget imbalances."
