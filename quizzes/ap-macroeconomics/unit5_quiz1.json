    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fiscal policy is primarily concerned with changes in:",
        "options": [
          "interest rates and the money supply",
          "government spending and taxation",
          "exchange rates and trade balances",
          "wage and price controls"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fiscal policy involves government decisions on spending and taxation to influence macroeconomic outcomes such as output, employment, and inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An expansionary fiscal policy is most likely to be used during:",
        "options": [
          "an inflationary gap",
          "a recessionary gap",
          "periods of hyperinflation",
          "when the economy is at full employment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy (increased government spending or tax cuts) aims to boost aggregate demand and close a recessionary gap when real GDP is below potential GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an automatic stabilizer?",
        "options": [
          "A temporary increase in military spending",
          "A one‑time tax rebate passed by Congress",
          "Unemployment insurance benefits",
          "A cut in corporate tax rates to stimulate investment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment benefits, automatically increase government outlays when the economy slows, without requiring new legislation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The spending multiplier is larger when:",
        "options": [
          "the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is higher",
          "the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is higher",
          "taxes are increased",
          "interest rates rise"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The multiplier = 1/(1 – MPC). A higher MPC means a smaller denominator (1 – MPC), resulting in a larger multiplier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Crowding out occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "government spending increases private investment",
          "higher government borrowing raises interest rates, reducing private investment",
          "tax cuts lead to increased consumer spending",
          "exports increase due to a weaker currency"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Crowding out refers to the reduction in private investment that can result from government deficit spending, which increases demand for loanable funds and raises interest rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the MPC is 0.75, a $100 billion increase in government spending will eventually increase real GDP by:",
        "options": [
          "$75 billion",
          "$100 billion",
          "$400 billion",
          "$133 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Multiplier = 1/(1 – 0.75) = 4. $100 billion × 4 = $400 billion increase in real GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A contractionary fiscal policy would involve:",
        "options": [
          "increasing government spending and cutting taxes",
          "decreasing government spending and raising taxes",
          "increasing the money supply",
          "decreasing interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy aims to reduce aggregate demand by cutting government spending and/or raising taxes, typically to combat inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of discretionary fiscal policy?",
        "options": [
          "It works too quickly",
          "It has no impact on aggregate demand",
          "Implementation and recognition lags",
          "It cannot be used during recessions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Discretionary fiscal policy is subject to lags: recognition lag (time to identify the problem), implementation lag (time to pass legislation), and impact lag (time for policy to affect the economy)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A balanced budget multiplier suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "an equal increase in taxes and government spending has no effect on GDP",
          "an equal increase in taxes and government spending increases GDP by the amount of the spending increase",
          "tax cuts are always more effective than spending increases",
          "deficits have no impact on interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The balanced budget multiplier states that if government spending and taxes are increased by the same amount, real GDP will increase by that amount because the spending multiplier is larger than the tax multiplier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Supply‑side fiscal policies are designed to:",
        "options": [
          "shift aggregate demand to the right",
          "shift long‑run aggregate supply to the right",
          "reduce inflation through demand reduction",
          "increase consumption in the short run"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Supply‑side policies (e.g., tax incentives for investment, deregulation) aim to increase the economy's productive capacity, shifting the LRAS curve rightward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be considered an expansionary fiscal policy action?",
        "options": [
          "Increasing personal income tax rates",
          "Reducing government transfer payments",
          "Increasing infrastructure spending",
          "Selling government bonds to the public"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increasing infrastructure spending raises government expenditure (G), directly increasing aggregate demand—an expansionary fiscal policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a recession, automatic stabilizers cause:",
        "options": [
          "government tax revenues to increase and spending to decrease",
          "government tax revenues to decrease and spending to increase",
          "both tax revenues and spending to decrease",
          "both tax revenues and spending to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a recession, incomes fall, so tax revenues decrease (especially with progressive taxes). At the same time, spending on programs like unemployment benefits rises automatically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government cuts taxes by $50 billion and the MPC is 0.8, the eventual change in real GDP will be:",
        "options": [
          "$40 billion",
          "$50 billion",
          "$200 billion",
          "$250 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Tax multiplier = –MPC/(1 – MPC) = –0.8/0.2 = –4. A tax cut of $50 billion increases GDP by $50 billion × 4 = $200 billion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'fiscal drag' refers to:",
        "options": [
          "the stimulative effect of tax cuts",
          "the slowing of economic growth due to rising tax revenues as incomes increase",
          "the crowding out of private investment",
          "the lag in implementing fiscal policy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fiscal drag occurs when rising incomes push taxpayers into higher brackets, increasing tax revenues and reducing disposable income, which can slow economic growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Ricardian equivalence' proposition?",
        "options": [
          "Tax cuts increase aggregate demand significantly",
          "People save more when government spending increases, offsetting its impact",
          "Government deficits have no effect on interest rates",
          "Tax cuts financed by borrowing will be saved, not spent, because people expect future taxes to rise"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Ricardian equivalence suggests that rational households anticipate that current deficit‑financed tax cuts will lead to future tax increases, so they save the extra income rather than spend it, neutralizing the stimulus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A structural budget deficit occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "the budget is in surplus at full employment",
          "the budget is in deficit even when the economy is at full employment",
          "automatic stabilizers cause deficits during recessions",
          "government spending is less than tax revenues"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A structural deficit exists when government spending exceeds revenues at full‑employment output, indicating a persistent imbalance not due to cyclical fluctuations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Expansionary fiscal policy is most effective when:",
        "options": [
          "the economy is at full employment",
          "interest rates are high",
          "there is substantial crowding out",
          "the economy is in a deep recession with idle resources"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When resources are idle (high unemployment, low capacity utilization), increased government spending is less likely to cause inflation and more likely to raise output without significant crowding out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a potential long‑run effect of persistent budget deficits?",
        "options": [
          "Lower national debt",
          "Higher interest rates and reduced capital formation",
          "Increased private saving",
          "A stronger currency"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Persistent deficits can lead to higher public debt, which may raise long‑term interest rates, crowd out private investment, and reduce the economy's future productive capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government increases spending and finances it entirely by borrowing, the immediate effect is:",
        "options": [
          "a decrease in aggregate demand",
          "an increase in aggregate demand",
          "no change in aggregate demand",
          "a leftward shift of aggregate supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Government spending directly increases aggregate demand. Borrowing to finance it does not offset the initial demand increase, though crowding out may reduce the net effect over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A tax cut aimed at increasing investment spending is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "demand‑side fiscal policy",
          "supply‑side fiscal policy",
          "automatic stabilization",
          "monetary policy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tax incentives for investment are intended to boost capital formation, productivity, and long‑run aggregate supply—key goals of supply‑side fiscal policy."
