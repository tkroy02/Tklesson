    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When aggregate demand unexpectedly decreases, real output falls in the short run primarily because:",
        "options": [
          "The money supply automatically contracts",
          "Potential GDP immediately decreases",
          "Wages are fixed by contracts and social norms",
          "All prices adjust downward instantaneously"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the short run, wages and some prices are sticky due to contracts, social norms, and menu costs. This prevents immediate downward adjustment, so a fall in AD leads to reduced production and higher unemployment, not just lower prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the economy is experiencing stagflation and the government implements a tax cut while simultaneously reducing government spending by the same amount, what is the most likely effect on aggregate demand?",
        "options": [
          "Aggregate demand will decrease",
          "Effect on aggregate demand is indeterminate",
          "Aggregate demand will increase",
          "Aggregate demand will remain unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A tax cut increases disposable income and consumption (shifting AD right), while reduced government spending decreases AD (shifting it left). If the magnitudes are equal, the net effect on AD could be neutral, assuming equal multipliers. However, under a balanced budget change, AD may remain roughly unchanged in simple models."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy experiences simultaneous rightward shifts in both aggregate demand and short-run aggregate supply. Which statement about the new short-run equilibrium is necessarily true?",
        "options": [
          "Real GDP will increase",
          "Unemployment rate will decrease",
          "Price level will increase",
          "Inflation rate will remain constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both rightward shifts increase real GDP. The effect on price level is ambiguous (AD increase raises prices, SRAS increase lowers them). Unemployment likely falls but isn't guaranteed if labor force grows. Only real GDP necessarily rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A significant decrease in consumer income leads to a reduction in aggregate demand. What are the expected effects on inflation and unemployment in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Lower inflation and lower unemployment",
          "Higher inflation and lower unemployment",
          "Lower inflation and higher unemployment",
          "Higher inflation and higher unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A leftward shift in AD reduces both output and the price level in the short run, leading to lower inflation (or deflationary pressure) and higher unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the immediate effect of a positive shock in aggregate demand (AD) on output in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Output decreases",
          "Output fluctuates unpredictably",
          "Output remains unchanged",
          "Output increases"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the short run, with sticky prices and wages, an increase in AD leads to higher real GDP as firms respond to increased demand by producing more."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Changes in which of the following shifts the aggregate supply curve?\n\ni. the price level\nii. the money wage rate\niii. potential GDP",
  "options": [
    "i only",
    "ii only",
    "iii only",
    "ii and iii",
    "i, ii, and iii"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "A change in the price level causes a movement along the aggregate supply (AS) curve, not a shift. A change in the money wage rate shifts the short-run AS curve because it affects production costs. A change in potential GDP shifts the long-run AS curve (LRAS) and also influences the position of the short-run AS curve. Therefore, only changes in ii and iii shift the AS curve."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "An increase in the price level leads to",
  "options": [
    "an upward movement along the aggregate supply curve.",
    "a downward movement along the aggregate supply curve.",
    "a leftward shift of the aggregate supply curve.",
    "a rightward shift of the aggregate supply curve.",
    "neither a movement along the aggregate supply curve nor a shift of the aggregate supply curve."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "An increase in the price level, with other factors (like wages and technology) held constant, increases the quantity of real GDP supplied. This is represented as an upward movement along the existing aggregate supply (AS) curve, not a shift of the curve itself."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Moving along the aggregate supply curve,",
  "options": [
    "the quantity of capital used increases.",
    "only the price level changes.",
    "technology advances.",
    "the stock of human capital increases.",
    "the real wage rate is constant."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Movement along the aggregate supply (AS) curve occurs only when the price level changes, holding all other factors constant (like wages, technology, and resource availability). Changes in capital, technology, human capital, or real wages would shift the entire AS curve."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A change in the price level produces a ______ the aggregate demand curve.\n\ni. shift in\nii. change in the slope of\niii. movement along",
  "options": [
    "i only",
    "ii only",
    "iii only",
    "i and iii",
    "i and ii"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "A change in the price level causes a movement along the aggregate demand (AD) curve due to the wealth effect, interest rate effect, and international trade effect. It does not shift the AD curve or change its slope, as those are caused by changes in factors like consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "When the price level rises and increases the demand for money, the nominal interest rate ______ and the real interest rate ______.",
  "options": [
    "rises; rises",
    "rises; falls",
    "falls; rises",
    "falls; falls",
    "does not change; does not change"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "When the price level rises, households and firms need more money for transactions, increasing the demand for money. If the money supply is fixed, the higher demand raises the nominal interest rate. In the short run, before inflation expectations adjust, the real interest rate (nominal rate minus expected inflation) also rises. This is part of the interest rate effect that contributes to the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In the short run, a rise in the price level brings a ______ in the real interest rate that ______ investment, bringing ______ in the quantity of real GDP demanded.",
  "options": [
    "rise; decreases; a decrease",
    "fall; decreases ; a decrease",
    "fall; increases ; an increase",
    "rise; increases ; an increase",
    "rise; decreases; an increase"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "In the short run, a higher price level increases the demand for money. If the money supply is fixed, the nominal and real interest rates rise (assuming inflation expectations don't adjust immediately). Higher real interest rates reduce investment spending, which in turn decreases the quantity of real GDP demanded—a movement along the downward-sloping aggregate demand curve."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "At a price level of 100, John has savings equal to $20,000. If the price level increases to 130, the buying power of John's savings is approximately",
  "options": [
    "$12,780.",
    "$15,400.",
    "$20,000.",
    "$26,000.",
    "$30,000."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "When the price level rises from 100 to 130, the value of money decreases. The real value (purchasing power) of John's savings is calculated as: (Nominal Savings) × (Initial Price Level / New Price Level) = $20,000 × (100 / 130) ≈ $15,384.61, which is closest to $15,400."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "An increase in government expenditure on goods and services leads to the",
  "options": [
    "aggregate supply curve shifting rightward.",
    "aggregate supply curve shifting leftward.",
    "aggregate demand curve shifting rightward.",
    "aggregate demand curve shifting leftward.",
    "potential GDP increasing."
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Government expenditure on goods and services (G) is a component of aggregate demand. An increase in G directly raises total spending in the economy, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right. This does not shift aggregate supply or change potential GDP in the short run, unless the spending enhances long-run productive capacity (e.g., infrastructure investment)."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A tax increase",
  "options": [
    "decreases aggregate demand and the AD curve shifts leftward.",
    "increases aggregate demand and the AD curve shifts rightward.",
    "decreases the quantity of real GDP demanded and there is a movement up along the AD curve.",
    "increases the quantity of real GDP demanded and there is a movement down along the AD curve.",
    "does not shift or lead to a movement along the aggregate demand curve."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "An increase in taxes reduces disposable income for households and/or after‑tax profits for firms, leading to lower consumption (C) and/or investment (I). This reduction in spending decreases aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve leftward. A change in the price level would cause movement along the AD curve, but a tax change shifts the entire curve."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Stagflation is defined as a period when real GDP ______ and the price level ______.",
  "options": [
    "increases; increases",
    "increases; decreases",
    "decreases; increases",
    "decreases; decreases",
    "is constant; rises rapidly"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Stagflation combines stagnation (falling real GDP and rising unemployment) with inflation (rising price level). It is typically caused by a leftward shift of the short‑run aggregate supply curve due to a supply shock (e.g., an oil price increase)."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following shifts the aggregate demand curve rightward?",
  "options": [
    "a decrease in expected future income",
    "a decrease in the price level",
    "a tax cut",
    "a decrease in the quantity of money",
    "a decrease in government expenditures on goods and services"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "A tax cut increases disposable income, boosting consumption (C) and shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right. A decrease in expected future income, a decrease in the money supply, or a decrease in government spending would shift AD leftward. A decrease in the price level causes movement along the AD curve, not a shift."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the intersection point of the Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) and Aggregate Demand (AD) curves relative to the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve determine the type of output gap in an economy?",
        "options": [
          "If the SRAS-AD intersection is to the right of LRAS, it indicates an inflationary gap; if to the left, a recessionary gap; if at LRAS, the economy is at full-employment equilibrium.",
          "The type of output gap is determined by the distance between the SRAS and LRAS curves, regardless of the AD curve’s position.",
          "The SRAS-AD intersection point relative to LRAS has no bearing on the type of output gap; it’s determined solely by the slope of the AD curve.",
          "An inflationary gap occurs when the SRAS-AD intersection is to the left of LRAS, while a recessionary gap occurs when it’s to the right of LRAS."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An inflationary gap exists when equilibrium output exceeds potential GDP (intersection right of LRAS). A recessionary gap exists when output is below potential (intersection left of LRAS). Full employment occurs at the intersection with LRAS."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the wage-price spiral contribute to the perpetuation of inflation in an economy?",
        "options": [
          "Government spending increases, leading to higher aggregate demand and causing businesses to raise prices without affecting wages",
          "Workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising prices, leading businesses to raise prices further to cover increased labor costs, creating a self-reinforcing cycle",
          "Central banks increase interest rates, causing businesses to raise prices to maintain profit margins, which then leads to higher wage demands",
          "Foreign exchange rates depreciate, increasing import costs and causing domestic prices to rise without impacting wages"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The wage-price spiral is a feedback loop: rising prices reduce real wages, prompting workers to demand higher nominal wages. Firms then raise prices to cover higher labor costs, leading to further inflationary pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a full‐employment economy, if consumer and business confidence falls causing a leftward shift in the aggregate demand (AD) curve, which of the following is the most accurate description of the short‐run effects?",
        "options": [
          "Only the aggregate supply curve shifts leftward causing higher prices and lower output.",
          "Real GDP falls below full employment levels, unemployment rises, and the aggregate price level decreases.",
          "Real GDP remains at full employment while the price level increases dramatically.",
          "There is an immediate rightward shift in the AD curve accompanied by increased government spending."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A leftward AD shift in the short run leads to lower output (recessionary gap), higher unemployment, and a lower price level, assuming SRAS does not shift immediately."
