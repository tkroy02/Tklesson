      {

        "question": "All of the following statements about the Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) are true except:",
        "options": [
          "The slope of the PPC indicates the opportunity cost of producing one good in terms of the forgone production of another.",
          "The PPC illustrates the trade-offs and opportunity costs of producing two goods.",
          "Points lying on the PPC represent efficient production levels given resource constraints.",
          "The PPC is typically linear because resources are perfectly adaptable across different types of production."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The PPC is typically bowed-out (concave), not linear, because resources are not perfectly adaptable—specialization leads to increasing opportunity costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes 'terms of trade' in international economics?",
        "options": [
          "How a country’s cost of production compares to that of its trading partners.",
          "The difference between the domestic price and international price of a good.",
          "The total volume of exports of a country relative to its GDP.",
          "The ratio of a country’s export prices to its import prices."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Terms of trade is defined as the ratio of a country's average export prices to its average import prices. An improvement means export prices rise relative to import prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is choosing to reallocate more labor toward automobile production at the expense of truck production. What economic concept does this decision best illustrate?",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost",
          "Absolute advantage",
          "Comparative advantage",
          "Opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Reallocating resources from trucks to cars means giving up truck production to gain car production—this is a direct example of opportunity cost (the value of the forgone trucks)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country X initially exports cars at $20,000 each and imports computers at $1,000 each, representing a terms of trade ratio of 20:1. After trade negotiations, the relative price of cars to computers rises to 25:1. What is the effect on Country X's terms of trade?",
        "options": [
          "There is no change in the terms of trade",
          "The terms of trade deteriorate",
          "The effect is ambiguous without additional information",
          "The terms of trade improve"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An increase in the ratio of export price (cars) to import price (computers) means Country X receives more imports per unit of exports—its terms of trade improve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two countries, Alphaland and Betaland, can produce computers and wheat. Alphaland has an absolute advantage in both goods, but Betaland has a comparative advantage in wheat production. If these countries specialize according to comparative advantage and engage in trade, what will be the result?",
        "options": [
          "Both countries can consume beyond their PPCs",
          "Only Alphaland will benefit from trade",
          "Total production will decrease",
          "Both countries will produce at the same point on their PPCs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Specialization based on comparative advantage increases total output and allows both countries to trade, consuming combinations of goods that lie outside their individual PPCs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the concave shape of the Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) represent?",
        "options": [
          "No opportunity costs",
          "Decreasing opportunity costs",
          "Increasing opportunity costs",
          "Constant opportunity costs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A concave (bowed-out) PPC reflects increasing opportunity costs—resources are not equally adaptable, so producing more of one good requires giving up larger and larger amounts of the other."
