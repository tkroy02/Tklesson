          "4.76%",
          "9%",
          "10%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inflation rate = [(CPI_current – CPI_previous) / CPI_previous] × 100 = [(189 – 180) / 180] × 100 = 5%."
      },

      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Includes transfer payments",
          "Adjusts for changes in the price level",
          "Counts all production within a country’s borders",
          "Exports imports"
        ],
        "answer": "B",

          "(Employed / Labor Force) × 100"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Labor force participation rate = (Labor Force ÷ Adult Non‑institutionalized Population) × 100."
