    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the CPI consistently overstates inflation due to substitution bias, which of the following would be a likely consequence for government policy?",
        "options": [
          "Excessive increases in Social Security payments",
          "Overestimation of the unemployment rate",
          "Underestimation of real GDP growth",
          "Insufficient adjustment of tax brackets for inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CPI-linked adjustments (e.g., Social Security COLAs) would be larger than needed, potentially leading to excessive increases in government spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car is sold for \\$40,000, and the intermediate inputs (parts) cost \\$15,000. What is the value added to GDP by the car’s assembly process?",
        "options": [
          "\\$25,000",
          "\\$40,000",
          "\\$55,000",
          "\\$15,000"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Value added = Final selling price − Cost of intermediate inputs = \\$40,000 − \\$15,000 = \\$25,000."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If nominal income remains constant while the CPI rises, what happens to real income?",
        "options": [
          "Real income remains unchanged",
          "Real income doubles",
          "Real income decreases",
          "Real income increases"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Real income = Nominal income / Price level. If prices rise (CPI up) and nominal income stays the same, real income falls."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the circular flow diagram, who demands in the factor market?",
        "options": [
          "Firms",
          "Government",
          "Foreign markets",
          "Consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the factor market, firms demand factors of production (labor, capital, land) from households, who supply them. The factor market is distinct from the product market, where households demand goods and services from firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which market do households interact by selling labor?",
        "options": [
          "Commodity market",
          "Capital market",
          "Product market",
          "Factor market"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Households supply labor (and other factors of production) to firms in the factor market. The product market is where households buy final goods and services from firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the circular flow diagram provide insight into the relationship between economic output and income?",
        "options": [
          "It shows how expenditure equals income in the economy",
          "It isolates government spending from consumer spending",
          "It ignores consumer activity",
          "It separates production and spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The circular flow model visually demonstrates the equality of total expenditure, total output, and total income in the economy—a foundational identity in macroeconomics (GDP from expenditure approach = GDP from income approach)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's Gross National Product (GNP) is significantly higher than its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which of the following is likely true?",
        "options": [
          "The country’s citizens own significant productive assets abroad.",
          "The country is running a large trade deficit.",
          "The country has a large number of foreign workers sending money home.",
          "Domestic prices are rising faster than foreign prices."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GNP = GDP + Net factor income from abroad (NFIA). If GNP > GDP, NFIA is positive, meaning domestic citizens earn more from overseas investments/assets than foreign citizens earn domestically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the circular flow of income, which of the following represents a 'leakage' that could lead to a contraction in economic activity if not offset by injections?",
        "options": [
          "A decision by households to increase their savings rate.",
          "Government spending on a new interstate highway system.",
          "A rise in corporate investment in new machinery.",
          "An increase in the demand for locally produced exports."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased household savings is a leakage (S) from the circular flow, reducing consumption and potentially contracting economic activity unless injections (I, G, X) rise to offset it. Options B, C, and D are injections (G, I, X) that stimulate economic activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be excluded from the calculation of GDP using the expenditure approach to avoid double counting?",
        "options": [
          "Legal services provided to a corporation.",
          "The salary paid to a public school teacher.",
          "The purchase of a new house by a family.",
          "The purchase of flour by a commercial bakery to make bread."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The purchase of flour by a bakery is an intermediate good, not a final good. Including it would double count when the bread is sold. Legal services (A), salaries (B), and new houses (C) are final transactions counted in GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Nominal GDP grows by 8% and the GDP Deflator increases by 10% in the same year, what happened to Real GDP?",
        "options": [
          "Real GDP decreased by approximately 2%.",
          "Real GDP remained constant.",
          "Real GDP increased by 18%.",
          "Real GDP increased by 2%."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Real GDP growth ≈ Nominal GDP growth − GDP deflator growth. Here: 8% − 10% ≈ −2%, meaning Real GDP fell slightly despite rising nominal GDP due to higher inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When using the Income Approach to calculate National Income, why is 'Depreciation' (Consumption of Fixed Capital) added back to reach Gross Domestic Income?",
        "options": [
          "To account for the value of capital used up during production.",
          "Because it is a form of indirect business tax.",
          "Because depreciation represents actual cash flow to households.",
          "To adjust for the effects of inflation on asset values."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Depreciation is added back because it measures the value of capital consumed in production. GDP measures total output before deducting capital consumption, so moving from Net Domestic Product (NDP) to GDP requires adding depreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might GDP not reflect increases in economic well-being?",
        "options": [
          "GDP excludes non-market activities",
          "GDP automatically adjusts for inflation rates",
          "GDP measures all economic transactions equally",
          "GDP includes unpaid work"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GDP measures only market transactions, so unpaid activities like household work, volunteering, and leisure—which contribute to well-being—are excluded, causing GDP to understate true improvements in living standards."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does investment spending impact the future production capacity of an economy?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the capital stock",
          "It reduces technological innovation and economic efficiency",
          "It depletes current resources",
          "It contracts the economy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Investment spending adds to the capital stock, expanding the economy's productive capacity over time, which enables higher potential output in the future."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the concept of voluntary exchange play a vital role in the circular flow model?",
        "options": [
          "It maximizes incentives for economic actors",
          "It restricts the efficient allocation of scarce resources throughout the economy",
          "It eliminates government intervention",
          "It standardizes wage rates across all markets"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Voluntary exchange ensures that households and firms participate in markets because both benefit, creating incentives that drive production, employment, and consumption in the circular flow of economic activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do firms' responses to changes in demand within the product market influence GDP?",
        "options": [
          "By reducing government spending",
          "By increasing interest rates",
          "By cutting total output",
          "By altering production levels"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Firms respond to changes in demand by adjusting how much they produce. Higher demand leads to increased production and higher GDP; lower demand leads to reduced production and lower GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is depreciation not counted as part of GDP?",
        "options": [
          "It is already accounted for in consumer spending calculations",
          "It reflects wear and tear, not new production",
          "It represents a measure of declining productivity in the economy",
          "It reflects investment in new capital resources"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP measures the value of newly produced goods and services in a period. Depreciation accounts for the reduction in value of existing capital due to wear and tear, which is not current production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the income approach to GDP measurement highlight the circularity of economic flows?",
        "options": [
          "It isolates consumer activity from broader economic patterns",
          "It shows income equals total output",
          "It concentrates primarily on expenditure data and spending patterns",
          "It separates firms and households"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The income approach demonstrates the equality between total output (production) and total income (earnings), illustrating the circular flow of money from firms to households and back through spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might GDP per capita be a more useful measure of economic prosperity than total GDP?",
        "options": [
          "It includes non-market activities",
          "It adjusts for shifts in population",
          "It isolates government economic influence",
          "It reflects nominal value"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP per capita accounts for population size, allowing for better comparison of average income and living standards across countries or over time, unlike total GDP which can be large simply due to a large population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What critical role do government expenditures play in influencing GDP?",
        "options": [
          "They provide a stable component of GDP",
          "They alter net exports directly",
          "They contract economic productivity",
          "They create resource market fluctuations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Government spending is a direct and often stable part of aggregate demand (GDP). It can be adjusted through fiscal policy to influence economic activity and is less volatile than investment or net exports."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The government has a large national debt with fixed-rate bonds. If unexpected inflation occurs, what is the most likely redistribution effect?",
        "options": [
          "Wealth transfers between different bondholder groups",
          "Wealth transfers from taxpayers to bondholders",
          "No significant redistribution occurs",
          "Wealth transfers from bondholders to taxpayers"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Unexpected inflation reduces the real value of fixed payments, benefiting the borrower (government/taxpayers) at the expense of lenders (bondholders)."
