    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which term describes the person or entity that is legally responsible for sending a tax payment to the government?",
        "options": [
          "Deadweight loss",
          "Economic incidence",
          "Statutory incidence",
          "Tax wedge"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Statutory incidence is defined by law and specifies which party is required to remit the tax to the authorities. Economic incidence refers to who actually bears the burden after price adjustments."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the demand for a product is perfectly inelastic, how is the burden of a new excise tax distributed?",
        "options": [
          "Consumers bear the entire burden.",
          "The burden is shared equally.",
          "The government bears the burden.",
          "Producers bear the entire burden."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers do not reduce quantity purchased when the price rises. Sellers can pass the full tax onto consumers via higher prices, so consumers bear the entire burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a competitive market, what determines the economic incidence of a tax?",
        "options": [
          "The number of products sold.",
          "The total revenue of the firms in the market.",
          "The relative elasticities of supply and demand.",
          "Whether the law says the buyer or the seller pays."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The economic burden of a tax falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic (responsive to price changes). The legal assignment (statutory incidence) does not determine the actual burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a $5 tax is placed on sellers and the market price increases by $3, who is bearing the larger portion of the tax?",
        "options": [
          "Consumers",
          "The government",
          "It is shared exactly 50/50.",
          "Sellers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price rose by $3, so consumers pay $3 more per unit. Sellers receive $3 more from consumers but must send $5 to the government, so they keep $2 less per unit. Consumers bear $3 of the tax, sellers bear $2 — consumers bear the larger portion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a 'tax wedge' represent on a supply and demand graph?",
        "options": [
          "The difference between the price paid by consumers and the price received by producers.",
          "The profit margin of the firm.",
          "The shift in the demand curve.",
          "The total amount of deadweight loss."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The tax wedge is the gap created by a tax between the price buyers pay (Pᵈ) and the price sellers receive (Pˢ). It equals the per‑unit tax amount."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following occurs when a tax is imposed on a market with highly elastic supply and highly elastic demand?",
        "options": [
          "The market price will not change.",
          "Consumers will bear the entire burden.",
          "The tax revenue will be maximized.",
          "The deadweight loss will be relatively large."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When both supply and demand are highly elastic, quantity falls sharply in response to a tax, creating a large deadweight loss (efficiency loss)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government wants to minimize the deadweight loss of a tax, it should tax goods where:",
        "options": [
          "The good is a luxury item.",
          "The price of the good is very high.",
          "Demand is very elastic.",
          "Supply and demand are relatively inelastic."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is smaller when supply and/or demand are inelastic because quantity changes little in response to the tax."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A tax on labor (income tax) is often argued to fall heavily on workers because:",
        "options": [
          "Workers are the ones who write the check to the government.",
          "The demand for labor is perfectly inelastic.",
          "Employers have no control over wages.",
          "The supply of labor is relatively inelastic compared to the demand for labor."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Labor supply is generally more inelastic than labor demand (workers have limited alternatives in the short run), so a larger portion of the tax burden tends to fall on workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an indirect tax, like a Sales Tax, differ from a direct tax, like Income Tax, in terms of shifting?",
        "options": [
          "Indirect taxes cannot be shifted.",
          "Indirect taxes are easier to shift to the consumer.",
          "Direct taxes are always shifted to the government.",
          "There is no difference in how they are shifted."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Indirect taxes (e.g., sales taxes, excise taxes) are levied on transactions and are often passed forward to consumers via higher prices. Direct taxes (e.g., income tax) are levied directly on individuals or firms and are harder to shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of a tax imposed on a market where supply is perfectly elastic?",
        "options": [
          "There is no deadweight loss.",
          "The price received by producers stays exactly the same.",
          "Consumers bear the entire burden.",
          "Sellers bear the entire burden."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With perfectly elastic supply, producers will not accept a lower net price; the entire tax is passed to consumers through a higher price, so consumers bear the full burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is 0.8, what is the value of the spending multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "10",
          "5",
          "4",
          "1.25"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Spending multiplier = 1 / (1 – MPC) = 1 / (1 – 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the tax multiplier always smaller in absolute value than the spending multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "Part of a tax cut is saved rather than spent in the first round.",
          "The government is less efficient at collecting taxes.",
          "Tax changes only affect the wealthy.",
          "Taxes are a leakage while spending is an injection."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The tax multiplier = –MPC / (1 – MPC). Because the initial tax change affects disposable income, and only the MPC portion of that income is spent in the first round, its total impact is smaller than an equal‑dollar direct spending change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) is 0.25, what is the tax multiplier?",

          "4",
          "-3",
          "-4",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MPS = 0.25 → MPC = 0.75. Tax multiplier = –MPC / MPS = –0.75 / 0.25 = –3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The government increases spending by $10 billion and increases taxes by $10 billion simultaneously. If the MPC is 0.9, what is the net effect on GDP?",
        "options": [
          "Increase of $10 billion",
          "No change in GDP",
          "Decrease of $10 billion",
          "Increase of $100 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Balanced‑budget multiplier = 1. ΔGDP = ΔG × multiplier + ΔT × tax multiplier = $10B × 10 + $10B × (–9) = $100B – $90B = $10B increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government wants to increase GDP by $100 million and the MPC is 0.75, how much should they increase government spending?",
        "options": [
          "$100 million",
          "$75 million",
          "$25 million",
          "$400 million"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Spending multiplier = 1 / (1 – 0.75) = 4. ΔG needed = ΔGDP / multiplier = $100 million / 4 = $25 million."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause the spending multiplier to increase?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in the MPS",
          "A decrease in the MPC",
          "A decrease in the MPS",
          "An increase in tax rates"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Spending multiplier = 1 / MPS. A decrease in MPS (which means an increase in MPC) raises the multiplier."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a tax cut of $20 billion leads to an eventual increase in GDP of $60 billion, what is the tax multiplier?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Tax multiplier = –MPC / (1 – MPC) = –0.5 / 0.5 = –1. ΔAD = –1 × (–$50M) = +$50 million."
