    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to nominal interest rates when there is an excess supply of money in the money market?",
        "options": [
          "Nominal interest rates increase",
          "Nominal interest rates remain unchanged",
          "Nominal interest rates decrease",
          "Nominal interest rates fluctuate randomly"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the money market, the interest rate is the price of money. An excess supply of money means that at the current interest rate, the quantity of money supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. To clear the market, lenders (suppliers of money) will compete by offering lower interest rates until the quantity demanded rises to meet the available supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the real interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "Always higher than nominal",
          "Equal to nominal rate",
          "Unrelated to inflation",
          "Adjusted for inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation. It represents the true cost of borrowing and the true return on saving, as it reflects the change in purchasing power. Formula: Real Interest Rate ≈ Nominal Interest Rate – Inflation Rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario would most likely cause lenders to demand higher nominal interest rates even if their required real return remains constant?",
        "options": [
          "The central bank raises reserve requirements",
          "The central bank announces expansionary monetary policy",
          "Productivity growth increases across the economy",
          "The government implements strict price controls"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the central bank announces expansionary monetary policy, lenders may anticipate higher future inflation. To maintain their desired real return, they will build this expected inflation into the loans they make, demanding a higher nominal interest rate (Nominal Rate = Real Rate + Expected Inflation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might the quantity of money demanded decrease when nominal interest rates increase?",
        "options": [
          "Decreased inflation",
          "Higher opportunity cost",
          "Increased liquidity",
          "Lower opportunity cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The interest rate represents the opportunity cost of holding money (which pays little or no interest) versus holding interest-bearing assets like bonds. When nominal interest rates rise, the opportunity cost of holding money increases, so people and firms will try to hold less money in their portfolios, decreasing the quantity of money demanded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is observing an increase in the supply of loanable funds. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in government borrowing",
          "A decrease in government borrowing",
          "A decrease in private savings",
          "An increase in private savings"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The supply of loanable funds comes from national savings (private + public). An increase in private savings directly increases the total pool of funds available for lending, shifting the supply curve to the right. A decrease in government borrowing (a smaller deficit or a larger surplus) increases public savings, which also increases the supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role do excess reserves play in the banking system?",
        "options": [
          "Limit money supply",
          "Reduce interest rates",
          "Increase reserve requirements",
          "Enable loan creation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Excess reserves are bank reserves held over and above the required minimum. These reserves provide the capacity for banks to create new loans. When a bank makes a loan, it creates a new deposit, expanding the money supply. Therefore, excess reserves are the raw material for credit creation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key determinant of the supply of loanable funds in the market?",
        "options": [
          "Foreign demand for domestic currency.",
          "Expectations of future borrowing needs.",
          "Government deficit spending.",
          "The savings rate."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The supply of loanable funds is primarily determined by national savings, which is driven by the savings rate of households, businesses, and the government (via its budget balance). A higher savings rate increases the supply of funds available for lending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm decides to take a loan for expansion. What could cause this action?",
        "options": [
          "The firm seeks to directly increase the money supply",
          "Real interest rates are negative, making borrowing attractive",
          "The firm aims to reduce its equity financing",
          "The firm wants to decrease its liquidity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A primary incentive for a firm to borrow (debt financing) is the cost of borrowing, represented by the real interest rate. If real interest rates are low or negative (when inflation exceeds the nominal rate), the real cost of repaying the loan is reduced or even beneficial. This makes borrowing an attractive means to finance expansion, as the expected return on the investment may exceed the low/negative real cost of capital."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Equity financing is best described as the process by which a firm raises funds by:",
        "options": [
          "Issuing shares of stock to the public.",
          "Selling off physical assets.",
          "Taking out bank loans.",
          "Borrowing money through issuing bonds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equity financing involves selling ownership stakes in the company (shares of stock) to investors. This is distinct from debt financing, which involves borrowing money (e.g., through loans or bonds) that must be repaid with interest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an open economy with a current account deficit of $50 billion and national savings of $200 billion, what must be the level of domestic investment?",
        "options": [
          "$50 billion",
          "$200 billion",
          "$250 billion",
          "$150 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The fundamental macroeconomic identity for an open economy is: National Savings (S) = Domestic Investment (I) + Net Capital Outflow (NCO). A current account deficit means the country is a net borrower from the rest of the world, so NCO is negative. Specifically, NCO = –(Current Account Balance). Therefore, S = I – CA. With S = $200B and CA = –$50B, then $200B = I – (–$50B) => I = $200B + $50B = $250B."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in foreign purchases of domestic assets affect the supply of loanable funds?",
        "options": [
          "The supply of loanable funds increases",
          "The supply of loanable funds remains constant",
          "The supply of loanable funds becomes unpredictable",
          "The supply of loanable funds decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The loanable funds market includes both domestic and foreign savers. When foreigners purchase domestic assets (like stocks or bonds), they are supplying their savings to the domestic financial market. This capital inflow increases the total pool of savings available for lending, shifting the supply of loanable funds to the right."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If M2 is $5,000 billion and M1 is $2,000 billion, what is the value of near monies in the economy?",
        "options": [
          "10,000 billion",
          "7,000 billion",
          "2,500 billion",
          "3,000 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Near monies are the components included in M2 but not in M1 (savings deposits, small time deposits, retail money market funds). Their value is calculated as: M2 – M1 = $5,000 billion – $2,000 billion = $3,000 billion."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when the real interest rate is above equilibrium in the loanable funds market?",
        "options": [
          "Decreased supply of loans",
          "A shortage of loanable funds",
          "A surplus of loanable funds",
          "Increased demand for loans"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If the real interest rate is above the market-clearing equilibrium, the quantity of loanable funds supplied by savers exceeds the quantity demanded by borrowers. This creates a surplus of loanable funds. Market pressure will then push the interest rate down toward equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A financial asset has the following characteristics: moderate liquidity, guaranteed but relatively low returns, and minimal default risk. This most likely describes:",
        "options": [
          "Cryptocurrency holdings",
          "Commodity futures contracts",
          "Common stocks of established companies",
          "Short-term government securities"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Short-term government securities (like Treasury bills) are highly liquid, have virtually no default risk (backed by the government), and provide guaranteed, low returns. 'Moderate liquidity' is a fit here compared to highly liquid cash, but they are more liquid than the other options listed. Their key traits are safety and low yield."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a decrease in transaction costs in the economy affect the demand for money, and why is this significant for economic transactions?",
        "options": [
          "Make the demand for money more volatile",
          "No effect on the demand for money",
          "Increase the demand for money",
          "Decrease the demand for money"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A key reason for holding money is to facilitate transactions. If transaction costs fall (e.g., due to better payment technology), people and firms can more easily and cheaply convert non-money assets into cash when needed. This reduces the need to hold large money balances for precautionary or transactions purposes, decreasing the overall demand for money."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of the inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Bond prices rise when interest rates fall",
          "Bond prices remain unchanged regardless of interest rate fluctuations",
          "Bond prices fall when interest rates fall",
          "Bond prices rise when interest rates increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond prices and market interest rates have an inverse relationship. When market interest rates fall, newly issued bonds pay lower yields, making existing bonds with their higher fixed coupon payments more attractive. The increased demand for existing bonds drives their prices up."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What happens to the equilibrium nominal interest rate if the demand for money increases while the supply remains constant?",
  "options": [
    "Interest rate remains unchanged",
    "Interest rate rises",
    "Interest rate falls",
    "Interest rate fluctuates randomly"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "In the money market, the nominal interest rate is the price that balances the quantity of money demanded and supplied. An increase in money demand (shifting the demand curve to the right) with a fixed money supply creates a shortage of money at the original interest rate. To eliminate the shortage, the interest rate must rise. A higher interest rate reduces the quantity of money demanded (due to the higher opportunity cost of holding cash) and restores equilibrium."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A country’s inflation rate increases from 2% to 4% while the nominal interest rate remains at 6%. What happens to the real interest rate?",
  "options": [
    "It stays the same",
    "It doubles",
    "It increases",
    "It decreases"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "The real interest rate is approximately equal to the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Initially, Real Rate ≈ 6% - 2% = 4%. After the change, Real Rate ≈ 6% - 4% = 2%. Therefore, the real interest rate decreases from 4% to 2%."

        "options": [
          "Leads to a shortage of funds",
          "Balances supply and demand",
          "Increases government debt",
          "Creates a surplus of funds"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The equilibrium real interest rate is the price at which the quantity of loanable funds supplied by savers equals the quantity demanded by borrowers. At this rate, the market clears—there is neither a shortage nor a surplus of funds."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the concept of liquidity in financial assets relate to the trade-off between accessibility and potential returns?",
        "options": [
          "The most illiquid assets consistently provide the lowest returns to compensate for their inaccessibility",
          "Liquidity and potential returns have no correlation; they are independent factors in asset valuation",
          "Increased liquidity always results in higher potential returns due to greater market participation",
          "Higher liquidity generally corresponds to lower potential returns, as more accessible assets tend to offer less yield"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "There is a fundamental trade-off between liquidity and return. Highly liquid assets (like cash and checking accounts) are easily accessible for transactions but offer little to no return. Less liquid assets (like long-term bonds or real estate) typically require investors to be compensated for the lack of accessibility and higher risk with a higher potential return (a liquidity premium)."
