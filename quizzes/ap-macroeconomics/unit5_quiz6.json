    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is most likely to increase the MPS of a population?",
        "options": [
          "Increased uncertainty about future job security.",
          "An increase in the availability of consumer credit.",
          "Expectations of high future inflation.",
          "A decrease in the real interest rate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Greater uncertainty about future income encourages precautionary saving, raising the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS). Easier credit, high expected inflation, or lower interest rates typically encourage spending rather than saving."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government increases taxes by $100 million and the MPC is 0.75, what is the final impact on Aggregate Demand?",
        "options": [
          "AD decreases by $400 million.",
          "AD decreases by $300 million.",
          "AD decreases by $100 million.",
          "AD increases by $300 million."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tax multiplier = –MPC / (1 – MPC) = –0.75 / 0.25 = –3. A $100 million tax increase reduces AD by $100 million × 3 = $300 million."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which income measure is used as the denominator when calculating the 'Personal Saving Rate'?",
        "options": [
          "Disposable Income.",
          "Gross Domestic Product (GDP).",
          "Personal Income.",
          "National Income."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Personal Saving Rate = (Personal Saving / Disposable Personal Income) × 100. Disposable income (after taxes) is the relevant base because it represents income available for spending or saving."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the Great Depression, many people lost their jobs, leading to a cycle of even less spending and more job losses. John Maynard Keynes proposed a solution to this problem. Which of the following best describes Keynes’ solution?",
        "options": [
          "The government should step in and increase spending to stimulate the economy.",
          "The government should reduce taxes and cut spending during a recession.",
          "The government should stop interfering with the economy and let it recover on its own.",
          "The government should focus only on enforcing contracts and protecting property rights."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Keynes argued that during a severe downturn, private sector demand may be insufficient. Government should increase spending (or cut taxes) to boost aggregate demand, break the cycle of declining income and employment, and stimulate recovery."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the government starts with a debt of $0. Then in year 1, there is a deficit of $100 billion, in year 2 there is a deficit of $60 billion, in year 3 there is a surplus of $40 billion, and in year 4 there is a deficit of $20 billion. What is government debt at the end of year 4?",
        "options": [
          "$20 billion.",
          "$140 billion.",
          "$180 billion.",
          "Somewhat greater than $220 billion, depending on the interest rate.",
          "Somewhat greater than $140 billion, depending on the interest rate."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Government debt accumulates deficits and is reduced by surpluses. Debt = $100B (year 1) + $60B (year 2) – $40B (year 3) + $20B (year 4) = $140 billion. Interest would add to debt, but the question asks for debt based only on the given surpluses/deficits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would *not* increase an existing budget deficit?",
        "options": [
          "an increase in interest on the government debt",
          "an increase in government expenditures on goods and services",
          "an increase in government transfer payments",
          "an increase in indirect taxes",
          "a decrease in investment income"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An increase in indirect taxes (e.g., sales taxes) raises government revenue, which reduces the deficit (or increases a surplus). All other options increase spending or lower revenue, widening the deficit."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following is equal to one?",
  "options": [
    "The elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve",
    "The spending (or expenditure) multiplier",
    "The money (or banking) multiplier",
    "The tax multiplier",
    "The balanced budget multiplier"
  ],
  "answer": "E",
  "explanation": "The balanced budget multiplier is 1. If government spending and taxes are increased by the same amount, aggregate demand increases by that amount because the spending multiplier (1/(1 – MPC)) is larger than the tax multiplier (–MPC/(1 – MPC)), resulting in a net multiplier of 1."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "There is relatively more crowding out as the result of expansionary fiscal policy when",
  "options": [
    "expansionary monetary policy accompanies the fiscal policy",
    "the investment demand curve is inelastic",
    "government spending improves profit expectations among businesses",
    "aggregate supply is vertical",
    "the investment demand curve is elastic"
  ],
  "answer": "E",
  "explanation": "Crowding out occurs when government borrowing raises interest rates, reducing private investment. If the investment demand curve is elastic, a given rise in interest rates causes a relatively large drop in investment spending, meaning crowding out is more pronounced."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Expansionary fiscal policy should shift the",
  "options": [
    "short run aggregate supply curve to the right.",
    "aggregate demand curve to the right.",
    "short run aggregate supply curve to the left.",
    "aggregate demand curve to the left."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy (increased government spending, tax cuts, or increased transfers) raises aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the right. It does not directly shift the short‑run aggregate supply curve, though it may indirectly affect costs over time."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Expansionary fiscal policy ________ the price level and ________ equilibrium real GDP.",
  "options": [
    "increases; increases",
    "increases; decreases",
    "decreases; decreases",
    "decreases; increases"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. In the short run, with an upward‑sloping SRAS curve, this raises both the price level and equilibrium real GDP."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If an increase in autonomous consumption spending of $10 million results in a $50 million increase in equilibrium real GDP, then",
  "options": [
    "the MPC is 0.75.",
    "the MPC is 0.8.",
    "the MPC is 0.9.",
    "the MPC is 0.5."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The spending multiplier = ΔGDP / ΔAutonomous spending = $50 million / $10 million = 5. Since multiplier = 1/(1 – MPC), we have 5 = 1/(1 – MPC) → 1 – MPC = 0.2 → MPC = 0.8."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Assume that the federal government gives a $5 billion tax cut and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.75. What happens to equilibrium GDP?",
  "options": [
    "There is a $15 billion increase in equilibrium GDP.",
    "There is a $20 billion decrease in equilibrium GDP.",
    "There is a $20 billion increase in equilibrium GDP.",
    "There is a $15 billion decrease in equilibrium GDP."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The tax multiplier = –MPC / (1 – MPC) = –0.75 / 0.25 = –3. A tax cut of $5 billion increases equilibrium GDP by $5 billion × 3 = $15 billion."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Suppose that the government allocates $1 billion for new roads. It also raises taxes by $1 billion to keep the deficit from growing. If the marginal propensity to consume = 0.9, what is the effect on equilibrium GDP?",
  "options": [
    "GDP increases by $1 billion.",
    "GDP does not change.",
    "GDP increases by $900 million.",
    "GDP increases by $10 billion."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "This is a balanced‑budget change: ΔG = $1 billion, ΔT = $1 billion. The balanced‑budget multiplier is 1, so equilibrium GDP increases by the amount of the spending increase ($1 billion). Mathematically: ΔGDP = ΔG × [1/(1 – MPC)] + ΔT × [–MPC/(1 – MPC)] = $1B × 10 + $1B × (–9) = $1B."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A federal budget deficit acts as an automatic stabiliser because",
  "options": [
    "Medicare payments increase during expansionary periods.",
    "unemployment benefit payments decrease during a recession.",
    "government tax revenues decrease during a recession.",
    "tax receipts decrease during expansionary periods."
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Automatic stabilizers work without new legislation: during a recession, incomes fall, so tax revenues decrease automatically (reducing the tax burden), while government spending on transfers like unemployment benefits increases. This helps cushion the decline in aggregate demand. Option C describes the revenue side of this stabilizing effect."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Suppose that the federal budget is balanced when GDP is at potential GDP. If equilibrium GDP falls below potential,",
  "options": [
    "the budget will remain balanced.",
    "tax revenues will increase automatically.",
    "this will result in a budget deficit.",
    "transfer payments will decrease automatically."
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "When equilibrium GDP falls below potential (a recession), incomes decline, causing tax revenues to fall automatically and transfer payments (e.g., unemployment benefits) to rise. These automatic stabilizers turn a balanced budget into a deficit, which helps cushion the downturn."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If the economy grows, the government's budget position should automatically:",
  "options": [
    "Worsen",
    "Improve",
    "Stay the same",
    "Decrease with inflation"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "During economic growth, incomes and profits rise, increasing tax revenues automatically. At the same time, spending on transfer payments (like unemployment benefits) tends to fall. These automatic stabilizers improve the government's budget position (smaller deficit or larger surplus)."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Fiscal drag occurs when:",
  "options": [
    "Tax bands do not increase with inflation",
    "Tax rates move inversely with inflation",
    "Government spending falls to reduce aggregate demand",
    "Tax bands increase with inflation"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Fiscal drag happens when tax brackets (bands) are not adjusted for inflation. As nominal incomes rise with inflation, taxpayers move into higher tax brackets, increasing the average tax rate and reducing disposable income, which can slow economic growth—even without an explicit tax rate increase."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Imagine there is no tax on income up to //$10,000; after that, there is a tax of 50%. What is the average tax rate on an income of //$20,000?",
  "options": [
    "//$5,000",
    "20%",
    "25%",
    "//$10,000"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Taxable income above //$10,000 = //$10,000. Tax = 50% of //$10,000 = //$5,000. Average tax rate = Total tax / Total income = //$5,000 / //$20,000 = 0.25 = 25%."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the main categories of the federal government outlays?",
        "options": [
          "transfer payments, expenditures on goods and services, and debt interest",
          "indirect taxes, farmers' subsidies, and debt interest",
          "personal income taxes, expenditures on goods and services, and debt interest",
          "investment income, debt interest and transfer payments",
          "none of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The three primary categories of federal outlays are: 1) Transfer payments (Social Security, Medicare, etc.), 2) Expenditures on goods and services (defense, infrastructure), and 3) Interest on the national debt."

          "provide incentives to encourage investment",
          "oversee revenue equalization among the provinces"
        ],
        "explanation": "Before the Keynesian revolution and WWII, the federal budget was viewed mainly as a tool to fund necessary government operations (salaries, defense, infrastructure), not as an instrument for macroeconomic stabilization.",
