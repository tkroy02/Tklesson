    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The aggregate production function shows that an economy increases its real GDP in the short run by:",
        "options": [
          "developing new technologies",
          "exploring for new deposits of natural resources",
          "increasing its physical capital stock",
          "using more labor"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the short run, technology and natural resources are typically fixed. Increasing physical capital stock takes time (investment and installation). The most immediately variable input is labor—firms can hire more workers or increase hours worked. Thus, short-run output increases primarily come from using more labor, moving along the existing production function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As labour increases, there is a __________",
        "options": [
          "movement along the aggregate production function and real GDP will decrease less with each additional increase in labor.",
          "movement along the aggregate production function, but there is no shift in it.",
          "movement along the aggregate production function and real GDP will increase less with each additional increase in labor.",
          "shift of the aggregate production function, but no movement along it."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increasing labor while holding capital and technology constant represents movement along the fixed aggregate production function. Due to diminishing marginal returns to labor, each additional worker adds less to total output than the previous one, so real GDP increases at a decreasing rate. The function only shifts if technology improves or capital increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The real wage rate measures the __________",
        "options": [
          "dollar value of what a worker could earn in another job.",
          "dollar value of an hour of work.",
          "average weekly earnings in dollars of a worker.",
          "quantity of goods and services that an hour of work will buy."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Real wage = Nominal wage ÷ Price level. It measures purchasing power—how many goods and services a worker can buy with their earnings. This distinguishes it from nominal (money) wage, which is simply the dollar amount. Real wages determine living standards and labor supply decisions."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If the price level increases, but workers' money wage remain constant, which of the following is TRUE?\ni. The quantity of labour demanded will increase.\nii. The real wage rate will decrease\niii. The demand for labor curve shifts rightward",
  "options": [
    "i only",
    "ii only",
    "i and ii only",
    "ii and iii only",
    "i, ii, and iii"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Constant money wage with higher prices means real wage = W/P decreases (ii is true). Lower real wage makes labor cheaper for firms, increasing quantity of labor demanded (i is true). This is a movement along the existing labor demand curve, not a shift. The labor demand curve itself shifts only if factors like productivity, technology, or output prices relative to input prices change. Therefore, iii is false."

  "question": "Using the Rule of 70, if the country of Flowerdom's current growth rate of real GDP per person is 7 percent a year, how long will it take the country's real GDP per person to double?",
  "options": [
    "49 years",
    "1 year",
    "2 years",
    "10 years",
    "7 years"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "According to the Rule of 70, the doubling time ≈ 70 ÷ annual growth rate (in percentage). Here: 70 ÷ 7 = 10 years. This means that at a 7% annual growth rate, Flowerdom's standard of living (measured by real GDP per person) will double approximately every 10 years. The Rule of 70 demonstrates the power of compound growth—even modest differences in growth rates lead to large differences in living standards over decades."

  "question": "Consider two countries with identical initial levels of GDP per capita. Country A implements policies that significantly increase its national savings rate. Country B implements policies that significantly increase immigration of highly educated workers. According to standard growth theory, which country is likely to achieve higher sustainable growth in GDP per capita in the long run, and why?",
  "options": [
    "Country B, because human capital accumulation can overcome diminishing returns to physical capital and directly increase total factor productivity.",
    "Country A, because higher savings provide ample loanable funds needed for investment, and always translate directly into higher long-run growth rates.",
    "Both will achieve identical growth rates because they both increase inputs to production.",
    "Country A, because capital deepening has more immediate effects on output than human capital development."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Standard growth theory suggests that while increasing the savings rate (Country A) leads to more physical capital and a higher level of output per capita, it does not permanently increase the growth rate due to diminishing returns to capital. In contrast, increases in human capital through immigration of skilled workers (Country B) can enhance total factor productivity—skilled workers not only contribute labor but also bring knowledge, innovation, and organizational improvements that can lead to sustained growth. Human capital can complement technology adoption and creation, potentially generating increasing returns rather than diminishing ones."

  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Consider two countries with identical savings rates, depreciation rates, and initial levels of capital per worker. Country A invests heavily in broadband infrastructure that improves information flow and market access. Country B invests an equivalent amount in routine maintenance of existing roads. According to modern growth theory, which country is likely to experience higher long-run growth in output per worker, and why?",
  "options": [
    "Country A, because its investment creates positive network externalities and increases total factor productivity",
    "Country B, because maintaining existing capital is more efficient than building new capital",
    "Both will grow at the same rate since investment levels are equal",
    "Country B, because infrastructure maintenance has more certain returns than new technology investments"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Country A's investment in broadband infrastructure creates network externalities—each additional user makes the network more valuable for all users. This increases total factor productivity (TFP) by improving information flow, reducing transaction costs, and enabling new business models. TFP growth is the primary driver of sustained long-run growth in modern endogenous growth theory. While Country B's maintenance preserves existing capital (important for the capital stock level), it doesn't significantly boost TFP. This illustrates how the type of investment matters as much as the quantity for long-term growth."

        "options": [
          "population growth; technological advances",
          "growth in real GDP per person; growth rate of capital",
          "population growth; increases in real GDP",
          "growth in real GDP per person; technological advances"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Labor force growth comes primarily from population growth (demographics) and labor force participation rates. Labor productivity (output per worker) grows mainly through technological progress, which improves how inputs are combined. While capital accumulation also boosts productivity, sustained productivity growth ultimately requires technological innovation."

        "question": "If capital per hour decreases, real GDP per hour of labor:",
        "options": [
          "decreases because the level of technology decreases",
          "increases because the level of technology increases",
          "decreases for a given level of technology",
          "increases for a given level of technology"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Capital per worker (capital deepening) is a key determinant of labor productivity. With less capital to work with, each worker produces less output, assuming technology is unchanged. This represents a movement along the production function, not a shift. Technology could potentially offset this, but the question specifies 'for a given level of technology.'"
