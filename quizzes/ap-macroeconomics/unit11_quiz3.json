    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following transactions would NOT be recorded in a country’s current account?",
        "options": [
          "Interest payments received on loans to foreign entities",
          "Foreign aid sent to developing nations",
          "Revenue from goods exported to other countries",
          "A domestic firm’s purchase of a factory in a foreign country"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The purchase of a foreign factory by a domestic firm is recorded in the capital/financial account as foreign direct investment (outflow). The current account includes: 1) Trade in goods and services (exports/imports), 2) Investment income (interest, dividends), and 3) Net transfers (foreign aid, remittances)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a potential consequence of a prolonged current account surplus?",
        "options": [
          "Increased inflation",
          "Higher unemployment",
          "Currency appreciation",
          "Reduced foreign reserves"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A prolonged current account surplus means the country is exporting more than importing, creating net demand for its currency as foreigners need it to pay for exports. This increased demand causes currency appreciation. While surpluses can also lead to inflationary pressures from excess demand, currency appreciation is the most direct consequence in forex markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the appreciation of a country's currency typically affect its net exports and aggregate demand?",
        "options": [
          "Decreases net exports but increases aggregate demand",
          "Has no significant impact on net exports or aggregate demand",
          "Decreases net exports and reduces aggregate demand",
          "Increases net exports and stimulates aggregate demand"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation makes domestic goods more expensive for foreigners (reducing exports) and foreign goods cheaper for domestic consumers (increasing imports). Both decrease net exports (NX = X - M). Since NX is a component of aggregate demand (AD = C + I + G + NX), a decrease in NX reduces aggregate demand, all else equal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following are determinants of exchange rates except:",
        "options": [
          "Consumer tastes for domestic versus foreign goods.",
          "The balance of trade surplus or deficit of a country.",
          "Relative income levels between countries.",
          "Speculation about future interest rates."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The balance of trade (part of current account) is an outcome or consequence of exchange rates rather than a direct determinant. Exchange rates are determined by factors like: 1) Relative interest rates (capital flows), 2) Relative inflation rates (PPP), 3) Speculation, 4) Government intervention, 5) Relative income/economic growth (affecting import demand). The trade balance adjusts to the exchange rate, not vice versa in determination."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the foreign exchange market, how does an increase in the exchange rate affect the quantity of dollars demanded?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the quantity demanded because producers seek to supply more dollars.",
          "It decreases the quantity demanded due to the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.",
          "It has no impact on quantity demanded, which is solely determined by income levels.",
          "It temporarily increases demand before buyers adjust their expectations."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The demand curve for dollars is downward-sloping: as the price of dollars (exchange rate) increases, the quantity of dollars demanded decreases. This is because a higher exchange rate (e.g., more yen per dollar) makes U.S. goods more expensive for Japanese buyers, reducing their demand for dollars to purchase U.S. exports."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of a currency appreciating?",
        "options": [
          "Exports become cheaper for foreign buyers.",
          "Exports become more expensive for foreign buyers.",
          "Foreign investment in the domestic market decreases.",
          "The trade balance always moves into surplus."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation means each unit of domestic currency buys more foreign currency. When domestic goods are priced in domestic currency and converted to foreign currency, they become more expensive for foreign buyers. This reduces export competitiveness and typically worsens the trade balance (moves toward deficit), though not always immediately due to the J-curve effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the foreign exchange market, what occurs at the equilibrium exchange rate?",
        "options": [
          "Quantity of currency demanded equals quantity supplied",
          "Interest rates equalize between countries",
          "Trade deficit equals trade surplus",
          "Purchasing power parity is achieved"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like any market, the foreign exchange market reaches equilibrium where quantity of currency demanded equals quantity supplied. This equilibrium exchange rate balances all transactions requiring currency exchange: exports/imports, capital flows, speculation, etc. PPP and interest rate parity are theoretical long-run conditions, not necessarily met at short-run equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does speculation play in the foreign exchange market?",
        "options": [
          "Reduces market liquidity",
          "Stabilizes exchange rates",
          "Eliminates currency risk",
          "Influences currency value"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Speculation—buying or selling currencies based on expected future price movements—directly influences currency values by affecting supply and demand. While it can sometimes stabilize rates (if speculators bet against extreme movements), it often amplifies volatility and can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies (e.g., currency attacks). Speculation doesn't eliminate risk; it often assumes risk for potential profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's central bank unexpectedly lowers interest rates, what adjustment would most likely occur in the foreign exchange market to restore equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "The currency appreciates until inflation decreases",
          "The currency depreciates until net exports increase sufficiently",
          "The currency depreciates until interest rates rise again",
          "The currency appreciates until capital inflows decrease sufficiently"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower interest rates reduce returns on domestic assets, causing capital outflows as investors seek higher returns elsewhere. This increases supply of domestic currency in forex markets, causing depreciation. Depreciation stimulates net exports, which can boost economic activity, potentially reducing the need for further rate cuts. The adjustment continues until the new exchange rate balances the lower interest rate environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country experiences a significant increase in domestic investment opportunities. If the central bank maintains a neutral monetary policy, what is the most likely effect on international capital flows and the domestic loanable funds market?",
        "options": [
          "Real interest rates rise, prompting domestic capital outflows",
          "Real interest rates fall, causing domestic capital outflows",
          "Real interest rates remain stable with balanced capital flows",
          "Real interest rates rise, attracting foreign capital inflows"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Increased investment demand shifts the demand for loanable funds rightward. With neutral monetary policy (unchanged money supply), this raises real interest rates. Higher interest rates attract foreign capital seeking better returns, causing capital inflows. These inflows help finance the increased investment without requiring higher domestic saving alone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an open economy, what happens when a country's real interest rate is higher than that of other countries?",
        "options": [
          "Currency depreciates",
          "Exports increase",
          "Capital inflows increase",
          "Domestic savings decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher real interest rates make domestic financial assets more attractive to foreign investors. This causes capital inflows as investors buy domestic assets, requiring them to purchase domestic currency. While this leads to currency appreciation (not depreciation) and may reduce exports, the immediate effect is increased capital inflows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which policy change can lead to an appreciation of a country's currency?",
        "options": [
          "Increased tariffs",
          "Higher interest rates",
          "Lower government spending",
          "Expansionary fiscal policy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher interest rates attract foreign capital seeking better returns, increasing demand for the domestic currency and causing appreciation. Increased tariffs might temporarily improve trade balance but often lead to retaliation. Lower government spending (contractionary fiscal) might reduce import demand but also slow growth. Expansionary fiscal policy typically increases imports and may lead to depreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A developing country experiences a sudden increase in foreign portfolio investment. What is the most likely short-term impact on its balance of payments accounts?",
        "options": [
          "Increased merchandise trade surplus",
          "Decreased current account deficit",
          "Reduced official reserves",
          "Increased capital and financial account surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Foreign portfolio investment (purchases of stocks, bonds) represents capital inflows, recorded as a credit in the capital and financial account, increasing its surplus (or reducing deficit). This inflow may finance a current account deficit but doesn't directly change it immediately. Official reserves might increase if the central bank intervenes to prevent currency appreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is experiencing a decrease in the value of its currency. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "options": [
          "A reduction in the country's income tax rates",
          "An increase in the global supply of oil",
          "A decrease in the country's inflation rate",
          "An increase in consumer tastes for foreign-produced goods"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Increased preference for foreign goods raises import demand, requiring domestic consumers to sell domestic currency to buy foreign currency. This increases supply of domestic currency in forex markets, causing depreciation. Lower inflation (C) would typically cause appreciation via PPP. Oil supply increase (B) might affect oil-importing/exporting countries differently. Tax cuts (A) might stimulate imports but effect is indirect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of a currency being undervalued in the foreign exchange market?",
        "options": [
          "Increased supply",
          "Decreased demand",
          "Currency shortage",
          "Currency surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If a currency is undervalued (priced below its equilibrium or PPP value), it becomes artificially cheap. This creates excess demand for the currency (as it's a bargain) and insufficient supply (as holders are reluctant to sell at low prices). The result is a currency shortage—quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at the undervalued price. This is why black markets develop when official rates are artificially low."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the U.S. balance of payments records a current account surplus of $100 billion and a capital account outflow of $120 billion, what must the official reserves account show to balance the payments?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease of $20 billion in official reserves",
          "A decrease of $100 billion in official reserves",
          "An increase of $120 billion in official reserves",
          "An increase of $20 billion in official reserves"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Balance of payments identity: Current Account + Capital Account + Official Reserves Account = 0. CA surplus (+100) + Capital outflow (-120, negative as it's an outflow) + ORA = 0. +100 -120 + ORA = 0 → ORA = +20. Positive ORA means increase in official reserves (central bank buys foreign currency). The $20 billion increase bridges the gap between the $100B surplus and $120B outflow."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the exchange rate changes from 1.2 euros per dollar to 1.5 euros per dollar, which of the following statements is correct?",
        "options": [
          "The exchange rate has remained constant in real terms",
          "The dollar has depreciated against the euro",
          "The euro has appreciated against the dollar",
          "The dollar has appreciated against the euro"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Increasing from €1.2/$ to €1.5/$ means each dollar buys more euros, so the dollar has appreciated (euro has depreciated). Percentage appreciation = (1.5-1.2)/1.2 = 25%. Real appreciation/depreciation would require knowing price level changes; this question gives only nominal rates."

          "Foreign direct investment",
          "Trade in goods",
          "Current transfers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Foreign direct investment (FDI) is recorded in the capital/financial account, not the current account. The current account includes: 1) Trade in goods, 2) Trade in services, 3) Primary income (investment income from abroad), and 4) Secondary income (current transfers like foreign aid, remittances)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a decrease in remittances affect the current account?",
        "options": [
          "Reduces current account surplus",
          "Increases capital account",
          "Decreases financial account",
          "Increases trade balance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Remittances (money sent home by workers abroad) are recorded as credits in the current account under secondary income (transfers). A decrease in remittances reduces this credit, worsening the current account balance (reducing surplus or increasing deficit). This doesn't directly affect the capital account or trade balance (goods/services)."

        "options": [
          "The preference shift will have little impact on currency values since it only affects consumer behavior domestically in Europe.",
          "Foreign demand for dollars increases, leading to an appreciation of the dollar and an improvement in the U.S. current account balance.",
          "Increased European demand for U.S. goods will lead to a reduction in foreign capital inflows, causing the dollar to depreciate.",
          "U.S. goods become more expensive in Europe, causing the dollar to depreciate due to decreased export volumes."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased European preference for U.S. goods raises demand for U.S. exports. Europeans need dollars to pay for these goods, increasing demand for dollars in forex markets → dollar appreciates. Higher exports improve the U.S. trade balance (part of current account). The appreciation may eventually reduce export competitiveness, but the initial effect is dollar appreciation and current account improvement."
