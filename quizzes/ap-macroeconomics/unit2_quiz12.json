      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an economy, S = 200, T = 150, M = 100, I = 180, G = 170, X = 80. What must happen to achieve equilibrium if full employment requires total injections = 500?",
        "options": [
          "Increase exports by 70",
          "Decrease taxes by 30",
          "Increase government spending by 70",
          "Decrease savings by 50"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Current injections = I + G + X = 180 + 170 + 80 = 430. Target injections = 500, shortfall = 70. Increasing G by 70 raises injections to 500, moving the economy toward full employment equilibrium."

          "Nominal interest rates rise to combat falling prices",
          "Consumers delay purchases expecting lower future prices"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Deflation encourages consumers to postpone spending because they expect prices to fall further, reducing current aggregate demand and worsening economic slowdown."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of unemployment is most directly associated with economic downturns?",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary focus of the Producer Price Index (PPI)?",
        "options": [
          "Total employment levels",
          "Interest rates",
          "Prices received by producers",
          "Prices paid by consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The PPI tracks changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, serving as a leading indicator for consumer price inflation."

          "Unemployment increases while inflation decreases",
          "Unemployment and inflation both increase simultaneously",
          "Unemployment and inflation remain constant throughout the phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the economy expands, unemployment falls due to higher demand for labor, while rising demand for goods and services pushes inflation upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What economic indicator would most clearly distinguish between a recession and a depression in the business cycle?",

          "Interest rates set by the central bank",
          "Duration and severity of GDP contraction"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A depression is a severe, prolonged recession characterized by deeper and longer declines in real GDP, higher unemployment, and greater economic disruption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is observing an increase in the price index that measures the average price level of goods and services that make up GDP. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "options": [
          "Rise in GDP price deflator",
          "Fall in GDP price deflator",
          "Rise in Consumer Price Index",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a business cycle contraction?",
        "options": [
          "A phase marked by a significant surge in exports boosting overall economic production.",
          "A phase during which government spending increases substantially to drive expansion.",
          "A period when real GDP declines following a peak due to reduced consumer and business spending.",
          "A period in which the economy experiences rapid growth and increased output."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A contraction (or recession) is a phase of declining real GDP, reduced economic activity, and often rising unemployment following a business cycle peak."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following are costs of inflation except",
        "options": [

          "Shoe-leather costs from efforts to avoid inflation’s effects",
          "Menu costs related to changing prices frequently",
          "Loss of purchasing power as the value of money decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inflation typically discourages saving because real returns may be low or negative; higher nominal interest rates often do not fully compensate for inflation."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the GDP deflator increased from 105 to 110.25 while the CPI increased from 210 to 226.8, what can be concluded about the relative prices in the economy?",
        "options": [
          "Overall inflation exceeded consumer goods inflation",
          "There was no change in relative prices",
          "Consumer goods inflation exceeded overall inflation",
          "Investment goods prices fell relative to consumer goods"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "GDP deflator growth = (110.25 − 105)/105 = 5%. CPI growth = (226.8 − 210)/210 = 8%. CPI rose faster, so consumer goods inflation exceeded overall domestic inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might the CPI not accurately reflect the cost of living?",
        "options": [
          "It adjusts for seasonal changes",
          "It excludes all imported goods",
          "It uses a fixed basket of goods",
          "It includes all government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The CPI uses a fixed basket of goods and services, which does not account for consumer substitution toward cheaper alternatives when prices change (substitution bias)."

          "Net Factor Income from Abroad.",
          "Statistical Discrepancy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "NNP = GNP − Depreciation (Consumption of Fixed Capital). This adjusts for the wear and tear of capital, reflecting the net output available for consumption or new investment without reducing the capital stock."

          "A U.S. government contractor builds a military base in Texas."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GNP includes income earned by U.S. factors of production abroad, such as profits from a U.S.-owned company overseas (option B). GDP only counts production within U.S. borders, so the Japanese profits are excluded from GDP but included in GNP. Options A, C, and D represent economic activity within the U.S. and are included in both GDP and GNP."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country's Gross National Product (GNP) is \\$5 trillion. If consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) is \\$400 billion and indirect business taxes minus subsidies total \\$300 billion, what is the Net National Income (NNI) at factor cost?",
        "options": [
          "\\$4.3 trillion",
          "\\$4.6 trillion",
          "\\$4.9 trillion",
          "\\$5.3 trillion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "NNI at factor cost = GNP − Depreciation − (Indirect taxes − Subsidies). Here: GNP = \\$5 trillion, depreciation = \\$0.4 trillion, net indirect taxes = \\$0.3 trillion. So NNP at market prices = \\$5 − \\$0.4 = \\$4.6 trillion. Subtract net indirect taxes: \\$4.6 − \\$0.3 = \\$4.3 trillion. This is NNI at factor cost."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Discouraged workers are not counted in the labor force. If they increase but the labor force stays constant, the unemployment rate is unaffected because they are neither employed nor officially unemployed."
