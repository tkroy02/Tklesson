    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an economy, S = 200, T = 150, M = 100, I = 180, G = 170, X = 80. What must happen to achieve equilibrium if full employment requires total injections = 500?",
        "options": [
          "A Increase exports by 70",
          "B Decrease taxes by 30",
          "C Increase government spending by 70",
          "D Decrease savings by 50"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Current injections = I + G + X = 180 + 170 + 80 = 430. Target injections = 500, shortfall = 70. Increasing G by 70 raises injections to 500, moving the economy toward full employment equilibrium."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In 2021, nominal GDP = $1,200; GDP deflator (2020 base) = 120. In 2022, nominal GDP = $1,500; GDP deflator = 125. If population grew 2% from 2021 to 2022, what was the approximate percentage change in real GDP per capita?",
        "options": [
          "A 18%",
          "B 20%",
          "C 22%",
          "D 15%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Real GDP 2021 = 1,200 / 1.20 = 1,000. Real GDP 2022 = 1,500 / 1.25 = 1,200. Real GDP growth = 20%. Real GDP per capita growth ≈ 20% − 2% (population growth) = 18%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "GDP = $5,000. Consumption of fixed capital = $400. Net factor income from abroad = −$50. Indirect business taxes = $300. What is Net National Product (NNP)?",
        "options": [
          "A $4,650",
          "B $4,550",
          "C $4,250",
          "D $5,450"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GNP = GDP + NFIA = 5,000 + (−50) = 4,950. NNP = GNP − Depreciation = 4,950 − 400 = 4,550."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of structural unemployment?",
        "options": [
          "A A typewriter manufacturer losing their job",
          "B A new graduate entering the job market",
          "C A construction worker between projects",
          "D A temporary layoff during a recession"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Structural unemployment occurs when workers' skills do not match job requirements due to technological change or shifts in the economy, such as the decline of typewriter manufacturing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a period of deflation, which of the following would most likely occur?",
        "options": [
          "A The real value of debt decreases",
          "B Aggregate supply shifts rightward",
          "C Nominal interest rates rise to combat falling prices",
          "D Consumers delay purchases expecting lower future prices"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Deflation encourages consumers to postpone spending because they expect prices to fall further, reducing current aggregate demand and worsening economic slowdown."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of unemployment is most directly associated with economic downturns?",
        "options": [
          "A Structural unemployment",
          "B Frictional unemployment",
          "C Cyclical unemployment",
          "D Seasonal unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cyclical unemployment results from insufficient aggregate demand during recessions and disappears during economic expansions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary focus of the Producer Price Index (PPI)?",
        "options": [
          "A Total employment levels",
          "B Interest rates",
          "C Prices received by producers",
          "D Prices paid by consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The PPI tracks changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, serving as a leading indicator for consumer price inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the relationship between unemployment and inflation typically change during the expansionary phase of the business cycle?",

          "A Unemployment decreases while inflation tends to increase",
          "B Unemployment increases while inflation decreases",
          "C Unemployment and inflation both increase simultaneously",
          "D Unemployment and inflation remain constant throughout the phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the economy expands, unemployment falls due to higher demand for labor, while rising demand for goods and services pushes inflation upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What economic indicator would most clearly distinguish between a recession and a depression in the business cycle?",
        "options": [
          "A Stock market performance",
          "B Consumer confidence index",
          "C Interest rates set by the central bank",
          "D Duration and severity of GDP contraction"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A depression is a severe, prolonged recession characterized by deeper and longer declines in real GDP, higher unemployment, and greater economic disruption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is observing an increase in the price index that measures the average price level of goods and services that make up GDP. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "options": [
          "A Rise in GDP price deflator",
          "B Fall in GDP price deflator",
          "C Rise in Consumer Price Index",
          "D Fall in Consumer Price Index"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The GDP deflator measures the average price level of all domestically produced goods and services. An increase indicates rising overall prices in the economy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a business cycle contraction?",
        "options": [
          "A A phase marked by a significant surge in exports boosting overall economic production.",
          "B A phase during which government spending increases substantially to drive expansion.",
          "C A period when real GDP declines following a peak due to reduced consumer and business spending.",
          "D A period in which the economy experiences rapid growth and increased output."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A contraction (or recession) is a phase of declining real GDP, reduced economic activity, and often rising unemployment following a business cycle peak."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following are costs of inflation except",
        "options": [
          "A Increased savings due to higher interest rates on deposits",
          "B Shoe-leather costs from efforts to avoid inflation’s effects",
          "C Menu costs related to changing prices frequently",
          "D Loss of purchasing power as the value of money decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inflation typically discourages saving because real returns may be low or negative; higher nominal interest rates often do not fully compensate for inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the GDP deflator increased from 105 to 110.25 while the CPI increased from 210 to 226.8, what can be concluded about the relative prices in the economy?",
        "options": [
          "A Overall inflation exceeded consumer goods inflation",
          "B There was no change in relative prices",
          "C Consumer goods inflation exceeded overall inflation",
          "D Investment goods prices fell relative to consumer goods"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "GDP deflator growth = (110.25 − 105)/105 = 5%. CPI growth = (226.8 − 210)/210 = 8%. CPI rose faster, so consumer goods inflation exceeded overall domestic inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might the CPI not accurately reflect the cost of living?",
        "options": [
          "A It adjusts for seasonal changes",
          "B It excludes all imported goods",
          "C It uses a fixed basket of goods",
          "D It includes all government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The CPI uses a fixed basket of goods and services, which does not account for consumer substitution toward cheaper alternatives when prices change (substitution bias)."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following transactions would increase the 'Investment' (I) component of US GDP?",
  "options": [

    "B A logistics company buys a fleet of used trucks from a dealership.",
    "C A household spends $5,000 on a vacation to Hawaii.",
    "D A restaurant buys a newly manufactured pizza oven."
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Only purchases of new capital goods (like a new pizza oven) are included in Investment (I) for GDP. Stock purchases (A) are financial transactions, used goods (B) are not new production, and vacations (C) are consumption."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A country's Net National Product (NNP) is calculated by subtracting which of the following from its GNP?",
  "options": [
    "A Consumption of Fixed Capital.",
    "B Indirect Business Taxes.",
    "C Net Factor Income from Abroad.",
    "D Statistical Discrepancy."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "NNP = GNP − Depreciation (Consumption of Fixed Capital). This adjusts for the wear and tear of capital, reflecting the net output available for consumption or new investment without reducing the capital stock."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following would be counted in the United States’ Gross National Product (GNP) but not in its Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?",
  "options": [
    "A A Toyota factory in Kentucky pays wages to American workers.",
    "B An American software company earns profits from its office in Japan.",
    "C A German tourist spends money in New York City.",
    "D A U.S. government contractor builds a military base in Texas."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "GNP includes income earned by U.S. factors of production abroad, such as profits from a U.S.-owned company overseas (option B). GDP only counts production within U.S. borders, so the Japanese profits are excluded from GDP but included in GNP. Options A, C, and D represent economic activity within the U.S. and are included in both GDP and GNP."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A country's Gross National Product (GNP) is $5 trillion. If consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) is $400 billion and indirect business taxes minus subsidies total $300 billion, what is the Net National Income (NNI) at factor cost?",
  "options": [
    "A $4.3 trillion",
    "B $4.6 trillion",
    "C $4.9 trillion",
    "D $5.3 trillion"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "NNI at factor cost = GNP − Depreciation − (Indirect taxes − Subsidies). Here: GNP = $5 trillion, depreciation = $0.4 trillion, net indirect taxes = $0.3 trillion. So NNP at market prices = $5 − $0.4 = $4.6 trillion. Subtract net indirect taxes: $4.6 − $0.3 = $4.3 trillion. This is NNI at factor cost."

        "question": "What happens to the unemployment rate if the number of discouraged workers increases, assuming the labor force remains constant?",
        "options": [
          "A Unemployment rate becomes negative",
          "B Unemployment rate decreases",
          "C Unemployment rate remains constant",
          "D Unemployment rate increases"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Discouraged workers are not counted in the labor force. If they increase but the labor force stays constant, the unemployment rate is unaffected because they are neither employed nor officially unemployed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are the Labor Force and Employment similar in economic terms?",
        "options": [
          "A Both are calculated using total population",
          "B Both are unaffected by economic conditions",
          "C Both decrease during economic expansions",
          "D Both relate to the working-age population"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Both labor force (employed + unemployed) and employment refer to portions of the working-age population actively participating in or available for work."
