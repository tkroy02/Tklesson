    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "With economic growth, the proportion of labour-force engaged in agriculture",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Remains unaffected",
          "Changes in an uncertain manner"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic growth typically involves structural transformation: as economies develop, labor shifts from agriculture to manufacturing and services. This occurs because agricultural productivity increases (fewer workers needed for food production), manufacturing and services offer higher wages, and consumer demand patterns change toward non-agricultural goods as incomes rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The capital-output ratio in a country during the different phases of growth",
        "options": [
          "Remains unchanged",
          "Fluctuates widely",
          "Changes within narrow limits",
          "Shows a secular declining trend"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The capital-output ratio (capital needed to produce a unit of output) generally shows a secular (long-term) declining trend with economic development. As technology improves and economies become more efficient, they can produce more output with less capital. This reflects increasing total factor productivity and technological progress over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Among the following determinants of growth, which one is a non-economic factor?",
        "options": [
          "Natural resources",
          "Population growth",
          "Favourable legislation",
          "Capital accumulation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Favourable legislation is a non-economic (institutional/political) factor. While natural resources, population, and capital are traditional economic inputs to production, legislation represents the institutional framework—property rights, rule of law, regulatory environment—that shapes economic incentives and efficiency. Institutions are crucial for growth but are considered non-economic inputs."

      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following is most likely to cause a 'brain drain,' negatively impacting a country's human capital?",
  "options": [
    "An increase in the number of research universities.",
    "Expansion of high-speed internet in rural areas.",
    "A decrease in the retirement age.",
    "Political instability."
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Brain drain refers to the emigration of highly skilled and educated individuals (such as scientists, engineers, doctors, and academics) from one country to another. Political instability—characterized by conflict, weak governance, human rights abuses, or economic uncertainty—creates strong push factors that drive educated professionals to seek stability, security, and better opportunities abroad, depleting the home country's human capital."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a boom",
        "options": [
          "Unemployment is likely to fall",
          "Prices are likely to fall",
          "Demand is likely to fall",
          "Imports are likely to fall"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During an economic boom (expansion phase of the business cycle), aggregate demand is high, production increases, and firms hire more workers. Therefore, unemployment typically falls as the economy operates closer to or beyond potential output. Prices generally rise due to demand pressures, demand increases, and imports often rise as domestic consumption increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sustainable economic growth depends upon",
        "options": [
          "Investment, not saving",
          "Saving, not investment",
          "Both saving and investment",
          "Neither saving nor investment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Sustainable economic growth requires both saving and investment. Saving provides the funds (in the loanable funds market) that finance investment in physical and human capital. Investment transforms savings into productive assets that increase future productive capacity. They are two sides of the same process: saving supplies funds, investment demands them for growth-enhancing projects."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Whose principle was that uncontained increase in population would eventually reduce living standards?",
        "options": [
          "Thomas Malthus",
          "Adam Smith",
          "David Ricardo",
          "John Maynard Keynes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thomas Malthus argued in his 1798 'Essay on the Principle of Population' that population grows geometrically while food production grows arithmetically, leading to a 'Malthusian trap' where population growth eventually outstrips food supply, causing famine, disease, and reduced living standards. His pessimistic view contrasted with later economists who emphasized technological progress."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic growth:",
        "options": [
          "has some negative externalities",
          "has no negative externalities",
          "can only be achieved in a capitalist system",
          "conflicts with the goal of full employment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While economic growth raises living standards, it often generates negative externalities such as environmental degradation, pollution, resource depletion, and social disruption. These are costs not reflected in market prices. Modern growth theory emphasizes sustainable development that balances economic growth with environmental and social considerations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker’s time is called:",
        "options": [
          "output",
          "productivity",
          "work quality",
          "worker efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Productivity is defined as output per unit of input, most commonly labor productivity (output per hour worked). It measures how efficiently labor (and other inputs) are used in production. Increases in productivity are the primary driver of long-term economic growth and rising living standards."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If an economy's real GDP grows at 3% and its population grows at 4%, what is happening to the standard of living?",
  "options": [
    "It is increasing by 1%.",
    "It is decreasing because real GDP per capita is falling.",
    "It remains stagnant as the growth cancels out.",
    "It is increasing because total output is higher than the previous year."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Standard of living is best measured by real GDP per capita (real GDP divided by population). When population grows faster (4%) than real GDP (3%), real GDP per capita decreases. This means the average output available per person is declining, indicating a falling standard of living despite the increase in total output."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Reducing the rate of population growth is widely thought to:",
        "options": [
          "be one way that less developed countries can try to raise their standard of living",
          "not be an effective way for less developed countries to raise their standard of living",
          "reduce the standard of living of less developed countries",
          "cause a reduction in productivity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lower population growth reduces the dependency ratio (non-workers per worker), allowing more resources per child for education and health. It also reduces pressure on limited resources and infrastructure. Many developing countries have found that slowing population growth, combined with sound economic policies, helps raise GDP per capita and living standards."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Countries tend to be classified as more or less developed based on",
        "options": [
          "the literacy rate",
          "the poverty rate",
          "the level of income per capita",
          "the types of goods they produce"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While multiple indicators measure development (literacy, poverty, life expectancy), the primary classification criterion is income per capita (typically GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power). The World Bank, UN, and IMF use income thresholds to categorize countries as low-income, middle-income, and high-income economies, though these classifications have limitations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A subsistence economy is",
        "options": [
          "a very low income economy",
          "an economy in which people make what they consume",
          "an economy in which people receive food for pay",
          "all of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A subsistence economy is one where individuals or families produce primarily for their own consumption rather than for market exchange. While such economies typically have low income levels, the defining characteristic is production for direct use rather than for trade. Most traditional agricultural societies before modernization were subsistence economies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be considered a 'supply-side' policy aimed at shifting the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve to the right?",
        "options": [
          "Providing tax rebates to households to stimulate consumption",
          "Increasing government transfers to provide a social safety net",
          "Reducing corporate tax rates specifically for R&D expenditures",
          "Lowering interest rates to encourage business borrowing for inventory"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Reducing corporate tax rates for R&D is a supply-side policy because it directly incentivizes innovation and technological progress, which increases the economy's productive capacity. R&D investment creates new knowledge and improves production processes, shifting the LRAS curve rightward by increasing potential GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of the Aggregate Production Function, what happens to the marginal product of physical capital as more capital is added to a fixed labor force?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes negative once the optimal capital-labor ratio is reached",
          "It remains constant due to economies of scale",
          "It decreases due to the law of diminishing marginal returns",
          "It increases because workers become more specialized"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The law of diminishing marginal returns states that as more units of a variable input (capital) are added to fixed inputs (labor), the additional output from each new unit eventually decreases. In growth models, this explains why simply adding more capital without technological progress leads to slowing growth and why sustained growth requires productivity improvements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is 'Real GDP per capita' considered a better measure of economic growth than 'Nominal GDP'?",
        "options": [
          "It measures the total value of all transactions in the economy",
          "It excludes negative externalities like pollution",
          "It accounts for both inflation and changes in the population size",
          "It is always higher than Nominal GDP during periods of deflation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Real GDP per capita adjusts for both inflation (using constant prices) and population changes, making it the best standard measure of average material living standards over time. Nominal GDP includes price increases, while per capita adjustment shows whether output growth outpaces population growth—both essential for assessing genuine improvements in economic well-being."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the likely effect on a country's Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) if it invests heavily in vocational training today?",
        "options": [
          "A movement along the curve toward more capital goods",
          "An outward shift of the entire PPC over time",
          "An inward shift of the PPC due to the opportunity cost of training",
          "A movement from a point inside the PPC to a point on the PPC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Vocational training increases human capital, enhancing workers' skills and productivity. This expands the economy's productive capacity, allowing it to produce more of all goods. In the PPC model, this is represented by an outward shift of the entire curve (economic growth), not just movement along or inside the existing frontier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Catch-up Effect' (Convergence)?",
        "options": [
          "All countries eventually reach the same level of total GDP",
          "Developed countries grow faster because they have more established infrastructure",
          "Small businesses growing faster than large corporations",
          "Developing countries grow faster than developed countries because they can adopt existing technologies"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The catch-up effect (or conditional convergence) suggests that developing countries can grow faster than developed ones by adopting existing technologies from advanced economies rather than inventing new ones. This allows them to close the technology gap, assuming they have adequate human capital, institutions, and policies to implement foreign technologies effectively."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in the national savings rate affect the economy in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "It permanently increases the growth rate of GDP",
          "It leads to a higher steady-state level of capital and output per worker",
          "It causes a permanent recession by reducing consumption",
          "It has no effect on long-run output as demand will eventually fall"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the Solow growth model, a higher savings rate increases investment, leading to more capital accumulation. This raises the steady-state levels of capital and output per worker (higher living standards) but does not permanently increase the growth rate. Once the new steady state is reached, growth returns to the rate determined by technological progress and population growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an infrastructure investment that creates a positive externality?",
        "options": [
          "A household installing a solar panel system for personal use",
          "A factory purchasing new robotic arms for its assembly line",
          "A government building a public highway that reduces logistics costs for all local businesses",
          "A private company building a high-speed internet network for its own headquarters"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Public highway construction creates positive externalities: benefits that spill over to third parties not directly involved. It reduces transportation costs for all businesses in the area, improves market access, stimulates economic activity, and may reduce congestion and pollution. These social benefits exceed the private benefits to the government builder, justifying public investment."
