          "Makes SRAS more stable due to broadened resource access"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deep import reliance exposes SRAS to foreign supply disruptions, exchange rate swings, or global input price spikes — increasing volatility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does the expectation of future policy changes play in shifting the SRAS curve, especially during volatile periods?",
        "options": [

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If firms expect future policies (e.g., taxes, regulations) to raise costs, they may raise prices now or cut investment — shifting SRAS left in anticipation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might SRAS shifts be less predictable in economies with a high degree of regulatory volatility?",
        "options": [
          "Regulatory stability diminishes its influence, leaving predictable shifts",
          "Volatility in regulation tends to stabilize SRAS over time",
          "The lack of regulatory patterns creates uncertain market conditions",
          "Consistent policy enforcement leads to predictable market reactions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the long run, wages and prices fully adjust, so changes in the price level do not affect real output — LRAS is vertical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the concept of full employment relate to the vertical LRAS curve?",
        "options": [
          "It indicates redundancy and inefficiency in labor utilization across the economy",
          "It represents a state of complete unemployment",
          "It shows maximum output at full capacity",
          "It means there is slack in resource usage"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "LRAS is vertical at potential GDP, where the economy is at full employment (natural rate of unemployment) and all resources are fully utilized."
      },
