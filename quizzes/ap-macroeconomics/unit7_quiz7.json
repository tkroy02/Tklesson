    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect does an increase in the discount rate have on consumer borrowing behavior?",
        "options": [
          "Encourages consumer borrowing",
          "Leads to increased savings",
          "Has no effect on borrowing",
          "Discourages consumer borrowing"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An increase in the discount rate is a contractionary signal. It makes it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed. Banks typically pass these higher costs on to consumers by raising their own lending rates (e.g., for mortgages, car loans). Higher loan interest rates discourage consumers from borrowing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve conducts an open-market sale of bonds, what is the likely impact on the money supply and interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Both money supply and interest rates decrease",
          "Both money supply and interest rates increase",
          "Money supply increases, interest rates decrease",
          "Money supply decreases, interest rates increase"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An open-market sale is contractionary. The Fed sells bonds, draining reserves from the banking system. This decreases the money supply. With less money available, the price of money (the interest rate) rises. Therefore, money supply decreases and interest rates increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might a central bank target in response to a rapidly growing economy about to exceed its productive capacity?",
        "options": [
          "Higher interest rates",
          "Lower interest rates",
          "Expansionary monetary policy through increased money supply",
          "Higher inflation rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An economy exceeding its productive capacity (an inflationary gap) risks overheating and high inflation. The central bank's appropriate response is contractionary policy, which aims to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates cool off investment and consumption spending, slowing aggregate demand growth back to a sustainable level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which tool of monetary policy would have the most direct impact on inflation control?",
        "options": [
          "Modifying fiscal policies through government spending",
          "Open market operations",
          "Changing the discount rate",
          "Altering the reserve ratio requirements"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Open market operations are the Fed's primary, most frequently used, and most flexible tool. By directly controlling the monetary base through daily bond purchases/sales, the Fed can precisely and quickly adjust the money supply to influence interest rates and aggregate demand, making it the most direct and effective tool for inflation control in normal times."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a scenario where the economy is at full employment, what would be the effect of an expansionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Increased real GDP",
          "Lower interest rates",
          "Reduced inflation",
          "Higher inflation rates"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "If the economy is already at full employment (potential output), aggregate supply is constrained in the short run. Expansionary policy increases aggregate demand beyond what the economy can produce. This creates an inflationary gap, leading primarily to higher prices (inflation) rather than a sustained increase in real GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a decrease in the reserve ratio affect a bank's ability to loan money?",
        "options": [
          "It stabilizes loanable funds",
          "It decreases loanable funds",
          "It increases loanable funds",
          "It has no effect on loanable funds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A lower reserve requirement means banks are required to hold a smaller fraction of their deposits as reserves. This converts some required reserves into excess reserves. Excess reserves are the funds banks can use to make new loans. Therefore, a decrease in the reserve ratio directly increases a bank's capacity to create loans."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is one potential downside of implementing expansionary monetary policy during a period of high inflation?",
        "options": [
          "Higher unemployment rates",
          "Reduced consumer spending and investment",
          "Worsening inflation",
          "Lower real GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Expansionary policy increases the money supply and stimulates demand. If implemented when inflation is already high (indicating demand is too high relative to supply), it would add more fuel to the fire, exacerbating inflationary pressures and potentially leading to runaway inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a direct consequence of the central bank conducting an open-market purchase?",
        "options": [
          "Increased taxation",
          "Increased interest rates",
          "Decreased monetary base",
          "Increased lending by financial institutions"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An open-market purchase injects new reserves into the banking system by the central bank buying bonds. These new reserves increase banks' excess reserves. With more excess reserves, banks have a greater capacity to make loans. Increased lending is a direct, intended consequence to stimulate the economy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what scenario would the Federal Reserve use contractionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "When inflation is above target",
          "When inflation is below target",
          "When unemployment is high",
          "When an economy is in recession"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Contractionary policy is used to reduce aggregate demand and cool down an overheating economy. The primary signal of an overheating economy is inflation rising above the central bank's target level. The Fed would raise interest rates to combat this high inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What could be the outcome of decreasing the federal funds rate in a weak economy?",
        "options": [
          "Increased borrowing and investment",
          "Higher consumer savings rates",
          "Reduced consumer spending",
          "Rising interest rates across the economy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decreasing the federal funds rate is an expansionary action. It lowers the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn lowers interest rates for consumers and businesses. Cheaper credit encourages firms to invest in new projects and consumers to finance large purchases (like homes and cars), leading to increased borrowing and investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the Federal Reserve's choice to raise the reserve ratio affect aggregate demand?",
        "options": [
          "No effect on aggregate demand",
          "Decreases aggregate demand",
          "Increases aggregate demand",
          "Stabilizes aggregate demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Raising the reserve ratio is a contractionary tool. It forces banks to hold more reserves, reducing their ability to lend. Less lending means less money creation, a smaller money supply, and higher interest rates. Higher interest rates discourage interest-sensitive spending (investment and consumption), leading to a decrease in aggregate demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve wishes to combat deflation, which action is it likely to take?",
        "options": [
          "Raise interest rates",
          "Lower the discount rate",
          "Increase reserve requirements",
          "Sell government securities"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deflation (falling prices) is often a sign of weak demand. To combat it, the Fed uses expansionary policy. Lowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Fed, encouraging lending and increasing the money supply. This is one of several expansionary tools that could be used to stimulate demand and increase inflation toward its target."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does tightening monetary policy influence the interest-sensitive components of spending?",
        "options": [
          "Stabilizes them",
          "Decreases them",
          "Increases them significantly",
          "No effect on them"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tightening (contractionary) policy raises interest rates. Spending on big-ticket items that are typically financed—like business investment in capital goods, new housing construction, and consumer durable goods (cars, appliances)—is highly sensitive to interest rates. Higher rates make financing more expensive, so these components of spending decrease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the central bank wishes to decrease inflation without causing a recession, what policy might it implement?",
        "options": [
          "No change in monetary policy",
          "Mild contractionary monetary policy",
          "Reduce employment",
          "Strong expansionary monetary policy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The goal is a 'soft landing.' To reduce inflation, some contraction is necessary. Implementing a mild, preemptive tightening (slightly raising interest rates) can slow aggregate demand growth enough to ease inflationary pressures without reducing aggregate demand so sharply that it causes a recession and a significant rise in unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would be the effect of a simultaneous increase in both the reserve ratio and the federal funds rate?",
        "options": [
          "Tightening of money supply",
          "Expanding money supply",
          "No effect on money supply",
          "Stabilization of money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both actions are strongly contractionary. Raising the reserve ratio directly reduces banks' lending capacity. Raising the federal funds rate target (achieved through open market sales) directly reduces bank reserves and increases the cost of borrowing. Together, they powerfully contract the money supply and tighten credit conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a result of expansionary policy, what might happen to short-term nominal interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Stabilize",
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Become unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Expansionary monetary policy (e.g., open market purchases) increases the supply of money in the money market. With money demand held constant, an increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price for money, which is the nominal interest rate. Therefore, short-term nominal interest rates decrease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following impacts is the most immediate result of a central bank's decision to lower the interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "Higher inflation",
          "Increased business investments",
          "Decrease in public spending",
          "Increased unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While all options are potential longer-term outcomes, the most *immediate* market result is a reduction in the cost of borrowing. Lower interest rates directly and quickly make new investment projects more profitable for businesses (the hurdle rate is lower), which can lead to an increase in planned business investments. Inflation and unemployment changes occur with a longer lag."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a central bank wants to decrease the money supply to stabilize currency, which action might it take?",
        "options": [
          "Lower the discount rate",
          "Open-market sale of bonds",
          "Engage in fiscal stimulus",
          "Decrease reserve requirements"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To decrease the money supply, the central bank must conduct a contractionary open market operation—selling bonds. This action drains reserves from the banking system, reducing the monetary base and the potential for money creation. A tighter money supply can help stabilize or increase the value of the currency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a likely result of an open-market sale when the financial system operates with limited reserves?",
        "options": [
          "Strengthened currency value",
          "Decrease in interest rates",
          "Capital flight",
          "Increase in money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An open-market sale is contractionary: it reduces the money supply and raises domestic interest rates. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the domestic currency. This increased demand causes the currency to appreciate, or strengthen, in foreign exchange markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What scenario would require the Federal Reserve to increase the reserve ratio?",
        "options": [
          "In a growing economy with minimal inflation and sustainable expansion",
          "In a stable economy with full employment",
          "In a recession with high unemployment",
          "In an overheated economy with rising inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Increasing the reserve ratio is a powerful, blunt contractionary tool. It would only be used in extreme circumstances where the Fed needs to forcefully and decisively reduce banks' lending capacity to cool down an overheated economy experiencing rising and problematic inflation. It is rarely used in practice."
