      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of productive efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "A company temporarily reducing output to test new production methods, even if it means not using all resources.",
          "An industry producing a surplus of products leading to unsold inventories despite full utilization of resources.",
          "A business running below its capacity with machinery left idle during peak hours.",
          "A factory that is operating on its production possibilities frontier by fully utilizing all available resources."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Productive efficiency occurs when production is at maximum output given current resources (on the PPC). Operating with idle resources or surplus inventory reflects inefficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does allocative efficiency mean in the context of an economy?",
        "options": [
          "It refers to the situation where all factors of production are used at full capacity regardless of the mix produced.",
          "It signifies that the cost of production is minimized even if it does not match consumer preferences.",
          "It means resources are distributed in a way that maximizes total societal welfare by producing the optimal mix of goods and services.",
          "It means an economy is producing at the maximum possible output given its resources, regardless of the consumption preferences."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency occurs when the economy produces the combination of goods and services that best matches society's preferences, maximizing overall welfare (MB = MC for all goods)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a trade agreement, Country X captures 80% of the economic gains while Country Y captures only 20%. This imbalance is most likely maintained because:",
        "options": [
          "Country X has leveraged its market power to keep the trade price near Country Y’s internal cost.",
          "Country Y has achieved a higher level of productive efficiency than Country X in all traded sectors.",
          "Country X is a smaller economy and therefore requires a larger share of the surplus to survive.",
          "Country Y has used protectionist tariffs to artificially inflate the value of its own exports."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unequal distribution of gains often results from bargaining power and market dominance. If Country X can set trade terms near Country Y's cost of production, it captures most of the surplus, even though trade remains positive-sum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Company P can produce 400 units per month, and local demand is 500 units, why might Company P still insist on exporting 200 units to Company Q in another country?",
        "options": [
          "To diversify its revenue streams and protect itself against a potential downturn in the local economy.",
          "Because the company is failing to achieve productive efficiency and wants to hide its losses.",
          "To ensure that the local market price remains high by artificially creating a domestic shortage.",
          "Because Company P is following a Traditional Economic model where trade is dictated by custom rather than profit."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exporting despite unmet local demand is a risk-management strategy—diversifying markets protects against local economic shocks and maintains long-term international contracts and brand reliability."
