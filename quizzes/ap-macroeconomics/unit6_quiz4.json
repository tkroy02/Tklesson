    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might someone buy a bond instead of holding cash?",
        "options": [
          "Bonds are easier to use",
          "Bonds offer interest income",
          "Bonds increase in value quickly",
          "Bonds are more liquid than cash"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bonds pay periodic interest (coupon payments), providing a return that cash typically does not. While cash is more liquid, bonds offer income in exchange for lower liquidity and some risk."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When do bonds become more desirable?",
        "options": [
          "When interest rates fall",
          "When stocks become popular",
          "When interest rates rise",
          "When bond prices drop"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When interest rates fall, existing bonds with higher fixed coupon rates become more attractive because they offer a better return than newly issued bonds, driving up demand and prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which investment typically has higher potential risk?",
        "options": [
          "Certificate of deposit",
          "Savings account",
          "Stocks",
          "Government bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stocks (equities) generally carry higher risk due to price volatility and uncertainty in dividends and capital gains, compared to insured deposits and government bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main reason firms issue stocks?",
        "options": [
          "To acquire other companies through mergers",
          "To pay less taxes",
          "To raise capital without debt",
          "To reduce product prices"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Issuing stock (equity financing) allows a company to raise funds without taking on debt. It dilutes ownership but avoids interest obligations and repayment requirements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What do interest rates provide a measure of?",
        "options": [
          "Stock market fluctuations",
          "Price of borrowed or saved money",
          "Liquidity of assets",
          "Long‑term investment risks"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Interest rates represent the cost of borrowing or the reward for saving/lending money. They are the price paid for the use of funds over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a shareholder make a profit on stocks?",
        "options": [
          "By issuing additional shares to increase ownership",
          "By selling at a higher price",
          "Through dividend payments only",
          "By using stocks as collateral for personal loans"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shareholders profit through capital gains (selling shares at a higher price than purchased) and/or dividends. Selling at a higher price is a primary source of return for many investors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If interest rates are low, what might investors prefer?",
        "options": [
          "Real estate",
          "Fine art",
          "Bonds",
          "High‑risk stocks"
        ],
        "explanation": "When interest rates are low, returns on safe assets like bonds are unattractive, leading some investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets such as stocks (including high‑risk stocks) or real estate.",
        "answer": "D"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to bond prices if interest rates increase?",
        "options": [
          "Bond prices increase",
          "Bond prices are unaffected",
          "Bond prices stabilize",
          "Bond prices decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Bond prices and interest rates move inversely. When market interest rates rise, existing bonds with lower fixed coupon rates become less attractive, so their market prices fall."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does investing in stocks differ from bonds in terms of ownership and financial return?",
        "options": [
          "Stocks involve lending money, bonds provide ownership",
          "Stocks provide ownership and potential high returns, bonds are loans with fixed returns",
          "Bonds provide ownership, stocks offer fixed interest",
          "Stocks and bonds both represent ownership in a company"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Stocks represent ownership (equity) with variable returns (dividends and capital gains). Bonds represent debt (a loan) with fixed interest payments and return of principal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why would an investor choose a bond over a stock when nearing retirement?",
        "options": [
          "Stocks provide more consistent dividend payments throughout market cycles",
          "Stocks can be sold more quickly in financial markets",
          "Bonds offer lower risk and stability",
          "Bonds typically generate higher long‑term returns"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Retirees often prioritize capital preservation and steady income. Bonds generally offer lower risk and more predictable cash flows than stocks, making them suitable for conservative portfolios."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what scenario might a company prefer equity financing over debt financing?",
        "options": [
          "When aiming to minimize shareholder influence",
          "If seeking to sell ownership to avoid incurring debt",
          "If ensuring stable fixed payments is a priority",
          "When wanting to maintain full managerial control"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Equity financing (issuing stock) avoids adding debt to the balance sheet and eliminates fixed interest obligations, though it dilutes existing ownership and control."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which financial asset's value is most directly affected by changes in interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Real estate",
          "Bonds",
          "Collectibles",
          "Stocks"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bond prices have an inverse mathematical relationship with interest rates. While stocks and real estate are also influenced by rates, the impact is more immediate and direct on bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If interest rates unexpectedly decrease, what is the likely impact on existing bond prices?",
        "options": [
          "Bond prices will decrease",
          "Bond prices will become volatile",
          "Bond prices will increase",
          "There will be no impact"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A decrease in interest rates makes existing bonds with higher coupon rates more valuable, so their market prices rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the liquidity of an investment influence the investor's flexibility?",
        "options": [
          "Less liquid investments offer more flexibility",
          "Liquidity does not affect financial flexibility",
          "Greater liquidity allows easier access to funds",
          "More liquid investments are harder to convert to cash"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "High liquidity means an asset can be quickly sold for cash with minimal price impact, giving investors greater flexibility to meet unexpected needs or seize new opportunities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might an investor be willing to accept a lower rate of return on a highly liquid asset?",
        "options": [
          "Higher risk tolerance",
          "Preference for immediate access to cash",
          "To avoid capital gains tax",
          "Expectation of large dividends"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Investors often trade off return for liquidity. Highly liquid assets (e.g., savings accounts) offer easy access to funds but typically yield lower returns than less liquid alternatives."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between risk tolerance and investment choices?",
        "options": [
          "Higher risk tolerance encourages diversifying into cash only",
          "Lower risk tolerance leads to investing in high‑yield bonds",
          "Higher risk tolerance leads to choosing more stable, conservative assets",
          "Higher risk tolerance favors stocks over bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Investors with higher risk tolerance are more willing to accept volatility in pursuit of higher returns, often favoring stocks (equities) over bonds or cash."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the opportunity cost of holding money when interest rates rise?",
        "options": [
          "Opportunity cost decreases",
          "Opportunity cost varies unpredictably",
          "Opportunity cost remains unchanged",
          "Opportunity cost increases"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost of holding cash is the forgone interest from alternative assets. When interest rates rise, the potential interest income lost by holding cash increases, raising the opportunity cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does issuing bonds help a company raise capital without altering ownership structure?",
        "options": [
          "By reducing the company's retained earnings balance",
          "By borrowing money with repayment terms",
          "By creating additional shares for new investors",
          "By selling equity stakes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bonds are debt instruments. Issuing bonds means borrowing funds from bondholders, which does not dilute ownership (unlike issuing stock) but creates a contractual obligation to repay with interest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what economic conditions might an investor prefer holding cash over investing in bonds?",
        "options": [
          "When interest rates are rising",
          "When interest rates are stable",
          "During periods of high inflation",
          "When interest rates are falling"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If interest rates are expected to rise, bond prices will fall. Investors may hold cash to avoid capital losses on bonds and to have liquidity to buy bonds later at higher yields."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might rising interest rates lead to a decrease in bond prices?",
        "options": [
          "Bond values remain fixed regardless of interest rates",
          "Rising rates increase bond desirability",
          "Bonds become less competitive compared to new, higher‑yield bonds",
          "It leads to overvaluation of bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When market interest rates rise, new bonds are issued with higher coupon rates. Existing bonds with lower coupons become less attractive, so their market prices drop to offer a comparable yield to new bonds."
