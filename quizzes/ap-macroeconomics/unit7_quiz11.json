    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, what will happen to the price of previously issued bonds?",
        "options": [
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Increase",
          "Initially decrease, then return to original price",
          "Decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When the Fed increases interest rates, newly issued bonds will offer higher coupon payments. This makes existing bonds with their lower fixed coupon payments less attractive in comparison. To make these existing bonds competitive, their market prices must fall, which increases their yield to match the new market rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the Federal Reserve implements contractionary monetary policy, what is the most likely effect on the relative attractiveness of stocks versus bonds?",
        "options": [
          "Both assets become equally more attractive",
          "Stocks become relatively more attractive than bonds",
          "Bonds become relatively more attractive than stocks",
          "Neither asset’s relative attractiveness changes"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Contractionary policy raises interest rates. Higher interest rates: 1) Increase the fixed return on newly issued bonds, making them more attractive. 2) Increase the discount rate used to value future corporate earnings, which typically lowers stock prices. 3) Can slow economic growth, hurting corporate profits. For these reasons, bonds generally become relatively more attractive than stocks when interest rates rise."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is experiencing an increase in the federal funds rate. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "options": [
          "The central bank is buying securities",
          "The central bank is selling securities",
          "The government is reducing public spending",
          "The government is increasing taxes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans of reserves. The central bank (Fed) directly influences this rate through open market operations. Selling government securities drains reserves from the banking system, reducing the supply of loanable reserves and causing the federal funds rate to increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve increases the money supply while the price level remains constant, which of the following best describes the immediate effect on the money market?",
        "options": [
          "Money demand will increase proportionally",
          "Nominal interest rates will rise",
          "Real interest rates will rise but nominal rates stay constant",
          "Nominal interest rates will fall"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the money market, an increase in the money supply shifts the supply curve to the right. Assuming money demand (determined by the price level and real GDP) is unchanged, the new equilibrium occurs at a lower nominal interest rate. This is a movement along a stable money demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bank has $500,000 in deposits and a required reserve ratio of 10%. If the bank is fully loaned out, what is the maximum amount of new money the banking system can create from this bank’s excess reserves?",
        "options": [
          "$450,000",
          "$5,000,000",
          "$0",
          "$4,500,000"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If a bank is 'fully loaned out,' it means it holds zero excess reserves; all reserves above the required amount have already been lent. The simple money multiplier formula shows the *potential* money creation from *new* excess reserves. Since this bank has no excess reserves ($0), there is no new base from which the banking system can create additional money."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country is experiencing a decrease in the purchasing power of money. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "options": [
          "The central bank is buying securities",
          "Inflation is lower than the nominal interest rate",
          "The government is reducing public spending",
          "Inflation is higher than the nominal interest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Purchasing power decreases when inflation outpaces the growth in nominal income or returns. If inflation is higher than the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate (nominal rate - inflation) is negative. This means money held in interest-bearing accounts is still losing real value, and cash loses value even faster. This erosion of real value is a direct decrease in purchasing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following are determinants for the supply of loanable funds except:",
        "options": [
          "Foreign purchases of domestic assets",
          "Expectations for the future",
          "Central bank’s monetary policy stance",
          "Savings rate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The supply of loanable funds comes from national saving (private + public) and net capital inflows. Option A (foreign purchases) increases supply. Option C (central bank policy) influences supply via interest on reserves and monetary base. Option D (savings rate) directly determines private saving. Option B, 'Expectations for the future,' is vague but is primarily a determinant of the *demand* for loanable funds (business investment plans based on profit expectations)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when money demand exceeds money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Inflation decreases",
          "Interest rates rise",
          "Currency depreciates",
          "GDP contracts"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the money market, the interest rate is the price that equilibrates supply and demand. If the quantity of money demanded is greater than the quantity supplied at the current interest rate, there is a shortage. To eliminate the shortage, the price (interest rate) must rise. A higher interest rate reduces the quantity of money demanded and encourages more supply (from interest-bearing assets), restoring equilibrium."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might monetary policy be less effective during periods of high uncertainty?",
        "options": [
          "Reduced consumer confidence",
          "Increased government spending",
          "Longer recognition and impact lags",
          "Higher interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monetary policy works by lowering interest rates to stimulate borrowing and spending. During high uncertainty (e.g., a deep recession or crisis), consumer and business confidence plummets. Even if interest rates are very low, households may prioritize paying down debt over new spending, and businesses may postpone investment due to bleak sales forecasts. This collapse in confidence can make traditional rate cuts less effective, a situation sometimes described as a 'liquidity trap' or 'pushing on a string.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the central bank conducts open market operations by selling government securities, what is the most likely effect on the money market equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "Money demand increases, interest rates fall",
          "Money supply decreases, interest rates rise",
          "Money demand decreases, interest rates rise",
          "Money supply increases, interest rates fall"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Selling government securities is a contractionary open market operation. The central bank receives payment, which drains reserves from the banking system, decreasing the money supply. In the money market, a leftward shift in the money supply curve, with demand constant, leads to a higher equilibrium interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a liquidity trap, which statement about monetary policy is most accurate?",
        "options": [
          "Conventional expansionary policy becomes ineffective",
          "Interest rate increases become more powerful",
          "Money multiplier effects are significantly amplified",
          "Velocity of money increases predictably"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A liquidity trap occurs when short-term nominal interest rates are at or near zero. At this point, the central bank cannot stimulate the economy further by lowering rates through conventional open market operations (since rates cannot go significantly below zero). In this situation, increasing the money supply may simply be held as idle excess reserves by banks, failing to boost lending, investment, or aggregate demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve increases the money supply during a recessionary gap, which of the following correctly describes the short-run effects on interest rates, investment, and real GDP?",
        "options": [
          "Interest rates fall, investment increases, real GDP decreases",
          "Interest rates remain constant, investment increases, real GDP increases",
          "Interest rates rise, investment decreases, real GDP increases",
          "Interest rates fall, investment increases, real GDP increases"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This is the standard transmission mechanism for expansionary monetary policy. 1) Increasing the money supply lowers interest rates (movement along the money demand curve). 2) Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses, stimulating investment spending. 3) Increased investment boosts aggregate demand, which increases real GDP in the short run, helping to close the recessionary gap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the reserve requirement is increased, what happens to the money multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "The money multiplier becomes unpredictable",
          "The money multiplier decreases",
          "The money multiplier increases",
          "The money multiplier remains constant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The simple money multiplier is defined as 1 / Reserve Requirement Ratio. Therefore, an increase in the reserve requirement (the denominator) results in a decrease in the value of the multiplier. A smaller multiplier means each dollar of reserves supports a smaller amount of checking deposits (money supply)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country’s central bank implements a policy that doubles the money supply while real output remains constant, what would most likely happen to money’s effectiveness as a:",
        "options": [
          "Store of value would increase due to greater availability",
          "Medium of exchange would increase due to greater liquidity",
          "Unit of account would improve due to more precise pricing",
          "Store of value would decrease due to inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "According to the Quantity Theory of Money (M*V = P*Y), if the money supply (M) doubles and real output (Y) is constant, the price level (P) must eventually double (assuming velocity V is stable). This rapid inflation severely erodes the purchasing power of money over time. A key function of money is to act as a store of value, and high inflation makes it a very poor store of value because its real worth declines quickly."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A bond with a face value of $1,000 and a 6% coupon rate is trading at $950. If market interest rates decrease by 1 percentage point, what is likely to happen to the bond’s price?",
  "options": [
    "The bond will be called by the issuer.",
    "The bond’s price will remain the same.",
    "The bond’s price will increase.",
    "The bond’s price will decrease."
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Bond prices and market interest rates have an inverse relationship. A 6% coupon bond was originally issued when market rates were around 6%. If market rates now fall by 1 percentage point (to ~5%), newly issued bonds would offer a lower coupon rate (5%). The existing bond with its higher fixed 6% coupon becomes more valuable in comparison. Investors will bid up its price from $950 toward a premium above its face value to lower its effective yield to match the new, lower market rate."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What is the result when the nominal interest rate is below the equilibrium rate in the money market?",
  "options": [
    "Decrease in bond prices",
    "Excess demand for money",
    "Excess supply of money",
    "Increase in unemployment"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "In the money market, the equilibrium interest rate balances the quantity of money supplied (set by the central bank) and the quantity of money demanded. If the current nominal interest rate is set below this equilibrium, the quantity of money demanded (at that low rate) exceeds the quantity supplied. This creates a shortage, or excess demand for money."

        "question": "A household decides to keep $10,000 in a non-interest-bearing checking account rather than in a bond yielding 3% annually. What is the precise economic term for the $300 this household forgoes?",
        "options": [
          "Opportunity cost of money holdings",
          "Transaction cost",
          "Inflation tax",
          "Liquidity premium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The opportunity cost of holding money is the interest income sacrificed by not holding an interest-bearing asset. In this case, the household forgoes $300 per year ($10,000 * 0.03) in potential bond interest. This forgone interest is the direct opportunity cost of choosing the liquidity of a checking account over the higher yield of a bond."

        "question": "If the Federal Reserve buys $1 million in bonds, what is the minimum possible increase in the money supply if the reserve ratio is 10%?",
        "options": [
          "$10 million",
          "$1 million",
          "$5 million",
          "$20 million"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The simple money multiplier (1/0.10 = 10) shows the *maximum potential* increase is $10 million. However, the question asks for the *minimum possible* increase. The minimum occurs if banks hold all the new reserves as excess reserves and do not lend them out, or if the public holds the proceeds as currency. In this extreme case, no additional deposits are created beyond the initial transaction, so the money supply increases by only the initial $1 million used to buy the bonds."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Short-term government securities (like U.S. Treasury bills) are highly liquid (can be sold easily), have virtually no default risk (backed by the government), and offer guaranteed but relatively low returns compared to riskier assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The federal funds rate is the Federal Reserve's primary monetary policy target. By conducting open market operations, the Fed adjusts the supply of bank reserves to maintain this rate at a specific target. Changes in the federal funds rate then influence other short-term interest rates throughout the economy, such as the prime rate and consumer loan rates, which affect borrowing and spending."
