      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the most comprehensive measure of a country's standard of living?",
        "options": [
          "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)",
          "Gross National Product (GNP)",
          "GDP per capita",
          "Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted GDP per capita"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "PPP-adjusted GDP per capita accounts for differences in price levels between countries, allowing more accurate comparisons of real purchasing power and living standards. While GDP per capita measures average income, PPP adjustment reflects what that income can actually buy in local markets, making it the best single indicator of material living standards for international comparisons."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary distinction between economic growth and economic development?",
        "options": [
          "Growth measures output increases; development includes qualitative improvements in living standards",
          "Growth is measured in nominal terms; development in real terms",
          "Growth applies to developed countries; development to developing countries",
          "Growth focuses on agriculture; development on industry"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Economic growth refers specifically to increases in real output (GDP), while economic development encompasses broader improvements: reduced poverty, better education and healthcare, increased political freedom, environmental sustainability, and more equitable income distribution. Development is multidimensional and qualitative, whereas growth is quantitative and necessary but not sufficient for development."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which indicator is part of the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI)?",
        "options": [
          "Income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient",
          "Average years of schooling",
          "Environmental sustainability index",
          "Political freedom score"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The HDI combines three dimensions: (1) Health: life expectancy at birth; (2) Education: mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling; (3) Standard of living: GNI per capita (PPP-adjusted). While inequality, environment, and freedom are important development aspects, they are captured in other indices, not the basic HDI calculation."

        "question": "What does the Lorenz curve illustrate?",
        "options": [
          "The relationship between inflation and unemployment",
          "The distribution of income within a country",
          "The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis",
          "The balance of payments position"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Lorenz curve graphically represents income distribution. It plots cumulative percentage of total income against cumulative percentage of population. A 45-degree line represents perfect equality. The further the Lorenz curve bows away from this line, the greater the income inequality. The Gini coefficient is derived from the Lorenz curve as the ratio of the area between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve to the total area under the line of equality."

        "question": "According to Rostow's stages of economic growth, which stage is characterized by traditional agriculture and limited technology?",
        "options": [
          "Take-off stage",
          "Drive to maturity",
          "Traditional society",
          "Age of high mass consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rostow's five stages are: (1) Traditional society: agriculture-based, limited technology, hierarchical social structure; (2) Preconditions for take-off: commercial exploitation, infrastructure development; (3) Take-off: industrialization begins, sustained growth starts; (4) Drive to maturity: diversified industrial base, technological adoption; (5) Age of high mass consumption: service sector dominance, consumer-oriented society."

        "question": "What is the 'brain drain' phenomenon in development economics?",
        "options": [
          "Migration of highly skilled workers from developing to developed countries",
          "Loss of natural resources due to overexploitation",
          "Decline in educational quality in developing nations",
          "Capital flight during economic crises"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Brain drain refers to the emigration of highly educated or skilled individuals (doctors, engineers, scientists) from developing to developed countries, often for better opportunities. This represents a human capital loss for sending countries, which bear education costs but don't benefit from the skills. Some argue for 'brain gain' if remittances or knowledge transfers occur, but the net effect is usually negative for development."

        "question": "Which organization primarily focuses on providing long-term development loans to developing countries?",
        "options": [
          "International Monetary Fund (IMF)",
          "World Trade Organization (WTO)",
          "World Bank",
          "United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The World Bank (specifically the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) provides long-term loans for development projects (infrastructure, education, health) at concessional rates. The IMF focuses on short-term balance of payments support and macroeconomic stability. WTO handles trade rules. UNDP provides technical assistance and coordinates development efforts but doesn't provide large-scale financing."

        "question": "What is import substitution industrialization (ISI)?",
        "options": [
          "A strategy of replacing imported goods with domestic production",
          "Reducing imports to improve trade balance",
          "Specializing in primary product exports",
          "Focusing on service sector development"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ISI was a development strategy popular in the mid-20th century where countries used tariffs, quotas, and subsidies to protect domestic industries producing goods previously imported. The goal was to reduce dependency, develop manufacturing, and save foreign exchange. While it created some industrial base, it often led to inefficient industries, limited competition, and higher consumer prices, prompting many countries to shift toward export-oriented strategies."

        "question": "Which factor is most critical for sustainable economic development according to modern theories?",
        "options": [
          "Abundant natural resources",
          "High population growth",
          "Investment in human capital",
          "Large agricultural sector"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Human capital (education, health, skills) is now recognized as fundamental for sustainable development. Educated, healthy populations are more productive, adaptive to technological change, and capable of innovation. While natural resources can provide initial advantages (though sometimes lead to 'resource curse'), human capital drives long-term growth. Population growth must be balanced with resources, and agriculture's relative importance typically declines with development."

        "question": "What does the term 'globalization' primarily refer to in economic context?",
        "options": [
          "The spread of democratic political systems worldwide",
          "Increasing interconnectedness of national economies through trade, finance, and information",
          "Uniform cultural practices across countries",
          "Environmental conservation efforts on a global scale"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic globalization involves: (1) Trade globalization: increased cross-border flows of goods/services; (2) Financial globalization: integrated capital markets; (3) Production globalization: global supply chains and multinational corporations; (4) Technological diffusion. While cultural and political dimensions exist, the economic aspect focuses on market integration, which brings efficiency gains but also creates vulnerability to external shocks and distributional concerns."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the 'digital divide' in development?",
        "options": [
          "The gap in technological infrastructure between urban and rural areas within countries",
          "The difference in internet access and digital literacy between developed and developing countries",
          "Both A and B",
          "The difference in television ownership between income groups"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The digital divide operates at multiple levels: (1) Between countries: developed nations have better infrastructure, affordability, and skills; (2) Within countries: urban/rural, rich/poor, educated/uneducated divides; (3) Gender divides in some societies. This creates development challenges as digital access becomes increasingly important for education, business, government services, and social participation."

        "question": "What is microfinance, and how does it relate to development?",
        "options": [
          "Small-scale international aid projects managed by NGOs",
          "Small loans and financial services for low-income individuals, often without traditional collateral",
          "Government subsidies for small businesses in developed countries",
          "International debt relief programs for poor nations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Microfinance provides small loans (microcredit), savings accounts, insurance, and other financial services to poor individuals, particularly women, who lack access to traditional banking. Pioneered by Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank, it aims to promote entrepreneurship, reduce poverty, and empower marginalized groups. While successful in many cases, critics note high interest rates and question whether it addresses structural poverty causes."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to dependency theory, why do developing countries struggle to develop?",
        "options": [
          "Lack of natural resources and poor climate conditions",
          "Historical colonialism and ongoing unequal power relations with developed countries",
          "Cultural attitudes that discourage hard work and innovation",
          "Overpopulation and limited arable land"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Dependency theory (associated with Prebisch, Frank, Wallerstein) argues developing countries are structurally disadvantaged in the global system: they export low-value primary products and import high-value manufactured goods, experiencing deteriorating terms of trade. Multinational corporations extract profits, and international institutions serve developed country interests. This creates 'core-periphery' relationships where development in some regions depends on underdevelopment in others."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary goal of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), now succeeded by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?",
        "options": [
          "Increase global military cooperation",
          "Promote free trade without restrictions",
          "Reduce poverty and improve living standards worldwide",
          "Standardize educational curricula across nations"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The MDGs (2000-2015) were eight international development targets including eradicating extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and developing global partnerships. The SDGs (2015-2030) expanded to 17 goals with greater emphasis on inequality, climate change, peace, and justice, but the overarching aim remains poverty reduction and improved wellbeing."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor contributes to the 'resource curse' or 'paradox of plenty'?",
        "options": [
          "Countries with abundant natural resources often experience slower economic growth and more conflict",
          "Resource-rich countries inevitably develop strong manufacturing sectors",
          "Natural resources guarantee political stability and democracy",
          "Resource abundance always leads to higher educational attainment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The resource curse describes how resource-rich countries often underperform economically due to: (1) Dutch disease: resource exports appreciate currency, hurting other exports; (2) Volatile commodity prices causing boom-bust cycles; (3) Weak institutions and corruption (rent-seeking); (4) Conflict over resource control; (5) Neglect of human capital and diversified economic development. Notable exceptions like Norway show resources can benefit development with strong institutions and prudent management."

        "question": "What does the Gini coefficient measure?",
        "options": [
          "Income inequality within a country",
          "Gender inequality in employment",
          "Environmental degradation levels",
          "Educational attainment disparities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Gini coefficient quantifies income inequality on a scale from 0 (perfect equality: everyone has same income) to 1 (perfect inequality: one person has all income). It's derived from the Lorenz curve. Values around 0.25 indicate low inequality (Scandinavia), 0.35-0.45 moderate (US, China), above 0.5 high inequality (Brazil, South Africa). While useful, it doesn't capture wealth inequality or mobility."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does foreign direct investment (FDI) differ from foreign portfolio investment in development context?",
        "options": [
          "FDI involves controlling ownership in enterprises; portfolio investment is purchasing securities without control",
          "FDI is always larger in scale than portfolio investment",
          "Portfolio investment creates more jobs than FDI",
          "FDI is short-term while portfolio investment is long-term"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "FDI involves establishing business operations or acquiring controlling interest (usually >10%) in foreign enterprises, bringing capital, technology, and management. Portfolio investment involves purchasing stocks, bonds, or other financial assets without controlling interest, typically more volatile. For development, FDI is generally preferred as it's more stable, transfers technology and skills, and creates jobs, though concerns about profit repatriation and foreign control exist."

        "question": "What is the 'informal sector' in developing economies?",
        "options": [
          "Government-regulated small businesses",
          "Economic activities not officially registered or regulated",
          "Agricultural sector in traditional societies",
          "High-tech startups in special economic zones"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The informal sector includes unregistered businesses, casual labor, street vendors, and other economic activities outside formal regulation, taxation, and protection. It provides employment and income for the poor but often features low productivity, insecurity, and lack of social benefits. Its size correlates with development level—larger in developing countries. Formalization is a development challenge, requiring balanced approaches that don't destroy livelihoods."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which concept refers to the idea that economic growth initially increases then decreases environmental degradation?",
        "options": [
          "Lorenz curve",
          "Kuznets curve (environmental)",
          "Laffer curve",
          "Phillips curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesizes an inverted U-shaped relationship between income per capita and environmental degradation: pollution increases during early industrialization, then decreases as countries become wealthier, afford cleaner technologies, and demand better environment. Evidence is mixed—some pollutants follow this pattern locally, but global problems like CO₂ emissions haven't shown clear turning points, raising questions about its general applicability."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main critique of using GDP per capita as the sole measure of development?",
        "options": [
          "It overestimates the standard of living in developed countries",
          "It ignores income distribution, environmental costs, and non-market activities",
          "It cannot be calculated for small countries",
          "It includes only material goods, excluding services"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP per capita has several limitations as a welfare measure: (1) Doesn't account for income distribution (could be high with extreme inequality); (2) Excludes non-market activities (household work, volunteerism); (3) Doesn't subtract environmental degradation costs; (4) Ignores leisure time; (5) Doesn't measure health, education, or freedom. Alternatives like HDI, Genuine Progress Indicator, and Happy Planet Index attempt broader measurement."
