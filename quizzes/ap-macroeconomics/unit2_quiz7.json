    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country’s labor force has shifted from primarily manufacturing to service‑oriented jobs over two decades. If the natural rate of unemployment has increased during this period, which explanation best accounts for this change?",
        "options": [
          "The labor force participation rate has increased",
          "Former manufacturing workers lack service sector skills",
          "Service jobs inherently create more cyclical unemployment",
          "Aggregate demand has permanently decreased"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An increase in the natural rate of unemployment often reflects a rise in structural unemployment—skills mismatches as the economy shifts from manufacturing to services."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would most likely cause the greatest divergence between CPI and GDP deflator measurements of inflation?",
        "options": [
          "A significant increase in import prices",
          "A uniform price increase across all domestic sectors",
          "A decrease in government spending",
          "An increase in domestic productivity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CPI includes imported consumer goods; GDP deflator does not. A sharp rise in import prices raises CPI more than the GDP deflator, creating divergence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a factor market?",
        "options": [
          "A supermarket selling groceries",
          "A stock exchange trading shares",
          "An online store selling electronics",
          "A job fair for engineers"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A factor market is where factors of production (labor, capital, land) are bought and sold. A job fair is a labor market—a type of factor market."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Double counting (counting the same value twice in GDP) can be avoided through the following, EXCEPT:",
        "options": [
          "Only counting the value of the 'Final Good' sold to the end consumer.",
          "Summing the 'Value Added' at each distinct stage of the production process.",
          "Using 'Real GDP' figures to adjust the total output for the effects of inflation.",
          "Ignoring 'Intermediate Goods' when calculating the total national output."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Real GDP corrects for price changes over time (inflation/deflation) but does not prevent double counting. Avoiding double counting requires counting only final goods or summing value added."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the labor force participation rate is 70% in a country with a population of 100 million and the unemployment rate is 5%, how many people are unemployed?",
        "options": [
          "3 million",
          "4 million",
          "3.5 million",
          "5 million"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Labor force = 70% of 100 million = 70 million. Unemployed = 5% of labor force = 0.05 × 70 million = 3.5 million."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following transactions would NOT be included in GDP when using the expenditures approach?",
        "options": [
          "Households purchase newly constructed homes",
          "A firm purchases previously owned factory equipment",
          "A domestic firm exports computers to another country",
          "The government builds a new highway"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Purchases of used capital goods are not current production; they were counted in GDP when first produced. Only new investment (I) is included."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the economy is at full employment and experiences a temporary increase in aggregate demand due to improved consumer sentiment. What are the expected short‑run effects on inflation and the unemployment rate?",
        "options": [
          "Inflation rises while the unemployment rate remains roughly unchanged.",
          "Inflation falls while the unemployment rate increases.",
          "Inflation rises while the unemployment rate falls significantly.",
          "Inflation falls while the unemployment rate remains roughly unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At full employment, output cannot increase much in the short run; higher demand mainly pushes up prices (inflation) without reducing unemployment below the natural rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The time period between a business cycle peak and its subsequent trough is most accurately described as:",
        "options": [
          "The natural rate of unemployment",
          "An expansion or recovery phase",
          "A recession or contraction phase",
          "A period of stagflation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From peak to trough, the economy is in contraction (recession)—real GDP falls and unemployment rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does the concept of ‘menu costs’ relate to the broader economic principle of price stickiness?",
        "options": [
          "Menu costs decrease price stickiness by incentivizing firms to adopt dynamic pricing strategies",
          "Menu costs contribute to price stickiness by making frequent price adjustments costly for firms",
          "Menu costs increase price flexibility by encouraging firms to update prices more frequently",
          "Menu costs are unrelated to price stickiness and only affect the restaurant industry"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Menu costs (the costs of changing prices) make firms reluctant to adjust prices quickly, contributing to price stickiness—a key assumption in short‑run macroeconomic models."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Country J, there are 160 million people in the labor force, and 16 million of these individuals are unemployed. What is the unemployment rate?",
        "options": [
          "12%",
          "15%",
          "10%",
          "9%"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Unemployment rate = (Unemployed / Labor force) × 100 = (16 million / 160 million) × 100 = 10%."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A country’s nominal GDP increased by 8% from one year to the next, while its GDP deflator increased by 5% during the same period. What does this information reveal about the country’s economic performance?",
  "options": [
    "Real GDP increased by approximately 3%",
    "Real GDP decreased by 3%",
    "Real GDP increased by 13%",
    "Real output remained unchanged"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Real GDP growth ≈ nominal GDP growth – inflation (GDP deflator increase). 8% – 5% = 3% real growth, indicating higher actual production."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which economic phenomenon would be most inconsistent with the typical characteristics of an expansion phase in the business cycle?",
  "options": [
    "Rising unemployment rate and declining consumer spending",
    "Increasing tax revenues and declining government deficits",
    "Increasing business investment and rising stock prices",
    "Growing capacity utilization and rising wages"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "An expansion is marked by falling unemployment and rising consumption. Rising unemployment and falling consumption are hallmarks of a contraction, making them inconsistent with expansion."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If nominal GDP increases by 10% in a year and the GDP deflator rises by 2%, what is the approximate percentage change in real GDP?",
  "options": [
    "Approximately 8% increase",
    "No change in real GDP",
    "Approximately 12% increase",
    "Approximately 10% increase"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Real GDP growth ≈ nominal GDP growth – inflation (GDP deflator growth). 10% − 2% = 8% real GDP growth."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What does substitution bias in CPI fail to capture?",
  "options": [
    "Government spending patterns",
    "Fluctuations in export prices",
    "Consumer behavior changes",
    "Price increases in luxury items"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Substitution bias occurs because the CPI uses a fixed market basket and does not reflect consumers shifting to cheaper alternatives when relative prices change."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If a government distributes $100 billion in transfer payments without receiving goods or services in return, by how much will GDP increase directly as a result of these payments?",
  "options": [
    "$100 billion",
    "$0",
    "$200 billion",
    "$50 billion"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Transfer payments are not payments for current production and are excluded from GDP. Only government purchases of goods/services (G) are counted."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following best defines the labor force participation rate?",
  "options": [
    "Total population over 16",
    "Percentage of adults in the labor force",
    "Ratio of employed to unemployed",
    "Number of jobs available"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The labor force participation rate measures the proportion of the adult civilian non‑institutionalized population that is either employed or actively seeking employment."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A nation implements policies that increase leisure time for workers while maintaining the same output levels. How would this affect GDP and economic welfare?",
        "options": [
          "GDP unchanged; economic welfare decreased",
          "GDP unchanged; economic welfare improved",
          "GDP decreased; economic welfare decreased",
          "GDP increased; economic welfare unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "GDP measures market output, which is unchanged. More leisure raises well‑being (welfare), but that gain is not captured in GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country’s real GDP has been growing at 3% annually for several years, but suddenly contracts by 0.5% for two consecutive quarters. What can be concluded about this economy?",
        "options": [
          "It has reached the peak of the business cycle",
          "It is experiencing normal fluctuations within expansion",
          "It has entered a recession after being in expansion",
          "It is experiencing stagflation but not recession"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Two consecutive quarters of declining real GDP is a common (though not official) definition of a recession—marking a shift from expansion to contraction."
