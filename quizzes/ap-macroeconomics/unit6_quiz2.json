        "question": "When the Fed raises the federal funds rate, what typically happens to long‑term interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "They fall immediately",
          "They rise, but the effect may be smaller or delayed",
          "They remain unchanged because long‑term rates are set by markets",
          "They become negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher short‑term rates tend to push up long‑term rates as well, because expectations of future short‑term rates rise and the term premium may increase, though the linkage is not always immediate or one‑to‑one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of bank capital requirements?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Capital requirements (e.g., under Basel III) mandate that banks hold a minimum level of equity relative to risk‑weighted assets to absorb losses and reduce the risk of insolvency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a liability on a commercial bank’s balance sheet?",
        "options": [
          "Loans to businesses",
          "Customer deposits",

          "Government securities"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Customer deposits are funds owed to depositors, making them a liability. Loans, reserves, and securities are assets."

          "1%",
          "5%",
          "2%",
          "3%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From the equation of exchange (M × V = P × Y), if V is constant, %ΔM + %ΔV = %ΔP + %ΔY. Here, %ΔP = 2%, %ΔY = 3%, so %ΔM = 5%."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The money multiplier is inversely related to the reserve ratio and the currency‑to‑deposit ratio. A lower currency‑to‑deposit ratio means less cash leakage, increasing the multiplier."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a reverse repo, the Fed sells securities with an agreement to repurchase them later, temporarily draining reserves from the banking system—a tool for fine‑tuning the money supply."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A liquidity trap occurs when short‑term nominal interest rates are near zero, making conventional expansionary monetary policy ineffective because further injections of money do not lower rates or stimulate spending."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might central bank independence be important?",
