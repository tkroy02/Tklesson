    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a closed economy with no government, if the equilibrium real interest rate in the loanable funds market is 5%, but the expected return on investment projects is only 4%, what would be the most likely outcome?",
        "options": [
          "Quantity of loanable funds demanded will decrease",
          "Quantity of loanable funds supplied will decrease",
          "Real interest rate will rise further",
          "Equilibrium quantity will increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The real interest rate is the cost of borrowing for investment. If the cost (5%) is higher than the expected return (4%), investment projects are unprofitable. Businesses will cancel or postpone these projects, reducing their demand for loans. This decrease in the quantity of loanable funds demanded (a movement along the demand curve) will put downward pressure on the real interest rate until it falls to a level consistent with the return on investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a likely consequence of an open-market purchase by the central bank?",
        "options": [
          "Higher reserve requirements",
          "Lower inflation rates",
          "Decreased money supply",
          "Increased money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An open-market purchase is an expansionary monetary policy tool. When the central bank buys government securities, it pays for them by crediting the reserve accounts of commercial banks. This injection of new reserves increases the monetary base, allowing banks to create more loans and deposits, thereby increasing the overall money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A central bank implements a contractionary monetary policy that raises interest rates from 3% to 5%. What economic behavior would this policy most likely incentivize regarding money holdings?",
        "options": [
          "Reduction in money holdings as opportunity cost increases",
          "Shift to foreign currencies with lower interest rates",
          "Increase in money holdings to prepare for higher prices",
          "No change as interest rates don’t affect money demand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The interest rate represents the opportunity cost of holding money (which earns little/no interest) versus interest-bearing assets. A higher interest rate increases this opportunity cost. Rational individuals and firms will respond by trying to reduce their holdings of non-interest-bearing money, decreasing the quantity of money demanded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve increases the money supply while real GDP and the price level remain constant, what is the most likely effect on interest rates in the money market?",
        "options": [
          "Interest rates will rise as the money demand curve shifts left",
          "Interest rates will fall as the money supply curve shifts right",
          "Interest rates will rise as the money supply curve shifts right",
          "Interest rates will remain unchanged as money demand increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the money market, the interest rate is determined by the supply and demand for money. An increase in the money supply shifts the supply curve to the right. With money demand (determined by real GDP and the price level) unchanged, the new equilibrium occurs at a lower interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bank with $5 million in deposits maintains $750,000 in reserves. If the required reserve ratio increases from 10% to 12%, by what percentage would the bank’s excess reserves change?",
        "options": [
          "Increase by 20%",
          "Decrease by 40%",
          "Decrease by 2%",
          "Decrease by 10%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "1. **Initial:** Required Reserves = 10% of $5M = $500,000. Actual Reserves = $750,000. Excess Reserves = $750,000 - $500,000 = $250,000.\n2. **After Change:** New Required Reserves = 12% of $5M = $600,000. New Excess Reserves = $750,000 - $600,000 = $150,000.\n3. **Change:** Excess reserves fell from $250k to $150k, a decrease of $100k.\n4. **Percentage Change:** ($100,000 decrease / $250,000 initial) * 100% = **40% decrease**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a recession, if the central bank takes no action but the public’s precautionary demand for money increases, what will happen to nominal interest rates in the money market?",
        "options": [
          "Fall as money velocity decreases",
          "Rise as money demand shifts rightward",
          "Remain unchanged as real GDP falls proportionally",
          "Fall as investment demand decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An increase in precautionary demand for money (due to uncertainty in a recession) means that at every interest rate, people want to hold more money. This is an increase in the demand for money, shifting the money demand curve to the right. With the money supply held constant (central bank takes no action), the equilibrium nominal interest rate will rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A central bank is concerned about declining liquidity in the financial system. Which action would most directly increase the proportion of highly liquid assets in the economy?",
        "options": [
          "Encouraging banks to issue more certificates of deposit",
          "Purchasing government bonds from commercial banks",
          "Increasing the required maturity period for savings accounts",
          "Promoting investment in corporate stocks"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Purchasing government bonds from commercial banks (an open market purchase) injects new reserves (highly liquid assets for banks) into the banking system. This directly increases the quantity of base money (the most liquid asset) in the economy, addressing a liquidity shortage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of expansionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Raising the discount rate",
          "Buying government securities",
          "Selling government securities",
          "Increasing the reserve requirement"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Buying government securities (an open market purchase) is the primary expansionary monetary policy tool. It increases bank reserves and the monetary base, leading to an increase in the money supply and lower interest rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the money supply considered independent of the nominal interest rate?",
        "options": [
          "Influenced by taxes",
          "Depends on inflation",
          "Set by central bank",
          "Varies with GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In standard macroeconomic models (like the money market graph), the money supply is depicted as a vertical line. This reflects the assumption that the central bank controls the money supply directly through its policy tools (open market operations, etc.), making it independent of (not determined by) the current nominal interest rate. The interest rate is the outcome of the interaction between this fixed supply and money demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What will happen if the Federal Reserve sells bonds in open market operations?",
        "options": [
          "The money supply decreases, raising interest rates",
          "Inflation rates will automatically rise",
          "The value of the dollar will significantly drop",
          "Banks will increase their lending activities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Selling bonds is a contractionary open market operation. The Fed receives payment, which drains reserves from the banking system. This decreases the monetary base and the money supply. With less money available, the price of money (the interest rate) rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm opts for equity financing over taking a loan. What could cause this action?",
        "options": [
          "The firm seeks to decrease its liquidity",
          "The firm aims to increase its reserve ratio",
          "The firm wants to raise funds by issuing stock",
          "The firm intends to lower its rate of return"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Equity financing specifically means raising capital by selling ownership shares (stock) in the company. This is distinct from debt financing (taking a loan). The question asks for the cause of choosing equity, and the most direct cause is the desire to raise funds through that specific method."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What determines the money supply in an economy with a fixed monetary base?",
        "options": [
          "Central bank policies",
          "Exchange rates",
          "Nominal interest rate",
          "Consumer spending"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The monetary base (currency + reserves) is the raw material for the money supply. Even with a fixed base, the central bank's policies—specifically its setting of reserve requirements and its influence on the money multiplier—determine how much of the broader money supply (M1, M2) can be created by the banking system from that base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a potential risk of maintaining low interest rates for an extended period?",
        "options": [
          "Deflation",
          "Asset bubbles",
          "Trade deficits",
          "Currency devaluation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Persistently low interest rates encourage excessive borrowing and risk-taking. This can lead to overinvestment in certain assets (like real estate or stocks), driving their prices far above their fundamental values and creating unsustainable 'bubbles' that eventually burst, causing financial instability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario would likely decrease the equilibrium interest rate in the loanable funds market?",
        "options": [
          "Decrease in business investment",
          "Increase in household savings",
          "Introduction of an investment tax credit",
          "Increase in government borrowing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An increase in household savings increases the supply of loanable funds (shifts the supply curve to the right). With demand constant, this leads to a lower equilibrium real interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the likely effect on nominal interest rates if the economy experiences deflation?",
        "options": [
          "Interest rates decrease",
          "Interest rates increase",
          "Interest rates remain stable",
          "Interest rates become volatile"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Deflation (falling prices) increases the real value of money. In the money market, this can increase the demand for money (people hoard cash as its purchasing power rises), which would put *upward* pressure on nominal rates. However, central banks typically respond to deflation by aggressively lowering their policy rates (often to near zero) to stimulate the economy. In practice, periods of deflation are strongly associated with very low nominal interest rates. The question asks for the likely effect, and the historical/policy response is a decrease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a hypothetical economy, the government decides to introduce a new digital currency called ‘CryptoDollar.’ It is widely accepted for all transactions and can be exchanged for goods and services. However, it is not backed by any physical commodity or government decree. Based on the essential characteristics of money, which of the following best describes the role of CryptoDollar in this economy?",
        "options": [
          "Store of value",
          "Medium of exchange",
          "Unit of account",
          "Commodity money"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The key phrase is 'widely accepted for all transactions.' This directly describes the medium of exchange function—it is used to buy and sell goods and services. The fact that it is not backed by a commodity rules out commodity money, and the lack of government decree means it's not technically fiat, but its primary described use is as a medium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What will happen if the Federal Reserve increases the required reserve ratio?",
        "options": [
          "Banks’ excess reserves decrease, contracting money supply",
          "Interest rates on loans will automatically drop",
          "The value of the dollar will significantly decrease",
          "The demand for money will significantly rise"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A higher reserve requirement forces banks to hold a larger fraction of deposits as non-loanable reserves. This reduces their excess reserves, which are the funds available for making new loans. With a reduced capacity to lend, the money creation process slows, contracting the money supply."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following is an example of a factor that increases the demand for loanable funds?",
  "options": [
    "A reduction in foreign investment in domestic assets",
    "Government deficit spending",
    "A rise in the national savings rate",
    "An increase in the domestic savings rate"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The demand for loanable funds comes primarily from businesses for investment and the government for borrowing. Government deficit spending, which requires the government to borrow money, directly increases the demand for loanable funds. The other options (A, C, D) affect the supply of loanable funds, not the demand."

          "Relying on trade credit",
          "Taking out a bank loan",
          "Issuing corporate bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equity financing involves selling ownership stakes in the company. Issuing shares of stock is the quintessential example. The other options (trade credit, bank loans, bonds) are all forms of debt financing."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "1. Calculate Required Reserves: 10% of $500,000 = $50,000.\n2. Identify Actual Reserves: $70,000.\n3. Calculate Excess Reserves: Actual Reserves - Required Reserves = $70,000 - $50,000 = **$20,000**."
