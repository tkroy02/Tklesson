    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A nation reports high GDP growth, yet life satisfaction surveys and mental health markers are sharply declining. Which of the following is the most 'Economic' explanation for this gap?",
        "options": [
          "GDP is an accurate measure of wealth, but it fails to subtract 'negative externalities' like stress, pollution, or the loss of leisure time.",
          "The nation has achieved 'Allocative Efficiency' by producing what people buy, but it has failed to achieve 'Productive Efficiency' in its healthcare system.",
          "The growth is likely driven by 'Capital Investment' in heavy industry, which is not included in GDP calculations.",
          "High GDP growth is a 'Leading Indicator' that mental health will automatically improve in the next fiscal quarter."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GDP measures market output but ignores non‑market costs like stress, environmental damage, and lost leisure—key reasons why GDP growth can coexist with declining well‑being."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of cyclical unemployment?",

          "Nominal income has decreased"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Real income = nominal income adjusted for inflation. An increase in real income signifies higher purchasing power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in frictional unemployment affect the natural rate of unemployment?",

          "Natural rate remains unchanged",
          "Natural rate becomes zero",
          "Natural rate decreases",
          "Natural rate increases"
        ],
        "answer": "D",

        "question": "All of the following statements regarding nominal and real income are true except:",
        "options": [
          "Comparisons of real income over time allow for assessment of changes in actual purchasing power.",
          "Nominal income reflects income levels adjusted for inflation, indicating purchasing power.",
          "Nominal income is measured in current dollars without any adjustment for inflation.",
          "Real income is adjusted for changes in the price level, providing a measure of purchasing power."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Nominal income is **not** adjusted for inflation; real income is. Statement B is false."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "GDP = C + I + G + (X – M). Government spending (G) is a direct component; imports are subtracted, transfer payments are excluded, intermediate goods are not counted separately."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a closed economy circular flow model, if households decide to save a larger portion of their income (thereby reducing consumption while all other factors remain constant), what is the most likely immediate effect on aggregate spending (GDP)?",
        "options": [
          "Aggregate spending (and thus GDP) decreases due to lower consumption expenditures.",
          "Aggregate spending increases immediately as higher savings directly boost investment expenditures.",
          "Aggregate spending remains unchanged because saved income is automatically reinvested.",
          "GDP is unaffected because the circular flow model does not account for changes in saving behavior."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the short run, if saving rises and consumption falls without an offsetting rise in investment, aggregate demand declines, reducing GDP."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "A nation’s statistical agency reports the following data: consumption = $800 billion, government spending = $300 billion, investment = $200 billion, exports = $150 billion, imports = $200 billion. Using the expenditures approach, what is this nation’s GDP?",
  "options": [
    "$1,250 billion",
    "$1,450 billion",
    "$1,300 billion",
    "$1,200 billion"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "GDP = C + I + G + (X − M) = 800 + 200 + 300 + (150 − 200) = 1,300 − 50 = 1,250 billion."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "If total wages, rents, interest, and profits equal aggregate spending in an economy, which fundamental national income identity does this illustrate?",
  "options": [
    "Net exports equal government spending.",
    "Aggregate income equals aggregate spending.",
    "Aggregate demand equals aggregate supply only in an open economy.",
    "The multiplier effect neutralizes differences between income and expenditure."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "In national income accounting, total factor payments (aggregate income) always equal total spending on final goods and services (aggregate expenditure). This is a core identity of GDP measurement."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country with a high GDP but significant income inequality might have issues accurately measuring:",

          "Economic growth",
          "Living standards"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "GDP per capita averages income; high inequality means many people’s living standards are well below the average, making GDP a poor proxy for typical well‑being."
