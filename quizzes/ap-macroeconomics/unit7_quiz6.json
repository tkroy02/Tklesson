    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary objective of expansionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Reduce inflation rates",
          "Decrease the money supply",
          "Increase interest rates",
          "Boost real GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The primary objective of expansionary monetary policy is to stimulate a sluggish economy. It aims to increase aggregate demand, which leads to higher real GDP and lower unemployment, typically during a recessionary gap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which tool involves the buying and selling of treasury bonds to influence the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Open market operations",
          "Discount rate adjustments",
          "Reserve requirement changes",
          "Federal funds rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Open market operations (OMOs) are the Federal Reserve's primary tool. By buying Treasury bonds, the Fed injects reserves into the banking system, increasing the money supply. Selling bonds drains reserves, decreasing the money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when the Federal Reserve lowers the discount rate?",
        "options": [
          "Banks borrow more",
          "Banks borrow less",
          "Money supply decreases",
          "Interest rates increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges commercial banks for short-term loans. Lowering it makes borrowing from the Fed cheaper, encouraging banks to borrow more reserves. These additional reserves can then be used to make more loans, which increases the money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the reserve ratio?",
        "options": [
          "Percentage of deposits banks must hold",
          "Target inflation rate",
          "Interest rate on loans",
          "Rate of treasury bond trades"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reserve ratio (or reserve requirement) is the fraction of customer deposits that a bank is legally required to hold as reserves (vault cash or deposits at the Fed) and not lend out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What impact does raising the reserve ratio have on the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Increases money supply",
          "Stabilizes money supply",
          "No effect",
          "Decreases money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Raising the reserve requirement forces banks to hold a larger portion of deposits as non-loanable reserves. This reduces their excess reserves, limiting their ability to create new loans and deposits, which contracts the money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes contractionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Raises money supply",
          "Increases real GDP",
          "Lowers interest rates",
          "Decreases money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Contractionary monetary policy is used to slow down an overheating economy and fight inflation. It involves actions by the central bank that decrease the money supply (or slow its growth), which typically leads to higher interest rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Increasing the federal funds rate has what effect on borrowing costs?",
        "options": [
          "Lowers borrowing costs",
          "Eliminates borrowing costs",
          "Stabilizes borrowing costs",
          "Raises borrowing costs"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The federal funds rate is the benchmark for short-term interest rates. When the Fed increases its target for this rate (through open market sales), it makes it more expensive for banks to borrow reserves overnight. This increased cost is passed on to consumers and businesses through higher interest rates on loans, raising overall borrowing costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an effect of a lower federal funds rate?",
        "options": [
          "Higher unemployment",
          "Cheaper borrowing for banks",
          "Decreased money supply",
          "Increased foreign investment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A lower federal funds rate reduces the cost for banks to borrow reserves from each other overnight. This lower cost of funds for banks typically leads them to offer lower interest rates on loans to consumers and businesses, making borrowing cheaper throughout the economy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does the Federal Reserve play in monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Influence money supply and interest rates",
          "Tax goods and services",
          "Collect income taxes",
          "Issue treasury bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. Its core function regarding monetary policy is to manage the nation's money supply and influence interest rates to achieve macroeconomic goals of maximum employment and price stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which policy aims to correct a recessionary gap?",
        "options": [
          "Neutral monetary policy",
          "Expansionary monetary policy",
          "Fiscal policy",
          "Contractionary monetary policy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A recessionary gap occurs when real GDP is below potential GDP, indicating underutilized resources and high unemployment. Expansionary monetary policy (increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates) is designed to stimulate aggregate demand to close this gap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the Federal Reserve use open market operations to increase the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Selling treasury bonds",
          "Raising the discount rate",
          "Increasing the reserve ratio",
          "Buying treasury bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "To increase the money supply, the Fed conducts an open market purchase. It buys Treasury bonds from banks or the public. It pays for these bonds by crediting the sellers' bank accounts, which increases bank reserves. These new reserves allow banks to make more loans, expanding the money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when the Federal Reserve sells bonds?",
        "options": [
          "Real interest rates drop",
          "Money supply decreases",
          "Economic output rises",
          "Money supply increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the Fed sells bonds (an open market sale), it receives payment from banks, which debits their reserve accounts. This drains reserves from the banking system, reducing the monetary base. With fewer reserves, banks have less capacity to lend, leading to a contraction of the money supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which action by the Federal Reserve indicates a move towards contractionary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Lowering the discount rate",
          "Reducing taxes",
          "Selling government securities",
          "Reducing the reserve ratio"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Selling government securities (bonds) is a definitive contractionary open market operation. It directly reduces bank reserves and the money supply. The other options (A and D) are expansionary actions, and (B) is a fiscal policy tool, not a monetary one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a recessionary gap, what is the Federal Reserve likely to do with interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Eliminate interest rates",
          "Decrease interest rates",
          "Keep interest rates unchanged",
          "Increase interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To combat a recessionary gap, the Fed pursues expansionary policy. This involves actions (like buying bonds) that increase the money supply, which in turn leads to lower equilibrium interest rates in the money market. Lower rates stimulate borrowing and spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the federal funds rate and the money supply?",
        "options": [
          "No relationship",
          "Wildly fluctuating",
          "Inversely proportional",
          "Directly proportional"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "There is an inverse relationship. When the Fed wants to lower the federal funds rate, it increases the money supply (via open market purchases). When it wants to raise the federal funds rate, it decreases the money supply (via open market sales). More money supply = lower interest rates; less money supply = higher interest rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a tool of monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Reserve ratio",
          "Discount rate",
          "Open market operations",
          "Taxation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Taxation is a tool of fiscal policy, which is controlled by the government (Congress and the President). The three primary tools of monetary policy, controlled by the central bank (the Fed), are: 1) Open Market Operations, 2) The Discount Rate, and 3) Reserve Requirements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is achieved through the Federal Reserve’s use of monetary policy during an inflationary gap?",
        "options": [
          "Increased aggregate demand",
          "Higher output levels",
          "Raised employment",
          "Reduced inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An inflationary gap occurs when the economy is overheating (real GDP > potential GDP), creating upward pressure on prices. The Fed uses contractionary monetary policy to reduce aggregate demand, which helps to slow the economy and reduce inflationary pressures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What economic condition does contractionary monetary policy aim to resolve?",
        "options": [
          "Hyperinflation",
          "Inflationary gap",
          "Recession",
          "Deflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Contractionary monetary policy is specifically designed to cool down an overheated economy experiencing an inflationary gap, where aggregate demand exceeds potential output, leading to rising inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which rate is directly used for banks to borrow from each other overnight?",
        "options": [
          "Open market rate",
          "Discount rate",
          "Reserve ratio",
          "Federal funds rate"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other banks on an overnight, unsecured basis. It is the primary interest rate target of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a recessionary gap, aggregate demand is typically:",
        "options": [
          "Non-existent",
          "Too high",
          "Too low",
          "Balanced"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A recessionary gap is defined by equilibrium real GDP being below potential GDP. This occurs because aggregate demand (AD) is insufficient (too low) to purchase the full-employment level of output. There is a shortfall in total spending in the economy."
