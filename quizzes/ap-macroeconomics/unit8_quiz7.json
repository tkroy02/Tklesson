    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does an increase in the money supply not affect real GDP in the long run according to the theory of monetary neutrality?",
        "options": [
          "It leads to a proportional increase in productive output and employment",
          "It decreases consumer savings and investment spending",
          "It only affects nominal values, not real values",
          "It increases employment rates significantly"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monetary neutrality is the classical concept that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables (like prices, wages, and exchange rates) in the long run. Real variables (like real GDP, real wages, and employment) are determined by real factors such as technology, resources, and institutions, not by the quantity of money. An increase in M leads to a proportional increase in P, leaving real output unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the theory of monetary neutrality clarify the relationship between inflation and real wages?",
        "options": [
          "Real wages remain unchanged by inflation",
          "Inflation decreases real wages by reducing purchasing power over time",
          "Real wages decline as inflation increases",
          "Inflation boosts real wages through higher pay"
        ],
        "explanation": "Monetary neutrality states that in the long run, a one-time increase in the money supply raises all nominal prices and wages proportionally. Therefore, the real wage (nominal wage / price level) remains unchanged. The confusion often arises from not distinguishing between one-time price level changes (which neutrality addresses) and sustained inflation (which can have complex effects if not fully anticipated). The core insight is that purely monetary changes don't alter real purchasing power in equilibrium.",
        "answer": "A"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What deeper implication does the wage-price spiral suggest about the interplay between demand-pull and cost-push inflation?",
        "options": [
          "They negate each other's impact on the economy",
          "They stabilize price levels over time",
          "They reinforce each other",
          "They result in deflationary pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A wage-price spiral is a vicious cycle where initial inflation (from either demand-pull or cost-push causes) leads workers to demand higher wages to keep up with the cost of living. Higher wages increase business costs, causing firms to raise prices further (cost-push). This new round of price increases triggers further wage demands, and so on. Thus, an initial shock from one type of inflation can trigger and be reinforced by the other, making inflation persistent and difficult to stop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of monetary policy, why might an increase in money supply initially solve a recessionary gap but lead to inflation?",
        "options": [
          "It boosts immediate supply beyond sustainable levels",
          "It raises short-term spending without increasing output capacity",
          "It increases long-term demand",
          "It lowers short-term output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a recession, resources are underutilized. Increasing the money supply lowers interest rates, stimulating investment and consumption, which increases Aggregate Demand and output (closing the gap). However, if policymakers continue expansionary policy after the economy reaches full employment, further increases in AD cannot be met with increased output (as capacity is maxed out). Instead, the excess demand bids up prices, leading to demand-pull inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What insight does the quantity theory of money provide on the long-term effects of a stable velocity of money amidst increasing money supply?",
        "options": [
          "Real output fluctuates unpredictably",
          "Price levels increase proportionally",
          "Prices decrease significantly",
          "Prices and real GDP grow equally"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The equation of exchange is M*V = P*Y. If the velocity of money (V) is stable and real output (Y) is at its potential (determined by real factors), then any increase in the money supply (M) must lead to a proportional increase in the price level (P). This is the core prediction of the quantity theory: sustained money growth causes sustained inflation in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might a consistent increase in consumer demand lead to broader economic distortions if not paired with output growth?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the velocity of money significantly",
          "It reduces nominal wage levels",
          "It enhances economic equilibrium",
          "It causes sustained demand-pull inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "If consumer demand (a component of AD) grows persistently faster than the economy's productive capacity (potential output, or LRAS), it creates continuous upward pressure on prices. This is sustained demand-pull inflation. It distorts price signals, encourages speculative behavior, erodes purchasing power, and can force the central bank to implement painful contractionary policies to restore stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do changes in aggregate supply due to increased input costs not result in economic stability, as seen in cost-push inflation scenarios?",
        "options": [
          "They decrease real GDP and increase prices",
          "They result in significant deflation",
          "They increase GDP directly",
          "They stabilize aggregate demand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cost-push inflation arises from a decrease (leftward shift) in Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS), typically caused by rising input costs (e.g., oil, wages). This shift leads to a higher price level (inflation) and a lower level of real GDP. This combination—stagflation—is inherently unstable and problematic because it involves the worst of both worlds: rising prices and falling output/employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do natural disasters exemplify the triggers of cost-push inflation within an economy?",
        "options": [
          "By reducing supply and increasing costs",
          "By stimulating consumer demand and spending",
          "By lowering production expenses",
          "By expanding the available workforce"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A natural disaster can destroy capital, disrupt supply chains, and reduce the availability of key resources. This directly reduces the economy's productive capacity (shifts SRAS left). The reduced supply of goods, coupled with increased costs of production (due to scarcity and repair), leads to higher prices—a classic trigger of cost-push inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What critical role does the velocity of money play in determining the real-time impact of increased money supply on price level?",
        "options": [
          "It determines adjustment speed of prices",
          "It completely separates money supply changes from inflationary pressures",
          "It only affects real economic output",
          "It maintains stable price levels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity (V) measures how quickly money circulates. If V is high or increasing, each unit of money is spent more often, amplifying the inflationary impact of a given increase in the money supply. If V is falling, it can offset some of the inflationary pressure from money growth. Thus, changes in V influence the timing and magnitude of how money supply changes translate into price level changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is demand-pull inflation considered easier to address than cost-push inflation?",
        "options": [
          "It involves complex multilateral solutions and international coordination",
          "It responds well to supply-side interventions",
          "Fiscal policies can combat it more effectively",
          "It requires simple supply adjustments"
        ],
        "explanation": "Demand-pull inflation is caused by excessive Aggregate Demand. Policymakers have direct, if sometimes painful, tools to reduce AD: contractionary fiscal policy (higher taxes, lower spending) and contractionary monetary policy (higher interest rates). Cost-push inflation is caused by problems on the supply side. Combatting it with demand-side tools (like raising rates) can deepen the associated recession. The real solution often requires improving productivity or resolving specific supply bottlenecks, which is more complex and slow-acting.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might sustained inflationary pressures reflect broader economic inefficiencies beyond just monetary policy mismanagement?",
        "options": [
          "Through increased foreign investments",
          "Through consistent GDP growth",
          "Through reduced fiscal spending",
          "Through structural supply-chain vulnerabilities"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Persistent inflation can be a symptom of deep-seated structural problems. For example, inefficient infrastructure, energy dependencies, rigid labor markets, or lack of competition can make an economy prone to frequent supply shocks and slow productivity growth. These vulnerabilities keep SRAS from shifting rightward sufficiently to meet growing AD, creating a persistent inflationary bias that monetary policy alone cannot easily fix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the theory of monetary neutrality suggest that adjustments in money supply primarily affect short-term economic variables?",
        "options": [
          "Prices adjust faster than real output",
          "Short-term oversupply creates temporary market stabilization effects",
          "Long-term unemployment compensates for inflation",
          "Long-term variables are inherently static"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monetary neutrality is a long-run proposition. It acknowledges that in the short run, prices and wages are 'sticky' and adjust slowly. Therefore, a change in the money supply can temporarily affect real variables like output and employment (moving along the SRPC or SRAS). However, in the long run, prices and wages are flexible and fully adjust, neutralizing the real effects and leaving only nominal changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does the wage-price spiral exacerbate structural unemployment issues?",
        "options": [
          "By expanding job opportunities",
          "By increasing competitive hiring",
          "By necessitating higher wages that firms cannot afford",
          "By reducing total consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a wage-price spiral, persistently high inflation embeds high wage-growth expectations. If these wage increases outpace productivity growth, firms' labor costs rise unsustainably. To remain profitable, firms may: 1) raise prices further (fueling the spiral), 2) automate, or 3) reduce their workforce. Options 2 and 3 can increase structural unemployment, as workers' skills may not match the new, higher-productivity jobs or they are priced out of the market."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the velocity of money a critical variable in predicting inflation beyond simply evaluating changes in money supply?",
        "options": [
          "It predicts future economic growth patterns and trends",
          "It determines government deficit levels",
          "It directly affects unemployment rates",
          "It shows how actively money circulates"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The equation M*V = P*Y shows that inflation (ΔP) depends on changes in both M and V relative to Y. If V is stable, then M growth is a good predictor. However, if V is volatile—for example, falling sharply during a financial crisis (a 'flight to liquidity') or rising with financial innovation—then inflation can deviate significantly from what money growth alone would suggest. Thus, understanding V is crucial."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What implications does the simultaneous shifting of AD to the right and AS to the left have for real GDP and price stability?",
        "options": [
          "Confirms price stability and maintains equilibrium",
          "GDP fluctuation with price increase",
          "Ensures greater GDP growth potential",
          "Balances inflation and deflation"
        ],
        "explanation": "A rightward AD shift increases both price level and real GDP. A leftward AS (SRAS) shift increases price level but decreases real GDP. Their combined effect on the price level is unambiguously positive (both forces push it up). Their effect on real GDP is conflicting and therefore uncertain—it could rise, fall, or stay the same depending on the magnitude of the shifts. This creates 'GDP fluctuation' alongside a definite price increase.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does cost-push inflation complicate traditional monetary policy responses aimed at stabilizing an economy?",
        "options": [
          "It doesn't address supply-side causes",
          "It reduces aggregate demand when demand isn't the underlying problem",
          "It outpaces technological advancement rates",
          "It strengthens currency values excessively"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cost-push inflation is a supply-side problem (SRAS has decreased). The traditional monetary policy response to inflation is to raise interest rates to reduce Aggregate Demand. However, this will further decrease output and increase unemployment, worsening the recessionary aspect of stagflation. Policymakers face a dreadful trade-off: fight inflation and deepen the recession, or fight the recession and let inflation run."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does inflation caused by increased money supply highlight potential long-term risks to fixed-income earners?",
        "options": [
          "It guarantees job security",
          "It reduces available credit",
          "It increases their nominal savings",
          "It lowers their real purchasing power"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Fixed-income earners (e.g., retirees on pensions, bondholders) receive payments that are fixed in nominal terms. If inflation rises due to an increase in the money supply, the real value (purchasing power) of these fixed nominal payments erodes over time. This is a key distributional consequence of inflation: it transfers wealth from creditors/lenders (fixed-income receivers) to debtors/borrowers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might a policymaker prioritize adjusting the velocity of money rather than focusing solely on money supply to combat inflation?",
        "options": [
          "To balance immediate price fluctuations more effectively",
          "To enhance GDP growth",
          "To reduce budget deficits",
          "To stabilize nominal interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity can change rapidly due to shifts in confidence or technology. If inflation is being driven by a sudden surge in V (e.g., a spending frenzy), directly targeting the money supply (M) might be too slow or blunt. Policies aimed at stabilizing confidence or affecting transaction technologies could help manage V and provide more immediate control over inflationary pressures arising from the spending side of the MV=PY equation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the wage-price spiral demonstrate the interconnectedness between production costs and consumer purchasing power?",
        "options": [
          "By decoupling real GDP from inflation",
          "By increasing productivity without cost increases",
          "By reinforcing demand-side weaknesses",
          "By cyclically increasing both costs and wages"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The wage-price spiral is the quintessential example of this interconnection. Higher production costs (from any source) lead firms to raise prices. Higher prices reduce workers' real purchasing power, leading them to demand higher wages. Higher wages are again a production cost for firms, leading to another round of price increases. This creates a closed, reinforcing cycle where costs and wages chase each other upward."

          "Higher social security benefits",
          "More educational grants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Government spending is constrained by its budget. Interest payments on the national debt are a mandatory expenditure. If interest rates rise or the debt level increases, the portion of the budget dedicated to interest payments grows. This leaves a smaller portion of the budget ('fiscal space') available for discretionary spending on public goods like infrastructure, education, and research, potentially crowding out these productive investments."
