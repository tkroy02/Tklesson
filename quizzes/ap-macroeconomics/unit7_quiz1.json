    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the primary tool of conventional monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to influence the money supply and interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Changing the discount rate",
          "Changing reserve requirements",
          "Open market operations",
          "Quantitative easing"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Open market operations (buying and selling U.S. Treasury securities) are the Fed's primary, most frequently used, and most flexible tool for adjusting the monetary base and influencing the federal funds rate on a daily basis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Federal Reserve sells government securities in the open market, what is the most likely immediate effect?",
        "options": [
          "The money supply increases and interest rates fall.",
          "The money supply decreases and interest rates rise.",
          "Bank reserves increase and interest rates fall.",
          "The discount rate automatically decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the Fed sells securities, it receives payment from banks, which drains reserves from the banking system. This reduces the monetary base, leading to a decrease in the money supply. With less money available, the price of borrowing (the interest rate) rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary goal of expansionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "To control inflation by reducing aggregate demand.",
          "To stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment.",
          "To increase the value of the national currency.",
          "To decrease government spending and the budget deficit."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Expansionary monetary policy aims to combat recession and high unemployment by increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates. This stimulates investment and consumption spending, increasing aggregate demand and real GDP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The federal funds rate is best defined as the interest rate:",
        "options": [
          "The Federal Reserve charges commercial banks for short-term loans.",
          "At which banks lend reserves to each other overnight.",
          "On long-term government bonds set by the Treasury.",
          "That commercial banks charge their best corporate customers."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions (banks) lend reserve balances to other banks on an overnight, unsecured basis. The Fed targets this rate as its key policy indicator."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a decrease in the reserve requirement ratio affect banks' ability to create money?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases the money multiplier and reduces lending capacity.",
          "It increases the money multiplier and expands lending capacity.",
          "It has no effect on the money multiplier but increases bank reserves directly.",
          "It forces banks to hold more excess reserves, restricting loans."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A lower reserve requirement means banks must hold a smaller fraction of deposits as reserves. This increases the money multiplier (1/reserve ratio), allowing each dollar of reserves to support a larger amount of checking deposits, thereby expanding the potential for loan creation and money supply growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Contractionary monetary policy is most appropriately used when the economy is experiencing:",
        "options": [
          "A recessionary gap with high unemployment.",
          "High inflation and an inflationary gap.",
          "Stable prices and full employment.",
          "A rapid decline in exports."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Contractionary policy (reducing the money supply, raising interest rates) is designed to reduce aggregate demand to cool down an overheating economy, thereby lowering inflationary pressures associated with an inflationary gap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which sequence correctly describes the transmission mechanism of expansionary monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "Fed buys bonds → MS increases → i decreases → I increases → AD increases",
          "Fed sells bonds → MS decreases → i increases → I decreases → AD decreases",
          "Fed lowers discount rate → MS decreases → i increases → C decreases → AD decreases",
          "Fed raises reserve requirement → MS increases → i decreases → I increases → AD increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the standard transmission mechanism: Open market purchase increases Money Supply (MS), which lowers interest rates (i). Lower borrowing costs stimulate Investment (I) and interest-sensitive Consumption (C), leading to an increase in Aggregate Demand (AD)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the economy is at full employment and the Fed engages in significant expansionary monetary policy, the most likely long-run result is:",
        "options": [
          "A permanent increase in real GDP and lower unemployment.",
          "Higher inflation with no long-run change in real GDP.",
          "A decrease in both inflation and real GDP.",
          "A sustained decrease in nominal interest rates."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, the economy returns to potential output (full employment) due to wage and price adjustments. Expansionary policy when the economy is already at potential primarily leads to higher prices (inflation) without a permanent increase in real output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the discount rate?",
        "options": [
          "The interest rate the Fed pays banks on their reserve deposits.",
          "The interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.",
          "The interest rate the Fed charges banks for short-term loans.",
          "The maximum interest rate allowed on consumer loans."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The discount rate is the interest rate charged by Federal Reserve Banks to commercial banks for short-term loans (typically overnight) to help them meet temporary reserve shortages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A liquidity trap occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Banks have too many reserves and refuse to make loans.",
          "Nominal interest rates are so high that investment ceases.",
          "Expansionary monetary policy becomes ineffective because interest rates cannot fall further.",
          "The money supply is shrinking rapidly due to bank failures."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a liquidity trap, short-term nominal interest rates are at or near zero. Central banks cannot stimulate the economy further by lowering rates through conventional means, as rates cannot go (significantly) below zero. This makes monetary policy less effective."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Quantitative easing (QE) is primarily used when:",
        "options": [
          "The federal funds rate is very high.",
          "The government needs to finance a large budget deficit.",
          "Conventional open market operations are no longer effective (e.g., at the zero lower bound).",
          "The central bank wants to directly control long-term consumer loan rates."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "QE is an unconventional monetary policy tool used when the policy interest rate is near zero. It involves large-scale purchases of longer-term securities (like mortgage-backed securities) to directly increase the money supply, lower long-term interest rates, and stimulate the economy when conventional rate cuts are exhausted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be considered an expansionary open market operation?",
        "options": [
          "The Fed selling Treasury bonds to a commercial bank.",
          "The Fed buying Treasury bonds from a commercial bank.",
          "The Fed raising the discount rate.",
          "The Fed increasing the reserve requirement ratio."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the Fed buys bonds, it pays for them by crediting the reserve accounts of commercial banks. This injects new reserves into the banking system, increasing the monetary base and enabling an expansion of the money supply—the definition of an expansionary action."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Crowding out in the context of monetary policy refers to:",
        "options": [
          "Government borrowing raising interest rates and reducing private investment.",
          "High inflation reducing the real value of savings.",
          "Bank regulations limiting the types of loans that can be made.",
          "Imports reducing demand for domestically produced goods."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While often associated with fiscal policy, crowding out is relevant to monetary policy discussions. If expansionary fiscal policy (government borrowing) increases demand for loanable funds, it can raise interest rates. This can 'crowd out' or reduce private investment, potentially offsetting some of the fiscal stimulus. Monetary policy can be used to mitigate this by accommodating the higher demand for money."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'tight money' policy is synonymous with:",
        "options": [
          "Expansionary monetary policy.",
          "Contractionary monetary policy.",
          "Fiscal policy involving tax increases.",
          "A policy of fixed exchange rates."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Tight money' or 'tightening' refers to contractionary monetary policy—actions by the central bank to reduce the money supply or slow its growth, typically to fight inflation. This makes credit less available and more expensive ('tighter')."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most likely effect of the Federal Reserve raising its target for the federal funds rate?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in business investment and consumer spending.",
          "An appreciation of the U.S. dollar in foreign exchange markets.",
          "A decrease in unemployment in the short run.",
          "An immediate decrease in long-term bond yields."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher U.S. interest rates attract foreign capital seeking higher returns. This increased demand for dollar-denominated assets causes the U.S. dollar to appreciate relative to other currencies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Federal Reserve's dual mandate, as set by Congress, is to achieve:",
        "options": [
          "Price stability and a balanced federal budget.",
          "Maximum employment and stable prices.",
          "High economic growth and low interest rates.",
          "A stable financial system and zero inflation."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Federal Reserve's dual mandate, established by law, is to foster maximum employment and price stability. This guides all of its monetary policy decisions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If banks decide to hold a large amount of excess reserves, the effectiveness of expansionary open market operations will likely:",
        "options": [
          "Increase because the money multiplier is larger.",
          "Decrease because the money multiplier is smaller.",
          "Remain unchanged as long as the Fed injects reserves.",
          "Cause an automatic increase in the discount rate."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If banks hold excess reserves instead of lending them out, the money multiplier process is weakened or halted. An injection of new reserves via open market operations may simply increase excess reserves without leading to a proportional increase in loans and the broader money supply, reducing policy effectiveness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of monetary policy?",
        "options": [
          "It can be implemented more quickly than fiscal policy.",
          "It is subject to administrative delays and political negotiation.",
          "It primarily affects investment through interest rates, which may be insensitive in a deep recession.",
          "It directly controls government spending and taxation."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A key limitation is that monetary policy works indirectly through interest rates. If business and consumer confidence is very low (e.g., in a deep recession or liquidity trap), lowering interest rates may not sufficiently stimulate borrowing and spending, making policy less effective."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the money supply will, in the short run, lead to:",
        "options": [
          "Higher interest rates and lower investment.",
          "Lower interest rates and higher investment.",
          "No change in interest rates or investment.",
          "Lower interest rates and lower investment."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the short run, with sticky prices, an increase in the money supply creates an excess supply of money. This leads to a lower equilibrium interest rate in the money market. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, stimulating investment and interest-sensitive consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of the Fed paying interest on reserves (IOR)?",
        "options": [
          "To provide a source of income for commercial banks.",
          "To create a floor for the federal funds rate and better control it.",
          "To encourage banks to hold fewer excess reserves and lend more.",
          "To directly finance government spending."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By paying interest on reserves, the Fed gives banks an incentive not to lend reserves below that rate. This establishes a floor for the federal funds rate, providing the Fed with a more powerful tool to control its policy rate, especially when there is a large quantity of excess reserves in the system."
