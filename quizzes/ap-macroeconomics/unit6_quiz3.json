    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the best example of money serving as a store of value?",
        "options": [
          "Comparing the price of two different brands of smartphones.",
          "Taking out a student loan to pay for college tuition.",
          "Using a debit card to purchase a bag of groceries.",
          "Putting $50 in a physical safe to use for a vacation next year."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A store of value allows money to be saved and retrieved in the future while preserving its purchasing power. Storing cash for future use exemplifies this function."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the AP Macro definition of money aggregates, which of the following is included in M2 but NOT in M1?",
        "options": [
          "Currency in circulation",
          "Small‑denomination time deposits (CDs)",
          "Demand deposits",
          "Other checkable deposits"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "M1 includes currency, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits. M2 adds less‑liquid components like savings deposits, small‑time deposits (CDs), and retail money market funds."

        "question": "On a commercial bank's balance sheet, which of the following is classified as a liability?",
        "options": [
          "Required reserves",
          "Loans made to customers",
          "Demand deposits",
          "Excess reserves"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Demand deposits are funds that depositors can withdraw on demand; the bank owes these funds to customers, making them a liability. Reserves and loans are assets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume the reserve requirement is 20%. If a customer deposits $1,000 in cash into their checking account, what is the maximum increase in the money supply that the banking system can create from this initial deposit?",
        "options": [
          "$200",
          "$5,000",
          "$800",
          "$4,000"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Money multiplier = 1 / reserve requirement = 1 / 0.20 = 5. Maximum increase in money supply = Initial deposit × Multiplier = $1,000 × 5 = $5,000. However, the question asks for the increase from the initial deposit, meaning the additional money created is $5,000 – $1,000 = $4,000? Wait—clarify: The total money supply increase includes the initial deposit. Typically, the maximum increase in money supply = Initial deposit × Multiplier = $5,000. The $1,000 deposit is already part of M1, so the net new money created = $5,000 – $1,000 = $4,000. But many textbooks say the 'maximum increase' = $5,000. Need to check standard AP phrasing. Given common AP questions, the answer is $4,000 (new loans). Let's verify: If the initial $1,000 is already counted in M1, then additional money created through lending = $1,000 × (Multiplier – 1) = $1,000 × 4 = $4,000. So D is correct."

        "options": [
          "A financial asset is a claim that entitles the owner to future income, while a physical asset is a tangible object.",
          "Financial assets are not influenced by the interest rate.",
          "Physical assets are always more liquid than financial assets.",
          "Only financial assets can be used as a store of value."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Financial assets (stocks, bonds, deposits) represent claims on future cash flows. Physical assets (real estate, machinery) are tangible items with productive or consumptive use."

        "options": [
          "$110",
          "$90",
          "$100",
          "$121"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Present Value = Future Value / (1 + interest rate) = $110 / 1.10 = $100."

        "options": [
          "A customer withdraws cash from their savings account.",
          "The government increases the required reserve ratio.",
          "A customer makes a new cash deposit into their checking account.",
          "The bank decides to issue a new loan to a business."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A new cash deposit increases total reserves. If required reserves rise by less than the increase in total reserves, excess reserves grow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are bonds typically considered to have more 'interest rate risk' than cash?",
        "options": [
          "Because bonds are more liquid than cash.",
          "Because as market interest rates rise, the resale price of existing bonds falls.",
          "Because bonds are guaranteed by the government to never lose value.",
          "Because cash gains more value when interest rates rise."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bond prices and interest rates move inversely. If market rates rise, existing bonds with lower coupon rates become less attractive, so their market price falls. Cash does not lose nominal value when rates rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bank has $100,000 in demand deposits and total reserves of $25,000. If the required reserve ratio is 10%, how much can this single bank safely lend out?",

          "$15,000",
          "$25,000",
          "$90,000",
          "$10,000"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Required reserves = 10% of $100,000 = $10,000. Total reserves = $25,000, so excess reserves = $25,000 – $10,000 = $15,000. A single bank can lend out its excess reserves."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a drawback of using commodity money, such as gold, compared to fiat money?",
        "options": [
          "The supply of commodity money is limited by its physical availability rather than economic needs.",
          "Fiat money is more likely to be accepted by foreign merchants.",
          "Commodity money is easier to transport and store than paper money.",
          "Commodity money has no intrinsic value."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Commodity money supply depends on mining or production, which may not adjust elastically to the economy's needs, potentially causing deflation or inflation unrelated to policy goals."
