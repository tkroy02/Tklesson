    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the short-run Phillips curve (SRPC) illustrate?",
        "options": [
          "A direct relationship between inflation and economic growth",
          "A trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the short run",
          "A constant level of unemployment regardless of inflation",
          "The long-term equilibrium between inflation and interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The short-run Phillips curve (SRPC) depicts an inverse relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate. It suggests that, in the short run, policymakers can choose a point on the curve—accepting higher inflation for lower unemployment, or vice versa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the shape and position of the long-run Phillips curve (LRPC)?",
        "options": [
          "Downward sloping at the natural rate of unemployment",
          "Vertical at the natural rate of unemployment",
          "Horizontal at the current inflation rate",
          "Upward sloping through the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The long-run Phillips curve (LRPC) is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment (NRU). This reflects the classical view that in the long run, after all wages and prices have adjusted, there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The economy returns to the NRU regardless of the inflation rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would cause the short-run Phillips curve to shift to the right?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the expected inflation rate",
          "An increase in the natural rate of unemployment",
          "A favorable supply shock",
          "A decrease in aggregate demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The SRPC is drawn for a given expected inflation rate and natural rate of unemployment (NRU). If the NRU increases (due to factors like higher structural unemployment), the entire SRPC shifts to the right, indicating that for any given inflation rate, the unemployment rate will be higher in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The phenomenon of 'stagflation' is best described by which situation on a Phillips curve diagram?",
        "options": [
          "A movement down along the SRPC",
          "A rightward shift of the SRPC",
          "A movement up along the LRPC",
          "A leftward shift of the LRPC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Stagflation is the simultaneous occurrence of high inflation and high unemployment. This is represented by a rightward shift of the SRPC, which moves the economy to a point with both higher inflation and higher unemployment than before—a point that was not previously on the old SRPC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the actual inflation rate is consistently higher than the expected inflation rate, what will happen to unemployment in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Unemployment will rise above the natural rate",
          "Unemployment will fall below the natural rate",
          "Unemployment will remain at the natural rate",
          "The relationship is unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the adaptive expectations version of the Phillips curve, if actual inflation exceeds expected inflation, the real wage falls (because nominal wages were set based on lower expected inflation). Employers find labor relatively cheap, hire more workers, and unemployment temporarily falls below the natural rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the natural rate of unemployment represent in the context of the Phillips curve?",
        "options": [
          "The unemployment rate when inflation is zero",
          "The unemployment rate when inflation is at its target",
          "The rate of unemployment where actual inflation equals expected inflation",
          "The minimum possible unemployment rate in any economy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The natural rate of unemployment (NRU) is the rate that exists when the economy is at potential output and there is no cyclical unemployment. On the Phillips curve, it is the rate where actual inflation equals expected inflation. At this point, there is no pressure for inflation to change due to labor market conditions, and the economy is on the LRPC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A favorable supply shock, such as a significant drop in oil prices, would most likely cause:",
        "options": [
          "A movement up along the SRPC",
          "A movement down along the SRPC",
          "A leftward shift of the SRPC",
          "A rightward shift of the SRPC"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A favorable supply shock reduces production costs, leading to lower inflation and higher output (lower unemployment) at the same time. This is represented by a leftward shift of the SRPC, moving the economy to a new, more favorable point with lower inflation and lower unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the long-run Phillips curve, what is the effect of an expansionary monetary policy intended to reduce unemployment below its natural rate?",
        "options": [
          "It will permanently lower both inflation and unemployment",
          "It will succeed only if inflation expectations remain unchanged",
          "It will cause a temporary reduction in unemployment but lead to higher inflation in the long run",
          "It will shift the LRPC to the left, creating a new, lower natural rate"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the long run, monetary policy cannot permanently alter unemployment from its natural rate (the LRPC is vertical). Expansionary policy can temporarily lower unemployment if it creates surprise inflation (moving down the SRPC). However, as expectations adjust, the SRPC shifts up, and unemployment returns to the NRU at a higher inflation rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role do inflation expectations play in the Phillips curve model?",
        "options": [
          "They determine the position of the LRPC",
          "They are irrelevant in the long run",
          "They determine the position of the SRPC",
          "They are fixed and never change"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inflation expectations are a key determinant of the short-run Phillips curve's position. A higher expected inflation rate shifts the SRPC upward (or rightward), meaning that for any given unemployment rate, the actual inflation rate will be higher. Changes in expectations are what cause the SRPC to shift over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government uses fiscal policy to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce unemployment from 7% to 5%, but the natural rate is 6%, what is the long-run consequence according to the Phillips curve?",
        "options": [
          "Permanent inflation at a stable rate",
          "A spiral of ever-increasing inflation",
          "A return to 6% unemployment but with higher inflation",
          "A new natural rate of 5% unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pushing unemployment below its natural rate (5% < 6%) creates upward pressure on wages and prices. Initially, inflation rises (movement along the SRPC). As workers and firms come to expect this higher inflation, they build it into wage and price contracts. This causes the SRPC to shift upward. In the long run, unemployment returns to the natural rate (6%), but at a higher sustained rate of inflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be represented by a movement along a stable short-run Phillips curve?",
        "options": [
          "A change in inflation expectations",
          "An adverse supply shock like an oil embargo",
          "An increase in aggregate demand",
          "An increase in structural unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A movement along a stable SRPC is caused by changes in aggregate demand that affect the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. An increase in AD lowers unemployment but raises inflation (movement up and left along the SRPC). Shifts of the SRPC are caused by changes in expectations or supply shocks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept of the 'non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment' (NAIRU) is most closely associated with which curve?",
        "options": [
          "The short-run Phillips curve",
          "The long-run Phillips curve",
          "The aggregate demand curve",
          "The money demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "NAIRU is another term for the natural rate of unemployment (NRU). It is the unemployment rate at which inflation does not accelerate; that is, where actual inflation equals expected inflation. This is precisely the point where the long-run Phillips curve (LRPC) is vertical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If workers and firms fully anticipate an increase in inflation, and wages adjust immediately, what will happen to unemployment?",
        "options": [
          "It will fall below the natural rate",
          "It will rise above the natural rate",
          "It will remain at the natural rate",
          "It will become unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If inflation is fully anticipated, workers demand higher nominal wages to keep their real wages constant. Firms, anticipating higher prices for their products, agree. With no change in real wages, there is no incentive for firms to hire more or fewer workers. Therefore, unemployment remains at the natural rate. This illustrates why there is no trade-off in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most likely impact of a successful policy to reduce frictional unemployment (like improved job-matching services) on the Phillips curves?",
        "options": [
          "A leftward shift of the LRPC and SRPC",
          "A rightward shift of the LRPC and SRPC",
          "A movement down along the existing SRPC",
          "No change to either curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A reduction in frictional unemployment lowers the natural rate of unemployment (NRU). The LRPC shifts left to this new, lower NRU. Correspondingly, the SRPC also shifts left, as for any given expected inflation rate, the short-run trade-off now occurs at a lower level of unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the 1970s, many economies experienced high inflation and high unemployment simultaneously. This historical period challenged the original Phillips curve idea by suggesting:",
        "options": [
          "The trade-off was stronger than expected",
          "The SRPC could shift outward",
          "The LRPC was horizontal",
          "Unemployment was not related to inflation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The original Phillips curve depicted a stable, inverse relationship. The stagflation of the 1970s, caused by adverse supply shocks (oil crises) and rising inflation expectations, showed that the SRPC could shift to the right, creating worse combinations of inflation and unemployment and breaking down the stable trade-off."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the central bank wants to reduce inflation from 8% to 4%, and the SRPC is stable, what is the short-run cost likely to be?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in unemployment",
          "An increase in unemployment",
          "No change in unemployment",
          "A decrease in the natural rate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Moving along a stable, downward-sloping SRPC requires a trade-off. To achieve lower inflation (a movement down and to the right on the SRPC), the economy must typically endure a period of higher unemployment in the short run, as restrictive policy slows aggregate demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The idea of a vertical long-run Phillips curve is most consistent with which of the following macroeconomic views?",
        "options": [
          "Keynesian economics in the short run",
          "Monetarist and classical economics",
          "The original Phillips curve observation",
          "The theory of demand-pull inflation only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The vertical LRPC is a cornerstone of Monetarist and New Classical economics. It emphasizes the long-run neutrality of money and the idea that output and unemployment return to their natural levels, independent of the inflation rate, once expectations have fully adjusted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in expected inflation affect the short-run trade-off faced by policymakers?",
        "options": [
          "It improves the trade-off, allowing lower unemployment for any given inflation",
          "It worsens the trade-off, requiring higher inflation for any given unemployment rate",
          "It eliminates the trade-off, making the SRPC vertical",
          "It has no effect on the trade-off"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher expected inflation is incorporated into wage and price setting. To achieve any given real wage that would induce a specific level of employment (unemployment rate), nominal wages must now be higher. This translates to a higher actual inflation rate for that same unemployment rate, shifting the SRPC upward. The trade-off worsens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the economy is at a point on the long-run Phillips curve, which of the following is also true?",
        "options": [
          "It is on the short-run Phillips curve as well",
          "Actual output is below potential output",
          "Cyclical unemployment is positive",
          "It is at the intersection of AD and the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Being on the LRPC means the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment and potential output (Yp). In the AD-AS model, this corresponds to the intersection of the AD curve and the vertical Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve at Yp."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A central bank with a strong reputation for keeping inflation low is likely to have which of the following effects on the Phillips curve trade-off?",
        "options": [
          "A steeper SRPC",
          "A flatter SRPC",
          "A more stable SRPC that is less likely to shift",
          "An LRPC that is horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Credible, consistent policy anchors inflation expectations. If people believe the central bank will keep inflation low, their expectations remain low and stable. This makes the SRPC more stable and less likely to shift upward in response to expansionary policy, as people do not expect the policy to lead to permanently higher inflation."
