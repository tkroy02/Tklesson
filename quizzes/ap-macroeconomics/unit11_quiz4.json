    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a government implements contractionary fiscal policy during a period of high inflation, which sequence correctly describes the effects on the foreign exchange market?",
        "options": [
          "Lower interest rates → capital outflows → currency depreciation",
          "Higher interest rates → capital inflows → currency appreciation",
          "Higher interest rates → capital outflows → currency depreciation",
          "Lower interest rates → capital inflows → currency appreciation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy (reducing government spending or increasing taxes) reduces aggregate demand and government borrowing. This decreases demand for loanable funds, lowering domestic interest rates. Lower interest rates make domestic assets less attractive, causing capital outflows as investors seek higher returns abroad. Capital outflows increase supply of the domestic currency in forex markets, leading to currency depreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the U.S. government increases spending, leading to a higher GDP, what is the likely effect on the U.S. dollar's exchange rate?",
        "options": [
          "Remains unchanged",
          "Depreciates",
          "Becomes volatile",
          "Appreciates"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy (increased government spending) raises aggregate demand and GDP. This increases demand for money and may push up interest rates (unless the Fed accommodates). Higher interest rates attract foreign capital, increasing demand for dollars in forex markets, causing dollar appreciation. The interest rate effect on capital flows typically dominates the import effect in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume that a 1 percentage point difference in real interest rates is associated with an increase of $50 million in capital inflows. If the U.S. real interest rate rises from 2% to 4% while the foreign real interest rate remains at 2%, what is the expected change in net capital inflows?",
        "options": [
          "No change",
          "$50 million increase",
          "$100 million increase",
          "$200 million increase"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The interest rate differential increases by 2 percentage points (4% - 2%). Each 1 percentage point difference brings $50 million in additional capital inflows. Therefore: 2 percentage points × $50 million per percentage point = $100 million increase in net capital inflows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the purchasing power of a currency when it depreciates?",
        "options": [
          "Purchasing power decreases",
          "Purchasing power increases",
          "Purchasing power remains stable",
          "Purchasing power fluctuates wildly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Currency depreciation means each unit of domestic currency buys fewer units of foreign currency. This directly reduces international purchasing power—imported goods and services become more expensive. If depreciation leads to imported inflation, domestic purchasing power may also decline as general price levels rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following transactions is recorded in the capital (or financial) account of the balance of payments?",
        "options": [
          "A Canadian citizen receiving dividends from an American corporation.",
          "A Swedish firm purchasing a manufacturing facility in Idaho.",
          "U.S. consumers importing French wine.",
          "The U.S. government increasing spending on domestic infrastructure."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The purchase of a foreign manufacturing facility is foreign direct investment (FDI), recorded as a credit in the capital/financial account. Dividend receipts are investment income (current account). Import of goods is trade in goods (current account). Domestic government spending is not an international transaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to net exports when a currency depreciates?",
        "options": [
          "Net exports remain constant",
          "Net exports become negative",
          "Net exports increase",
          "Net exports decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Currency depreciation makes domestic goods cheaper for foreign buyers (increasing exports) and foreign goods more expensive for domestic consumers (decreasing imports). Both effects increase net exports (NX = X - M), though the adjustment may follow a J-curve pattern where the trade balance initially worsens before improving as quantities adjust."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an appreciating currency?",
        "options": [
          "The price level within a country is increasing",
          "The value of a currency is rising relative to another currency",
          "The balance of payments is in surplus",
          "The interest rates within a country are rising"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation is specifically defined as an increase in the value of one currency relative to another. Rising price levels constitute inflation. A balance of payments surplus may cause appreciation but is not itself appreciation. Rising interest rates may lead to appreciation but are not the definition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When domestic investors choose to invest in foreign assets due to lower domestic real interest rates, what is the likely effect on the domestic currency?",
        "options": [
          "The domestic currency depreciates as increased outbound capital flows reduce demand for it.",
          "The domestic currency initially depreciates but then becomes fixed through government intervention.",
          "There is no effect on the domestic currency since exchange rates are solely determined by trade balances.",
          "The domestic currency appreciates because higher foreign returns boost investor confidence."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capital outflows require domestic investors to sell domestic currency to buy foreign currency. This increases supply of domestic currency in forex markets, leading to depreciation. Exchange rates are determined by both trade flows (current account) and capital flows (financial account)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country experiencing high inflation relative to its trading partners would most likely see its currency:",
        "options": [
          "Remain stable due to purchasing power parity",
          "Appreciate due to higher nominal interest rates",
          "Appreciate as domestic consumers buy more imports",
          "Depreciate as domestic goods become less competitive"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "According to purchasing power parity, countries with higher inflation should experience currency depreciation to equalize price levels. Higher inflation makes domestic goods more expensive relative to foreign goods, reducing export competitiveness and increasing import demand. This puts downward pressure on the currency through the trade balance channel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which account records transactions involving foreign investments?",
        "options": [
          "Current Account",
          "Official Reserves Account",
          "Capital and Financial Account",
          "Trade Balance Account"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The capital and financial account records transactions in foreign assets: foreign direct investment, portfolio investment (stocks, bonds), and other investments. The current account records trade in goods/services, income, and transfers. Official reserves account records central bank transactions. There is no separate 'trade balance account'—trade balance is part of the current account."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement accurately describes the relationship between exchange rates and currency values?",
        "options": [
          "A currency quoted at a higher price has appreciated",
          "Exchange rates and currency values move in the same direction",
          "Exchange rates remain fixed while currency values fluctuate",
          "A currency quoted at a lower price has depreciated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a currency is 'quoted at a higher price,' it means more foreign currency is required to purchase one unit of it—this is appreciation. Exchange rates and currency values have an inverse relationship when quoted differently (e.g., dollars per euro vs. euros per dollar). Exchange rates can be fixed or flexible. Whether a lower quoted price means depreciation depends on the quotation method."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's government decreases spending and increases taxes in an effort to reduce a budget deficit, what is the likely effect on the country's currency in the foreign exchange market?",
        "options": [
          "The currency appreciates.",
          "The currency's value fluctuates.",
          "The currency remains stable.",
          "The currency depreciates."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy reduces government borrowing, decreasing demand for loanable funds and lowering interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce attractiveness to foreign investors, causing capital outflows. This increases supply of domestic currency in forex markets, leading to depreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy is operating below full employment and its currency suddenly appreciates. Which policy response would most effectively counteract the resulting change in aggregate demand?",
        "options": [
          "Reducing government spending to improve trade balance",
          "Implementing import quotas while maintaining currency value",
          "Expansionary fiscal policy to offset declining net exports",
          "Contractionary monetary policy to stabilize the currency"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation reduces net exports (exports become more expensive, imports cheaper), decreasing aggregate demand. With the economy below full employment, expansionary fiscal policy (increased government spending or tax cuts) directly boosts aggregate demand to offset the contraction from reduced net exports."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario would most likely lead to a deficit in the capital and financial account (CFA)?",
        "options": [
          "Foreign investment in domestic assets",
          "Increase in exports",
          "Domestic investment abroad",
          "Decrease in imports"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A capital and financial account deficit occurs when capital outflows (domestic investment abroad) exceed capital inflows (foreign investment domestically). Domestic investment abroad is a debit (outflow) in the CFA. Foreign investment in domestic assets is a credit (inflow). Export/import changes affect the current account."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What similarity exists between the current account and the capital (or financial) account in the balance of payments?",
        "options": [
          "Both exclusively manage the nation's gold reserves and securities.",
          "Both track transactions between a nation and foreigners.",
          "Each directly influences domestic monetary policy decisions.",
          "Each solely records the nation's export and import of goods."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both accounts record international economic transactions between residents and non-residents. The current account covers trade in goods/services, income, and transfers. The capital/financial account covers transactions in financial assets. They do not manage reserves, not solely record goods trade, and while they inform policy, they do not directly control it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following statements regarding foreign exchange market equilibrium are true except:",
        "options": [
          "At equilibrium in the foreign exchange market, there is no tendency for the exchange rate to change.",
          "Foreign exchange market equilibrium is achieved when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at a particular exchange rate.",
          "In foreign exchange market equilibrium, the quantity supplied of a currency always exceeds the quantity demanded.",
          "Market forces adjust the exchange rate until the supply of a currency equals its demand."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, quantity supplied equals quantity demanded—neither exceeds the other. If quantity supplied exceeded quantity demanded, there would be a surplus, putting downward pressure on the exchange rate until equilibrium is restored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way are consumer tastes and relative incomes similar in affecting exchange rates?",
        "options": [
          "Both can lead to a currency appreciating or depreciating.",
          "Both are unrelated to the demand for domestic and foreign goods.",
          "Each solely determines the volume of gold reserves in a country.",
          "Each is controlled directly by the nation's central bank policies."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both factors influence trade flows: consumer preferences affect demand for imports/exports, and relative incomes affect import spending capacity. Changes in either can cause currency appreciation or depreciation. For example, if consumers shift preference toward domestic goods, reduced import demand may cause currency appreciation."

        "options": [
          "Aggregate demand increases, resulting in higher domestic interest rates and an appreciation of the currency.",
          "Aggregate demand remains unchanged, but the exchange rate appreciates regardless of fiscal policy.",
          "Aggregate demand decreases, but the exchange rate remains unaffected because fiscal policy does not influence capital flows.",
          "Aggregate demand decreases, which may reduce domestic interest rates and lead to a depreciation of the currency due to lower capital inflows."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Contractionary fiscal policy directly reduces aggregate demand. Lower government borrowing reduces demand for loanable funds, lowering interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce capital inflows or cause outflows, decreasing demand for the domestic currency and leading to depreciation."

        "question": "A country is choosing to implement a monetary policy that loosens credit conditions, making domestic financial assets less attractive to foreign investors. What is the most likely outcome for its currency?",
        "options": [
          "The domestic currency is likely to appreciate because growth in domestic lending spurs rapid economic expansion.",
          "The domestic currency is likely to depreciate as lower interest rates reduce foreign investment demand.",
          "The domestic currency will experience unpredictable fluctuations with no clear trend, as market forces are purely random.",
          "There will be no change in the currency value since monetary policy does not affect exchange rates."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Expansionary monetary policy lowers interest rates, making domestic assets less attractive to foreign investors. This reduces capital inflows or causes outflows, decreasing demand for the domestic currency in forex markets and leading to depreciation."

          "The euro will appreciate relative to the US dollar"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increased European demand for U.S. goods requires Europeans to sell euros to buy dollars for payment. This increases demand for dollars and supply of euros in forex markets, causing the dollar to appreciate (more euros per dollar) and the euro to depreciate (fewer dollars per euro)."
