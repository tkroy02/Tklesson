      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a small country imposes a tariff on an imported good that it cannot influence on world markets, which group experiences the largest deadweight loss?",
        "options": [
          "Domestic consumers through higher prices",
          "Domestic producers through reduced competitiveness",
          "The domestic government through administrative costs",
          "Domestic society overall through efficiency losses"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For a small country (price-taker on world markets), tariffs create deadweight loss from both consumption distortion (consumers buy less than optimal) and production distortion (resources shift to less efficient domestic production). While consumers pay higher prices and producers gain some protection, the net efficiency loss to society is the largest concern, representing pure economic waste that benefits no one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose Country A and Country B form a customs union, eliminating tariffs between them but maintaining a common external tariff. If Country A begins importing shoes from Country B instead of from lower-cost Country C outside the union, this represents:",
        "options": [
          "Trade creation, which increases economic efficiency",
          "Trade diversion, which may reduce economic efficiency",
          "Absolute advantage realization",
          "Optimal currency area formation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Trade diversion occurs when a trade agreement causes imports to shift from a lower-cost producer outside the union to a higher-cost producer within the union due to tariff preferences. This can reduce global efficiency even if it benefits union members. Trade creation would occur if Country A started importing from Country B instead of producing shoes domestically at even higher cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under a fixed exchange rate system, if a country experiences a balance of payments deficit, the central bank must typically:",
        "options": [
          "Sell foreign currency reserves and buy domestic currency",
          "Buy foreign currency reserves and sell domestic currency",
          "Allow the currency to depreciate freely",
          "Implement expansionary monetary policy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To maintain a fixed exchange rate during a balance of payments deficit (excess supply of domestic currency), the central bank must buy the domestic currency using its foreign exchange reserves. This supports the currency's value but depletes reserves. Eventually, if deficits persist, the country may need to devalue the currency or implement contractionary policies to reduce demand for imports."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Marshall-Lerner condition' states that for a currency depreciation to improve the trade balance:",
        "options": [
          "The sum of price elasticities of demand for exports and imports must be greater than 1",
          "Domestic inflation must be lower than foreign inflation",
          "The country must have a flexible exchange rate regime",
          "The government must simultaneously implement fiscal austerity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Marshall-Lerner condition specifies that currency depreciation improves the trade balance only if |η_X| + |η_M| > 1, where η_X is price elasticity of demand for exports and η_M is price elasticity of demand for imports. If demand is inelastic (sum < 1), depreciation worsens the trade balance (the 'J-curve' may still lead to eventual improvement as elasticities increase over time)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best explains why developing countries might experience worsening terms of trade over time?",
        "options": [
          "The Prebisch-Singer hypothesis: primary commodity prices fall relative to manufactured goods",
          "Comparative advantage guarantees equal gains from trade for all participants",
          "Developed countries impose uniformly high tariffs on all imports",
          "Developing countries typically have overvalued currencies"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Prebisch-Singer hypothesis argues that prices of primary commodities (exports of many developing countries) tend to decline relative to prices of manufactured goods (exports of developed countries) due to: 1) Lower income elasticity of demand for primary products, 2) Technological progress reducing raw material needs, 3) Market power differences. This can worsen developing countries' terms of trade over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country with a floating exchange rate experiences capital flight due to political instability, what is the immediate effect on its currency and interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Currency depreciates; interest rates rise",
          "Currency appreciates; interest rates fall",
          "Currency depreciates; interest rates fall",
          "Currency appreciates; interest rates rise"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capital flight increases supply of domestic currency in forex markets (investors sell domestic assets for foreign currency) → currency depreciates. The selling of domestic bonds increases their supply, lowering bond prices and raising interest rates. This automatic adjustment makes domestic assets more attractive, potentially stabilizing capital flows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'voluntary export restraint' (VER) differs from a quota primarily in that:",
        "options": [
          "VERs are imposed by the importing country, quotas by the exporting country",
          "VERs are imposed by the exporting country, quotas by the importing country",
          "VERs generate government revenue for the importing country",
          "VERs are less trade-restrictive than quotas"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A VER is a quota imposed by the exporting country (often under pressure from the importing country). The key difference: with a VER, the exporting country's government or producers capture the quota rents (price difference × quantity), while with an import quota, the importing country could capture rents by selling licenses. Both restrict trade equally, but distribution of benefits differs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, according to the Balassa-Samuelson effect, countries with faster productivity growth in tradable goods will experience:",
        "options": [
          "Real exchange rate appreciation",
          "Real exchange rate depreciation",
          "No change in real exchange rates",
          "Higher inflation without exchange rate changes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Balassa-Samuelson effect explains why rapidly growing countries experience real exchange rate appreciation. Higher productivity growth in tradables increases wages economy-wide. Since non-tradables (services) don't benefit from the same productivity gains, their prices rise relative to tradables, increasing the overall price level and causing real appreciation even if the nominal rate is fixed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following trade policies would be most effective in protecting a specific domestic industry while minimizing consumer price increases?",
        "options": [
          "A production subsidy to domestic firms",
          "A tariff on competing imports",
          "An import quota",
          "A consumption tax on both domestic and imported goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A production subsidy supports domestic producers without raising consumer prices (unlike tariffs/quotas). Consumers still benefit from lower world prices, while domestic production is protected. However, subsidies require government funding (taxes) and may violate WTO rules. Economists generally prefer subsidies over tariffs for protection if protection is deemed necessary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'trilemma' of international economics states that a country cannot simultaneously have:",
        "options": [
          "Free trade, fixed exchange rates, and independent monetary policy",
          "Free capital mobility, fixed exchange rates, and independent monetary policy",
          "Balanced trade, full employment, and price stability",
          "Current account balance, capital account balance, and stable exchange rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The impossible trinity/trilemma: countries can only achieve two of: 1) Free capital mobility, 2) Fixed exchange rates, 3) Independent monetary policy. Example: With fixed rates and capital mobility, interest rates must align with anchor country (no independent policy). With fixed rates and independent policy, capital controls are needed. With independent policy and capital mobility, floating rates are required."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the nominal exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and British pound changes from $1.50/£ to $1.80/£, which of the following describes the change?",
        "options": [
          "Dollar appreciation of 20%",
          "Dollar depreciation of 20%",
          "Dollar appreciation of 16.7%",
          "Dollar depreciation of 16.7%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Calculation: (New rate − Old rate)/Old rate = (1.80 − 1.50)/1.50 = 0.30/1.50 = 0.20 = 20%. Since more dollars are needed to buy one pound, the dollar has depreciated by 20%. Alternatively, pound appreciation = (1/1.50 − 1/1.80)/(1/1.50) = (0.6667 − 0.5556)/0.6667 = 16.7% appreciation. Appreciation/depreciation percentages are not symmetric."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'effective rate of protection' measures how a tariff structure affects:",
        "options": [
          "Consumer prices for final goods",
          "The value added by domestic producers",
          "Government tariff revenue",
          "The volume of imports"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The effective rate of protection considers tariffs on both final goods and imported inputs. It measures the percentage increase in domestic value added made possible by the tariff structure. If final goods have high tariffs but inputs have low tariffs, domestic producers get high effective protection. This concept explains why tariff escalation (higher rates on processed goods) favors domestic manufacturing over raw material production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause the largest increase in a country's current account deficit, assuming all else equal?",
        "options": [
          "A domestic economic boom increasing import demand",
          "A foreign recession reducing export demand",
          "Currency appreciation making imports cheaper",
          "All of the above would have similar effects"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All three factors can significantly worsen the current account: 1) Strong domestic growth increases income and import spending, 2) Weak foreign growth reduces demand for exports, 3) Currency appreciation makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive. In practice, these often occur together (booms attract capital inflows causing appreciation), compounding the trade balance deterioration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'gravity model' of trade predicts that trade between two countries is proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "Their GDPs and inversely proportional to the distance between them",
          "Their comparative advantage differences",
          "Their tariff levels and exchange rate volatility",
          "Their cultural and linguistic similarities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The gravity model (analogous to Newton's law) states: Trade = k × (GDP₁ × GDP₂)/(Distance). Larger economies trade more; more distant countries trade less due to transportation costs, cultural differences, and informational barriers. This empirical regularity holds remarkably well and explains why regional trade agreements often have large effects (reducing 'distance' barriers)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country pegs its currency to another currency but experiences higher inflation than the anchor country, what is the likely consequence?",
        "options": [
          "Automatic real depreciation through nominal adjustment",
          "Loss of competitiveness and persistent current account deficits",
          "Capital inflows seeking higher returns",
          "Automatic monetary tightening to maintain the peg"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With a fixed nominal exchange rate, higher domestic inflation causes real appreciation (domestic goods become more expensive relative to foreign goods). This reduces export competitiveness and increases import attractiveness, leading to persistent current account deficits. To maintain the peg, the central bank may need to use reserves or implement contractionary policies, but the real appreciation and trade effects occur automatically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which argument for protectionism is based on strategic trade policy considerations?",
        "options": [
          "Infant industry protection",
          "National security concerns",
          "Retaliation against unfair trade practices",
          "Capturing economic profits in industries with increasing returns"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Strategic trade policy suggests that in industries with economies of scale and first-mover advantages (e.g., aerospace, semiconductors), temporary protection or subsidies can help domestic firms capture global market share and economic profits. This 'national champion' argument differs from infant industry (learning effects) or national security (essential goods). Critics note it risks trade wars and government picking losers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'sterilized' foreign exchange intervention occurs when a central bank:",
        "options": [
          "Buys foreign currency and sells domestic currency without offsetting monetary operations",
          "Buys foreign currency and sells domestic bonds to neutralize money supply effects",
          "Sells foreign currency and buys domestic currency to influence exchange rates",
          "Allows the exchange rate to float completely without intervention"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sterilization involves offsetting the monetary impact of forex intervention. Example: To resist currency appreciation, central bank buys foreign currency (increasing domestic money supply) but simultaneously sells government bonds (decreasing money supply). Net effect: exchange rate influenced but money supply unchanged. Unsterilized intervention changes both. Sterilization is often ineffective in long run as it doesn't address fundamental imbalances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between trade openness and economic growth according to empirical evidence?",
        "options": [
          "Trade openness universally and automatically increases growth rates",
          "Trade openness has no systematic relationship with growth",
          "Trade openness generally correlates with higher growth, but institutions matter",
          "Trade openness benefits developed countries but harms developing ones"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Most evidence shows trade openness associates with higher growth, but the relationship isn't automatic. Benefits depend on: 1) Complementary policies (education, infrastructure), 2) Institutional quality (property rights, rule of law), 3) Sequencing of liberalization. Openness alone isn't sufficient; countries need capacity to absorb technology and compete. Some countries have grown with protection (historically), but most successful economies eventually liberalize."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'absorption approach' to the balance of payments emphasizes that a current account deficit represents:",
        "options": [
          "An excess of domestic investment over domestic saving",
          "An excess of domestic spending over domestic output",
          "Currency misalignment due to speculative flows",
          "Structural competitiveness problems in export sectors"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The absorption approach (CA = Y − A, where Y = national output, A = absorption/spending) views current account deficits as domestic expenditure exceeding production. To reduce a deficit, either increase output (Y↑) or reduce absorption (A↓). This contrasts with the elasticities approach (focus on relative prices) and highlights that trade imbalances reflect national saving-investment gaps at the macroeconomic level."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario would make a currency union (like the Eurozone) sustainable according to optimal currency area theory?",
        "options": [
          "Member countries have synchronized business cycles and labor mobility",
          "Member countries maintain independent monetary policies",
          "Member countries have different inflation preferences",
          "Member countries specialize in different export sectors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Optimal currency area criteria include: 1) Synchronized business cycles (reduces need for independent monetary policy), 2) Labor mobility (allows adjustment to asymmetric shocks), 3) Fiscal transfers (risk-sharing), 4) Similar inflation preferences. When shocks affect countries differently (asymmetric), a common monetary policy may be inappropriate for some members, creating tension within the union."
