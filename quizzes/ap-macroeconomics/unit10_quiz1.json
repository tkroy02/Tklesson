    "subtitle": "AP Macroeconomics – Comparative Advantage, Trade Barriers, Exchange Rates, and Balance of Payments",
    "subject": "AP Macroeconomics",
    "topic": "Comparative Advantage, Tariffs, Quotas, Exchange Rates, Trade Balance, Current Account, Capital Account",
    "duration": 40,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the fundamental basis for international trade according to modern trade theory?",
        "options": [
          "Absolute advantage in all goods",
          "Government trade agreements",
          "Comparative advantage and opportunity cost differences",
          "Identical production possibilities across countries"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage, based on differences in opportunity costs, is the fundamental basis for mutually beneficial trade. Even if one country has an absolute advantage in producing all goods, both countries can benefit from trade by specializing in what they produce at lower relative opportunity cost."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country A can produce either 10 cars or 5 computers with one unit of resources, and Country B can produce either 8 cars or 2 computers with one unit of resources, which country has a comparative advantage in computers?",
        "options": [
          "Country A",
          "Country B",
          "Neither country",
          "Both countries"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Country A's opportunity cost of 1 computer = 2 cars (10/5). Country B's opportunity cost of 1 computer = 4 cars (8/2). Country A has a lower opportunity cost for computers (2 cars < 4 cars), giving it comparative advantage in computers. Country B has comparative advantage in cars (opportunity cost of 1 car = 0.25 computers vs. Country A's 0.5 computers)."

        "question": "A tariff imposed on imported steel will most likely result in:",
        "options": [
          "Lower domestic steel prices and increased domestic steel consumption",
          "Higher domestic steel prices and decreased domestic steel consumption",
          "Increased government revenue and lower domestic steel prices",
          "Decreased government revenue and increased imports of steel"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tariffs increase the price of imported goods, allowing domestic producers to raise prices as well. Higher prices reduce quantity demanded (consumption decreases). While government revenue may increase from the tariff, the primary effects are higher domestic prices and reduced consumption of both imported and domestically produced steel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a country's currency appreciates relative to other currencies, which of the following will occur?",
        "options": [
          "Its exports become cheaper for foreign buyers",
          "Its imports become more expensive for domestic consumers",
          "Its exports become more expensive for foreign buyers",
          "Its trade balance will necessarily improve"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Currency appreciation means each unit of domestic currency buys more foreign currency. This makes domestic goods more expensive when priced in foreign currency (exports become more expensive) and foreign goods cheaper when priced in domestic currency (imports become cheaper). This typically worsens the trade balance as exports decrease and imports increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The balance of payments is divided into two main accounts: the current account and the capital/financial account. Which of the following is included in the current account?",
        "options": [
          "Foreign direct investment",
          "Purchases of foreign stocks and bonds",
          "Trade in goods and services",
          "Changes in official reserves"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The current account includes: 1) Trade in goods and services (exports minus imports), 2) Net investment income, and 3) Net transfers. The capital/financial account includes purchases of foreign assets (stocks, bonds, FDI) and changes in official reserves. By definition, the two accounts sum to zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the United States has a trade deficit with China, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "The U.S. has a capital account surplus with China",
          "China has lower productivity than the U.S. in all goods",
          "The U.S. dollar must depreciate against the Chinese yuan",
          "The U.S. has an absolute advantage in all goods traded"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A trade deficit (current account deficit) must be financed by a capital account surplus—foreign investment flowing into the country. If the U.S. imports more from China than it exports, China earns dollars that it must invest in U.S. assets (Treasury bonds, stocks, real estate). This capital inflow represents a U.S. capital account surplus."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A quota on imported sugar will:",
        "options": [
          "Generate government revenue like a tariff",
          "Increase the domestic price of sugar and create quota rents for import license holders",
          "Decrease the domestic price of sugar below the world price",
          "Have no effect if domestic supply is sufficient"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A quota restricts the physical quantity of imports, reducing supply in the domestic market and increasing the domestic price above the world price. Unlike tariffs, quotas don't generate government revenue (unless the government sells import licenses). The difference between the world price and domestic price creates 'quota rents'—extra profit earned by those who hold import licenses."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a floating exchange rate system?",
        "options": [
          "The government fixes the exchange rate at a specific level",
          "The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in foreign exchange markets",
          "The exchange rate adjusts automatically to maintain purchasing power parity",
          "The central bank intervenes daily to stabilize the exchange rate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a floating (flexible) exchange rate system, currency values are determined by market forces of supply and demand without government intervention. This contrasts with fixed exchange rates (government sets value) or managed floats (government intervenes occasionally). Floating rates automatically adjust to balance international payments."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Japanese investors increase their purchases of U.S. government bonds, what is the most likely effect on the U.S. dollar and U.S. interest rates?",
        "options": [
          "Dollar appreciates; U.S. interest rates fall",
          "Dollar depreciates; U.S. interest rates rise",
          "Dollar appreciates; U.S. interest rates rise",
          "Dollar depreciates; U.S. interest rates fall"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Japanese investors need dollars to buy U.S. bonds, increasing demand for dollars in foreign exchange markets → dollar appreciates. The increased demand for U.S. bonds drives up bond prices, which inversely affects interest rates (bond prices ↑ = interest rates ↓). This capital inflow helps finance U.S. current account deficits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The infant industry argument for protectionism suggests that:",
        "options": [
          "All industries should be protected from foreign competition",
          "New industries need temporary protection to become competitive",
          "Mature industries need protection to maintain employment",
          "Agricultural sectors should always be protected for food security"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The infant industry argument claims that new domestic industries need temporary protection (tariffs, quotas) to grow large enough to achieve economies of scale and become internationally competitive. Once mature, protection should be removed. Critics note it's difficult to identify which industries deserve protection and when to remove it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory suggests that in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "Exchange rates should equalize interest rates across countries",
          "Exchange rates should adjust so identical baskets of goods cost the same in different countries",
          "Countries with trade deficits will always have depreciating currencies",
          "Central banks should intervene to maintain fixed exchange rates"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "PPP states that exchange rates should adjust so that a given basket of goods costs the same in different countries when expressed in a common currency. If a basket costs $100 in the U.S. and €80 in Europe, the PPP exchange rate should be $1.25/€. In reality, PPP holds only approximately due to trade barriers, transportation costs, and non-traded goods."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause the U.S. dollar to depreciate against the euro?",
        "options": [
          "Higher interest rates in the U.S. compared to Europe",
          "Increased U.S. demand for German automobiles",
          "Increased European demand for U.S. technology stocks",
          "Expansionary monetary policy in Europe"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased U.S. demand for German cars means Americans need more euros to pay for imports. They sell dollars to buy euros, increasing supply of dollars and demand for euros in forex markets → dollar depreciates, euro appreciates. Higher U.S. interest rates (A) would attract capital inflows, appreciating the dollar. Capital inflows to U.S. stocks (C) also appreciate the dollar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country with a flexible exchange rate experiences a large increase in its exports. What is the most likely effect on its currency value and trade balance?",
        "options": [
          "Currency appreciates; trade balance improves",
          "Currency appreciates; trade balance eventually moves toward zero",
          "Currency depreciates; trade balance worsens",
          "Currency depreciates; trade balance improves"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased exports raise demand for the country's currency (foreigners need it to pay for exports) → currency appreciates. The appreciation makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, reducing export demand and increasing import demand. This automatic adjustment moves the trade balance back toward equilibrium—the 'self-correcting' mechanism of flexible exchange rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the U.S. Federal Reserve conducts contractionary monetary policy (raises interest rates), what is the likely effect on international capital flows and the dollar?",
        "options": [
          "Capital outflow; dollar depreciation",
          "Capital inflow; dollar appreciation",
          "Capital outflow; dollar appreciation",
          "Capital inflow; dollar depreciation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher U.S. interest rates make U.S. assets more attractive to foreign investors → capital inflow as investors buy dollar-denominated assets. Increased demand for dollars causes dollar appreciation. This can worsen the U.S. trade deficit (stronger dollar makes exports more expensive, imports cheaper) but helps finance it through capital inflows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'J-curve effect' describes:",
        "options": [
          "The immediate improvement in trade balance following currency depreciation",
          "The initial worsening then eventual improvement of trade balance after currency depreciation",
          "The relationship between inflation and unemployment in open economies",
          "The long-term trend of increasing trade volumes with economic development"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The J-curve describes how currency depreciation initially worsens the trade balance (because import and export quantities adjust slowly due to contracts and habits, but prices change immediately) before eventually improving it (as quantities adjust to price changes). The trade balance follows a 'J' pattern over time: initial decline then recovery above starting point."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a non-tariff barrier to trade?",
        "options": [
          "A 10% tax on imported automobiles",
          "A limit of 1 million tons of steel imports per year",
          "Health and safety regulations that disproportionately affect foreign producers",
          "Both B and C"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Non-tariff barriers include: 1) Quantitative restrictions (quotas - B), 2) Regulatory standards that disadvantage imports (C), 3) Domestic content requirements, 4) Administrative delays, etc. Option A is a traditional tariff. Non-tariff barriers have become more common as tariffs have been reduced through trade agreements."

        "question": "According to the Heckscher-Ohlin model, countries will export goods that:",
        "options": [
          "Use their abundant factors of production intensively",
          "Use their scarce factors of production intensively",
          "Have the lowest absolute production costs",
          "Are produced by infant industries"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Heckscher-Ohlin theorem states that countries export goods that intensively use their abundant factors (e.g., labor-abundant countries export labor-intensive goods) and import goods that intensively use their scarce factors. This extends comparative advantage from productivity differences to factor endowment differences."

        "question": "If Country X has a current account deficit of $50 billion, what must be true about its capital/financial account?",
        "options": [
          "It must have a deficit of $50 billion",
          "It must have a surplus of $50 billion",
          "It must be in balance (zero)",
          "It cannot be determined without knowing the balance of trade"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By accounting identity: Current Account + Capital Account = 0. A current account deficit (−$50B) must be exactly offset by a capital account surplus (+$50B). This means the country is borrowing from abroad (receiving capital inflows) to finance its excess of imports over exports."

          "Payment of dividends to Japanese holders of U.S. stocks"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Credits in the current account represent inflows of payments to the country: exports of goods/services, income received from abroad, or transfers received. German tourists spending in the U.S. is an export of services (tourism). The other options are debits: imports (A), capital outflows (C), or income payments to foreigners (D)."

          "Appreciate to maintain purchasing power parity",
          "Depreciate to maintain purchasing power parity",
          "Remain unchanged if interest rates are adjusted",
          "Be pegged by the central bank to prevent inflation transmission"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to relative PPP, countries with higher inflation should see their currencies depreciate to maintain similar price levels across countries. If U.S. inflation is 5% and Eurozone inflation is 2%, the dollar should depreciate by approximately 3% against the euro to keep baskets of goods costing the same in both currencies."
