    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario would most likely cause a movement along the demand curve for loanable funds rather than a shift of the curve?",
        "options": [
          "A change in business tax incentives for capital purchases",
          "A technological innovation that creates new investment",
          "An increase in expected future profitability",
          "A change in the real interest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A change in the real interest rate causes movement along the demand for loanable funds curve. The other options shift the demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What similarity exists between Quantity Supplied and Supply?",
        "options": [
          "Both are related to production decisions at various prices",
          "Both are solely determined by consumer demand",
          "Both suggest that technology has no impact on production",
          "Both are fixed regardless of changes in market conditions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Quantity supplied refers to the amount at a specific price, while supply refers to the schedule/relationship at all prices. Both deal with producers' willingness to produce at different price levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The government reduces spending by $150 billion while simultaneously cutting taxes by $200 billion. If the MPC is 0.8, what is the net effect on aggregate demand in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Aggregate demand remains unchanged",
          "Aggregate demand increases by $250 billion",
          "Aggregate demand decreases by $50 billion",
          "Aggregate demand increases by $50 billion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Spending multiplier = 1/(1−0.8) = 5. ΔAD from spending cut = −150 × 5 = −750. Tax multiplier = −MPC/(1−MPC) = −0.8/0.2 = −4. ΔAD from tax cut = 200 × (−4) = −800. Net ΔAD = (−750) + (−800) = −1550? That seems off; recheck: Actually, tax cut is expansionary; formula: ΔAD from tax cut = −MPC/(1−MPC) × ΔT = −4 × (−200) = +800. Wait, ΔT = −200 (tax cut). ΔAD = −4 × (−200) = +800. ΔAD from spending cut = −150 × 5 = −750. Net ΔAD = +800 −750 = +50. So answer D? But given the options, they might treat tax cut effect as −MPC × ΔT × multiplier? Let's compute correctly: Spending multiplier = 5, ΔG = −150 → ΔAD1 = −750. Tax multiplier = −4, ΔT = −200 → ΔAD2 = (−4) × (−200) = +800. Net = +50 → but that’s not an option? Yes, option D says +50. That’s correct. I misread earlier. Answer: D."

        "question": "How does an increased consumer savings rate impact the components of the AD curve and the overall economy?",
        "options": [
          "Increases consumer spending and shifts AD rightward",
          "Decreases consumption, shifting AD left",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why would an unexpected increase in inflation due to a natural disaster lead to movement along the AD curve rather than a shift?",
        "options": [
          "Inflation only affects the supply side of the economy, not demand",
          "The price level changes but demand factors stay the same",
          "Inflation has no measurable effect on aggregate demand",
          "Supply and demand are equally impacted by inflation"
        ],
        "explanation": "If inflation (price level rise) is caused by a supply shock (like a natural disaster), the change in price level moves the economy along a stationary AD curve — AD doesn't shift unless the factors underlying C, I, G, or NX change.",

          "No change as imports and exports balance"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Removing tariffs makes imports cheaper, increasing imports and possibly reducing net exports (X−M), shifting AD left, assuming no immediate equal rise in exports."

          "Firms reduce production when interest rates fall",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs, increasing investment spending (I), which shifts AD right."

          "Affect all components equally"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher confidence raises consumption (C) and can boost investment (I) via expected future sales; lower confidence reduces both."

          "It shows no correlation between price and purchasing power",
          "Lower prices increase purchasing power and consumption",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Public investment projects (e.g., infrastructure) take time to plan and start spending; the AD shift may occur gradually."
