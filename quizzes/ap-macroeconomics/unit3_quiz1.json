    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause a rightward shift of the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in government spending",
          "An increase in consumer confidence",
          "A rise in the price level",
          "A decrease in the money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher consumer confidence increases consumption spending (C), shifting AD to the right. The price level movement causes movement along the AD curve, not a shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which component of Aggregate Demand is typically the largest in a developed economy?",
        "options": [
          "Net Exports",
          "Government Spending",
          "Investment",
          "Consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Consumption (C) is usually the largest component of GDP in advanced economies, often accounting for 60‑70% of total spending."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short‑run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve is upward sloping primarily because:",
        "options": [
          "Input prices adjust instantly to changes in the price level",
          "Wages and other input prices are sticky in the short run",
          "In the long run, all prices are flexible",
          "Potential output changes with the price level"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "SRAS slopes upward because nominal wages and some input prices are slow to adjust (sticky). When output prices rise, real production costs fall temporarily, encouraging more output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would shift the SRAS curve to the left?",
        "options": [
          "A technological improvement",
          "A decrease in nominal wages",
          "An increase in the price of imported oil",
          "A decrease in business taxes"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher input costs (e.g., imported oil) raise production costs, reducing SRAS at every price level — a leftward shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the economy is in a recessionary gap, which of the following describes the relationship between actual output and potential output?",
        "options": [
          "Actual output is greater than potential output",
          "Actual output equals potential output",
          "Actual output is less than potential output",
          "Potential output is undefined in the short run"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A recessionary gap occurs when actual real GDP is below potential GDP (full‑employment output)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would be the short‑run effect of a significant increase in business confidence on the price level and real GDP?",
        "options": [
          "Price level increases, real GDP decreases",
          "Price level decreases, real GDP increases",
          "Price level increases, real GDP increases",
          "Price level decreases, real GDP decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increased business confidence raises investment (I), shifting AD rightward. In the short run, this raises both real output and the price level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long‑run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve is vertical because:",
        "options": [
          "In the long run, only the price level matters for output",
          "Output in the long run is determined by technology, resources, and institutions, not the price level",
          "Government spending always adjusts to maintain full employment",
          "The economy always returns to the natural rate of unemployment immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "LRAS is vertical at potential GDP, which depends on the economy's productive capacity (labor, capital, technology). In the long run, changes in the price level do not affect real output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Stagflation occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Both inflation and unemployment decrease",
          "Inflation decreases but unemployment increases",
          "Both inflation and unemployment increase",
          "Inflation increases but unemployment decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stagflation = stagnation (high unemployment) + inflation. It is typically caused by a leftward shift of SRAS (e.g., supply shock)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a demand shock?",
        "options": [
          "A sudden increase in oil prices",
          "A major technological breakthrough",
          "A large decrease in consumer spending due to a recession scare",
          "An increase in minimum wage legislation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A demand shock affects spending components of AD. A fall in consumer spending shifts AD left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the economy is at full employment and there is an increase in Aggregate Demand, what is the long‑run result?",
        "options": [
          "Higher output and higher price level",
          "Higher output with no change in price level",
          "No change in output, higher price level",
          "No change in output, lower price level"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Starting at full employment, an AD increase raises prices in the short run but not output. In the long run, wages adjust, SRAS shifts left, returning output to potential but at a higher price level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A negative supply shock will most likely cause:",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in both inflation and unemployment",
          "An increase in inflation and a decrease in unemployment",
          "A decrease in inflation and an increase in unemployment",
          "An increase in both inflation and unemployment"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A negative supply shock (e.g., oil price spike) shifts SRAS left, raising prices (inflation) and reducing output (higher unemployment) — stagflation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The wealth effect, interest‑rate effect, and exchange‑rate effect explain why:",
        "options": [
          "SRAS slopes upward",
          "AD slopes downward",
          "LRAS is vertical",
          "Government spending affects output more than prices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "These three effects explain the inverse relationship between the price level and quantity of real GDP demanded — the downward slope of the AD curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the AD‑AS model, an inflationary gap exists when:",
        "options": [
          "Actual GDP is less than potential GDP",
          "Actual GDP equals potential GDP",
          "Actual GDP is greater than potential GDP",
          "The price level is falling"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An inflationary gap occurs when actual output exceeds potential output, putting upward pressure on prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which policy would be most appropriate to close a recessionary gap?",
        "options": [
          "Increase taxes",
          "Decrease government spending",
          "Increase government spending",
          "Reduce the money supply"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Expansionary fiscal policy (increase G or decrease T) shifts AD rightward, raising output toward potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If households decide to save more and spend less, the immediate effect in the AD‑AS model is:",
        "options": [
          "AD shifts right",
          "AD shifts left",
          "SRAS shifts left",
          "LRAS shifts left"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower consumption (C) reduces aggregate demand, shifting AD left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The natural rate of unemployment is represented in the AD‑AS model by:",
        "options": [
          "The vertical LRAS curve",
          "The horizontal portion of SRAS",
          "The point where AD intersects SRAS",
          "The difference between actual and potential GDP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "LRAS corresponds to potential GDP, where the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government cuts taxes for households, what is the most likely short‑run effect on the AD‑AS graph?",
        "options": [
          "AD shifts left, price level falls, output falls",
          "AD shifts right, price level rises, output rises",
          "SRAS shifts right, price level falls, output rises",
          "LRAS shifts right, price level falls, output rises"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tax cuts increase disposable income, raising consumption (C) and shifting AD right. In the short run, output and price level increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario would cause both AD and SRAS to shift to the right?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in consumer confidence and a decrease in oil prices",
          "An increase in government spending and an increase in wages",
          "An increase in exports and a technological improvement",
          "A decrease in taxes and an increase in business regulations"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher exports shift AD right; technological improvement shifts SRAS right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, after an increase in AD starting from full employment, the economy returns to:",
        "options": [
          "A higher output level and a higher price level",
          "The original output level and a higher price level",
          "A higher output level and the original price level",
          "The original output and price levels"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, output returns to potential (original output level), but the price level remains higher due to the initial AD increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the economy self‑corrects from a recessionary gap without policy intervention, which of the following occurs?",
        "options": [
          "Nominal wages rise, shifting SRAS left",
          "Nominal wages fall, shifting SRAS right",
          "Consumer confidence rises, shifting AD right",
          "Government spending increases, shifting AD right"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a recession, unemployment puts downward pressure on wages. Lower wages reduce production costs, shifting SRAS right until output returns to potential."
