        "question": "What is the primary specialized function of chloroplasts within plant cells?",
        "options": [
          "To capture light energy and synthesize glucose via photosynthesis",
          "To act as a storage facility for excess water and cellular waste",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chloroplasts are the solar-powered factories of the cell. They are specialized to convert radiant light energy into stable chemical energy stored in the bonds of glucose."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which specific pigment molecule is responsible for capturing light and giving chloroplasts their green appearance?",

          "Carotenoids",
          "Phycobilins",
          "Hemoglobin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorophyll is the primary pigment used in photosynthesis. It absorbs blue and red wavelengths of light and reflects green light, which is why most plants appear green."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Within a chloroplast, what are the individual disc-shaped membrane sacs called?",

          "Cristae",
          "Grana",
          "Nucleoli"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thylakoids are the site of the light-dependent reactions. Their membranes contain the chlorophyll and electron transport chains necessary for capturing solar energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What term is used to describe a vertical stack of thylakoid discs?",
        "options": [
          "Granum (plural: grana)",
          "Stroma",
          "Lumen",
          "Matrix"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Grana are organized stacks of thylakoids. This arrangement maximizes the surface area for light-capturing pigments within the limited volume of the organelle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where specifically do the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) take place within the chloroplast?",
        "options": [
          "In the stroma",
          "Across the thylakoid membranes",
          "Within the thylakoid lumen",
          "In the intermembrane space"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The stroma is the aqueous fluid surrounding the grana. It contains the enzymes (like Rubisco) required to convert carbon dioxide ($$CO_2$$) into sugar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what structural way are chloroplasts and mitochondria similar to one another?",
        "options": [
          "Both possess a highly folded inner membrane system to increase surface area",
          "Both are found in both animal and plant cells to provide energy",
          "Both use chlorophyll as their primary source of power and energy",
          "Both lack an outer membrane, allowing them to float freely in the cytosol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both organelles rely on increased surface area for energy transformations: mitochondria use cristae for respiration, and chloroplasts use thylakoids for photosynthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the biological advantage of having hundreds of thylakoids inside a single chloroplast?",
        "options": [
          "It maximizes the total surface area for light absorption",
          "It provides a place to store large amounts of starch and water",
          "It prevents the chloroplast from being damaged by excess heat",
          "It allows the plant to separate different colors of light for storage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More membrane surface area means more space for chlorophyll. This allows the plant to capture the maximum amount of solar energy possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which component of the chloroplast houses the enzymes necessary for carbon fixation?",

          "The stroma",
          "The inner membrane",
          "The grana stack",
          "The thylakoid lumen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The stroma is the chemical center where carbon fixation occurs. It holds the enzymes that assemble glucose molecules using ATP and NADPH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the presence of chloroplasts fundamentally change the lifestyle of a plant compared to an animal?",
        "options": [
          "Chloroplasts allow plants to be autotrophs, making their own food from sunlight",
          "Chloroplasts allow plants to hunt for nutrients in the soil",
          "Chloroplasts allow plants to breathe underwater more efficiently",
          "Chloroplasts eliminate the need for plants to undergo cellular respiration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chloroplasts enable autotrophy. Unlike animals (heterotrophs), plants don't need to consume other organisms to survive."
      },
      {

        "question": "Which statement best represents the concept of 'structure determines function' in the chloroplast?",
        "options": [
          "Thylakoids capture light energy; the stroma produces glucose",
          "The green pigment attracts insects for the purpose of pollination",
          "The outer membrane is designed to filter out harmful ultraviolet rays",
          "The small size of the organelle allows it to escape being eaten by herbivores"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The division of labor within the chloroplast—thylakoids for light harvesting and stroma for chemical synthesis—is a classic example of structure matching function."
