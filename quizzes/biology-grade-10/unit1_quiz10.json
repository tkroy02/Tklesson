        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The color change in Benedict's test is semi-quantitative; a transition from blue to green (low), yellow/orange (moderate), and brick-red (high) indicates sugar concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Biuret test is used to detect which macromolecule by reacting with peptide bonds?",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the procedure for the Ethanol Emulsion test used to identify lipids?",
        "options": [
          "Dissolve the sample in ethanol, then pour into water",
          "Apply iodine solution directly to the solid sample",
          "Mix the sample with Biuret reagent and apply heat",
          "Combust the sample and measure the total ash residue"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lipids dissolve in ethanol but not in water. When the ethanol-lipid solution is added to water, the lipids precipitate out as tiny droplets, forming a cloudy white emulsion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which result indicates a positive test for the presence of proteins using Biuret reagent?",
        "options": [
          "A color change from Light Blue to Violet/Purple",
          "A color change from Orange to deep Blue-black",
          "The formation of a distinct red layer at the top",
          "A color change from Blue to a solid Brick-red"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The shift from the light blue color of copper sulfate to violet indicates the presence of proteins."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To test for a non-reducing sugar like sucrose, what must be done to the sample before adding Benedict's solution?",
        "options": [

          "Treat the sample with Iodine and monitor for a primary color change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acid hydrolysis breaks the glycosidic bond in sucrose, releasing glucose and fructose (both reducing sugars) which then react with Benedict's reagent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sudan III is a dye often used to test for lipids. How does it work?",
        "options": [
          "It is a fat-soluble molecule that stains lipid layers red",
          "It reacts to the specific pH levels found in simple sugars",
          "It binds directly to the phosphate head of phospholipids",
          "It adheres to the tertiary alpha-helix structures of proteins"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sudan III is a non-polar dye; it dissolves in lipids and stains them a distinct red color."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an Iodine test remains yellow-brown, what can be concluded about the sample?",

          "Starch is not present",
          "Glucose is present in high amounts",
          "The sample contains protein",
          "The iodine reagent has expired"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Yellow-brown is the original color of the iodine reagent; no color change indicates a negative result for starch."
