    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "RNA Synthesis from DNA",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What enzyme carries out transcription?",
        "options": [
          "RNA polymerase",
          "DNA polymerase",
          "Helicase",
          "Ligase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RNA polymerase is the enzyme that builds RNA molecules by adding RNA nucleotides complementary to a DNA template strand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During transcription, which DNA strand serves as the template?",
        "options": [
          "Only one of the two DNA strands (template strand)",
          "Both DNA strands are transcribed simultaneously",
          "The coding strand with the higher concentration of G-C pairs",
          "The specific DNA strand that is structurally shorter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For any given gene, only one DNA strand (the template strand) is transcribed. The other strand (coding strand) has the same sequence as the RNA (with T instead of U)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does RNA polymerase know where to start transcription?",
        "options": [
          "It binds to specific promoter sequences on the DNA",
          "It attaches to random locations along the chromosome",
          "It begins at the first AUG start codon it encounters",
          "It follows a path created by helicase unwinding the DNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Promoter sequences are specific DNA regions that signal 'start transcribing here.' RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to promoters."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what direction is RNA synthesized during transcription?",
        "options": [
          "5' to 3' direction",
          "3' to 5' direction",
          "Both directions along the template strand",
          "The direction varies depending on the gene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase adds nucleotides only to the 3' end, so RNA grows in the 5'→3' direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does transcription differ from DNA replication?",
        "options": [
          "Transcription copies specific genes; replication copies entire chromosomes",
          "Transcription exhibits a much higher degree of accuracy than replication",
          "Replication utilizes RNA polymerase while transcription uses DNA polymerase",
          "The two processes are functionally identical except for the location"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Key differences: 1) Product: RNA vs DNA, 2) Amount copied: Gene vs entire chromosome, 3) Enzymes: RNA polymerase vs DNA polymerase, 4) Primer: Not needed vs needed for replication."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What base replaces thymine (T) in RNA?",
        "options": [
          "Uracil (U)",
          "Adenine (A)",
          "Cytosine (C)",
          "Guanine (G)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RNA contains uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). Uracil pairs with adenine, just like thymine does in DNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during elongation in transcription?",
        "options": [
          "RNA polymerase moves along DNA, adding complementary RNA nucleotides",
          "RNA polymerase proofreads and modifies the primary RNA strand",
          "The RNA molecule detaches completely from the DNA template",
          "The DNA double helix rewinds tightly behind the RNA polymerase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During elongation, RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template, unwinding it and adding RNA nucleotides complementary to the DNA template strand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does transcription terminate?",
        "options": [
          "RNA polymerase reaches a specific termination sequence in the DNA",
          "The RNA molecule naturally runs out of template DNA to copy",
          "The process stops once the entire DNA chromosome has been transcribed",
          "RNA polymerase dissociates after a fixed amount of time has elapsed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Termination occurs when RNA polymerase reaches specific termination sequences in the DNA. This causes the RNA transcript to be released."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the DNA after transcription?",
        "options": [
          "It rewinds back into its original double helix structure",
          "It remains in an unwound state for permanent gene expression",
          "It is enzymatically degraded and recycled by the cell",
          "It covalently bonds with the resulting RNA product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After RNA polymerase passes, the DNA behind it rewinds back into its double helix structure. The DNA is unchanged and can be transcribed again."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the initial product of transcription called?",
        "options": [
          "Pre-mRNA or primary transcript",
          "Mature, functional messenger RNA",
          "A completed, functional cytoplasmic protein",
          "A processed and edited RNA molecule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The RNA initially made is called pre-mRNA (in eukaryotes) or primary transcript. It often undergoes processing (editing) before becoming functional mRNA."
