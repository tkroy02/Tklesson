    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Single Trait Inheritance",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a monohybrid cross?",
        "options": [
          "A genetic cross focusing on one trait",
          "A cross between two separate species",
          "A cross involving multiple linked traits",
          "A cross that only produces hybrid offspring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monohybrid cross examines the inheritance of a single trait. For example, crossing plants that differ only in seed shape (round vs wrinkled)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of a Punnett square?",
        "options": [
          "To predict possible genotypes and phenotypes of offspring",
          "To determine the actual genotypes of parental organisms",
          "To modify the existing genetic makeup of offspring",
          "To track the long-term evolution of population traits"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A Punnett square is a visual tool that shows all possible combinations of gametes from parents, allowing prediction of offspring genotypes and phenotypes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In pea plants, round seeds (R) are dominant to wrinkled seeds (r). If two heterozygous plants (Rr) are crossed, what is the expected phenotypic ratio?",
        "options": [
          "3 round : 1 wrinkled",
          "1 round : 1 wrinkled",
          "All offspring with round seeds",
          "All offspring with wrinkled seeds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rr × Rr produces: 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr. Since R is dominant, RR and Rr plants have round seeds. So 3 round : 1 wrinkled."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a homozygous dominant plant (RR) is crossed with a homozygous recessive plant (rr), what will all the offspring be?",
        "options": [
          "Heterozygous (Rr) with dominant phenotype",
          "Homozygous dominant (RR) with dominant phenotype",
          "Homozygous recessive (rr) with recessive phenotype",
          "A random mix of all three possible genotypes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RR can only give R gametes; rr can only give r gametes. All offspring get R from one parent and r from the other, so all are Rr (heterozygous) showing the dominant trait."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the genotypic ratio from crossing two heterozygous individuals (Aa × Aa)?",
        "options": [
          "1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa",
          "All offspring as Aa",
          "3 AA : 1 aa ratio",
          "1 Aa : 1 aa ratio"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The classic Mendelian ratio: Each parent produces A and a gametes. Combining: 1/4 AA, 2/4 Aa, 1/4 aa, or 1:2:1 genotypic ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In humans, having free earlobes (F) is dominant to attached earlobes (f). If a heterozygous man marries a woman with attached earlobes, what percentage of their children would likely have attached earlobes?",
        "options": [
          "50%",
          "25%",
          "75%",
          "100%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Man: Ff (heterozygous), Woman: ff (attached). Cross: Ff × ff → 1/2 Ff (free) : 1/2 ff (attached). So 50% chance of attached earlobes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a 1:1 phenotypic ratio in offspring suggest about the parents' genotypes?",
        "options": [
          "One parent heterozygous, other homozygous recessive",
          "Both parents homozygous dominant for the trait",
          "Both parents heterozygous for the specific trait",
          "One parent homozygous dominant, other heterozygous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 1:1 ratio (like 1 dominant : 1 recessive) typically results from a test cross: heterozygous (Aa) × homozygous recessive (aa)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If all offspring from a cross show the dominant trait, what can you conclude about the dominant parent?",
        "options": [
          "It could be either homozygous dominant or heterozygous",
          "It must be heterozygous to achieve this outcome",
          "It must be homozygous dominant for the trait",
          "It is definitely homozygous recessive in genotype"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If ALL offspring show dominant trait, the dominant parent could be homozygous dominant (AA) or heterozygous (Aa) if crossed with another dominant individual. A test cross would be needed to determine for sure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In dogs, black fur (B) is dominant to brown fur (b). Two black dogs produce a brown puppy. What are the genotypes of the parents?",
        "options": [
          "Both must be Bb (heterozygous)",
          "Both must be BB (homozygous dominant)",
          "One parent is BB, the other is Bb",
          "One parent is BB, the other is bb"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Brown puppy has bb genotype (recessive). To produce a bb offspring, each parent must contribute a 'b' allele. Since both parents are black (dominant phenotype), they must be Bb."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are Punnett square predictions expressed as probabilities rather than certainties?",
        "options": [
          "Each fertilization event is random, like flipping a coin",
          "The squares are often calculated using incorrect ratios",
          "Environmental factors frequently override genetic outcomes",
          "Genes mutate rapidly during the gamete formation phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Punnett squares show probabilities, like coin flips. If you flip a coin twice, you expect 1 head : 1 tail, but you might get two heads. Similarly, a couple with 25% chance of a recessive trait might have 4 children all without it."
