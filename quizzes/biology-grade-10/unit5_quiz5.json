      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are gametes?",
        "options": [
          "Sex cells (sperm and eggs) with half the normal chromosome number",
          "Somatic cells that maintain the full species-specific diploid count",
          "Cells that undergo continuous mitosis for tissue-specific growth",
          "Specialized autotrophic cells used for internal glucose production"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gametes are haploid sex cells (n) produced by meiosis. Sperm are male gametes, eggs are female gametes. They combine during fertilization to form a diploid zygote (2n)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the process of sperm production called?",
        "options": [
          "Spermatogenesis",
          "Oogenesis",
          "Mitogenesis",
          "Gametogenesis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm production in male testes. It produces four functional sperm cells from each diploid germ cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the process of egg production called?",
        "options": [
          "Oogenesis",
          "Spermatogenesis",
          "Cytokinesis",
          "Binary Fission"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oogenesis is the process of egg (ovum) production in female ovaries. It produces one functional egg and polar bodies from each diploid germ cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many functional gametes result from spermatogenesis vs oogenesis?",
        "options": [
          "Spermatogenesis: 4 sperm; Oogenesis: 1 egg + polar bodies",
          "Both processes result in 4 functional cells per meiotic cycle",
          "Both processes result in 1 functional cell per meiotic cycle",
          "Spermatogenesis: 1 sperm; Oogenesis: 4 eggs + polar bodies"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spermatogenesis produces 4 equal-sized, functional sperm. Oogenesis produces 1 large, nutrient-rich egg and 2-3 small polar bodies that degenerate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the egg become so large compared to sperm?",
        "options": [
          "It contains nutrients and cytoplasm to support early embryo development",
          "It must be large enough to be identified by chemical receptors on sperm",
          "It contains duplicate sets of chromosomes to ensure genetic variation",
          "It requires a massive surface area to swim through the fallopian tubes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The egg stores nutrients, organelles, and cytoplasmic materials needed for the zygote's initial development after fertilization. The sperm contributes mainly genetic material."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are polar bodies in oogenesis?",
        "options": [
          "Small non-functional cells that receive little cytoplasm",
          "Secondary sperm cells that facilitate the fertilization process",
          "Protective somatic cells that nourish the egg during maturation",
          "Primary germ cells that are held in reserve for future cycles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polar bodies are small cells produced during oogenesis that receive chromosomes but minimal cytoplasm. They eventually degenerate, allowing one egg to get most nutrients."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When does oogenesis begin and complete in humans?",
        "options": [
          "Begins before birth, completes after puberty (one per month)",
          "Begins at puberty, completes within several days of the cycle",
          "Occurs continuously and rapidly throughout the entire adult life",
          "Occurs exclusively during active pregnancy to maintain hormone levels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In humans, oogenesis starts before a female is born (millions of primary oocytes formed). At puberty, one oocyte completes meiosis each month until menopause."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does spermatogenesis timing differ from oogenesis?",
        "options": [
          "Spermatogenesis begins at puberty and continues throughout life",
          "Spermatogenesis begins before birth and ceases during adulthood",
          "Both processes follow an identical timeline from birth to death",
          "Spermatogenesis is a seasonal process triggered by light cycles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spermatogenesis begins at puberty in males and continues throughout life, producing millions of sperm daily. Oogenesis has a limited timeframe and egg supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What adaptation helps sperm reach the egg?",
        "options": [
          "Flagellum (tail) for swimming",
          "Yolk-filled vacuoles for energy",
          "Chloroplasts for localized ATP",
          "Thick shells for osmotic balance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sperm have a flagellum (tail) that allows them to swim through the female reproductive tract to reach the egg. They are streamlined for motility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important that gametes are haploid?",
        "options": [
          "So fertilization restores the diploid chromosome number",
          "To allow the cells to move faster through fluid environments",
          "To prevent the occurrence of any potential genetic mutations",
          "To enable the cells to divide via mitosis after fertilization"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Haploid gametes (n) ensure that when sperm and egg fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote has the correct diploid (2n) chromosome number for the species."
