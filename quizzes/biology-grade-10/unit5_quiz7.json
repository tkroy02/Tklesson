    "duration": 10,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between genotype and phenotype?",
        "options": [
          "Genotype: genetic makeup; Phenotype: observable traits",
          "Genotype: observable traits; Phenotype: genetic makeup",
          "Genotype: cellular function; Phenotype: sequence of DNA",
          "Genotype: environmental impact; Phenotype: inherited alleles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Genotype is the actual genetic combination (like BB, Bb, or bb). Phenotype is the physical expression of those genes (like brown eyes or blue eyes)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these represents a genotype?",
        "options": [
          "Bb",
          "Brown eyes",
          "Tall plant",
          "Widow's peak hairline"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Genotypes use letters to represent alleles (like Bb, TT, aa). Phenotypes describe the observable trait (brown eyes, tall, widow's peak)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these represents a phenotype?",
        "options": [
          "Blue flowers",
          "Hh homozygous",
          "The letter Rr",
          "Recessive alleles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phenotypes describe what we can observe: physical appearance, biochemical characteristics, or behavior. 'Blue flowers' is an observable trait."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does it mean when two individuals have the same phenotype but different genotypes?",
        "options": [
          "They look the same but have different genetic combinations",
          "They are genetically identical but express different traits",
          "They have the same alleles but different chromosomal counts",
          "Their phenotypes have adapted to different environments"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For example, a brown-eyed person could have genotype BB (homozygous dominant) or Bb (heterozygous). Same phenotype (brown eyes), different genotypes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can two individuals with the same genotype have different phenotypes?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, due to environmental influences",
          "No, genotype always determines phenotype exactly",
          "Only if they belong to entirely different species",
          "Only if the alleles are specifically codominant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Environment can affect phenotype. For example, identical twins (same genotype) may have different heights if one has better nutrition, or different skin tones with different sun exposure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the genotype of a homozygous dominant individual for a trait?",
        "options": [
          "Two dominant alleles (like AA)",
          "Two recessive alleles (like aa)",
          "One dominant and one recessive allele (like Aa)",
          "A variable mix of multiple allele versions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homozygous dominant means having two copies of the dominant allele (AA). This individual will show the dominant phenotype."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the genotype of a heterozygous individual?",
        "options": [
          "One dominant and one recessive allele (like Aa)",
          "Two dominant alleles (like AA)",
          "Two recessive alleles (like aa)",
          "No observable alleles for that specific trait"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heterozygous means having two different alleles for a gene (Aa). This individual will show the dominant phenotype if the trait follows simple dominance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can you determine an organism's genotype if it shows the dominant phenotype?",
        "options": [
          "Perform a test cross with a homozygous recessive individual",
          "Visually inspect the somatic cells for allele size",
          "Compare its phenotype to the population average",
          "Observe the organism's environmental adaptability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A test cross (breeding with homozygous recessive) reveals whether a dominant-phenotype individual is homozygous dominant or heterozygous. If any offspring show recessive trait, parent was heterozygous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between genotype, phenotype, and proteins?",
        "options": [
          "Genotype (DNA) → Proteins → Phenotype (trait)",
          "Phenotype (trait) → Proteins → Genotype (DNA)",
          "Proteins → Genotype (DNA) → Phenotype (trait)",
          "Genotype and phenotype are structurally unrelated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Genes (genotype) provide instructions for making proteins. Proteins perform functions in cells, leading to observable traits (phenotype). This is the central dogma of molecular biology."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is understanding genotype vs phenotype important in medicine?",
        "options": [
          "It helps identify genetic carriers and predict disease risk",
          "It allows medical professionals to edit somatic genotypes",
          "It proves that external environments have no impact on health",
          "It confirms that phenotypes are resistant to genetic mutation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Some people carry disease alleles (genotype) without showing symptoms (phenotype). Genetic testing can reveal risks, allowing for early intervention or informed family planning."
