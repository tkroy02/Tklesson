    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is exponential growth?",
        "options": [
          "Growth at a constant rate per individual (J-shaped curve)",
          "Growth that slows as population approaches carrying capacity",
          "Growth that occurs only in a steady, linear fashion",
          "Growth that fluctuates up and down around a mean value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exponential growth occurs when resources are unlimited: population increases by a constant percentage each time period, creating a J-shaped curve on a graph."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is logistic growth?",
        "options": [
          "Growth that slows as it approaches carrying capacity (S-shaped curve)",
          "Unlimited growth at a maximum rate regardless of density",
          "Growth that occurs in sudden bursts followed by crashes",
          "A steady decline in the number of individuals over time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Logistic growth starts exponentially but slows as resources become limited, leveling off at carrying capacity (K), producing an S-shaped sigmoid curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between r-selected and K-selected species?",
        "options": [
          "r-selected: many offspring, little care; K-selected: few offspring, much care",
          "r-selected: large body sizes; K-selected: very small body sizes",
          "r-selected: long lifespans; K-selected: extremely short lifespans",
          "There is no functional difference between these two strategies"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "r-strategists (like insects, weeds) maximize reproductive rate in unstable environments. K-strategists (like elephants, humans) maximize survival in stable environments near K."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is biotic potential?",
        "options": [
          "Maximum reproductive rate of a population under ideal conditions",
          "The actual observed growth rate measured in a wild ecosystem",
          "The total carrying capacity of a specific environment",
          "The level of genetic diversity present within a population"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Biotic potential represents the theoretical maximum growth if all individuals survive and reproduce at maximum capacity (rarely achieved in nature)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during the lag phase of population growth?",
        "options": [
          "Population adjusts to environment, and growth is initially slow",
          "Population grows at the maximum possible exponential rate",
          "Population declines rapidly due to extreme overcrowding",
          "Population stabilizes permanently at the carrying capacity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the lag phase, individuals acclimate, establish territories, and begin reproducing - growth is initially slow before exponential phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What typically causes population growth to slow in the logistic model?",
        "options": [
          "Density-dependent factors like competition and disease",
          "Random environmental events like fires or volcanic eruptions",
          "Sudden genetic changes in the DNA of the population",
          "The mass migration of all individuals out of the area"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As population density increases, competition for resources intensifies, predation may increase, disease spreads more easily - these density-dependent factors reduce growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is overshoot in population dynamics?",
        "options": [
          "When a population temporarily exceeds its carrying capacity",
          "When population growth is perfectly regulated by predators",
          "When the carrying capacity of an area increases suddenly",
          "When a population drops below its minimum viable size"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to reproductive time lags, populations may continue growing briefly after reaching K, causing overshoot followed by die-off or crash."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What shape does exponential growth produce on a graph?",
        "options": [
          "J-shaped curve",
          "S-shaped curve",
          "Straight horizontal line",
          "U-shaped curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exponential growth curves upward increasingly steeply, resembling the letter J when viewed on a standard population vs. time graph."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for exponential growth?",
        "options": [
          "dN/dt = rN (where N=population, r=growth rate)",
          "dN/dt = rN(K-N)/K (where K=carrying capacity)",
          "N = K at all times throughout the growth period",
          "The growth rate (r) is always equal to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The exponential equation shows change in population (dN/dt) equals growth rate (r) times current population size (N)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do most natural populations show logistic rather than exponential growth?",
        "options": [
          "Resources such as space and food are limited in real ecosystems",
          "Organisms intentionally limit their reproduction to save the area",
          "Exponential growth only occurs within controlled laboratories",
          "Global climate change prevents species from reaching potential"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In nature, space, food, water, and other resources are finite, creating competition that limits population size long before theoretical biotic potential is reached."
