    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Energy Carriers in Photosynthesis",
    "duration": 10,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of ATP during the Calvin cycle?",
        "options": [
          "To provide the chemical energy necessary to build glucose molecules",
          "To serve as the primary source of carbon for sugar synthesis",
          "To split water molecules into oxygen and protons",
          "To act as a pigment that absorbs green light wavelengths"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ATP acts as the 'battery' for the Calvin cycle. It provides the energy required to power the chemical reactions that rearrange carbon atoms into glucose."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the specific role of NADPH within the stroma during photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "To provide high-energy electrons and hydrogen for reducing $CO_2$",
          "To provide the structural framework for the thylakoid membrane",
          "To carry oxygen gas from the thylakoid to the stomata",
          "To absorb photons and excite electrons in Photosystem I"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "NADPH is a reducing agent. It carries 'reducing power' in the form of high-energy electrons and hydrogen atoms, which are added to carbon compounds to create sugar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In terms of their metabolic destination, how are ATP and NADPH similar?",
        "options": [
          "Both are produced in the light reactions and consumed in the Calvin cycle",
          "Both are enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of glucose for energy",
          "Both are light-absorbing pigments found within the grana",
          "Both are gaseous waste products released during the day"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ATP and NADPH represent the link between the two stages of photosynthesis. They store the energy captured from light so it can be used later to build matter."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to an ATP molecule after it releases its energy in the Calvin cycle?",
        "options": [
          "It loses a phosphate group to become ADP and returns to the thylakoid",
          "It is completely broken down into carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms",
          "It becomes a structural part of the newly formed glucose molecule",
          "It is converted into NADPH to help carry more electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The process is cyclical. Once ATP is 'spent,' it becomes ADP. This ADP must return to the light-dependent reactions to be 'recharged' with a new phosphate group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the status of NADPH once it has donated its electrons to the Calvin cycle?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes NADP$^+$ and travels back to the light reactions",
          "It gains an extra hydrogen atom to become NADPH$_2$",
          "It is stored in the central vacuole as a reserve energy source",
          "It is transformed into an ATP molecule to save space"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After donating its electrons and hydrogen ($H^+$), NADPH reverts to its 'empty' form, NADP$^+$. It then returns to the thylakoid membrane to pick up more electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do ATP and NADPH facilitate the connection between the two stages of photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "They act as chemical shuttles that transfer energy between the thylakoids and the stroma",
          "They allow the light-independent reactions to occur in the mitochondria",
          "They convert glucose directly back into light energy for the plant to use",
          "They prevent the plant from needing carbon dioxide during the day"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ATP and NADPH are the bridge. They take the energy captured by the thylakoids (Stage 1) and deliver it to the stroma (Stage 2) where the work of building sugar happens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a key structural and functional difference between NADPH and NADH?",
        "options": [
          "NADPH has an extra phosphate and is primarily used for building molecules",
          "NADH contains significantly more energy than NADPH",
          "NADPH is only used in animal cells for cellular respiration",
          "NADH is the molecule used to capture light in the thylakoid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'P' in NADPH stands for Phosphate. While NADH is generally used to *break down* molecules for energy in respiration, NADPH is used to *build* molecules (biosynthesis) in photosynthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why would the Calvin cycle immediately stop if the supply of ATP and NADPH were cut off?",
        "options": [
          "The cycle requires both an energy source and a source of electrons to build sugar",
          "ATP and NADPH are the physical building blocks of the carbon dioxide molecule",
          "These molecules are required to keep the chloroplast at a cool temperature",
          "The plant would run out of carbon atoms without these energy carriers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Building sugar from $CO_2$ is an 'uphill' process. Without the energy (ATP) and the 'glue' (electrons from NADPH), the chemical rearrangement simply cannot happen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Approximately how much chemical energy is required to produce a single molecule of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$)?",
        "options": [
          "18 ATP and 12 NADPH",
          "6 ATP and 6 NADPH",
          "2 ATP and 2 NADPH",
          "38 ATP and 0 NADPH"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Synthesis is expensive! To fix 6 molecules of $CO_2$ into one glucose, the plant must spend 18 ATP and 12 NADPH molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a plant was exposed to a toxin that prevented the formation of NADPH but allowed ATP production, what would happen?",
        "options": [
          "Sugar production would stop because there are no electrons to reduce $CO_2$",
          "The plant would produce glucose normally using only the energy from ATP",
          "The plant would start using water directly to build the sugar molecules",
          "The light reactions would produce extra oxygen to compensate for the loss"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy (ATP) isn't enough on its own. To turn $CO_2$ into sugar, you must add electrons and hydrogen. Without NADPH, the 'reduction' step of the Calvin cycle fails."
