      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to ATP after it is used in the Calvin cycle?",
        "options": [
          "Loses a phosphate to become ADP and is recycled",
          "Breaks down into carbon dioxide and water vapor",
          "Becomes a permanent part of the glucose molecule",
          "Is released from the chloroplast as cellular waste"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once ATP is spent, it becomes ADP. It then returns to the thylakoid to be 'recharged' during the light reactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to NADPH after it is used in the Calvin cycle?",
        "options": [
          "Loses electrons to become NADP$^+$ and is recycled",
          "Gains extra energy to become a larger carrier",
          "Is incorporated into the final sugar structure",
          "Is converted into ATP for long-term storage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "NADPH returns to its oxidized form, NADP$^+$, after donating electrons. It then travels back to the thylakoid for another round."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do these carriers link the two stages of photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "They shuttle energy from thylakoids to the stroma",
          "They produce glucose directly from the light energy",
          "They function independently in different organelles",
          "They convert oxygen into carbon dioxide for the plant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ATP and NADPH act as the bridge, carrying the energy captured in the first stage to power the work in the second stage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a major difference between NADPH and NADH?",
        "options": [
          "NADPH has a phosphate and is used for building",
          "NADH contains more chemical energy than NADPH",
          "NADPH is only found in the cells of mammals",
          "NADH is used to capture light in the thylakoids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The extra phosphate in NADPH specializes it for anabolic (building) reactions like photosynthesis, while NADH is for catabolic (breaking down) reactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Calvin cycle unable to proceed without NADPH?",
        "options": [
          "It lacks the electrons needed to reduce the carbon",
          "It lacks the enzymes needed to absorb the carbon",
          "It lacks the carbon atoms to build the glucose",
          "It lacks the pigments needed to reflect the light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without the reducing power of NADPH, the plant cannot add the necessary electrons and hydrogen to $CO_2$ to create sugar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much energy is needed for one molecule of glucose?",
        "options": [
          "Roughly 18 ATP and 12 NADPH molecules",
          "Roughly 6 ATP and 6 NADPH molecules",
          "Roughly 2 ATP and 2 NADPH molecules",
          "Roughly 36 ATP and 24 NADPH molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Creating a single molecule of glucose is energy-intensive, requiring a specific ratio of energy and reducing power."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if a plant has ATP but lacks NADPH?",
        "options": [
          "Sugar production stops due to lack of electrons",
          "Sugar production continues using only the ATP",
          "The plant creates glucose from water molecules",
          "The light reactions produce more oxygen to help"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy (ATP) is not enough; the chemical transformation of $CO_2$ into glucose requires the electrons provided specifically by NADPH."
