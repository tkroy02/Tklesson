        "question": "What is the primary difference between a purine and a pyrimidine base?",
        "options": [
          "Purines have a double-ring structure, while pyrimidines have a single-ring structure",
          "Purines are found only in RNA strands, while pyrimidines are found only in DNA",
          "Purines contain organic phosphorus, while pyrimidines contain organic sulfur",
          "Purines are highly hydrophilic, while pyrimidines are entirely hydrophobic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Purines (Adenine and Guanine) consist of a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Thymine, and Uracil) consist of a single six-membered ring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following nitrogenous bases is classified as a purine?",

          "Uracil"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) are the two purine bases found in both DNA and RNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which nitrogenous base is found exclusively in RNA and replaces thymine?",
        "options": [
          "Uracil",
          "Adenine",
          "Cytosine",
          "Guanine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Uracil is the pyrimidine base unique to RNA; it pairs with adenine, similar to how thymine pairs with adenine in DNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of a molecule that consists of only a pentose sugar and a nitrogenous base, without a phosphate group?",
        "options": [
          "Nucleoside",
          "Nucleotide",
          "Polynucleotide",
          "Amino acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A nucleoside is the sugar-base combination. Once a phosphate group is added, it becomes a nucleotide (specifically a nucleoside monophosphate)."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a polynucleotide chain, the $$3'$$ carbon of one sugar is linked to the $$5'$$ phosphate of the next. What is this bond called?",
