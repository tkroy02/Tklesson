        "options": [
          "It is temporarily stored in the bonds of ATP molecules",
          "It is released as heat and lost immediately to the environment",
          "It is used directly to power all cellular work without storage",
          "It is converted to light energy for use in cellular signaling"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The energy from catabolic reactions is captured in the bonds of ATP, which then serves as a portable energy source for various cellular activities."
