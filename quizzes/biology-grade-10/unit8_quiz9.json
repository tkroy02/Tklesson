        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hormones are chemical substances produced by endocrine glands that travel through the bloodstream to target cells/organs, where they regulate physiological activities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What specific characteristic allows a hormone to affect only certain target cells?",
        "options": [
          "Target cells possess specific protein receptors for that particular hormone",
          "Hormones are physically directed only to certain anatomical body parts",
          "All cells in the human body respond to all circulating hormones equally",
          "Hormones are selectively filtered and deactivated by non-target organs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The lock-and-key mechanism: only cells with specific protein receptors for a particular hormone can respond to it, ensuring precise regulation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two primary chemical classifications of hormones?",
        "options": [
          "Steroid hormones and protein/peptide hormones",
          "Acidic-based hormones and basic-alkaline hormones",
          "Fast-acting neurotransmitter hormones and slow-acting body hormones",
          "Localized brain hormones and systemic peripheral body hormones"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steroid hormones (lipid-soluble, from cholesterol, e.g., sex hormones) vs. protein/peptide hormones (water-soluble, e.g., insulin, growth hormone)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do steroid hormones differ from protein hormones in their mechanism of action?",
        "options": [
          "Steroids enter cells to affect gene expression; proteins bind to surface receptors",
          "Steroids trigger immediate rapid responses; proteins work slowly over many days",
          "Steroids only influence muscle growth; proteins only affect glandular secretion",
          "There is no functional difference in how these two classes interact with cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steroid hormones (lipid-soluble) diffuse through cell membranes, bind intracellular receptors, and directly affect DNA transcription. Protein hormones bind membrane receptors, triggering second messenger systems."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary physiological role of insulin in the body?",
        "options": [
          "Lowering blood glucose by promoting cellular uptake and glycogen storage",
          "Raising blood glucose levels by triggering the breakdown of liver glycogen",
          "Directly regulating the concentration of calcium ions within the blood",
          "Controlling the overall metabolic rate and cellular oxygen consumption"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Insulin, secreted by pancreatic beta cells, lowers blood glucose by facilitating glucose uptake into cells and promoting glycogen storage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which hormone acts as the functional antagonist to insulin?",
        "options": [
          "Glucagon",
          "Thyroxine",
          "Cortisol",
          "Estrogen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glucagon (from pancreatic alpha cells) raises blood glucose by stimulating glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis, opposing insulin's action."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary biological effect of Growth Hormone (GH)?",
        "options": [
          "Stimulating the growth and repair of tissues, specifically bone and muscle",
          "Regulating the circadian rhythms and daily sleep-wake cycles",
          "Controlling the homeostatic balance of water and electrolytes",
          "Preparing the body for immediate acute stress and fight-or-flight responses"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Growth hormone promotes tissue growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration by stimulating protein synthesis and fat metabolism."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What defines a 'tropic' hormone?",
        "options": [
          "A hormone that stimulates another endocrine gland to secrete its own hormones",
          "A hormone that acts directly on non-endocrine tissues to produce a response",
          "A hormone that primarily functions to inhibit the activity of other hormones",
          "A hormone specialized solely for the regulation of the digestive system"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tropic hormones control the secretion of other endocrine glands (e.g., TSH stimulates thyroid; ACTH stimulates adrenal cortex)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What occurs during the process of hormone up-regulation?",
        "options": [
          "Target cells increase the number of specific receptors to enhance sensitivity",
          "The primary endocrine gland begins to secrete a lower volume of the hormone",
          "The hormone molecules are broken down more rapidly within the bloodstream",
          "The target tissues become significantly less sensitive to the circulating hormone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Up-regulation increases sensitivity to a hormone. Conversely, down-regulation (as seen in Type 2 Diabetes) decreases sensitivity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do different hormones exhibit varying response times within the body?",
        "options": [
          "It depends on whether they activate genes or trigger second messenger systems",
          "All hormones are chemically designed to work at identical physiological speeds",
          "Faster hormones are evolved to be more critical for overall survival",
          "Response time is determined solely by the total concentration of the hormone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steroid hormones (affecting gene expression) take hours to days. Protein hormones (using second messengers like cAMP) act within minutes to hours."
