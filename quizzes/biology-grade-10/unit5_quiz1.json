        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cell cycle is the series of events that leads to cell growth, DNA replication, and cell division, producing two daughter cells from one parent cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two main phases of the cell cycle?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cell cycle consists of Interphase (cell growth and DNA replication) and the Mitotic phase (actual cell division, including mitosis and cytokinesis)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During which phase does DNA replication occur?",
        "options": [

          "Metaphase of Mitosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA replication happens during the S phase (Synthesis phase) of Interphase. This ensures each daughter cell gets a complete copy of DNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during G1 phase of Interphase?",
        "options": [
          "Cell growth and normal metabolic activities",
          "Duplication of sister chromatids and histones",
          "Condensation of chromatin into visible structures",
          "Alignment of homologous pairs at the cell plate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During G1 (Gap 1) phase, the cell grows, carries out normal functions, and prepares for DNA replication. It's a period of intense biochemical activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of G2 phase?",
        "options": [
          "Preparation for cell division and final growth",
          "Primary synthesis of mitochondrial DNA molecules",
          "Active separation of the two cellular nuclei",
          "Direct division of the phospholipid bilayer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During G2 (Gap 2) phase, the cell prepares for mitosis: it grows more, produces proteins needed for division, and checks that DNA replication was successful."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during cytokinesis?",
        "options": [
          "The cytoplasm divides, forming two separate cells",
          "The nucleolus dissolves to allow spindle attachment",
          "The nuclear envelope reforms around the chromatin",
          "The centrosomes migrate to the poles of the cell"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm and organelles, completing cell division. It usually follows mitosis (nuclear division)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell cycles differ?",
        "options": [
          "Prokaryotes use binary fission; eukaryotes use mitosis/meiosis",
          "Prokaryotes require a complex spindle apparatus for division",
          "Eukaryotes lack a specialized phase for DNA replication",
          "Prokaryotes maintain a nuclear membrane during their cycle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Prokaryotes (bacteria) divide by simple binary fission. Eukaryotes (plants, animals, fungi) have more complex cycles with mitosis or meiosis for nuclear division."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are checkpoints in the cell cycle and why are they important?",
        "options": [
          "Control points that ensure conditions are right before proceeding",
          "Stationary phases where cells permanently cease all activity",
          "Specific locations on the DNA where enzymes begin replication",
          "Metabolic pathways that convert glucose into cell wall material"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Checkpoints verify that the cell is ready to proceed. They prevent errors like damaged DNA being replicated or uneven chromosome distribution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if cell cycle regulation fails?",
        "options": [
          "Uncontrolled cell division can lead to cancer",
          "The cell reverts to an anaerobic metabolic state",
          "The organism immediately stops all somatic growth",
          "Chromosomes are converted into simple protein chains"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When cell cycle controls fail, cells may divide uncontrollably, forming tumors. This is why cancer is often called 'uncontrolled cell division.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is understanding the cell cycle important in medicine?",
        "options": [
          "It helps develop cancer treatments and understand development",
          "It identifies the specific bacteria responsible for infection",
          "It prevents the occurrence of any future genetic mutations",
          "It ensures that all cells in the body divide at identical rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cancer treatments often target rapidly dividing cells. Understanding the cell cycle also helps with wound healing, fetal development, and treating genetic disorders."
