        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Every amino acid shares a fundamental structure: a central carbon bonded to a hydrogen, an amino group ($$-NH_2$$), a carboxyl group ($$-COOH$$), and a variable side chain known as the R-group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the backbone is identical across all amino acids, the R-group varies in size, charge, and polarity, dictating how the amino acid interacts within a protein."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many standard amino acids are used by living organisms to build proteins?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are 20 standard amino acids that occur in various sequences to form the vast diversity of proteins found in nature."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the chemical formula for the amino group found in all amino acids?",
        "options": [
          "$$-NH_2$$",
          "$$-COOH$$",
          "$$-OH$$",
          "$$-CH_3$$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The amino group consists of one nitrogen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms ($$-NH_2$$); it acts as a base by accepting protons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which functional group gives an amino acid its acidic properties?",
        "options": [
          "Carboxyl group ($$-COOH$$)",
          "Amino group ($$-NH_2$$)",
          "Phosphate group ($$-PO_4$$)",
          "Hydroxyl group ($$-OH$$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carboxyl group can donate a hydrogen ion ($$H^+$$) in solution, which is the defining characteristic of an acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Amino acids that the human body cannot synthesize and must be obtained from the diet are called:",
        "options": [
          "Essential amino acids",
          "Non-essential amino acids",
          "Inorganic amino acids",
          "Secondary amino acids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Essential amino acids (usually 9 in humans) cannot be produced by metabolic pathways and must be ingested through food."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An R-group that consists entirely of hydrocarbons (carbon and hydrogen) would make an amino acid:",
        "options": [
          "Hydrophobic",
          "Hydrophilic",
          "Negatively charged",
          "Positively charged"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrocarbon chains are non-polar and do not interact well with water, classifying the amino acid as hydrophobic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At physiological pH (around 7.4), amino acids often exist as 'zwitterions.' What does this mean?",
        "options": [
          "They carry both a positive and a negative charge, making them dipolar ions",
          "They have completely lost all their oxygen atoms through dehydration",
          "They have bonded with a lipid to become completely insoluble in water",
          "They have changed from a linear chain to a complex closed ring structure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a zwitterion, the amino group is protonated ($$-NH_3^+$$) and the carboxyl group is deprotonated ($$-COO^-$$), resulting in a molecule with a net neutral charge but localized charges."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element is found in amino acids but is generally absent from pure carbohydrates and lipids?",
        "options": [
          "Nitrogen",
          "Carbon",
          "Hydrogen",
          "Oxygen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen is a key component of the amino group. While C, H, and O are in almost all organic molecules, nitrogen is a defining feature of proteins and nucleic acids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following amino acids contains sulfur in its R-group, allowing it to form disulfide bridges?",

          "Cysteine",
          "Glycine",
          "Alanine",
          "Serine"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cysteine contains a sulfhydryl group ($$-SH$$), which is critical for forming strong covalent disulfide bonds that stabilize protein folding."
