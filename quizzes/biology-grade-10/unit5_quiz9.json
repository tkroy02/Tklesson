    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Two Trait Inheritance",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a dihybrid cross?",
        "options": [
          "A cross examining two different traits simultaneously",
          "A cross between two separate species with distinct traits",
          "A cross involving only one trait with multiple alleles",
          "A cross that always produces genetically identical offspring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dihybrid cross studies the inheritance of two different traits at the same time, like seed shape AND seed color in pea plants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment?",
        "options": [
          "Genes for different traits assort independently during gamete formation",
          "Alleles for a single trait separate during the gamete formation phase",
          "Dominant alleles always mask the physical expression of recessive alleles",
          "Genes located on the same chromosome are always inherited as a single unit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Independent assortment means that the inheritance of one trait doesn't affect the inheritance of another trait (for genes on different chromosomes). This creates new combinations of traits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In pea plants, round (R) is dominant to wrinkled (r), and yellow (Y) is dominant to green (y). What gametes can a RrYy plant produce?",
        "options": [
          "RY, Ry, rY, ry",
          "Only RY and ry combinations",
          "RR, YY, rr, yy combinations",
          "R, r, Y, y as separate units"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A heterozygous plant for both traits (RrYy) produces four types of gametes: RY, Ry, rY, ry. Each gamete gets one allele for each gene."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the classic phenotypic ratio from a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous individuals (RrYy × RrYy)?",
        "options": [
          "9:3:3:1",
          "3:1",
          "1:2:1",
          "1:1:1:1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The dihybrid cross of two heterozygotes produces: 9 round yellow, 3 round green, 3 wrinkled yellow, 1 wrinkled green. This is the classic 9:3:3:1 ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many squares are in a Punnett square for a dihybrid cross?",
        "options": [
          "16 (4×4)",
          "4 (2×2)",
          "8 (4×2)",
          "64 (8×8)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each heterozygous parent produces 4 types of gametes, so a 4×4 grid (16 squares) is needed to show all possible combinations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two traits are independently assorted, what does this imply about their gene locations?",
        "options": [
          "They are located on different chromosomes",
          "They are located on the same chromosome",
          "They are situated very close together on the same chromosome",
          "They are strictly inherited through mitochondrial DNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Independent assortment typically occurs when genes are on different chromosomes. Genes on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together (linked), unless crossing over separates them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In rabbits, black fur (B) is dominant to brown (b), and short hair (S) is dominant to long hair (s). A BbSs rabbit is crossed with a bbss rabbit. What is the expected phenotypic ratio?",
        "options": [
          "1 black short : 1 black long : 1 brown short : 1 brown long",
          "All offspring expressing the black short hair phenotype",
          "The standard 9:3:3:1 Mendelian phenotypic ratio",
          "3 black short : 1 brown long phenotypic ratio"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "BbSs × bbss is a test cross for two traits. BbSs produces BS, Bs, bS, bs gametes; bbss produces only bs. Result: 1 BbSs : 1 Bbss : 1 bbSs : 1 bbss, or 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What fraction of offspring from RrYy × RrYy would be homozygous recessive for both traits?",
        "options": [
          "1/16",
          "1/4",
          "1/8",
          "1/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For each trait, chance of homozygous recessive is 1/4 (rr = 1/4, yy = 1/4). Multiply: 1/4 × 1/4 = 1/16 chance of rryy (wrinkled green)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does independent assortment increase genetic variation?",
        "options": [
          "It creates new combinations of traits not present in parents",
          "It facilitates the creation of new alleles through mutation",
          "It prevents certain traits from being inherited by offspring",
          "It ensures that all offspring in a generation are identical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parents might be round yellow and wrinkled green. Through independent assortment, offspring can be round green or wrinkled yellow - new combinations not seen in either parent!"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you get a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in offspring, what were the parents' genotypes?",
        "options": [
          "Both heterozygous for both traits (RrYy × RrYy)",
          "One homozygous dominant and one heterozygous for both traits",
          "Both homozygous recessive for both traits involved",
          "One heterozygous and one homozygous recessive for both traits"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 9:3:3:1 ratio is the hallmark of a dihybrid cross between two individuals heterozygous for both traits. Any other parental combination produces different ratios."
