    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Growth and Repair Functions",
    "duration": 10,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of mitosis in multicellular organisms?",
        "options": [
          "Growth and repair of tissues",
          "Production of gametes (sex cells)",
          "Increasing genetic variation",
          "Reducing chromosome number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis allows organisms to grow from a single fertilized egg into a complex multicellular organism and to replace damaged or worn-out cells throughout life."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does mitosis help in wound healing?",
        "options": [
          "It produces new cells to replace damaged ones",
          "It triggers apoptosis in all adjacent healthy cells",
          "It alters the genetic code to resist future injury",
          "It synthesizes structural proteins like collagen directly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When you get a cut, cells around the wound undergo mitosis to produce identical new cells that fill in the gap, helping the tissue repair itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important that mitosis produces genetically identical cells?",
        "options": [
          "To maintain consistent tissue function and genetic stability",
          "To promote phenotypic diversity within specialized tissues",
          "To prepare somatic cells for eventual sexual reproduction",
          "To facilitate the transition of stem cells into gametes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For growth and repair, we need exact copies - skin cells should make more skin cells with the same DNA, not different types. This maintains tissue integrity and function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which process allows a starfish to regrow a lost arm?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis",
          "Meiosis",
          "Fertilization",
          "Differentiation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Regeneration involves cells near the injury undergoing mitosis to produce new cells that rebuild the missing structure. This is a dramatic example of repair through mitosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do single-celled organisms use mitosis?",
        "options": [
          "For asexual reproduction to create new individuals",
          "To increase cytoplasmic volume without cell division",
          "To generate haploid spores for sexual recombination",
          "To repair internal organelles after environmental stress"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In single-celled organisms like amoebas or paramecia, mitosis is a form of asexual reproduction - one cell divides to become two genetically identical individuals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to chromosome number during mitosis?",
        "options": [
          "It stays the same (diploid to diploid)",
          "It is halved (diploid to haploid)",
          "It doubles (haploid to diploid)",
          "It undergoes random reduction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis produces two daughter cells with the same chromosome number as the parent cell. If the parent is diploid (2n), both daughters are also diploid (2n)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do children's bones grow longer?",
        "options": [
          "Cells in growth plates undergo mitosis",
          "Osteocytes expand in size without dividing",
          "Germ line cells undergo meiosis in the marrow",
          "Calcium deposits replace cells through osmosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Growth plates at the ends of children's bones contain actively dividing cells (via mitosis). This cell division increases bone length during growth spurts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would happen if mitosis stopped working in an adult human?",
        "options": [
          "Wounds wouldn't heal and tissues couldn't renew",
          "The heart would immediately stop all contractions",
          "Cells would begin dividing via binary fission instead",
          "The individual would lose the ability to produce sperm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Many tissues constantly renew through mitosis: skin cells (replace every 2-4 weeks), intestinal lining (every 3-6 days), blood cells, etc. Without mitosis, these renewal processes would fail."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is mitosis involved in asexual reproduction in plants?",
        "options": [
          "Stem cuttings grow roots through mitosis",
          "Flowers facilitate pollination through mitosis",
          "Seed embryos are formed exclusively by mitosis",
          "Fruit ripening is triggered by mitotic hormones"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When you take a cutting from a plant and it grows roots, those new cells come from mitosis. This is vegetative propagation - a form of asexual reproduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is mitosis important for maintaining homeostasis in organisms?",
        "options": [
          "It replaces worn-out cells to keep tissues functioning properly",
          "It actively regulates the core body temperature of the organism",
          "It manages blood glucose levels by secreting insulin during division",
          "It preserves water balance by modifying the cell's osmotic potential"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homeostasis means maintaining stable internal conditions. By replacing damaged or dead cells, mitosis helps tissues and organs continue functioning properly, supporting overall bodily stability."
