    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the overall chemical equations of photosynthesis and cellular respiration compare?",
        "options": [
          "They represent inverse chemical pathways of each other",
          "They utilize completely different sets of carbon molecules",
          "They are identical reactions occurring in different tissues",
          "They both require a constant input of solar energy to proceed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light -> C6H12O6 + 6O2. Respiration: C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP. The products of one are the reactants of the other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main energy relationship between photosynthesis and respiration?",
        "options": [
          "Photosynthesis stores energy; respiration releases energy",
          "Both processes store potential energy within glucose bonds",
          "Both processes release kinetic energy for cellular movement",
          "Respiration stores energy; photosynthesis releases energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis captures light energy and stores it as chemical energy in glucose. Respiration releases that stored energy by breaking down glucose to make ATP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where do photosynthesis and cellular respiration occur in cells?",
        "options": [
          "Photosynthesis in chloroplasts; respiration in mitochondria",
          "Both metabolic processes are localized in the mitochondria",
          "Both metabolic processes are localized in the chloroplasts",
          "Photosynthesis in mitochondria; respiration in chloroplasts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each process has its specialized organelle: chloroplasts for photosynthesis (in plants/algae), mitochondria for respiration (in most eukaryotic cells)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are the electron transport chains similar in both processes?",
        "options": [
          "Both use electron transport to create proton gradients for ATP",
          "Both generate oxygen gas as a primary metabolic byproduct",
          "Both are located within the fluid stroma of the chloroplast",
          "Both directly synthesize glucose through the chain proteins"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both processes use electron transport chains to pump protons across membranes, creating gradients that drive ATP synthase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the oxygen produced by photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "Most is used by organisms for cellular respiration",
          "It remains trapped in leaf tissues to prevent oxidation",
          "It is converted into carbon dioxide by light reactions",
          "It is discarded as a toxic waste that plants cannot use"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthetic oxygen becomes atmospheric oxygen, which aerobic organisms (including the plants themselves) use for cellular respiration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do photosynthesis and respiration work together in plants?",
        "options": [
          "Plants use photosynthesis to make glucose and respiration to get energy from it",
          "Plants perform photosynthesis during the day and have no need for respiration",
          "Plants perform respiration only at night to conserve their glucose supplies",
          "Photosynthesis provides ATP for the cell without the need for respiration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plants do both: they build glucose via photosynthesis and break it down via respiration 24/7 to power cellular functions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between autotrophs and heterotrophs regarding these processes?",
        "options": [
          "Autotrophs do photosynthesis; heterotrophs depend on them for food/oxygen",
          "Autotrophs perform respiration; heterotrophs perform photosynthesis",
          "Both groups perform the exact same ratio of both metabolic processes",
          "Heterotrophs produce the organic glucose required by all autotrophs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Autotrophs (producers) create the organic matter and oxygen that heterotrophs (consumers) need to survive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do these processes participate in the carbon cycle?",
        "options": [
          "Photosynthesis removes CO2 from atmosphere; respiration adds CO2 back",
          "Both processes act as sinks that remove CO2 from the atmosphere",
          "Both processes act as sources that add CO2 to the atmosphere",
          "Photosynthesis adds CO2; respiration removes it from the air"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis fixes atmospheric carbon into organic form; respiration returns carbon to the atmosphere as CO2 gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would happen if photosynthesis suddenly stopped but respiration continued?",
        "options": [
          "O2 would decrease and CO2 would increase until respiration failed",
          "Atmospheric gas concentrations would remain stable due to plants",
          "Plants would simply switch to using respiration to create oxygen",
          "O2 levels would rise sharply due to the lack of photosynthetic use"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without photosynthesis to recycle CO2 into O2, aerobic respiration would eventually exhaust the oxygen supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are photosynthesis and respiration considered complementary processes?",
        "options": [
          "They complete cycles of matter and energy flow through ecosystems",
          "They are identical chemical reactions that utilize different enzymes",
          "They represent a competition for resources within a single plant cell",
          "One process is only for producers and the other is only for consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "They form a cycle where the waste products of one (CO2/H2O or O2/Glucose) are the essential requirements for the other."
