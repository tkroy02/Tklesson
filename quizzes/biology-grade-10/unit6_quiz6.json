        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Translation happens at ribosomes, which can be free in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
      },

          "DNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "tRNA (transfer RNA) brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome based on matching its anticodon to the mRNA codon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of mRNA in translation?",
        "options": [
          "It provides the code for amino acid sequence",
          "It carries amino acids to the ribosome",
          "It forms the structure of the ribosome",
          "It unwinds the DNA double helix"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "mRNA carries the genetic instructions from DNA to the ribosome, where its codon sequence determines the order of amino acids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does translation begin?",
        "options": [
          "Ribosome binds to mRNA at the start codon",
          "DNA unwinds to expose the gene",
          "tRNA releases its amino acid",
          "RNA polymerase makes an RNA copy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The small ribosomal subunit binds to mRNA, then finds the start codon (AUG). The first tRNA carrying methionine joins, followed by the large subunit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during elongation in translation?",
        "options": [
          "Amino acids are added to the growing chain",
          "The ribosome detaches from the mRNA",
          "mRNA is synthesized from DNA",
          "tRNA molecules are broken down"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During elongation, tRNAs bring amino acids, peptide bonds form between them, and the ribosome moves along mRNA one codon at a time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What signals the end of translation?",
        "options": [
          "A stop codon is reached",
          "The mRNA runs out of codons",
          "No more tRNAs are available",
          "The ribosome reaches the 5' end"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA), a release factor binds, and the polypeptide is released."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is formed when many ribosomes translate the same mRNA?",
        "options": [
          "A polysome",
          "A proteasome",
          "A nucleosome",
          "A chromatid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A polysome (or polyribosome) is multiple ribosomes translating one mRNA simultaneously, allowing efficient protein production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of bond forms between amino acids during translation?",
        "options": [
          "Peptide bond",
          "Hydrogen bond",
          "Ionic bond",
          "Disulfide bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Peptide bonds form between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next, creating the polypeptide backbone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After translation, where might a protein go next?",
        "options": [
          "To the rough ER for processing",
          "Back to the nucleus",
          "Into the mitochondria",
          "To the cell membrane immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Proteins destined for secretion or membranes enter the rough ER during translation. Others are released into the cytoplasm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What ensures the correct amino acid is added during translation?",
        "options": [
          "Codon-anticodon matching",
          "The size of the tRNA",
          "The order of DNA bases",
          "The pH of the cytoplasm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "tRNA has an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon, and each tRNA carries a specific amino acid, ensuring accuracy."
