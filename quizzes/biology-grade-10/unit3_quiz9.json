    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Glycolysis and Krebs Cycle",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which part of the cell does glycolysis take place?",
        "options": [
          "Cytoplasm (cytosol)",
          "Mitochondrial matrix",
          "Inner mitochondrial membrane",
          "Nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm. Because it does not require specialized organelles like mitochondria, it is a universal process found in almost all living cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the literal translation and primary action of 'glycolysis'?",
        "options": [
          "Sugar splitting",
          "Oxygen binding",
          "Energy storage",
          "Carbon fixing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Derived from the Greek 'glyco' (sugar) and 'lysis' (splitting), the process involves breaking one 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the net yield of products from one molecule of glucose at the end of glycolysis?",
        "options": [
          "2 pyruvate, 2 ATP (net), and 2 NADH",
          "1 pyruvate, 1 ATP, and 1 NADH",
          "2 acetyl-CoA, 4 ATP, and 2 FADH₂",
          "6 $$CO_2$$, 2 ATP, and 2 NADH"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glycolysis uses 2 ATP but produces 4, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATP. It also reduces two $$NAD^+$$ molecules to 2 NADH and produces 2 pyruvate molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement correctly describes the oxygen requirement of glycolysis?",
        "options": [
          "It is anaerobic and does not require oxygen to proceed",
          "It is aerobic and requires a constant supply of oxygen",
          "It requires oxygen only during the initial energy-investment phase",
          "It requires oxygen in animal cells but not in bacterial cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glycolysis is an anaerobic process. This allows cells to generate a small amount of energy even when oxygen levels are low or absent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where specifically within the mitochondria does the Krebs cycle occur?",
        "options": [
          "Mitochondrial matrix",
          "Intermembrane space",
          "Cristae (inner membrane folds)",
          "Outer mitochondrial membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Krebs cycle (or Citric Acid Cycle) takes place in the matrix, the innermost fluid-filled compartment containing the necessary enzymes for the cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which 2-carbon molecule enters the Krebs cycle to combine with oxaloacetate?",
        "options": [
          "Acetyl-CoA",
          "Pyruvate",
          "Glucose",
          "Lactic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Before the Krebs cycle begins, pyruvate is oxidized into Acetyl-CoA. This 2-carbon molecule then joins the 4-carbon oxaloacetate to form the 6-carbon citrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the primary products generated by the Krebs cycle for every one Acetyl-CoA molecule?",
        "options": [
          "2 $$CO_2$$, 1 ATP, 3 NADH, and 1 FADH₂",
          "1 $$CO_2$$, 2 ATP, 1 NADH, and 3 FADH₂",
          "Oxygen, Water, and 32 ATP",
          "Glucose, ATP, and Pyruvate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For each turn of the cycle (per Acetyl-CoA), 2 carbon dioxide molecules are released as waste, while high-energy carriers (NADH and FADH₂) are produced for the next stage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the remaining carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule during the Krebs cycle?",
        "options": [
          "They are released as waste carbon dioxide ($$CO_2$$)",
          "They are recycled to rebuild new glucose molecules",
          "They are converted into high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP",
          "They are used to synthesize the oxygen required for breathing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Krebs cycle completes the breakdown of the original glucose. The carbons are fully oxidized and released as $$CO_2$$, which the organism then exhales."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are the processes of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle physically and chemically linked?",
        "options": [
          "Pyruvate from glycolysis is converted to Acetyl-CoA to enter the Krebs cycle",
          "Glycolysis produces the oxygen that the Krebs cycle uses as fuel",
          "The Krebs cycle produces the glucose required for glycolysis to begin",
          "ATP produced in the Krebs cycle is used to split sugar in glycolysis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'link reaction' converts pyruvate (the end of glycolysis) into Acetyl-CoA (the start of the Krebs cycle), allowing the energy extraction to continue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which stage is responsible for producing the highest quantity of electron carriers (NADH and FADH₂)?",
        "options": [
          "The Krebs cycle",
          "Glycolysis",
          "The Link reaction",
          "Fermentation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While glycolysis produces 2 NADH, the Krebs cycle (per glucose) produces 6 NADH and 2 FADH₂. These carriers are vital for the final Electron Transport Chain stage."
