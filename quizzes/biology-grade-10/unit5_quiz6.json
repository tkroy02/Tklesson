      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is heredity?",
        "options": [
          "The passing of traits from parents to offspring",
          "The process of cell division for somatic growth",
          "The production of haploid gametes through meiosis",
          "The study of how organisms interact within an ecosystem"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heredity is the biological process where traits (like eye color, height) are transmitted from parents to their children through genes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Who is known as the 'Father of Genetics'?",
        "options": [
          "Gregor Mendel",
          "Charles Darwin",
          "James Watson",
          "Louis Pasteur"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, conducted experiments with pea plants in the 1860s and established the basic principles of inheritance, though his work wasn't recognized until later."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a gene?",
        "options": [
          "A segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait",
          "A specialized cell that undergoes meiotic division",
          "A structural protein that determines phenotypic color",
          "A nomenclature used to describe an entire chromosome"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A gene is a specific sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for building proteins, which determine our traits. Humans have about 20,000-25,000 genes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are alleles?",
        "options": [
          "Different versions of the same gene",
          "Matching pairs of chromosomes in a diploid cell",
          "The specific proteins that constitute metabolic traits",
          "Functional types of gametes produced during meiosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alleles are different forms of the same gene. For example, the gene for eye color has alleles for blue, brown, green, etc. You inherit one allele from each parent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'dominant' mean in genetics?",
        "options": [
          "An allele that masks the expression of another allele",
          "The most frequent allele found within a population",
          "An allele that consistently causes genetic disorders",
          "The specific allele that is inherited from the father"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dominant allele is expressed (shows up) even if only one copy is present. For example, brown eye allele is dominant over blue - you only need one brown allele to have brown eyes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'recessive' mean in genetics?",
        "options": [
          "An allele that is only expressed when two copies are present",
          "An allele that is never expressed in any generation",
          "An allele that eventually disappears over several generations",
          "The deleterious allele that is filtered by natural selection"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A recessive allele is only expressed when an individual has two copies (one from each parent). If a dominant allele is present, the recessive trait is hidden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is Mendel's Law of Segregation?",
        "options": [
          "Allele pairs separate during gamete formation",
          "Genes on different chromosomes sort independently",
          "Dominant alleles always mask recessive counterparts",
          "Phenotypic traits blend together in all offspring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During meiosis, the two alleles for each gene separate (segregate) so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. This explains why offspring get one allele from each parent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why were Mendel's pea plants good for studying heredity?",
        "options": [
          "They had clearly different traits, were easy to grow, and could self-pollinate",
          "They possessed the same total number of chromosomes as human cells",
          "They reproduced very slowly to allow for more detailed observation",
          "They consistently demonstrated a blending pattern of inheritance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pea plants have distinct traits (seed shape, color, flower color), produce many offspring, grow quickly, and Mendel could control pollination. This made patterns of inheritance clear."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between homozygous and heterozygous?",
        "options": [
          "Homozygous: two same alleles; Heterozygous: two different alleles",
          "Homozygous: two different alleles; Heterozygous: two same alleles",
          "Homozygous: dominant alleles only; Heterozygous: recessive alleles only",
          "Homozygous: haploid cells; Heterozygous: diploid cell pairs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homozygous means having two identical alleles for a gene (BB or bb). Heterozygous means having two different alleles (Bb)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do meiosis and fertilization explain inheritance patterns?",
        "options": [
          "Meiosis produces haploid gametes with one allele each; fertilization combines them",
          "Meiosis creates identical daughter cells; fertilization introduces variation",
          "Meiosis occurs immediately after fertilization in the eukaryotic cycle",
          "Fertilization triggers the production of gametes through meiosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During meiosis, diploid cells produce haploid gametes, each with one allele per gene. When sperm and egg fuse during fertilization, they create a diploid zygote with two alleles for each gene - one from each parent."
