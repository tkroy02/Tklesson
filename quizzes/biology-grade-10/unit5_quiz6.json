    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is heredity?",
        "options": [
          "The passing of traits from parents to offspring",
          "The process of cell division for growth",
          "The production of gametes through meiosis",
          "The study of how organisms interact"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heredity is the biological process where traits (like eye color, height) are transmitted from parents to their children through genes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Who is known as the 'Father of Genetics'?",
        "options": [
          "Gregor Mendel",
          "Charles Darwin",
          "James Watson",
          "Louis Pasteur"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, conducted experiments with pea plants in the 1860s and established the basic principles of inheritance, though his work wasn't recognized until later."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a gene?",
        "options": [
          "A segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait",
          "A type of cell that undergoes meiosis",
          "A protein that determines eye color",
          "Another name for a chromosome"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A gene is a specific sequence of DNA that contains the instructions for building proteins, which determine our traits. Humans have about 20,000-25,000 genes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are alleles?",
        "options": [
          "Different versions of the same gene",
          "Pairs of chromosomes in a cell",
          "The proteins that make up our traits",
          "Types of gametes produced by meiosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alleles are different forms of the same gene. For example, the gene for eye color has alleles for blue, brown, green, etc. You inherit one allele from each parent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'dominant' mean in genetics?",
        "options": [
          "An allele that masks the expression of another allele",
          "The most common allele in a population",
          "An allele that causes genetic disorders",
          "The allele that comes from the father"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dominant allele is expressed (shows up) even if only one copy is present. For example, brown eye allele is dominant over blue - you only need one brown allele to have brown eyes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'recessive' mean in genetics?",
        "options": [
          "An allele that is only expressed when two copies are present",
          "An allele that is never expressed",
          "An allele that disappears over generations",
          "The weaker allele that should be eliminated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A recessive allele is only expressed when an individual has two copies (one from each parent). If a dominant allele is present, the recessive trait is hidden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is Mendel's Law of Segregation?",
        "options": [
          "Allele pairs separate during gamete formation",
          "Genes on different chromosomes sort independently",
          "Dominant alleles always mask recessive ones",
          "Traits blend together in offspring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During meiosis, the two alleles for each gene separate (segregate) so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. This explains why offspring get one allele from each parent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why were Mendel's pea plants good for studying heredity?",
        "options": [
          "They had clearly different traits, were easy to grow, and could self-pollinate",
          "They had the same number of chromosomes as humans",
          "They reproduced very slowly",
          "They showed blending inheritance clearly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pea plants have distinct traits (seed shape, color, flower color), produce many offspring, grow quickly, and Mendel could control pollination. This made patterns of inheritance clear."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between homozygous and heterozygous?",
        "options": [
          "Homozygous: two same alleles; Heterozygous: two different alleles",
          "Homozygous: two different alleles; Heterozygous: two same alleles",
          "Homozygous: dominant alleles only; Heterozygous: recessive alleles only",
          "They mean exactly the same thing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homozygous means having two identical alleles for a gene (BB or bb). Heterozygous means having two different alleles (Bb)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do meiosis and fertilization explain inheritance patterns?",
        "options": [
          "Meiosis produces haploid gametes with one allele each; fertilization combines them",
          "Meiosis creates identical cells; fertilization adds variation",
          "Meiosis occurs after fertilization in the life cycle",
          "Fertilization produces gametes through meiosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During meiosis, diploid cells produce haploid gametes, each with one allele per gene. When sperm and egg fuse during fertilization, they create a diploid zygote with two alleles for each gene - one from each parent."
