    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "X and Y Chromosome Inheritance",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are sex-linked traits?",
        "options": [
          "Traits controlled by genes on sex chromosomes (X or Y)",
          "Traits that are expressed exclusively in a single gender",
          "Traits that are only relevant to the reproductive system",
          "Traits that periodically skip generations due to mutation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sex-linked traits are determined by genes located on the sex chromosomes (X or Y). Most sex-linked traits are X-linked because the X chromosome has many genes, while the Y chromosome has few."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are males more likely to express X-linked recessive disorders?",
        "options": [
          "Males have only one X chromosome, so one recessive allele shows the trait",
          "Males possess inherently weaker alleles on their single X chromosome",
          "Females have biological protections against recessive genetic mutations",
          "These specific disorders only target male physiological structures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Males are XY - they have only one X chromosome. If that X carries a recessive allele, there's no second X to provide a dominant allele to mask it. Females (XX) need two copies to show the trait."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A woman who is a carrier for an X-linked recessive disorder has what genotype?",
        "options": [
          "She has one normal allele and one disorder allele (heterozygous)",
          "She has two identical recessive disorder alleles (homozygous)",
          "She has two identical normal dominant alleles (homozygous)",
          "She lacks a second X chromosome and functions like a male"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A carrier female has one normal dominant allele and one recessive disorder allele on her X chromosomes (XᴺXᴰ). She doesn't show the disorder but can pass it to offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pattern shows a sex-linked recessive trait in a pedigree?",
        "options": [
          "More males affected, often skips generations",
          "Only females affected, passes directly to all male offspring",
          "Statistically equal numbers of males and females affected",
          "Only males pass the phenotype directly to their daughters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "X-linked recessive traits appear more in males, can skip generations when passed through carrier females, and are never passed from father to son (fathers give Y to sons)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A man with an X-linked recessive disorder marries a woman who is not a carrier. What is true about their children?",
        "options": [
          "All daughters will be carriers, all sons will be normal",
          "All children will express the phenotypic disorder",
          "All daughters will express the disorder, all sons will be carriers",
          "All children will be genetically and phenotypically normal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Affected father (XᴰY) gives Xᴰ to all daughters, normal mother (XᴺXᴺ) gives Xᴺ to all children. Daughters: XᴺXᴰ (carriers). Sons: XᴺY (normal, get Y from father)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the chance that a carrier mother and normal father will have a son with an X-linked recessive disorder?",
        "options": [
          "25% (or 50% of sons)",
          "50% (or 100% of sons)",
          "0% (sons cannot inherit X-linked traits from the mother)",
          "75% (the statistical majority of male offspring)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carrier mother (XᴺXᴰ) × Normal father (XᴺY). Each son has 50% chance of getting Xᴰ from mother (affected) vs Xᴺ (normal). Overall among all children: 25% chance of affected son."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is an example of an X-linked recessive disorder in humans?",
        "options": [
          "Color blindness",
          "Down syndrome",
          "Huntington's disease",
          "Cystic fibrosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Red-green color blindness is X-linked recessive. About 8% of males have it, but only 0.5% of females (need two copies). Other examples: hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can a father pass an X-linked trait to his son?",
        "options": [
          "No, fathers pass Y chromosomes to sons",
          "Yes, all paternal traits are inherited by male offspring",
          "Only if the specific trait is expressed as dominant",
          "Only if the maternal parent is also a carrier for the trait"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fathers give Y chromosomes to sons (to make them male), and X chromosomes to daughters. So X-linked traits cannot pass from father to son, only to daughters."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'carrier' in genetics?",
        "options": [
          "Someone who has one copy of a recessive allele but doesn't show the trait",
          "Someone who has the disease and can spread it through the population",
          "Someone who is genetically immune to a specific metabolic disorder",
          "Someone who possesses two identical dominant alleles for a single trait"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A carrier has one recessive allele for a disorder but doesn't show symptoms because they have a dominant normal allele. They can pass the recessive allele to offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does understanding sex-linked inheritance help in genetic counseling?",
        "options": [
          "It helps predict risks for sons vs daughters and identify carriers",
          "It guarantees that all inherited genetic disorders can be cured",
          "It proves that only male patients should be tested for genetic risk",
          "It demonstrates that all recessive genetic disorders are preventable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Understanding sex-linked patterns helps counselors: calculate different risks for male vs female children, identify female carriers in families, and provide accurate family planning advice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a woman has an X-linked recessive disorder, what must be true about her parents?",
        "options": [
          "Her father must have the disorder and her mother must be at least a carrier",
          "Both parents must be phenotypically normal to pass the trait",
          "Only her mother needs to express the phenotypic disorder",
          "Her parents' genotypes have no statistical impact on the outcome"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a female to have an X-linked recessive disorder (XᴰXᴰ), she must get Xᴰ from both parents. So: father must be affected (XᴰY), and mother must be at least a carrier (XᴺXᴰ or XᴰXᴰ)."
