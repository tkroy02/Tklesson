    "subtitle": "7.7 Speciation",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "New Species Formation",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is speciation?",
        "options": [
          "The formation of new species",
          "The extinction of a species",
          "Migration within a species",
          "Adaptation without divergence"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species that can no longer interbreed successfully."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is reproductive isolation?",
        "options": [
          "Barriers that prevent interbreeding",
          "Geographic separation only",
          "Different mating seasons only",
          "Physical inability to mate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reproductive isolation includes any biological difference—pre-zygotic or post-zygotic—that prevents members of different species from producing fertile offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What must happen for speciation to occur?",
        "options": [
          "Gene flow between populations must stop",
          "All individuals must become identical",
          "Environments must remain constant",
          "Mutation rates must decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Speciation requires that populations become reproductively isolated so they evolve independently, accumulating genetic differences until they can no longer interbreed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a pre-zygotic barrier?",
        "options": [
          "It prevents mating or fertilization",
          "It acts after hybrid formation",
          "It only affects chromosome number",
          "It is always geographic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pre-zygotic barriers include habitat, temporal, behavioral, mechanical, or gametic isolation that prevent fertilization from occurring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a post-zygotic barrier?",
        "options": [
          "It reduces hybrid viability or fertility",
          "It prevents mating entirely",
          "It causes immediate death",
          "It only occurs in plants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Post-zygotic barriers occur after fertilization: hybrid inviability (dies early), hybrid sterility (can't reproduce), or hybrid breakdown (later generations weak)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the biological species concept?",
        "options": [
          "Species are groups that can interbreed",
          "Species are defined by appearance only",
          "Species are based on DNA similarity",
          "Species are ecological roles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The biological species concept defines species as groups of actually or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't mules be considered a species?",
        "options": [
          "They are sterile hybrids",
          "They look different from parents",
          "They have unique behaviors",
          "They live in different habitats"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mules (horse × donkey hybrids) are sterile and cannot produce offspring, so they don't form an interbreeding population—a key requirement for species under the biological concept."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does genetic divergence lead to speciation?",
        "options": [
          "Accumulated differences prevent interbreeding",
          "All genes become identical",
          "Populations suddenly merge",
          "Mutations stop occurring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When isolated populations accumulate different mutations and experience different selection pressures, their genes diverge until compatibility is lost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is adaptive radiation?",
        "options": [
          "Rapid speciation into diverse forms",
          "Slow merging of similar species",
          "Extinction of many species",
          "Migration without speciation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adaptive radiation occurs when a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many new species filling different ecological niches (e.g., Darwin's finches, Hawaiian honeycreepers)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can speciation occur without geographic separation?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, through sympatric speciation",
          "No, always requires physical separation",
          "Only in laboratory conditions",
          "Only for bacteria and viruses"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sympatric speciation can occur within the same geographic area through mechanisms like polyploidy (plants), habitat specialization, or sexual selection."
