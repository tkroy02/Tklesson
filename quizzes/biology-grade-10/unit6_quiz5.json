    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Codon-Amino Acid Relationships",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many nucleotides make up one codon?",
        "options": [
          "Three",
          "Two",
          "Four",
          "One"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A codon is a three-nucleotide sequence on mRNA that specifies one amino acid. This triplet system allows 64 possible combinations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which codon signals the start of protein synthesis?",
        "options": [
          "AUG",
          "UAA",
          "UAG",
          "UGA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "AUG codes for methionine and serves as the start codon in almost all organisms. It marks where translation begins."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does it mean that the genetic code is redundant?",
        "options": [
          "Multiple codons can specify the same amino acid",
          "One codon specifies and can specify many amino acids",
          "Codons overlap each other",
          "Some codons have no function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Redundancy means most amino acids are specified by more than one codon. For example, leucine has six different codons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about stop codons is correct?",
        "options": [
          "They signal the end of translation",
          "They code for special amino acids",
          "They are read but not used",
          "They restart the reading frame"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) signal the ribosome to release the polypeptide chain. They do not code for any amino acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The genetic code is nearly universal. What does this mean?",
        "options": [
          "Most organisms use the same codon assignments",
          "All codons work the same in every cell",
          "Mutations never change codon meaning",
          "Every species has identical genes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With minor exceptions, the same codons specify the same amino acids across nearly all life forms, suggesting a common evolutionary origin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which best describes how codons are read?",
        "options": [
          "Without gaps, from a fixed start point",
          "With spaces between each triplet",
          "Backwards from the stop codon",
          "Randomly along the mRNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reading frame is set by the start codon, and ribosomes read mRNA continuously in non-overlapping triplets until a stop codon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a codon sequence is GCA, what will it likely code for?",
        "options": [
          "Alanine",
          "Glycine",
          "Arginine",
          "Serine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the genetic code: GCA, GCC, GCG, and GCU all code for alanine. GCA is one of them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would happen if a codon mutates from UUU to UUC?",
        "options": [
          "No change in the amino acid",
          "A different amino acid is inserted",
          "Translation stops early",
          "The reading frame shifts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both UUU and UUC code for phenylalanine. This is a silent mutation—the DNA changes but the protein does not."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the ribosome identify the correct tRNA?",
        "options": [
          "By matching codon and anticodon",
          "By reading the amino acid directly",
          "By tRNA size and shape",
          "By chemical tags on the tRNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ribosome ensures correct pairing between mRNA codon and tRNA anticodon. This ensures the right amino acid is added."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the genetic code described as unambiguous?",
        "options": [
          "Each codon specifies only one amino acid",
          "It never makes mistakes during translation",
          "It cannot be changed by mutations",
          "All organisms use it perfectly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unambiguous means a given codon always codes for the same amino acid. This consistency is essential for accurate protein synthesis."
