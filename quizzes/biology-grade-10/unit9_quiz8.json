    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Population Control Factors",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a limiting factor in ecology?",
        "options": [
          "An environmental factor that restricts population growth",
          "A biological factor that always increases population size",
          "A specific condition related only to food availability",
          "A factor that affects individual health but not groups"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Limiting factors are conditions that constrain population growth, determining carrying capacity by restricting resources or increasing mortality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between density-dependent and density-independent factors?",
        "options": [
          "Density-dependent: effect increases with population density; Density-independent: effect unrelated to density",
          "Density-dependent: always abiotic factors; Density-independent: always biotic factors",
          "Density-dependent: increases growth; Density-independent: decreases growth",
          "They are identical concepts used interchangeably in research"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density-dependent factors (competition, disease, predation) intensify as population grows. Density-independent factors (weather, natural disasters) affect populations regardless of size."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is an example of a density-dependent limiting factor?",
        "options": [
          "The rapid spread of an infectious respiratory disease",
          "A severe hurricane destroying a coastal nesting habitat",
          "A massive volcanic eruption covering a forest in ash",
          "A long-term drought reducing regional water availability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diseases spread more easily in dense populations where individuals are in close contact, making their impact density-dependent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is an example of a density-independent limiting factor?",
        "options": [
          "A forest fire that kills organisms across a large area",
          "Intense competition between individuals for nesting sites",
          "Increased predation as the prey population size grows",
          "A parasite infestation that weakens a herd of animals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Forest fires kill organisms regardless of population density - they're abiotic events affecting all individuals in the area similarly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the competitive exclusion principle?",
        "options": [
          "Two species cannot occupy the same niche indefinitely",
          "All species in a community eventually go extinct over time",
          "Competition only occurs between different animal species",
          "Resources are always equally distributed among competitors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "G.F. Gause's principle states that complete competitors cannot coexist; one will be more efficient and eventually exclude the other from the niche."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is resource partitioning?",
        "options": [
          "Species divide limited resources to reduce competition",
          "One dominant species takes all resources from another",
          "Resources are distributed randomly among various species",
          "The environment provides unlimited resources for all life"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To avoid competitive exclusion, species may evolve to use different parts of a resource (different food types, feeding times, or habitat areas)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a keystone species?",
        "options": [
          "A species with a disproportionate effect on its ecosystem",
          "The most abundant species found within a given community",
          "Any species that acts as a top predator in the food chain",
          "A species that has recently gone extinct in its habitat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Keystone species (like sea otters or wolves) have effects far greater than their abundance would suggest - their removal dramatically alters ecosystem structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does predation act as a limiting factor?",
        "options": [
          "Reduces prey population and affects behavior/distribution",
          "Always drives the prey species to total local extinction",
          "Has no measurable effect on prey population dynamics",
          "Only affects the weakest individuals within the population"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Predation controls prey numbers directly and influences prey behavior (hiding, vigilance), distribution, and evolution through natural selection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of abiotic factors as limiting factors?",
        "options": [
          "Non-living factors determine where species can survive",
          "They only affect individuals but not whole populations",
          "They are always less important than biological factors",
          "They only limit plant populations and never animal ones"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Abiotic factors create fundamental niches - the range of conditions where a species could potentially survive. Actual distribution is further limited by biotic factors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between a fundamental and realized niche?",
        "options": [
          "Fundamental: where species could live; Realized: where it actually lives",
          "Fundamental: the current habitat; Realized: the potential habitat",
          "There is no difference between these biological concepts",
          "Fundamental: microscopic niche; Realized: macroscopic niche"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The fundamental niche is the full range of conditions a species can tolerate. The realized niche is smaller - where it actually exists after competitive exclusion."
