      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main difference in purpose between mitosis and meiosis?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis: growth/repair; Meiosis: gamete production",
          "Mitosis: genetic diversity; Meiosis: somatic growth",
          "Both processes are specialized for tissue regeneration",
          "Both processes are specialized for sexual reproduction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis produces identical cells for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. Meiosis produces genetically variable gametes for sexual reproduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the daughter cells compare genetically in mitosis vs meiosis?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis: identical; Meiosis: genetically different",
          "Mitosis: genetically different; Meiosis: identical",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid cells. Meiosis produces four genetically different haploid gametes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many divisions occur in each process?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis: one division; Meiosis: two divisions",
          "Mitosis: two divisions; Meiosis: one division",
          "Both involve a single division of the cell nucleus",
          "Both involve two consecutive rounds of cell division"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis involves one division of the nucleus. Meiosis involves two consecutive divisions (Meiosis I and Meiosis II)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to chromosome number in each process?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis: stays same; Meiosis: is halved",
          "Mitosis: is halved; Meiosis: stays same",
          "Both processes preserve the original diploid count",
          "Both processes reduce the starting diploid count"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis maintains chromosome number (diploid -> diploid). Meiosis reduces chromosome number by half (diploid -> haploid)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does crossing over occur?",
        "options": [
          "Only in meiosis (Prophase I)",
          "Only in mitosis (Prophase)",
          "In both mitosis and meiosis",
          "Neither process involves crossing over"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crossing over (genetic recombination) occurs only during Prophase I of meiosis. This creates new gene combinations and increases genetic variation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many daughter cells are produced?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis: 2; Meiosis: 4",
          "Mitosis: 4; Meiosis: 2",
          "Both produce 2 daughter cells",
          "Both produce 4 daughter cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis produces 2 diploid daughter cells. Meiosis produces 4 haploid gametes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which cells do these processes occur?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis: somatic cells; Meiosis: germ cells",
          "Mitosis: germ cells; Meiosis: somatic cells",
          "Both occur exclusively within the somatic tissues",
          "Both occur exclusively within the reproductive organs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis occurs in somatic (body) cells throughout the organism. Meiosis occurs only in germ cells (in gonads) to produce gametes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which process creates genetic variation?",
        "options": [
          "Meiosis creates variation; mitosis does not",
          "Mitosis creates variation; meiosis does not",
          "Both create significant genetic variation",
          "Neither creates any form of genetic variation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Meiosis creates genetic variation through crossing over and independent assortment. Mitosis produces identical copies, maintaining genetic consistency in tissues."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the starting and ending cells compare?",
        "options": [
          "Mitosis: diploid -> diploid; Meiosis: diploid -> haploid",
          "Mitosis: haploid -> diploid; Meiosis: diploid -> diploid",
          "Both pathways result in diploid daughter cell pairs",
          "Both pathways result in haploid daughter cell sets"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mitosis begins and ends with diploid cells. Meiosis begins with a diploid cell and produces haploid gametes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important that meiosis reduces chromosome number?",
        "options": [
          "So fertilization can restore the diploid number",
          "To allow the daughter cells to divide more quickly",
          "To ensure all chromosomes are identical in size",
          "To prevent the cell from becoming too large to function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If gametes were diploid, fertilization would produce tetraploid (4n) zygotes. Halving in meiosis ensures fertilization restores the normal diploid (2n) number."
