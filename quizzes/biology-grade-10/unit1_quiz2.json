        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the process of hydrolysis, what is the role of the water molecule?",
        "options": [
          "It is added to break the covalent bond between monomers",
          "It is removed to allow a stable covalent bond to form",

          "It prevents the chemical reaction from ever occurring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrolysis literally means 'water-splitting.' A water molecule is consumed to break the covalent bond and restore the functional groups of the separate monomers."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amino acids are the building blocks that link via peptide bonds to form polypeptide chains, which fold into proteins."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the structural analogy of a 'pearl necklace,' what do the individual pearls represent?",

          "Water molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The individual pearls are the repeating units (monomers), while the entire finished necklace is the polymer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the potential energy when a polymer is broken down into monomers in a living cell?",
        "options": [
          "Chemical energy is typically released",
          "Energy is created from an empty void",
          "The cell requires a massive heat input",
          "No measurable energy change occurs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Breaking chemical bonds in complex molecules (catabolism) generally releases energy that the cell can then utilize."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which functional groups are most commonly involved in the dehydration synthesis of carbohydrate polymers?",
        "options": [
          "Hydroxyl groups ($-OH$)",
          "Methyl groups ($-CH_3$)",
          "Phosphate groups ($-PO_4$)",
          "Carboxyl groups ($-COOH$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monosaccharides contain multiple hydroxyl groups; these interact during dehydration synthesis to form glycosidic linkages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a polymer consists of 10 monomers linked in a linear chain, how many water molecules were removed during its synthesis?",
        "options": [
          "9 molecules",
          "10 molecules",
          "11 molecules",
          "5 molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "One water molecule is removed for every bond formed. In a linear chain of $n$ monomers, there are $n-1$ bonds. Therefore, 10 monomers require 9 bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the ability to form polymers essential for living organisms?",
        "options": [
          "It facilitates the construction of complex structures from universal building blocks",
          "It represents the only biological mechanism capable of storing simple carbon atoms",
          "It ensures that complex molecules dissolve much faster in water than small monomers",
          "It prevents all essential chemical reactions from ever reaching thermal equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Life uses a limited 'alphabet' of monomers to build a nearly infinite variety of polymers with specific structural and catalytic functions."
