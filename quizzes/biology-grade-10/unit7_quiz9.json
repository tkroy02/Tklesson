    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is divergent evolution?",
        "options": [
          "Related species become different",
          "Unrelated species become similar",
          "Species remain unchanged",
          "Evolution reverses direction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divergent evolution occurs when closely related species evolve different traits, often due to adapting to different environments (e.g., Darwin's finches, mammal limb diversity)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What causes convergent evolution?",
        "options": [
          "Similar adaptations to similar environments",
          "Shared ancestry with recent divergence",
          "Identical genetic mutations",
          "Geographic isolation only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convergent evolution produces similar traits in unrelated species facing similar environmental challenges (e.g., wings in birds/bats/insects, streamlined shapes in sharks/dolphins/ichthyosaurs)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are analogous structures evidence of?",
        "options": [
          "Convergent evolution",
          "Divergent evolution",
          "Genetic drift",
          "Horizontal gene transfer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Analogous structures (similar function, different origin) result from convergent evolution, not common ancestry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What pattern shows common ancestry?",
        "options": [
          "Homologous structures",
          "Analogous structures",
          "Identical behaviors",
          "Similar coloration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homologous structures (similar anatomy, different function) indicate divergent evolution from a common ancestor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is coevolution?",
        "options": [
          "Two species evolving in response to each other",
          "One species evolving alone",
          "Evolution stopping completely",
          "All species evolving at same rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Coevolution involves reciprocal adaptations between interacting species (predator-prey, plant-pollinator, host-parasite), like flowers and their pollinators."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is adaptive radiation?",
        "options": [
          "Rapid diversification from one ancestor",
          "Slow merging of multiple species",
          "Evolution in one direction only",
          "Loss of all variation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adaptive radiation is a pattern of divergent evolution where a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many species filling different niches."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which shows convergent evolution?",
        "options": [
          "Cacti and euphorbias in deserts",
          "Foxes and wolves in forests",
          "Finches on different islands",
          "Humans and chimpanzees"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cacti (Americas) and euphorbias (Africa) independently evolved similar succulent, spiny forms to survive in similar desert environments—classic convergence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does extinction relate to evolution patterns?",
        "options": [
          "It creates opportunities for diversification",
          "It stops all evolutionary change",
          "It only affects convergent evolution",
          "It reverses divergent evolution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass extinctions eliminate many species, emptying ecological niches and allowing survivors to diversify through adaptive radiation (e.g., mammals after dinosaur extinction)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is parallel evolution?",
        "options": [
          "Related species evolve similar traits independently",
          "Unrelated species become identical",
          "Evolution occurs at the same rate everywhere",
          "All traits evolve simultaneously"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel evolution involves related species independently developing similar adaptations (e.g., gliding membranes in flying squirrels and sugar gliders—both marsupials and placentals)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What evolutionary pattern explains why sharks and dolphins look similar?",
        "options": [
          "Convergent evolution",
          "Divergent evolution",
          "Parallel evolution",
          "Genetic drift"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sharks (fish) and dolphins (mammals) independently evolved streamlined bodies, fins, and coloration for efficient swimming in similar marine environments—convergent evolution."
