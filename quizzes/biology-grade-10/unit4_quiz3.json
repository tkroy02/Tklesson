    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "$$6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \\text{light} \\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$",
          "$$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \\rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \\text{ATP}$$",
          "$$6O_2 + C_6H_{12}O_6 \\rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O$$",
          "$$6H_2O + \\text{light} \\rightarrow 6O_2 + 6H_2$$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis is the process of using solar energy to transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. It is essentially the chemical opposite of aerobic cellular respiration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the reactants (inputs) required for photosynthesis to occur.",
        "options": [
          "Carbon dioxide, water, and light energy",
          "Glucose and oxygen",
          "Oxygen, ATP, and water",
          "Glucose, light, and chlorophyll"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For photosynthesis to proceed, a plant must have access to carbon dioxide (absorbed via stomata), water (absorbed via roots), and light energy (captured by chlorophyll)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the primary products (outputs) resulting from photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "Glucose and oxygen",
          "Carbon dioxide and water",
          "ATP, NADPH, and water",
          "Light energy and water vapor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The plant produces glucose ($$C_6H_{12}O_6$$) to store energy for growth and repair, while oxygen ($$O_2$$) is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the chemical equation for photosynthesis relate to the equation for cellular respiration?",
        "options": [
          "The products of one are the reactants of the other",
          "They are identical processes that occur in different organelles",
          "Photosynthesis is a breakdown process, while respiration is a building process",
          "They are unrelated because respiration does not involve light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These two processes form a biological cycle. The oxygen and glucose produced by photosynthesis are used by mitochondria for respiration, which in turn produces the $$CO_2$$ and water needed for photosynthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From which reactant molecule is the oxygen gas ($$O_2$$) byproduct derived?",
        "options": [
          "Water ($$H_2O$$)",
          "Carbon dioxide ($$CO_2$$)",
          "Glucose ($$C_6H_{12}O_6$$)",
          "Chlorophyll"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During the light-dependent reactions, water molecules are split apart in a process called photolysis. The oxygen atoms from the water are then released as $$O_2$$ gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the ultimate fate of the carbon atoms found in the reactant carbon dioxide ($$CO_2$$)?",
        "options": [
          "They are fixed into organic glucose molecules",
          "They are released into the atmosphere as waste",
          "They are converted into oxygen atoms within the chloroplast",
          "They are used to build the ATP molecules in the thylakoid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon fixation occurs when the carbon from inorganic $$CO_2$$ is incorporated into an organic framework, eventually forming the high-energy sugar glucose."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a written chemical equation, why is 'light energy' usually placed above the yields arrow?",
        "options": [
          "It is a required energy source but not a chemical substance (matter)",
          "It is a byproduct that is released into the environment",
          "It is a catalyst that is used up and destroyed during the reaction",
          "It represents the total mass of the glucose being produced"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Light is energy, not matter. It is necessary to power the reaction, but because it doesn't have mass or atoms, it isn't listed as a chemical reactant like water or carbon dioxide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the balanced equation, how many molecules of carbon dioxide are needed to produce one molecule of glucose?",
        "options": [
          "6",
          "1",
          "12",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The balanced equation ($$6CO_2 + 6H_2O \\rightarrow 1C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$) shows a 6:1 ratio between carbon dioxide consumed and glucose produced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule in the photosynthesis equation represents the long-term storage of chemical energy?",
        "options": [

          "Oxygen ($$O_2$$)",
          "Water ($$H_2O$$)",
          "Carbon Dioxide ($$CO_2$$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glucose stores energy in its chemical bonds. Plants can convert this glucose into starch for long-term storage or use it to power cellular activities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the photosynthesis equation demonstrate the Law of Conservation of Mass?",
        "options": [
          "The number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow",
          "Energy from the sun is converted into new matter (carbon atoms)",
          "The mass of the oxygen released is greater than the mass of the water used",
          "The plant gains mass by absorbing energy from the chlorophyll"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In any chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed. The atoms from the $$CO_2$$ and $$H_2O$$ are simply rearranged to form glucose and oxygen."
