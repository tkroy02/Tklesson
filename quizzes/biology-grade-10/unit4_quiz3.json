    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct overall equation for photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂",
          "C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP",
          "6O₂ + C₆H₁₂O₆ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O",
          "6H₂O + light → 6O₂ + 6H₂"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water, with light energy, to produce glucose and oxygen. This is essentially the reverse of cellular respiration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the reactants (inputs) of photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "Carbon dioxide, water, and light energy",
          "Glucose and oxygen",
          "Oxygen and ATP",
          "Water and light only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis requires three inputs: carbon dioxide (from air), water (from soil), and light energy (from sun). All three are necessary for the process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the products (outputs) of photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "Glucose and oxygen",
          "Carbon dioxide and water",
          "ATP and NADPH",
          "Water and light energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The main products are glucose (sugar for energy storage) and oxygen (released into the atmosphere). The glucose can be used immediately or stored as starch."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the photosynthesis equation compare to the cellular respiration equation?",
        "options": [
          "They are exact opposites",
          "They are exactly the same",
          "Photosynthesis produces more ATP",
          "Respiration requires light energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. Respiration: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP. The molecules are the same but the arrow direction is reversed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where do the oxygen atoms in the O₂ product come from?",
        "options": [
          "From the water molecules (H₂O)",
          "From the carbon dioxide molecules (CO₂)",
          "From the glucose molecules",
          "From the chlorophyll pigment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The oxygen gas (O₂) released during photosynthesis comes from water molecules that are split. This process is called photolysis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the carbon atoms during photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "They become part of glucose molecules",
          "They are released as oxygen gas",
          "They combine with hydrogen to make water",
          "They provide energy for the reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon atoms from CO₂ are incorporated into organic molecules, eventually forming glucose. This is called carbon fixation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is light energy written above the arrow in the equation?",
        "options": [
          "It is required for the reaction but isn't a physical reactant",
          "It becomes part of the glucose molecule",
          "It is produced along with glucose",
          "It is the main product of photosynthesis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Light energy is needed to drive the reaction but isn't consumed as a chemical substance. It's a form of energy input, not a material input like CO₂ or H₂O."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the number of molecules in the photosynthesis equation?",
        "options": [
          "6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O make 1 glucose + 6 O₂",
          "1 CO₂ + 1 H₂O make 1 glucose + 1 O₂",
          "12 CO₂ + 12 H₂O make 2 glucose + 12 O₂",
          "3 CO₂ + 3 H₂O make 1 glucose + 3 O₂"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The balanced equation shows that 6 carbon dioxide molecules and 6 water molecules produce 1 glucose molecule and 6 oxygen molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which part of the equation represents energy storage?",
        "options": [
          "The glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) stores chemical energy",
          "The oxygen (O₂) stores light energy",
          "The water (H₂O) stores solar energy",
          "The carbon dioxide (CO₂) contains stored energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glucose contains chemical energy in its bonds. This energy came originally from sunlight and is now stored for later use by the plant or by organisms that eat the plant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does photosynthesis demonstrate conservation of mass?",
        "options": [
          "Atoms are rearranged but not created or destroyed",
          "Energy is created from sunlight",
          "Oxygen atoms disappear during the reaction",
          "Extra carbon atoms are added from chlorophyll"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All atoms in the reactants (6C, 18O, 12H) are accounted for in the products (6C, 18O, 12H). They are just rearranged into different molecules."
