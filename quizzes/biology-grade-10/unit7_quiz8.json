    "subtitle": "7.8 Speciation Types",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Geographic vs Ecological Speciation",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is allopatric speciation?",
        "options": [
          "Speciation due to geographic separation",
          "Speciation without physical barriers",
          "Speciation through polyploidy",
          "Speciation in overlapping ranges"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Allopatric speciation occurs when a physical barrier (river, mountain, ocean) divides a population, leading to independent evolution and eventual reproductive isolation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is sympatric speciation?",
        "options": [
          "Speciation without geographic isolation",
          "Speciation across continents",
          "Speciation only in fossils",
          "Speciation that reverses quickly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sympatric speciation occurs within the same geographic area, often through mechanisms like polyploidy, habitat differentiation, or sexual selection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is an example of allopatric speciation?",
        "options": [
          "Squirrels on opposite sides of the Grand Canyon",
          "Apple maggot flies on different fruits",
          "Polyploid plants in one field",
          "Cichlid fish in the same lake"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kaibab and Abert squirrels live on opposite rims of the Grand Canyon—geographically separated populations that have diverged into different species."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can sympatric speciation occur in plants?",
        "options": [
          "Through polyploidy events",
          "Through continental drift",
          "Through mountain formation",
          "Through ocean barriers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polyploidy (extra chromosome sets) can instantly create reproductive isolation. Many crop plants (wheat, cotton) originated this way."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is peripatric speciation?",
        "options": [
          "Isolation of a small peripheral population",
          "Speciation across vast continents",
          "Speciation through hybridization",
          "Speciation that affects all members equally"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Peripatric speciation is a type of allopatric speciation where a small population at the edge of the range becomes isolated and evolves rapidly (founder effect + genetic drift)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is parapatric speciation?",
        "options": [
          "Speciation across adjacent habitats",
          "Speciation through random mating",
          "Speciation that takes millions of years",
          "Speciation only in laboratory settings"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parapatric speciation occurs when populations are mostly continuous but experience different selection pressures across an environmental gradient, leading to divergence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which speciation type is most common?",
        "options": [
          "Allopatric speciation",
          "Sympatric speciation",
          "Parapatric speciation",
          "Instant speciation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most speciation events likely involve some geographic separation (allopatric or peripatric), as physical barriers strongly reduce gene flow, allowing independent evolution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can ecological differences drive sympatric speciation?",
        "options": [
          "Different resources lead to specialization",
          "All individuals use the same resources",
          "Resources are unlimited and identical",
          "Specialization never affects mating"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If subpopulations specialize on different resources (e.g., insects on different host plants), they may evolve separately and eventually become reproductively isolated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What role does sexual selection play in speciation?",
        "options": [
          "It can create premating isolation",
          "It always prevents speciation",
          "It only matters after speciation",
          "It has no evolutionary importance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divergent mate preferences (color patterns, courtship rituals, songs) can create reproductive barriers even in sympatry, driving speciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is adaptive radiation often associated with?",
        "options": [
          "Rapid allopatric or sympatric speciation",
          "Slow evolutionary stasis",
          "Decreasing species numbers",
          "Loss of ecological diversity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adaptive radiation (e.g., Hawaiian honeycreepers, African cichlids) involves rapid speciation into diverse ecological niches, often through a combination of mechanisms."
