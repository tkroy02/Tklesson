        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first line consists of innate, non-specific barriers that prevent microorganisms from entering the body in the first place."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these serves as a primary physical barrier in the first line of defense?",
        "options": [
          "The skin",
          "Stomach acid (gastric juice)",
          "Plasma-derived antibodies",
          "Active phagocytic cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intact skin provides a continuous, waterproof physical barrier that most pathogens cannot penetrate when healthy and unbroken."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the specific role of mucous membranes in the body's defense strategy?",
        "options": [
          "To trap pathogens in sticky secretions and move them out of the body",
          "To synthesize specific antibodies against common environmental invaders",
          "To directly engulf and digest bacteria through cellular phagocytosis",
          "To trigger a localized inflammatory response to recruit immune cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mucus produced by mucous membranes traps microorganisms, and cilia or peristalsis move them out (coughing, sneezing, swallowing)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does stomach acid effectively act as a chemical barrier?",
        "options": [
          "Its highly acidic pH destroys most ingested pathogenic microorganisms",
          "It facilitates the production of antibodies against food-borne bacteria",
          "It acts as a chemical signal to attract white blood cells to the stomach",
          "It chemically neutralizes all toxic substances found in ingested food"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gastric juice has a pH of 1.5-3.5, which destroys most bacteria and viruses that enter through food and drink."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which protective enzyme is naturally found in human tears and saliva?",
        "options": [
          "Lysozyme",
          "Histamine",
          "Agglutinin",
          "Interferon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lysozyme is an enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls, providing chemical protection in body secretions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the skin's normal flora (resident bacteria) contribute to the first line of defense?",
        "options": [
          "It competes with foreign pathogens for physical space and vital nutrients",
          "It produces specialized antibodies that neutralize invading pathogens",
          "It actively hunts and kills all foreign bacteria entering the environment",
          "It triggers the nervous system to signal white blood cells to attack"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Commensal bacteria occupy niches and consume resources, making it difficult for pathogenic bacteria to establish infections."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What occurs physiologically when the first line of defense is successfully breached?",
        "options": [
          "The second line of defense (innate internal immunity) is activated",
          "The body immediately begins the rapid production of memory B cells",
          "The entire immune system undergoes a temporary shutdown",
          "The body relies exclusively on a fever response to handle the breach"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If pathogens get past physical/chemical barriers, non-specific internal defenses (phagocytes, inflammation, fever) become activated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a component of the first-line defense mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "The production of specific memory B cells",
          "The acidic pH levels found on the skin and in the stomach",
          "The production of mucus within the respiratory and digestive tracts",
          "The mechanical flushing action of tears, sweat, and urine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Memory B cells are part of the specific adaptive (third line) immunity, developing after exposure to a pathogen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are sebaceous (oil) glands critical for maintaining skin-based defense?",
        "options": [
          "They secrete lipids that inhibit the growth of many bacteria and fungi",
          "They secrete a layer of antibodies that coats the epidermal surface",
          "They actively recruit beneficial bacteria to the skin surface",
          "They are primarily responsible for the skin's role in thermoregulation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sebum creates an acidic environment (pH 3-5) on the skin surface that inhibits the growth of many pathogens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do cilia in the respiratory tract assist in protecting the lungs?",
        "options": [
          "They move in coordinated waves to sweep mucus and trapped particles upward",
          "They secrete antimicrobial chemicals directly into the alveolar sacs",
          "They function as cellular receptors that engulf inhaled viral particles",
          "They transmit electrical signals to the brain to initiate coughing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ciliated epithelial cells line the respiratory tract, constantly moving mucus toward the throat to be swallowed or expelled."
