    "topic": "CO₂ and Temperature Effects",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration typically affect photosynthesis rate?",
        "options": [
          "It increases photosynthesis rate up to a point, then levels off",
          "It causes a linear increase that continues indefinitely as CO₂ rises",
          "It triggers a sharp decline once CO₂ exceeds 400 parts per million",
          "It has no measurable effect because water is the only limiting factor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CO₂ is a raw material for photosynthesis. More CO₂ means more substrate for the Calvin cycle, so rate increases until another factor (like light or enzymes) becomes limiting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why might increasing CO₂ above normal atmospheric levels boost plant growth in greenhouses?",
        "options": [
          "CO₂ is often a limiting factor, so extra CO₂ allows faster photosynthesis",
          "CO₂ acts as a high-energy fuel that plants use instead of sunlight",
          "CO₂ prevents the loss of water vapor by sealing the stomata permanently",
          "CO₂ increases the acidity of the soil to help roots absorb minerals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In sealed greenhouses with good light and temperature, CO₂ can become the limiting factor. Adding CO₂ removes this limitation, increasing growth rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "It increases up to an optimum, then decreases at higher temperatures",
          "It remains constant until 40°C, then stops completely and instantly",
          "It decreases steadily as temperature rises due to increased transpiration",
          "It follows a strictly linear path where hotter temperatures always help"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like most enzyme-controlled reactions, photosynthesis has an optimum temperature. Above this, enzymes denature; below it, reactions slow down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to photosynthesis at very high temperatures (above 40°C)?",
        "options": [
          "Enzymes denature and photosynthesis declines sharply",
          "The light-dependent reactions accelerate to compensate for heat",
          "Plants switch to a different type of photosynthesis using oxygen",
          "The rate stabilizes because the plant enters a dormant 'heat' state"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High temperatures denature enzymes like Rubisco in the Calvin cycle and damage thylakoid membranes, causing a rapid drop in the rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is CO₂ concentration increasing in Earth's atmosphere?",
        "options": [
          "Mainly from burning fossil fuels and deforestation",
          "Because rising temperatures prevent plants from absorbing any CO₂",
          "Due to a natural decrease in the total number of plants worldwide",
          "Mainly because of increased volcanic activity and undersea vents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, release stored CO₂. Deforestation also reduces the number of 'sinks' that absorb CO₂."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might be the effect of global warming on photosynthesis worldwide?",
        "options": [
          "Complex - could increase in some areas, decrease in others due to heat stress",
          "A universal increase in growth because all plants prefer warmer climates",
          "A total shutdown of photosynthesis globally as enzymes reach 30°C",
          "No significant change as plants adapt instantly to new temperature levels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Warmer temperatures might help in cool regions but harm in already warm regions. Factors like drought and heat stress make the global outcome complex."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do temperature and light intensity interact as limiting factors?",
        "options": [
          "The optimal temperature depends on light intensity, and vice versa",
          "They are mutually exclusive and cannot both affect the plant at once",
          "Light intensity only limits the plant during the day, temperature only at night",
          "Increasing light intensity always fixes any damage caused by high heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In bright light, temperature is more likely to be limiting. In optimal temperature, light is more likely to be limiting. They interact to determine the final rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to plants in very cold temperatures?",
        "options": [
          "Photosynthesis slows because enzyme activity decreases",
          "The rate increases as the plant tries to generate metabolic heat",
          "Chlorophyll molecules shatter, preventing any light absorption",
          "Plants stop taking in CO₂ to prevent the internal fluids from freezing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cold temperatures slow molecular movement and enzyme activity, leading to a decreased rate of photosynthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why don't plants photosynthesize faster with unlimited CO₂ in nature?",
        "options": [
          "Other factors like light, temperature, or water usually become limiting first",
          "Plants have a genetic 'cap' that prevents them from using extra CO₂",
          "High CO₂ levels act as a poison that destroys the spongy mesophyll",
          "The stomata close automatically when CO₂ levels exceed 0.04%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In nature, multiple factors interact. Even with extra CO₂, a plant might be limited by light, water, or soil nutrients."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is understanding these limiting factors important for predicting climate change impacts?",
        "options": [
          "It helps predict how ecosystems might respond to changing CO₂ and temperature",
          "It allows scientists to calculate exactly when photosynthesis will stop on Earth",
          "It proves that human-made CO₂ is different from the CO₂ used by plants",
          "It demonstrates that temperature is the only factor that will ever matter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Scientists use models incorporating these factors to predict forest absorption rates, crop yields, and ecosystem shifts."
