        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like carbohydrates and lipids, amino acids are linked via dehydration synthesis (condensation), where a water molecule is removed to form a covalent bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A peptide bond forms between which two specific functional groups of adjacent amino acids?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The bond specifically connects the carbon of the carboxyl group ($-COOH$) from the first amino acid to the nitrogen of the amino group ($-NH_2$) of the second."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When two amino acids are joined together by a single peptide bond, the resulting molecule is called a:",

          "49",
          "50",
          "51",
          "25"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each peptide bond formation releases one water molecule. In a linear chain, the number of bonds is always $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of monomers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'polypeptide'?",
        "options": [
          "A long chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds",
          "A molecule consisting of exactly two amino acids",
          "A protein that has reached its final functional 3D shape",
          "A branched carbohydrate used for energy storage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A polypeptide is a polymer of many amino acids. While often used interchangeably with 'protein,' a polypeptide refers specifically to the primary covalent chain before final folding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What must be added to a polypeptide to break the peptide bonds and release individual amino acids?",
        "options": [
          "Water molecules (Hydrolysis)",
          "Carbon dioxide",
          "Additional R-groups",
          "Oxygen gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrolysis is the process of adding water to break the covalent peptide bonds, a process essential for protein digestion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which atoms are directly involved in the covalent backbone of a peptide bond?",
        "options": [
          "Carbon and Nitrogen",
          "Carbon and Oxygen only",
          "Nitrogen and Hydrogen only",
          "Carbon and Carbon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The peptide bond is a $C-N$ link between the carbonyl carbon of one amino acid and the amide nitrogen of the next."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the orientation of a polypeptide chain, starting from the first amino acid added?",
        "options": [
          "N-terminus to C-terminus",
          "C-terminus to N-terminus",
          "R-group to R-group",
          "Alpha-carbon to Alpha-carbon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polypeptides are synthesized and read from the Amino-terminus (N-terminus) to the Carboxyl-terminus (C-terminus)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the peptide bond described as having 'partial double-bond character'?",
        "options": [
          "It is rigid and resists rotation",
          "It can easily be broken by low heat",
          "It allows the R-groups to spin freely",
          "It is an ionic bond rather than a covalent bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to resonance, the $C-N$ bond in a peptide link is shorter and more rigid than a standard single bond, which limits rotation and influences protein folding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which enzyme category is responsible for catalyzing the formation of peptide bonds during translation?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Peptidyl transferase, an enzyme integrated into the ribosome, facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids during protein synthesis."
