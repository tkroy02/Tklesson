        "question": "What happens to the chemical structure of an enzyme after it catalyzes a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It remains unchanged and can be reused for additional reactions",
          "It is hydrolyzed and must be resynthesized by ribosomes",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enzymes are not consumed in the reactions they catalyze. They return to their original state after product release and can catalyze multiple rounds of reaction."

        "question": "What does the property of 'enzyme specificity' refer to?",

          "Each enzyme typically catalyzes only one specific chemical reaction",
          "Enzymes function effectively only at one specific temperature",
          "Enzymes are localized only within specific membrane-bound organelles",
          "Each enzyme produces a fixed, specific quantity of product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enzyme specificity means that most enzymes catalyze only one particular chemical reaction due to the precise fit between their active site and the substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do enzymes lower the activation energy of a biochemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "By orienting substrates optimally and stabilizing the transition state",
          "By transferring high-energy phosphate bonds from their own structure",
          "By significantly increasing the local temperature of the cytoplasm",
          "By altering the equilibrium constant ($$K_{eq}$$) of the reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enzymes work by orienting substrates properly, straining bonds, and providing optimal microenvironments to facilitate the transition state."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary organic composition of the vast majority of enzymes?",

          "Globular proteins",
          "Complex carbohydrates",
          "Double-stranded nucleic acids",
          "Hydrophobic lipids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most enzymes are globular proteins. While some catalytic RNA molecules (ribozymes) exist, proteins are the primary biological catalysts."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of non-protein cofactors in enzyme function?",
        "options": [
          "They assist in catalysis by carrying chemical groups or electrons",
          "They serve as structural replacements for denatured enzymes",
          "They compete with substrates to permanently block the active site",
          "They encode the specific amino acid sequence of the enzyme"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cofactors are non-protein molecules (like metal ions or coenzymes) that help enzymes perform their catalytic functions."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements regarding the regulation of enzyme activity is correct?",

          "Enzyme activity remains constant regardless of cellular conditions",
          "All enzymes across different species operate at the same optimal rate",
          "Enzyme activity increases linearly with substrate concentration indefinitely"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cells regulate enzyme activity through allosteric regulation, covalent modification, and feedback inhibition to maintain metabolic balance."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement accurately describes the relationship between an enzyme and its substrate?",
        "options": [
          "The substrate is the specific reactant molecule the enzyme acts upon",
          "The enzyme is consumed as it converts the substrate into products",
          "The substrate permanently alters the enzyme's primary amino acid sequence",
          "The enzyme binds to the substrate to form a permanent covalent complex"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substrates are the reactant molecules that bind to an enzyme's active site and are converted to products during the catalytic cycle."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are enzymes considered essential for maintaining life processes?",
