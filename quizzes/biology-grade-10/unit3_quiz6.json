    "subtitle": "3.6 pH Effects",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "pH on Enzyme Activity",
    "duration": 10,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'optimal pH' for an enzyme?",
        "options": [
          "The pH at which the enzyme works fastest",
          "The most acidic pH the enzyme can survive",
          "The pH of pure water (pH 7)",
          "The pH that destroys the enzyme completely"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The optimal pH is the pH level where the enzyme catalyzes reactions at its maximum rate - it's the peak of the enzyme activity graph."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to enzymes in very acidic or very basic conditions?",
        "options": [
          "They can denature and lose their specific shape",
          "They work faster because pH provides extra energy",
          "They become permanently activated to work at any pH",
          "They break down into simple sugars and fats"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Extreme pH levels can disrupt the bonds that hold the enzyme's 3D shape, causing it to unravel (denature) and lose function, similar to high temperatures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which enzyme works best in the acidic environment of the stomach?",
        "options": [
          "Pepsin (optimal pH around 2)",
          "Salivary amylase (optimal pH around 7)",
          "Trypsin (optimal pH around 8)",
          "Pancreatic lipase (optimal pH around 7)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pepsin, the stomach enzyme that digests proteins, works best at very acidic pH (around pH 2), which matches the stomach's hydrochloric acid environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do most enzymes in human cells work best around neutral pH (6-8)?",
        "options": [
          "That's the pH of most body fluids and cell cytoplasm",
          "Neutral pH is the only pH where enzymes can work",
          "Acidic and basic conditions don't exist in living things",
          "All enzymes in nature have evolved for pH 7"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most human cells maintain a near-neutral internal environment (pH around 7.2-7.4), so their enzymes have evolved to work best at that pH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would a graph of enzyme activity vs. pH typically look like?",
        "options": [
          "A curve that rises to a peak then drops on both sides",
          "A straight line going upward as pH increases",
          "A flat line that doesn't change with pH",
          "A zigzag pattern with many peaks and valleys"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like the temperature graph, pH graphs usually show a bell-shaped curve: activity increases to optimal pH, then decreases as pH becomes too acidic or too basic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does pH affect the charges on amino acids in an enzyme?",
        "options": [
          "It changes which amino acids are positively or negatively charged",
          "It removes all charges from the amino acids",
          "It adds extra phosphate groups to the amino acids",
          "It has no effect on amino acid charges"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "pH affects whether acidic amino acids (like aspartic acid) are charged (-) or neutral, and whether basic amino acids (like lysine) are charged (+) or neutral, changing how they interact."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does changing the charges on amino acids affect enzyme function?",
        "options": [
          "Correct charges help maintain the enzyme's shape and active site",
          "Charges provide the energy needed for catalysis",
          "Enzymes need maximum charge to work properly",
          "All enzymes must be completely neutral to function"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The specific 3D shape of enzymes depends on attractions and repulsions between charged amino acids. Wrong charges mean wrong shape, so the active site doesn't work properly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when you add antacid medication for heartburn?",
        "options": [
          "It raises stomach pH, temporarily reducing pepsin activity",
          "It lowers stomach pH, speeding up all digestion",
          "It denatures all enzymes in the digestive system",
          "It provides extra enzymes to help with digestion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Antacids neutralize stomach acid, raising pH. This temporarily reduces pepsin activity (which needs acidic pH), relieving discomfort from excess stomach acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which enzyme would likely work best in the basic (alkaline) small intestine?",
        "options": [
          "Trypsin (optimal pH around 8)",
          "Pepsin (optimal pH around 2)",
          "Salivary amylase (optimal pH around 7)",
          "All enzymes work the same at any pH"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Trypsin, a pancreatic enzyme that continues protein digestion, works best around pH 8, matching the slightly basic environment of the small intestine where bicarbonate neutralizes stomach acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are pH effects similar to temperature effects on enzymes?",
        "options": [
          "Both show optimal ranges with bell-shaped activity curves",
          "Both always increase enzyme activity when increased",
          "Neither has any permanent effect on enzyme structure",
          "Both effects are exactly the same for all enzymes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both temperature and pH graphs typically show bell curves with optimal points. Both can denature enzymes at extremes, and different enzymes have different optimal ranges for both factors."
