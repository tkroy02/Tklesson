        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tertiary structure is the full 3D conformation of a single polypeptide, resulting from interactions between the R-groups (side chains)."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike secondary structure (backbone), tertiary structure is determined by various interactions (ionic, hydrophobic, etc.) between the variable side chains."
      },

        "question": "What is 'hydrophobic interaction' in the context of protein folding?",
        "options": [
          "Non-polar R-groups cluster in the center of the protein to avoid water",

          "Hydrocarbon chains are chemically converted into stable glucose rings"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As a protein folds in an aqueous environment, hydrophobic (non-polar) side chains end up in clusters at the core of the protein, away from water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which strong covalent bond can form between the sulfur atoms of two cysteine amino acids to stabilize tertiary structure?",

          "Hydrogen bond",
          "Peptide link"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Disulfide bridges are strong covalent bonds that 'pin' parts of the protein together, providing significant structural stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Quaternary structure is best described as:",
        "options": [
          "The arrangement and interaction of two or more polypeptide subunits",
          "The folding of a single protein chain into exactly four alpha-helices",
          "The metabolic stage where a protein is broken down for cellular energy",
          "A short chain of four amino acids linked together by peptide bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Many functional proteins, like hemoglobin, consist of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) working together as one macromolecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hemoglobin, which consists of four separate polypeptide subunits, is an example of which structural level?",
        "options": [
          "Quaternary structure",
          "Tertiary structure",
          "Primary structure",
          "Secondary structure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because hemoglobin is composed of two alpha-globin and two beta-globin chains, it exhibits quaternary structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during the denaturation of a protein?",
        "options": [
          "The protein loses its higher-level structure and functional three-dimensional shape",
          "The primary covalent sequence of amino acids is completely hydrolyzed and destroyed",
          "The protein molecule is converted into a lipid through a complex chemical shift",
          "Additional amino acids are synthesized and added to the N-terminus of the chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Denaturation disrupts the weak bonds (H-bonds, ionic) that maintain 3D shape, causing the protein to unfold and lose its biological activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following environmental factors can cause a protein to denature?",
        "options": [
          "Extreme changes in pH levels or exposure to high temperatures",
          "Brief exposure to visible light or standard magnetic fields",
          "Storing the purified protein at standard room temperature",
          "Dissolving a highly soluble protein in pure distilled water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat increases kinetic energy and pH changes alter the charge of R-groups; both can break the interactions maintaining the tertiary structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What kind of bond forms between a positively charged R-group and a negatively charged R-group in a protein?",

          "Ionic bond",
          "Hydrophobic interaction",
          "Disulfide bridge",
          "Peptide bond"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ionic bonds (or salt bridges) form between oppositely charged side chains, helping to stabilize the folded 3D conformation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'prosthetic group' in a quaternary protein structure?",
        "options": [
