    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Patterns of Natural Selection",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is directional selection?",
        "options": [
          "It favors one extreme phenotype",
          "It favors intermediate phenotypes",
          "It favors both extremes equally",
          "It prevents any change in traits"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Directional selection shifts a trait distribution toward one extreme, like larger beak size during drought (Galapagos finches) or antibiotic resistance in bacteria."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does stabilizing selection do?",
        "options": [
          "It favors intermediate traits",
          "It favors the largest individuals",
          "It favors the smallest individuals",
          "It increases trait variation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stabilizing selection maintains the status quo by favoring average phenotypes. Example: human birth weight—very small or very large babies have lower survival."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What characterizes disruptive selection?",
        "options": [
          "It favors both extremes over intermediates",
          "It eliminates all variation",
          "It moves traits in one direction",
          "It only occurs in plants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Disruptive selection favors individuals at both ends of a trait range, potentially leading to two distinct phenotypes or speciation (e.g., black-bellied seedcracker finches with small or large beaks)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which selection type reduces genetic variation?",
        "options": [
          "Stabilizing and directional selection",
          "Disruptive selection only",
          "All types increase variation",
          "No selection affects variation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stabilizing and directional selection reduce variation by favoring specific phenotypes. Disruptive selection can maintain or increase variation by favoring extremes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might cause directional selection?",
        "options": [
          "A changing environment",
          "A stable environment",
          "Random mating patterns",
          "Lack of competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Directional selection often occurs when environments change—climate shifts, new predators, or novel food sources favor one extreme over others."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When is sexual selection a type of natural selection?",
        "options": [
          "When traits increase mating success",
          "When traits only affect survival",
          "When environments are constant",
          "When populations are very small"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sexual selection favors traits that improve mating opportunities (bright plumage, antlers, courtship displays), even if they reduce survival—peacock tails are classic examples."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is artificial selection?",
        "options": [
          "Human-directed breeding for desired traits",
          "Natural selection in artificial habitats",
          "Random selection in lab conditions",
          "Selection that always fails"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Artificial selection is humans choosing which individuals breed based on desired traits (e.g., dog breeds, crop plants, livestock)—accelerated evolution by human design."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can you identify selection type from a graph?",
        "options": [
          "By the shape of trait distribution change",
          "By the color of the graph lines",
          "By the number of species shown",
          "By the age of the population"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Directional: curve shifts left/right; Stabilizing: curve narrows at center; Disruptive: curve becomes bimodal (two peaks)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might maintain disruptive selection?",
        "options": [
          "Two distinct ecological niches",
          "A uniform environment",
          "No genetic variation",
          "Slow environmental change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a habitat offers two very different resources (small and large seeds, different microhabitats), individuals specialized for each may outcompete generalists."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is an example of stabilizing selection?",
        "options": [
          "Most babies born at medium weight",
          "Peacocks with largest tails mate most",
          "Bacteria evolving drug resistance",
          "Finches developing different beak sizes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Human birth weight shows stabilizing selection—babies of average weight have highest survival, while very small or very large babies face higher risks."
