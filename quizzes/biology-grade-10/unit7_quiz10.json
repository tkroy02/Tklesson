    "subtitle": "7.10 Human Impact on Evolution",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Human Influences on Evolution",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is artificial selection?",
        "options": [
          "Humans breeding organisms for desired traits",
          "Natural selection occurring within urban environments",
          "Random mating patterns in captive animal populations",
          "Evolutionary change occurring without human interference"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Artificial selection is humans choosing which individuals reproduce based on desired traits (e.g., dog breeds, crop yields, milk production)—evolution directed by human preference."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do antibiotics drive bacterial evolution?",
        "options": [
          "They select for resistant bacteria",
          "They kill all bacterial strains equally",
          "They prevent all spontaneous genetic mutations",
          "They cause bacteria to become structurally weaker"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Antibiotics create strong selection pressure: bacteria with resistance genes survive and reproduce, leading to evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains (e.g., MRSA)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is pesticide resistance an example of?",
        "options": [
          "Human-induced natural selection",
          "Artificial selection by agricultural farmers",
          "Unintended side effects of genetic engineering",
          "Random genetic drift in small insect populations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pesticides kill susceptible insects, leaving resistant ones to reproduce. This is natural selection (differential survival) but human-caused through pesticide use."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does habitat fragmentation affect evolution?",
        "options": [
          "It isolates populations, increasing genetic drift",
          "It facilitates an increase in gene flow between species",
          "It prevents all forms of evolutionary change",
          "It makes separate environments ecologically identical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When habitats are broken into fragments, populations become isolated, leading to increased genetic drift, inbreeding, and potentially rapid local adaptation or speciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the evolutionary impact of overfishing?",
        "options": [
          "It selects for smaller, earlier-maturing fish",
          "It significantly increases genetic diversity in fish",
          "It causes instantaneous speciation events",
          "It halts the process of fish evolution entirely"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fishing often targets larger fish, leaving smaller ones to breed. This selects for genes for smaller size and earlier reproduction—evolution in response to human harvesting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does climate change influence evolution?",
        "options": [
          "It alters selection pressures on many species",
          "It halts all evolutionary processes completely",
          "It only influences short-term animal behavior",
          "It causes all global environments to become identical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rapid climate change shifts temperatures, precipitation, and seasons, creating new selection pressures that can drive adaptation, migration, or extinction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is conservation genetics concerned with?",
        "options": [
          "Maintaining genetic diversity in small populations",
          "Creating entirely new species through bio-engineering",
          "Deliberately increasing mutation rates in the wild",
          "Eliminating all genetic variation to stabilize a species"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Small, isolated populations lose genetic diversity through inbreeding and drift. Conservation genetics aims to preserve variation to maintain adaptive potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How have humans influenced plant evolution?",
        "options": [
          "Through domestication and targeted crop breeding",
          "By halting all natural plant evolutionary processes",
          "By engineering all food plants to be genetically identical",
          "Exclusively through random chance events"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Humans domesticated crops (wheat, rice, corn) over thousands of years, selecting for traits like larger seeds, reduced shattering, and higher yields—dramatic artificial selection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an unintended consequence of human-mediated evolution?",
        "options": [
          "Superweeds resistant to common herbicides",
          "The complete extinction of all known agricultural pests",
          "The permanent loss of all future evolutionary potential",
          "Immediate and widespread speciation events"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Herbicide use selects for resistant weeds; antibiotic use selects for resistant bacteria. These are evolutionary responses with significant practical consequences."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is understanding human impact on evolution important?",
        "options": [
          "To manage ecosystems and resources sustainably",
          "To effectively stop all natural evolutionary processes",
          "To demonstrate that humans can fully control nature",
          "To systematically eliminate genetic variation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Recognizing how human activities drive evolution helps us address antibiotic resistance, pest control, conservation, and sustainable harvesting—applying evolutionary thinking to real-world problems."
