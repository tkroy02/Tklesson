    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Fossil Record as Evolution Evidence",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What do fossils provide evidence for?",
        "options": [
          "How life has changed over time",
          "Exactly how all species originated",
          "What DNA ancient organisms had",
          "Why mass extinctions happened"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fossils show that organisms from the past differ from those today, demonstrating that life has changed through time—a key piece of evidence for evolution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are transitional fossils?",
        "options": [
          "Fossils showing intermediate forms",
          "Fossils between rock layers",
          "Fossils that are partly decayed",
          "Fossils from different continents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Transitional fossils exhibit traits common to both ancestral and descendant groups, like Tiktaalik (fish-to-amphibian) or Archaeopteryx (dinosaur-to-bird)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the fossil record generally change from older to younger rock layers?",
        "options": [
          "Organisms become more complex",
          "Organisms stay exactly the same",
          "All organisms go extinct",
          "Only plant fossils appear"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Generally, simpler organisms appear in older layers, with more complex forms in younger layers, showing a pattern of increasing complexity over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the principle of superposition state?",
        "options": [
          "Older layers are below younger layers",
          "Fossils determine rock age",
          "Similar fossils are the same age",
          "All fossils are equally important"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In undisturbed rock sequences, lower layers were deposited earlier and are older than upper layers, providing relative dates for fossils within them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the fossil record incomplete?",
        "options": [
          "Fossilization is a rare event",
          "Scientists haven't looked everywhere",
          "Most organisms dissolve quickly",
          "Rocks destroy all fossils over time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fossilization requires specific conditions: rapid burial, minimal decay, and preservation. Most organisms decompose without leaving fossils."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What can fossil distribution across continents suggest?",
        "options": [
          "Continents were once connected",
          "Organisms swam between continents",
          "All continents had the same climate",
          "Fossils moved after forming"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Similar fossils on now-separated continents (like Glossopteris plants) support plate tectonics and continental drift, explaining how related species lived together long ago."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What do mass extinction events show in the fossil record?",
        "options": [
          "Many species disappeared suddenly",
          "Evolution stopped for a time",
          "All life was wiped out completely",
          "Only the strongest survived always"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass extinctions (like the end-Cretaceous) show rapid loss of many species globally, followed by diversification of survivors—a pattern of 'punctuated equilibrium' in evolution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do fossils help establish evolutionary relationships?",
        "options": [
          "By showing anatomical changes over time",
          "By providing DNA for comparison",
          "By telling us what organisms ate",
          "By revealing exact migration routes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fossil sequences, like horse evolution or whale ancestors, show gradual anatomical changes linking modern species to their ancestors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of rock most commonly contains fossils?",
        "options": [
          "Sedimentary rock",
          "Igneous rock",
          "Metamorphic rock",
          "Volcanic rock"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sedimentary rocks form from accumulated sediments that can bury and preserve organisms. Igneous and metamorphic rocks usually destroy organic remains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are some organisms better represented in the fossil record?",
        "options": [
          "They had hard body parts",
          "They lived longer lives",
          "They were more numerous",
          "They evolved more recently"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Organisms with hard parts (shells, bones, teeth) fossilize more easily than soft-bodied organisms, creating a biased record."
