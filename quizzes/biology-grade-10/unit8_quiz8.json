        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The thyroid gland produces thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which regulate metabolic rate, energy production, and growth/development."
      },

          "The pancreas",
          "The liver",
          "The adrenal cortex",
          "The posterior pituitary"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pancreas contains islets of Langerhans with alpha cells (glucagon) and beta cells (insulin) that regulate blood glucose levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which gland primarily controls the 'fight or flight' response?",
        "options": [
          "The adrenal glands (specifically the adrenal medulla)",
          "The thyroid gland's follicular cells",
          "The parathyroid glands on the posterior thyroid surface",
          "The pineal gland located within the epithalamus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine, preparing the body for emergency action by increasing heart rate and energy availability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What characterizes a negative feedback mechanism in endocrine regulation?",
        "options": [
          "A process where rising hormone levels inhibit further secretion of that hormone",
          "A condition where hormone secretion increases exponentially without limit",
          "A scenario where a hormone directly stimulates its own biosynthetic pathway",
          "An antagonistic relationship where one hormone permanently deactivates another"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most hormones are regulated by negative feedback: high hormone levels inhibit further secretion, maintaining homeostasis (e.g., thermostat regulation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which hormone is critical for regulating calcium levels in the blood?",

          "Insulin",
          "Thyroxine",
          "Cortisol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium by stimulating bone breakdown, calcium absorption in intestines, and calcium reabsorption in kidneys."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the functional relationship between the hypothalamus and the endocrine system?",
        "options": [
          "It links the nervous and endocrine systems by controlling pituitary function",
          "It acts as the primary site for the synthesis of all peripheral hormones",
          "It serves as a specialized reservoir for storing fat-soluble hormones",
          "It functions as a biological filter to remove excess hormones from circulation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hypothalamus produces releasing and inhibiting hormones that control the anterior pituitary and produces hormones stored/released by the posterior pituitary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do endocrine and nervous system communications differ regarding speed and duration?",
        "options": [
          "Endocrine responses are generally slower to initiate but last longer",
          "Endocrine responses are significantly faster but provide brief effects",
          "Both systems transmit signals at identical electrochemical speeds",
          "The nervous system is the only pathway capable of producing lasting changes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nervous system: milliseconds to seconds, brief effects. Endocrine system: seconds to hours/days, sustained effects due to hormone persistence in blood."
