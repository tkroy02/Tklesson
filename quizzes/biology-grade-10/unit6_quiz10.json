    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are mutagens?",
        "options": [
          "Agents that increase mutation rates",
          "Enzymes that repair DNA",
          "Proteins that prevent mutations",
          "Molecules that stabilize DNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mutagens are physical or chemical agents that damage DNA or interfere with replication, increasing the frequency of mutations above the natural background rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is a physical mutagen?",
        "options": [
          "UV radiation",
          "Tobacco smoke",
          "Viral infection",
          "Dietary fat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "UV radiation is a physical mutagen that causes thymine dimers—covalent bonds between adjacent thymine bases, distorting the DNA helix."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do many chemical mutagens work?",
        "options": [
          "By altering DNA base structure",
          "By breaking chromosomes apart",
          "By speeding up replication",
          "By blocking transcription"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chemical mutagens like nitrous acid or benzopyrene modify bases (e.g., converting cytosine to uracil) or insert themselves into DNA, causing mispairing during replication."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are spontaneous mutations?",
        "options": [
          "Errors that occur naturally without mutagens",
          "Mutations caused by radiation",
          "Mutations from chemical exposure",
          "Inherited mutations only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spontaneous mutations arise from natural processes like DNA replication errors, tautomeric shifts in bases, or oxidative damage from normal metabolism."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What can increase the chance of mutations during DNA replication?",
        "options": [
          "DNA polymerase errors",
          "Increased cell size",
          "Higher protein synthesis",
          "More ribosomes present"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Although DNA polymerase has proofreading, occasional mismatches escape correction, leading to base substitutions or small insertions/deletions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do some viruses cause mutations?",
        "options": [
          "By inserting their DNA into host genes",
          "By producing chemical mutagens",
          "By radiating host cells",
          "By blocking DNA repair"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Some viruses integrate their genetic material into host chromosomes, disrupting gene sequences and potentially causing frameshifts or altered regulation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are mutations in somatic cells not inherited?",
        "options": [
          "They are not in gametes",
          "They are always repaired",
          "They are too small to matter",
          "They occur only in mitochondria"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Somatic (body) cell mutations affect only that individual and its cellular descendants. Only mutations in germline cells (gametes) can pass to offspring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor does NOT typically cause mutations?",
        "options": [
          "Normal aerobic respiration",
          "Ionizing radiation",
          "Certain industrial chemicals",
          "Some antiviral drugs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While aerobic respiration produces reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, it's not considered a mutagenic 'factor' in the same deliberate sense as radiation or specific chemicals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a beneficial mutation?",
        "options": [
          "One that improves an organism's survival",
          "Any mutation in non-coding DNA",
          "A mutation that has no effect",
          "A mutation that is quickly repaired"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Beneficial mutations enhance an organism's fitness—e.g., antibiotic resistance in bacteria, lactase persistence in humans, or darker fur in polluted environments."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can mutations drive evolution?",
        "options": [
          "By creating genetic variation for selection",
          "By directly adapting organisms to environments",
          "By reducing population size",
          "By repairing damaged DNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mutations provide the raw genetic variation upon which natural selection acts. Without mutations, there would be no new alleles for evolution to work with."
