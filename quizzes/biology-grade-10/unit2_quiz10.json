    "duration": 10,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which chemical test is most commonly used in schools to detect the presence of proteins?",
        "options": [
          "Biuret test",
          "Benedict's test",
          "Iodine test",
          "Sudan IV test"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Biuret test is the standard test for proteins in biological samples. Benedict's tests for reducing sugars, iodine for starch, and Sudan IV for lipids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What color change indicates a positive Biuret test for proteins?",
        "options": [
          "Blue to violet or purple",
          "Blue to brick-red precipitate",
          "Yellow-brown to blue-black",
          "Colorless to cloudy white emulsion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Biuret reagent is blue. In the presence of proteins (specifically peptide bonds), it turns violet or purple."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What specific structural feature in proteins does the Biuret test detect?",
        "options": [
          "Peptide bonds between amino acids",
          "Sulfur atoms within cysteine R-groups",
          "Isolated amino groups ($$-NH_2$$)",
          "Isolated carboxyl groups ($$-COOH$$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Biuret test specifically detects peptide bonds (C-N bonds in the protein backbone). The reagent forms a violet complex with copper ions in alkaline solution when peptide bonds are present."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would give a positive Biuret test?",
        "options": [
          "All of the listed substances",
          "Egg white (albumin solution)",
          "Milk protein (casein suspension)",
          "Purified enzyme solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All proteins contain peptide bonds and will give a positive Biuret test. Egg white, milk proteins, and enzymes are all proteins."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of sodium hydroxide ($$NaOH$$) in the Biuret test?",
        "options": [
          "It creates the alkaline environment needed for the reaction",
          "It provides the copper ions for coordination complex formation",
          "It hydrolyzes peptide bonds to release free amino acids",
          "It acts as a primary reducing agent in the chemical test"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$$NaOH$$ makes the solution alkaline, which is necessary for the copper ions in the Biuret reagent to form the violet complex with peptide bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the Biuret test differentiate between proteins and single amino acids?",
        "options": [
          "Single amino acids give a negative result because they lack peptide bonds",
          "Single amino acids produce a significantly darker purple color than proteins",
          "Single amino acids turn the solution bright yellow instead of purple",
          "There is no visible difference; both substances test positive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Biuret test requires at least two peptide bonds to work. Single amino acids (or dipeptides) lack sufficient peptide bonds and give a negative or very weak result."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What safety precaution is especially important when performing the Biuret test?",
        "options": [
          "Wear gloves and eye protection when handling sodium hydroxide",
          "Keep the Biuret reagent away from all open flame or heat sources",
          "Perform the test only in complete darkness to prevent degradation",
          "Avoid breathing the vapors near the copper sulfate solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sodium hydroxide is corrosive and can cause severe burns. Proper personal protective equipment (gloves, goggles) is essential when handling it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which substance would NOT give a positive Biuret test?",
        "options": [
          "Glucose solution",
          "Egg albumin",
          "Gelatin powder in solution",
          "Amylase enzyme solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glucose is a carbohydrate, not a protein. It lacks peptide bonds and would give a negative Biuret test (but might give a positive Benedict's test)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of copper sulfate in the Biuret reagent?",
        "options": [
          "It provides $$Cu^{2+}$$ ions that form a complex with peptide bonds",
          "It acts as a universal pH indicator in the test solution",
          "It actively digests proteins into smaller peptide fragments",
          "It oxidizes amino groups to produce a visible color change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Copper(II) ions ($$Cu^{2+}$$) from copper sulfate form a violet-colored coordination complex with the nitrogen atoms in peptide bonds under alkaline conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a student tests an unknown food sample and gets a violet color with Biuret reagent, what conclusion can they draw?",
        "options": [
          "The sample contains proteins or polypeptides",
          "The sample definitely originates from animal-based sources",
          "The sample contains only essential amino acid monomers",
          "The sample is composed primarily of lipid content"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A positive Biuret test indicates the presence of proteins or polypeptides (molecules with multiple peptide bonds). It doesn't specify the source, amino acid composition, or other nutrients."
