        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon is uniquely versatile; it can share one, two, or three pairs of electrons with another carbon atom to form single ($C-C$), double ($C=C$), or triple ($C\\equiv C$) bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of biology, what defines a molecule as 'organic'?",
        "options": [
          "It contains carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen",
          "It was produced without the use of chemicals",
          "It consists entirely of oxygen and nitrogen",
          "It is created only within the upper atmosphere"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In biological sciences, 'organic' refers to molecules that contain carbon-hydrogen bonds, which are characteristic of the molecules found in living organisms."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which geometric shape is formed when a carbon atom forms four single covalent bonds?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When carbon forms four single bonds, the electron pairs repel each other equally, resulting in a 3D tetrahedral shape with bond angles of approximately 109.5°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is carbon considered the 'building block of life'?",
