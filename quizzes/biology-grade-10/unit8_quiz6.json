        "question": "What is the peripheral nervous system (PNS)?",
        "options": [
          "The network of nerves and ganglia located outside the brain and spinal cord",
          "The anatomical structures consisting of the brain and spinal cord only",
          "The regulatory system responsible for autonomic organ functions only",
          "A collection of specialized sensory receptors lacking motor pathways"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The PNS includes all neural structures outside the brain and spinal cord: sensory receptors, nerves, ganglia, and motor endings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary role of sensory (afferent) nerves?",
        "options": [
          "They carry electrochemical signals from receptors toward the CNS",
          "They transmit motor commands away from the CNS to effectors",
          "They facilitate inter-neuronal connections within the spinal cord",
          "They directly regulate involuntary physiological functions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sensory neurons transmit information from sensory receptors (skin, organs, muscles) to the central nervous system for processing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the function of motor (efferent) nerves?",
        "options": [
          "They carry output commands from the CNS to muscles and glands",
          "They bring raw sensory data from the environment to the brain",
          "They perform high-level data processing within the cerebral cortex",
          "They are localized exclusively within the protective vertebrae"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Motor neurons carry signals from the CNS to muscles, glands, and organs to produce responses (movement, secretion, etc.)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the somatic nervous system responsible for?",
        "options": [
          "The conscious control of voluntary skeletal muscle contractions",
          "The unconscious regulation of internal visceral organs",
          "The cognitive processing of complex emotions and long-term memory",
          "The metabolic regulation of heart rate and digestive enzymes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The somatic division controls conscious, voluntary movements of skeletal muscles and receives sensory input from external stimuli."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the autonomic nervous system (ANS)?",
        "options": [
          "A system that regulates involuntary physiological processes",
          "A division that controls conscious, voluntary muscle movements",
          "A pathway that exclusively processes external sensory stimuli",
          "A network that connects only the internal structures of the brain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ANS controls automatic functions like heart rate, digestion, respiration, and glandular activity without conscious effort."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two functional divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System?",
        "options": [
          "Sympathetic and parasympathetic",
          "Sensory and motor",
          "Central and peripheral",
          "Somatic and autonomic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sympathetic prepares for 'fight or flight'; parasympathetic promotes 'rest and digest.' They often have opposite effects on organs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of the sympathetic division?",
        "options": [
          "To mobilize body systems during stress or high-energy activity",
          "To conserve energy and stimulate digestion during relaxation",
          "To mediate the voluntary movement of the skeletal system",
          "To filter and process incoming tactile sensory information"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sympathetic activation increases heart rate, dilates airways, releases glucose, dilates pupils—preparing for intense physical activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the parasympathetic division responsible for?",
        "options": [
          "Promoting energy conservation and maintaining routine functions",
          "Triggering immediate physiological responses to emergencies",
          "Controlling the voluntary contraction of skeletal muscle groups",
          "Transmitting high-speed pain signals from the extremities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parasympathetic activity dominates during relaxation: slows heart rate, stimulates digestion, constricts pupils, promotes nutrient absorption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are ganglia in the context of the PNS?",
        "options": [
          "Clusters of neuron cell bodies located outside the CNS",
          "Dense bundles of axons found within the spinal cord tracts",
          "Ventricular spaces in the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid",
          "External insulating layers that wrap around peripheral nerves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ganglia are collections of neuron cell bodies in the PNS, like dorsal root ganglia (sensory) or autonomic ganglia (sympathetic/parasympathetic)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the PNS and CNS interact to maintain function?",
        "options": [
          "The PNS provides sensory input and executes motor output for the CNS",
          "The PNS processes and integrates all information independently",
          "The CNS only assumes control of the PNS during the sleep cycle",
          "The two systems function as completely separate biological units"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The PNS serves as the communication network: sensory pathways inform CNS about internal/external conditions; motor pathways execute CNS decisions."
