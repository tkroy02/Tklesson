    "subtitle": "7.3 Molecular Evidence",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "DNA and Protein Comparisons",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does molecular evidence for evolution compare?",
        "options": [
          "DNA or protein sequences",
          "Fossil sizes and shapes",
          "Geographic distributions",
          "Behavioral patterns"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecular evidence examines similarities and differences in DNA nucleotide sequences or protein amino acid sequences across species."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do DNA similarities support evolutionary relationships?",
        "options": [
          "More similar DNA suggests closer kinship",
          "Identical DNA means identical species",
          "DNA differences prove no relationship",
          "All DNA evolves at the same rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Species that share a more recent common ancestor have accumulated fewer DNA mutations and therefore have more similar genetic sequences."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are conserved genes?",
        "options": [
          "Genes that change very slowly",
          "Genes that are always identical",
          "Genes found in one species only",
          "Genes that control behavior"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conserved genes (like those for ribosomes or cytochrome c) are essential for basic cellular functions and mutate slowly, revealing deep evolutionary relationships."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why compare cytochrome c across species?",
        "options": [
          "It is essential and evolves slowly",
          "It is different in every organism",
          "It determines physical appearance",
          "It is easy to extract from fossils"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cytochrome c is a protein involved in cellular respiration. Its slow, steady mutation rate makes it useful for comparing distantly related organisms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a molecular clock estimate?",
        "options": [
          "Time since species diverged",
          "Rate of fossil formation",
          "Speed of DNA replication",
          "Age of individual organisms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A molecular clock uses mutation rates in DNA or proteins to estimate when two species last shared a common ancestor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can molecular evidence confirm fossil evidence?",
        "options": [
          "Both show similar evolutionary trees",
          "Both provide exact dates",
          "Both reveal behavior directly",
          "Both come from the same sources"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When molecular data (DNA/protein similarities) and morphological data (fossils/anatomy) produce similar phylogenetic trees, they reinforce each other as evidence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might unexpected molecular similarities suggest?",
        "options": [
          "Closer relationship than anatomy shows",
          "That DNA analysis is flawed",
          "Identical environments always",
          "Convergent evolution at molecular level"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sometimes DNA reveals close relationships not obvious from anatomy (e.g., whales being closely related to hippos), correcting earlier classifications."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is ribosomal RNA (rRNA) often used in molecular studies?",
        "options": [
          "It is present in all living things",
          "It codes for physical traits",
          "It mutates very rapidly",
          "It is easy to see under microscopes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "rRNA genes are found in all cellular life, are essential for protein synthesis, and evolve slowly enough to compare even very different organisms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do pseudogenes provide evolutionary evidence?",
        "options": [
          "They accumulate mutations without function",
          "They code for new adaptations",
          "They are identical across species",
          "They prevent further evolution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pseudogenes are non-functional DNA copies of genes. Their similar mutation patterns in related species show common ancestry (e.g., vitamin C pseudogene in primates)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What limitation exists in molecular evidence?",
        "options": [
          "It doesn't work for extinct species without DNA",
          "It cannot compare different organisms",
          "It always contradicts fossil evidence",
          "It only works for animals, not plants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While powerful, molecular evidence requires preserved DNA or proteins, which are rarely available from fossils more than a million years old."
