    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which common name is used to describe the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "Calvin cycle",
          "Krebs cycle",
          "Citric acid cycle",
          "Glycolysis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Named after Melvin Calvin, the Calvin cycle is the chemical pathway that 'fixes' carbon from the atmosphere into organic molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where specifically within the chloroplast do the light-independent reactions take place?",
        "options": [
          "In the stroma",
          "In the thylakoid membranes",
          "Inside the thylakoid lumen",
          "Between the inner and outer membranes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The stroma is the fluid-filled space surrounding the grana. It contains the aqueous environment and enzymes necessary for the Calvin cycle to function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary biological objective of the Calvin cycle?",
        "options": [
          "To produce stable glucose using $CO_2$, ATP, and NADPH",
          "To capture photons and generate temporary ATP",
          "To split water molecules to release oxygen gas",
          "To transport high-energy electrons to the mitochondria"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Calvin cycle is the 'synthesis' part of photosynthesis, taking inorganic carbon and assembling it into high-energy sugar molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of biology, what does 'carbon fixation' refer to?",
        "options": [
          "Incorporating inorganic $CO_2$ into organic sugar molecules",
          "Breaking down glucose to release carbon dioxide",
          "Converting carbon atoms into oxygen atoms",
          "Attaching carbon atoms to the chlorophyll pigment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fixation is the process of 'fixing' a gas into a solid, usable form. In this case, gas-phase carbon dioxide is turned into solid carbohydrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following serves as the required inputs for the Calvin cycle?",
        "options": [
          "$CO_2$, ATP, and NADPH",
          "Light, $H_2O$, and $CO_2$",
          "Oxygen, Glucose, and ADP",
          "Chlorophyll, $O_2$, and Photons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cycle requires carbon (from $CO_2$), energy (from ATP), and reducing power/electrons (from NADPH) to build glucose."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the primary products (outputs) of the light-independent reactions?",
        "options": [
          "Glucose (G3P), ADP, and NADP$^+$",
          "Oxygen, ATP, and NADPH",
          "Water, Light energy, and $CO_2$",
          "Starch, Chlorophyll, and Pyruvate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cycle produces a 3-carbon sugar (G3P) used to make glucose, while sending 'empty' energy carriers (ADP and NADP$^+$) back to the light reactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the term 'light-independent' slightly misleading for these reactions?",
        "options": [
          "They rely on ATP and NADPH produced by light-dependent reactions",
          "They only occur in the total absence of light",
          "They produce light energy that the plant then re-absorbs",
          "They require green light to activate the enzymes in the stroma"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While they don't use photons directly, they cannot continue for long without the constant supply of ATP and NADPH generated during the light-dependent phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the ATP and NADPH after they are used in the Calvin cycle?",
        "options": [
          "They return to the thylakoids as ADP and NADP$^+$ to be recharged",
          "They are stored in the vacuole for the plant to use at night",
          "They are released as waste products through the leaf stomata",
          "They are converted into glucose molecules themselves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Calvin cycle 'spends' the energy. The resulting 'empty' ADP and NADP$^+$ molecules are recycled back to the light-dependent reactions to be energized again."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Mathematically, how many turns of the Calvin cycle are required to fix enough carbon for one molecule of glucose?",
        "options": [
          "6 turns",
          "1 turn",
          "3 turns",
          "12 turns"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each turn fixes one molecule of $CO_2$ (one carbon atom). Since glucose has six carbon atoms ($C_6H_{12}O_6$), six turns are needed to produce one glucose molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the relationship between the two stages of photosynthesis?",
        "options": [
          "They are a coupled cycle where the products of one power the other",
          "They are completely independent and happen in different organelles",
          "The Calvin cycle must finish before the light reactions can begin",
          "The light reactions produce sugar, which the Calvin cycle then breaks down"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a perfect example of metabolic cooperation: the light reactions provide the fuel, and the Calvin cycle uses that fuel to build the product (sugar)."
