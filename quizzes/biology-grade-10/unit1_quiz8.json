    "subtitle": "1.8 Saturated vs Unsaturated Fats",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Biochemical Molecules",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary structural characteristic of a saturated fatty acid?",
        "options": [
          "It contains only single bonds between carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain",
          "It contains at least one double bond between carbon atoms in the chain",
          "It possesses a significant kink or bend within its hydrocarbon tail",
          "It is composed of a closed ring structure rather than a linear chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Saturated fats are 'saturated' with hydrogen atoms because there are no double bonds between carbons, allowing the maximum number of hydrogens to bond to the carbon skeleton."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are unsaturated fats typically liquid at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Double bonds create kinks that prevent the molecules from packing closely together",
          "They have significantly shorter carbon chains than most common saturated fats",
          "They are highly polar molecules that dissolve in atmospheric water moisture",
          "The lack of hydrogen atoms makes the molecules lighter and less physically dense"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $C=C$ double bonds (usually in cis-configuration) create bends in the fatty acid tails, preventing them from solidifying at room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common source of saturated fats?",
        "options": [
          "Animal fats such as butter and lard",
          "Vegetable oils such as olive oil",
          "Fish oils containing omega-3",
          "Nut oils like almond or walnut oil"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most animal fats are saturated, which allows them to pack tightly and remain solid at room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'polyunsaturated' fatty acid?",
        "options": [
          "A fatty acid with two or more carbon-carbon double bonds",
          "A fatty acid that has been artificially hardened via heating",
          "A fatty acid containing multiple branched glycerol backbones",
          "A fatty acid that is saturated with several different elements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The prefix 'poly-' means many; polyunsaturated fats have multiple double bonds in their hydrocarbon chains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the consumption of trans-fats generally affect human health?",
        "options": [
          "They increase 'bad' cholesterol (LDL) and decrease 'good' cholesterol (HDL)",
          "They provide essential vitamins that the human body cannot produce naturally",
          "They improve cardiovascular health by thinning the blood within the arteries",
          "They are much easier for the body to digest than natural saturated fat types"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Trans-fats, often created through industrial hydrogenation, are associated with a significant increase in the risk of coronary heart disease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'cis' unsaturated fatty acid, where are the hydrogen atoms located relative to the double bond?",
        "options": [
          "On the same side of the carbon chain",
          "On opposite sides of the carbon chain",
          "They are completely removed from the area",
          "They are bonded to the glycerol backbone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the cis-configuration, hydrogens are on the same side, which creates the physical repulsion that causes the chain to bend or 'kink'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the process of 'hydrogenation' used for in the food industry?",
        "options": [
          "Converting unsaturated liquid oils into solid fats by adding hydrogen",
          "Breaking down triglycerides into separate glycerol and fatty acid units",
          "Adding water molecules to fats to make them lower in total calories",
          "Removing carbon atoms to make the fats more soluble in polar liquids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogenation synthetically adds hydrogen to unsaturated bonds to make them saturated (or trans-unsaturated), increasing shelf life and changing texture (e.g., margarine)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which fat type is generally considered the healthiest for cardiovascular function?",
        "options": [
          "Unsaturated fats",
          "Saturated fats",
          "Trans-fats",
          "Synthetic fats"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated (like Omega-3), are linked to improved heart health and lower cholesterol levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the molecular shape of a saturated fatty acid?",
        "options": [
          "Straight and linear",
          "Bent at a 90-degree angle",
          "A closed circular ring",
          "A complex branching structure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because there are no double bonds to cause kinks, saturated fatty acids are straight, allowing them to stack efficiently."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monounsaturated fatty acid contains how many double bonds?",
        "options": [
          "1",
          "0",
          "2",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The prefix 'mono-' indicates that the fatty acid contains exactly one carbon-carbon double bond."
