          "Peptide bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak hydrogen bonds form between the complementary base pairs. While weak individually, the thousands of bonds together provide significant stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many hydrogen bonds form between an Adenine (A) and a Thymine (T) base pair?",

          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adenine and Thymine are held together by two hydrogen bonds, whereas Guanine and Cytosine are held together by three."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What components make up the 'uprights' or 'backbone' of the DNA ladder structure?",
        "options": [
          "Alternating deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups",
          "Alternating nitrogenous bases and hydrogen bonds",
          "Chains of amino acids and R-groups",
          "Pairs of purines and pyrimidines"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The outer rails of the DNA molecule are formed by strong covalent phosphodiester bonds between sugars and phosphates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a DNA sample is found to contain 20% Adenine, what percentage of the sample must be Thymine?",
        "options": [
          "20%",
          "30%",
          "80%",
          "40%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because Adenine always pairs with Thymine, their concentrations in a double-stranded DNA molecule must be equal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scientists are credited with discovering the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953?",
        "options": [
          "James Watson and Francis Crick",
          "Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin",

          "Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Watson and Crick proposed the double-helix model, largely based on X-ray diffraction data collected by Rosalind Franklin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where are the nitrogenous bases located in the double helix structure?",
        "options": [
          "Tucked into the center, away from the surrounding water",
          "On the very outside of the sugar-phosphate backbone",
          "Scattered randomly throughout the cytoplasm",
          "Attached only to the $$5'$$ end of the molecule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hydrophobic nitrogenous bases are oriented toward the interior of the helix, shielded by the hydrophilic sugar-phosphate backbone."
      },
      {

        "question": "What is the significance of the specific sequence of base pairs along the DNA molecule?",
        "options": [
          "It constitutes the genetic code for building proteins",
          "It determines the total weight of the cell",
          "It controls the temperature at which the DNA melts",
          "It allows the DNA to dissolve in lipids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The order of the bases (A, T, C, G) acts as a digital code that the cell's machinery reads to assemble amino acids in the correct order for proteins."
