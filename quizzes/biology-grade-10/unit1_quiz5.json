        "question": "What is the primary structural difference between starch and cellulose?",
        "options": [
          "Starch is made of alpha-glucose, while cellulose is made of beta-glucose",
          "Starch contains nitrogen groups, while cellulose contains only oxygen",
          "Starch is a complex polymer, while cellulose is a simple monomer unit",
          "Starch is found in animal tissue, while cellulose is found in plants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The orientation of the glycosidic bonds (alpha vs. beta) changes the molecular shape, making cellulose linear and starch helical."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chitin is a structural polysaccharide similar to cellulose but contains nitrogen-containing appendages on the glucose units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can humans digest starch but not cellulose (fiber)?",
        "options": [
          "Humans lack enzymes that can break the beta-glycosidic linkages in cellulose",
          "Cellulose is too large to fit within the acidic environment of the stomach",
          "Starch is soluble in water, while cellulose acts as a permanent insulator",
          "Cellulose contains toxic nitrogen groups that inhibit metabolic digestion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amylase breaks alpha-linkages in starch, but humans do not produce cellulase to break the beta-linkages in cellulose."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes amylopectin?",
        "options": [
          "A branched chain of glucose found in starch",
          "An unbranched chain of glucose found in starch",
          "A structural sugar found in insect exoskeletons",
          "The primary monomer used to build glycogen units"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Starch consists of two types of molecules: unbranched amylose and branched amylopectin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the solubility of glucose when it is converted into a large polysaccharide like starch?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes much less soluble, making it better for storage",
          "It becomes much more soluble in aqueous cellular environments",
          "It becomes a combustible gas at standard body temperatures",
          "Its chemical solubility remains identical to the monomer form"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polysaccharides are large and often insoluble, which prevents them from affecting the osmotic balance of the cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the branching of glycogen relate to its function in animals?",
        "options": [
          "It allows for faster release of glucose during exercise",
          "It makes the molecule stronger for internal skeletal support",
          "It prevents the molecule from being digested by gut bacteria",
          "It allows the molecule to store complex genetic information"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Extensive branching provides more ends for enzymes to work on, allowing for the rapid breakdown of glycogen into glucose when energy is needed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'strength' of cellulose comes from which type of inter-molecular interaction?",

          "Hydrogen bonding between parallel chains",
          "Ionic bonding between glucose units",
          "Covalent bonding between different cell walls",
          "Metallic bonding within the fiber"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen bonds form between the hydroxyl groups of parallel cellulose molecules, grouping them into strong microfibrils."
