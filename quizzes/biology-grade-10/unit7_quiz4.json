    "subtitle": "7.4 Natural Selection Principles",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Darwin's Core Concepts",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first principle of natural selection?",
        "options": [
          "Variation exists in populations",
          "All individuals survive equally",
          "Traits are not inherited",
          "Resources are unlimited"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Individuals in a population vary in their traits (size, color, speed, etc.). Without variation, natural selection cannot occur."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'heritability' mean in natural selection?",
        "options": [
          "Traits can be passed to offspring",
          "All traits are environmentally caused",
          "Mutations never affect traits",
          "Only strong traits are inherited"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For natural selection to work, variations must be heritable—passed from parents to offspring through genes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is overproduction of offspring?",
        "options": [
          "More offspring are produced than can survive",
          "All offspring survive to adulthood",
          "Parents produce exactly enough offspring",
          "Only the strongest offspring are born"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most species produce more offspring than the environment can support, leading to competition for limited resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is differential survival and reproduction?",
        "options": [
          "Individuals with advantageous traits survive and reproduce more",
          "All individuals reproduce equally",
          "Only the largest individuals survive",
          "Survival is completely random"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and pass those traits to the next generation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which best describes natural selection?",
        "options": [
          "Non-random differential reproduction",
          "Random survival of all individuals",
          "Deliberate choice by organisms",
          "Sudden change in all traits"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural selection is non-random because traits affecting survival/reproduction are not random—but the genetic variations arise randomly through mutation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of natural selection over time?",
        "options": [
          "Adaptation to the environment",
          "All individuals become identical",
          "Evolution stops completely",
          "Random traits accumulate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Over generations, advantageous traits become more common, making the population better adapted to its environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What did Darwin observe about finches on the Galapagos?",
        "options": [
          "Beak shapes matched food sources",
          "All finches had identical beaks",
          "Beak size changed randomly daily",
          "Finches deliberately shaped their beaks"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Different islands had different seeds; finch populations evolved beak shapes suited to their local food sources—a classic example of natural selection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does natural selection relate to evolution?",
        "options": [
          "It is a mechanism that drives evolution",
          "It prevents evolution from occurring",
          "It is the same as evolution",
          "It works against evolutionary change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural selection is one mechanism (along with genetic drift, gene flow, mutation) that causes evolution—changes in allele frequencies over generations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is required for natural selection to act?",
        "options": [
          "Variation, heritability, and differential fitness",
          "Identical traits in all individuals",
          "Unlimited resources for everyone",
          "No competition between organisms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural selection requires: 1) variation in traits, 2) heritability of those traits, 3) differential survival/reproduction based on traits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What misconception do people often have about natural selection?",
        "options": [
          "That organisms 'try' to evolve",
          "That it produces perfect organisms",
          "That it always favors the biggest",
          "That it works very rapidly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural selection doesn't involve intention. Random mutations create variation; the environment 'selects' among existing traits—no planning or 'trying' is involved."
