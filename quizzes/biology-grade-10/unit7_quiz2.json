    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are homologous structures?",
        "options": [
          "Similar structures from common ancestry",
          "Structures with identical functions",
          "Parts that develop at the same time",
          "Organs that look exactly alike"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homologous structures (like human arms, bat wings, whale flippers) have similar anatomy from common ancestry but may serve different functions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What do homologous structures suggest about organisms?",
        "options": [
          "They share a common ancestor",
          "They live in similar environments",
          "They have identical DNA sequences",
          "They evolved at the same time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homologous structures indicate evolutionary relationships—similar underlying anatomy implies descent from a shared ancestor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are analogous structures?",
        "options": [
          "Similar functions but different origins",
          "Identical structures in all animals",
          "Structures that are no longer used",
          "Parts that develop from same tissue"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Analogous structures (like bird wings and insect wings) perform similar functions but evolved independently, often in unrelated species facing similar environmental challenges."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What causes analogous structures to evolve?",
        "options": [
          "Convergent evolution",
          "Common descent",
          "Genetic drift",
          "Horizontal gene transfer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convergent evolution produces analogous structures when unrelated species adapt similarly to comparable environments (e.g., wings for flight, streamlined shapes for swimming)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are vestigial structures?",
        "options": [
          "Reduced remnants of functional ancestors",
          "Newly evolved body parts",
          "Structures used for multiple purposes",
          "Organs that grow larger over time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vestigial structures (human appendix, whale pelvis) are remnants of features that were functional in ancestors but have reduced or changed function in descendants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do vestigial structures support evolution?",
        "options": [
          "They show descent with modification",
          "They prove all structures are useful",
          "They indicate perfect adaptation",
          "They demonstrate rapid change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vestigial structures make sense if organisms evolved from ancestors where these structures were functional, not if each species was independently created."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is an example of homologous structures?",
        "options": [
          "Human arm and bat wing",
          "Bird wing and butterfly wing",
          "Dolphin fin and shark fin",
          "Plant leaf and cactus spine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Human arms and bat wings share the same bone arrangement (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, phalanges) from a common mammalian ancestor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does comparative embryology reveal?",
        "options": [
          "Similar early development in related species",
          "Exact adult forms in embryos",
          "When species diverged in time",
          "How environments affect development"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Closely related species often have similar embryonic stages (like pharyngeal pouches in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals), suggesting common ancestry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does comparative anatomy differ from molecular evidence?",
        "options": [
          "It compares physical structures, not DNA",
          "It is less reliable than DNA evidence",
          "It only works for extinct species",
          "It ignores evolutionary relationships"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Comparative anatomy examines morphological (structural) similarities, while molecular evidence compares DNA or protein sequences. Both provide independent lines of evidence for evolution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What pattern would suggest two species are NOT closely related?",
        "options": [
          "Analogous structures only",
          "Many homologous structures",
          "Similar embryonic development",
          "Identical bone arrangements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If species share only analogous structures (similar functions but different origins), they likely adapted independently to similar environments rather than sharing recent common ancestry."
