        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers stored in synaptic vesicles that are released into the synaptic cleft to transmit signals to the next cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when an action potential reaches the synaptic terminal?",
        "options": [
          "Voltage-gated calcium channels open, triggering exocytosis",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Voltage-gated calcium channels open, Ca²⁺ influx causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing neurotransmitters by exocytosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What binds neurotransmitters on the postsynaptic cell?",

          "Proteins embedded within the layers of the myelin sheath",
          "Phospholipid bilayers of the mitochondrial membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Neurotransmitters bind to complementary receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane, either opening ion channels directly or activating second messenger systems."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)?",
        "options": [
          "A graded depolarization that makes firing an action potential more likely",
          "A hyperpolarization that significantly inhibits neural firing",
          "the maintenance of a stable resting potential in the neuron",
          "The temporary refractory period occurring after an impulse"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "EPSPs are graded depolarizations (e.g., from glutamate binding) that bring the postsynaptic neuron closer to threshold, increasing the chance of an action potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP)?",
        "options": [
          "A hyperpolarization that moves the membrane further from threshold",
          "A rapid depolarization that triggers spontaneous action potentials",
          "The maximum positive voltage peak of an electrical impulse",
          "The baseline activity of the sodium-potassium exchange pump"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IPSPs are graded hyperpolarizations (e.g., from GABA or glycine) that move the membrane potential away from threshold, reducing the chance of firing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are neurotransmitters removed from the synaptic cleft?",

          "Permanent integration into the postsynaptic membrane",
          "Conversion into myelin proteins by nearby glial cells",
          "Direct absorption into the capillaries of the vascular system"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Termination methods include: reuptake into presynaptic neuron, enzymatic degradation (e.g., acetylcholinesterase), or diffusion away—preventing continuous stimulation."
      },
      {

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temporal summation (rapid signals from one source) and spatial summation (signals from multiple sources) combine EPSPs and IPSPs to determine if threshold is reached."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What distinguishes electrical synapses from chemical synapses?",
        "options": [
          "Direct cytoplasmic connections facilitate ion flow via gap junctions",
          "They rely exclusively on the release of specialized neurotransmitters",
          "They exhibit a significantly slower rate of signal transmission",
          "They require the presence of calcium-dependent vesicle exocytosis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrical synapses allow direct ion flow between cells through gap junctions, enabling faster, bidirectional communication (e.g., in heart muscle, some brain regions)."
