          "Three glycerols and one fatty acid",
          "One glucose and three fatty acids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A triglyceride is formed by joining a single glycerol 'backbone' to three fatty acid chains through dehydration synthesis."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the specific covalent bond formed between glycerol and a fatty acid?",

          "Phosphodiester bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An ester linkage forms when the hydroxyl group ($-OH$) of glycerol reacts with the carboxyl group ($-COOH$) of a fatty acid."

          "3",

          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since a triglyceride involves the formation of three ester bonds (one for each fatty acid), three molecules of water are removed during the dehydration synthesis process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which functional group is found at the end of a fatty acid chain and allows it to bond with glycerol?",

          "Hydroxyl group ($-OH$)",
          "Amino group ($-NH_2$)",
          "Phosphate group ($-PO_4$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carboxyl group at the 'head' of the fatty acid is acidic and reactive, allowing it to bond to the glycerol molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the chemical structure of glycerol, the backbone of a triglyceride?",
        "options": [
          "A three-carbon alcohol with three hydroxyl groups",
          "A six-carbon sugar ring with multiple oxygen atoms",
          "A long hydrocarbon chain of 16-18 carbon molecules",
          "A nitrogenous base connected to a phosphate group"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glycerol is a simple 3-carbon molecule $(C_3H_8O_3)$ where each carbon is bonded to a hydroxyl group ($-OH$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary biological function of triglycerides in adipose tissue?",
        "options": [
          "Long-term energy storage",
          "Formation of the lipid bilayer in cell membranes",
          "Transmission of genetic information",
          "Immediate transport of glucose to the brain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Triglycerides are the main form of stored energy in animals. They are packed into fat cells (adipocytes) for use when food intake is low."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the structure of a triglyceride contribute to its hydrophobicity?",
        "options": [
          "The long hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acids are non-polar",
          "The glycerol backbone carries a strong positive ionic charge",
          "The ester linkages react aggressively with water molecules",
          "The molecule contains too many oxygen atoms to allow dissolution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The bulk of the molecule consists of long C-H chains. These are non-polar and do not form hydrogen bonds with water, making the entire molecule insoluble."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the process of digestion, which enzyme is responsible for breaking triglycerides back down into glycerol and fatty acids?",
        "options": [
          "Lipase",
          "Amylase",
          "Protease",
          "Nuclease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lipases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of triglycerides, breaking the ester bonds by adding water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'fatty acid'?",
        "options": [
          "A long hydrocarbon chain with a terminal carboxyl group",
          "A ring of six carbon atoms with alternating double bonds",
          "A chain of polar amino acids linked by peptide bonds",
          "A phosphate group attached to a five-carbon pentose sugar"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fatty acids consist of a hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail and a hydrophilic carboxylic acid head."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are triglycerides more efficient than glycogen for long-term energy storage in mobile animals?",
        "options": [
          "They store more energy per gram and are stored without water weight",
          "They can be converted to glucose much faster than branched glycogen",
          "They are much smaller molecules and easier to transport in the blood",
          "They provide structural support for the skeleton as well as energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Triglycerides are anhydrous (don't bind to water) and have a higher energy density, meaning animals can carry more energy with less physical bulk/weight."
