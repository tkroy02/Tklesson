          "Creating new habitats for endangered species"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Habitat fragmentation occurs when human activities (roads, agriculture, urbanization) divide continuous habitat into smaller pieces, creating 'islands' that isolate populations."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the term 'invasive species' mean?",
        "options": [
          "Non-native species that cause harm in new environments",
          "Any species that migrates seasonally between habitats",

          "All introduced species, regardless of their impact"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Invasive species are introduced (often accidentally) to new areas where they lack natural predators/controls, outcompete natives, and disrupt ecosystems."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is sustainable development?",
        "options": [

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sustainable development balances environmental protection, economic growth, and social equity for long-term human and ecological wellbeing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is biological magnification (biomagnification)?",
        "options": [
          "Toxic substances concentrate up food chains",
          "Species become larger over evolutionary time scales",
          "Populations grow exponentially without any limits",
          "Genetic diversity increases in heavily polluted areas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Persistent toxins (DDT, mercury, PCBs) accumulate in organisms' tissues, becoming more concentrated at each trophic level, affecting top predators most severely."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of a wildlife corridor?",
        "options": [
          "Connect fragmented habitats to allow species movement",
          "Provide viewing areas for tourists to see wildlife",
          "Fence off protected areas from all human access",
          "Direct animals away from human settlements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Corridors (greenways, underpasses, forest strips) enable gene flow between isolated populations, reducing inbreeding and supporting migration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main goal of captive breeding programs?",
        "options": [
          "Maintain diverse populations for eventual reintroduction",
          "Create new domesticated animal breeds for farms",
          "Produce animals specifically for zoos and entertainment",
          "Replace wild populations entirely with captive ones"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Captive breeding preserves endangered species when wild populations are critically low, with the aim of reintroducing them to restored habitats."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the term 'ecological footprint' measure?",
        "options": [
          "Human demand on Earth's ecosystems",
          "The size of animal territories in the wild",
          "The area needed for a single species' survival",
          "The physical depth of plant roots in the soil"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ecological footprint calculates the land and water area required to produce resources consumed and absorb wastes generated by a population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the tragedy of the commons?",
        "options": [
          "Individuals overuse shared resources for personal gain",
          "Natural disasters that affect common property",
          "When conservation efforts fail despite good intentions",
          "The inevitable extinction of all species on Earth"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This economic concept explains why shared resources (oceans, atmosphere, public lands) are often overexploited when individuals act in self-interest without regulation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most effective approach to biodiversity conservation?",
        "options": [
          "Protecting intact ecosystems and restoring degraded ones",
          "Only focusing on large, charismatic megafauna",
          "Moving all endangered species into captive zoos",
          "Creating environmental laws without any enforcement"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In-situ conservation (protecting species in their natural habitats) preserves ecological relationships and evolutionary processes more effectively than ex-situ methods alone."
