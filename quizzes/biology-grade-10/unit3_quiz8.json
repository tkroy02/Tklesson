    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary biological purpose of cellular respiration?",
        "options": [
          "To convert chemical energy from food into usable ATP (energy)",
          "To generate oxygen gas as a byproduct for other cells",
          "To synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water molecules",
          "To store extra energy by converting ATP into ADP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cellular respiration is the metabolic process cells use to convert the chemical energy stored in nutrients (like glucose) into Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy currency of life."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these represents the correct overall equation for aerobic cellular respiration?",
        "options": [
          "Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water + ATP",
          "Carbon Dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Glucose + Oxygen",
          "Glucose → Lactic Acid + ATP + Carbon Dioxide",
          "Oxygen + Water → Carbon Dioxide + Glucose + ATP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aerobic respiration involves the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen to yield carbon dioxide, water, and a high amount of ATP energy. It is chemically the opposite of photosynthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which eukaryotic organelle does the majority of aerobic respiration take place?",
        "options": [
          "Mitochondria",
          "Nucleus",
          "Ribosomes",
          "Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the initial step (glycolysis) occurs in the cytoplasm, the Krebs Cycle and the Electron Transport Chain—which produce the most ATP—occur within the mitochondria."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the three main stages of aerobic cellular respiration in the correct chronological order?",
        "options": [
          "Glycolysis → Krebs Cycle → Electron Transport Chain",
          "Krebs Cycle → Glycolysis → Electron Transport Chain",
          "Electron Transport Chain → Krebs Cycle → Glycolysis",
          "Glycolysis → Electron Transport Chain → Krebs Cycle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glucose is first broken down in the cytoplasm (Glycolysis), processed further in the mitochondrial matrix (Krebs Cycle), and finally used to generate mass ATP in the inner membrane (ETC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule serves as the primary and most common fuel source for cellular respiration?",
        "options": [
          "Glucose",
          "Amino acids",
          "Lipids",
          "Nucleic acids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Although cells can metabolize fats and proteins, glucose (a simple sugar) is the most efficient and preferred starting molecule for the respiratory pathway."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the specific role of oxygen ($$O_2$$) during aerobic respiration?",
        "options": [
          "It acts as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain",
          "It provides the initial spark of energy to break the glucose bonds",
          "It is converted directly into glucose during the Krebs Cycle",
          "It is used to transport ATP molecules out of the mitochondria"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen is essential because it pulls electrons through the transport chain. Without oxygen, the chain stops, and the cell cannot produce large amounts of ATP."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the six carbon atoms originally found in a glucose molecule during respiration?",
        "options": [
          "They are released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide ($$CO_2$$)",
          "They are converted into oxygen atoms to be used by the cell",
          "They are incorporated into the structure of the new ATP molecules",
          "They are fused together to form a larger starch molecule for storage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As glucose is broken down, the carbon atoms are removed step-by-step and combined with oxygen to form $$CO_2$$, which is then exhaled by the organism."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is cellular respiration considered essential for the survival of all living organisms?",
        "options": [
          "It provides the ATP energy required for all cellular activities and repair",
          "It is the only process that can remove water from the cell's environment",
          "It prevents the cell from absorbing too much oxygen from the air",
          "It allows cells to move without needing any form of energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Every cellular process—from muscle contraction and active transport to DNA replication—requires energy. Without respiration, cells have no way to power these life-sustaining tasks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the relationship between physiological breathing and cellular respiration?",
        "options": [
          "Breathing provides the oxygen gas required for cellular respiration to occur",
          "They are identical chemical processes occurring in different parts of the body",
          "Breathing produces ATP, while cellular respiration produces the oxygen we need",
          "There is no functional relationship between gas exchange and energy production"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Breathing (ventilation) is the mechanical process of gas exchange that brings in the oxygen needed for cellular respiration and removes the carbon dioxide waste produced by it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would be the most likely result if cellular respiration were to suddenly stop in a human body?",
        "options": [
          "Immediate cell death due to a total lack of ATP energy",
          "The body would shift to using sunlight to produce energy indefinitely",
          "Cells would continue to function normally using stored heat",
          "Only the brain cells would stop working, while other organs would continue"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because cells cannot store large amounts of ATP, they must produce it constantly. If respiration stops, energy-dependent processes fail immediately, leading to organism death."
