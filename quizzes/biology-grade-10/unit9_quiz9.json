        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Biodiversity encompasses genetic diversity within species, species diversity in communities, and ecosystem diversity across landscapes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the three main levels of biodiversity?",
        "options": [
          "Genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Genetic diversity (within species), species diversity (number and abundance of species), and ecosystem diversity (variety of habitats and ecological processes)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is genetic diversity important for species survival?",
        "options": [
          "Provides raw material for adaptation to changing environments",
          "Makes species look more physically distinct for researchers",
          "Only matters for artificial breeding and agricultural purposes",
          "Has no real significance in natural ecological processes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Genetic variation allows populations to adapt to environmental changes, resist diseases, and avoid inbreeding depression that reduces fitness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an endemic species?",
        "options": [
          "A species found only in one specific geographic area",
          "A species that is currently on the brink of extinction",
          "A species that lives in almost every region in the world",
          "A species that was recently introduced from another region"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Endemic species have restricted ranges (islands, mountain tops, isolated lakes) and are particularly vulnerable to extinction from habitat loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a biodiversity hotspot refer to?",
        "options": [
          "A region with high species richness and high threat from humans",
          "Any area with a warm climate and many common species",
          "A place where new species are discovered on a daily basis",
          "Scientific laboratories where global biodiversity is studied"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hotspots contain at least 1,500 endemic plant species and have lost at least 70% of original habitat. They're conservation priorities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are ecosystem services?",
        "options": [
          "Benefits humans receive from healthy ecosystems",
          "The fees paid by tourists to visit national parks",
          "Services provided by global environmental organizations",
          "The calculated economic value of already extinct species"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ecosystem services include provisioning (food, water), regulating (climate, flood control), supporting (nutrient cycling), and cultural (recreation, spiritual) benefits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does biodiversity increase ecosystem stability?",
        "options": [
          "More species provide functional redundancy and resilience",
          "It decreases stability by increasing internal competition",
          "Only total species number matters, not their specific roles",
          "Stability comes from abiotic factors rather than biodiversity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diverse ecosystems have multiple species performing similar functions (redundancy), so if one species declines, others can maintain ecosystem processes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between species richness and species evenness?",
        "options": [
          "Richness: number of species; Evenness: relative abundance",
          "Richness: total abundance; Evenness: spatial distribution",
          "They are identical measurements of community health",
          "Richness: ecosystem types; Evenness: genetic diversity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Richness counts how many different species. Evenness measures how equally individuals are distributed among those species."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are keystone species crucial for biodiversity?",
        "options": [
          "Their activities maintain the structure of their communities",
          "They are always the most abundant species in the habitat",
          "They possess the largest genetic diversity of any species",
          "They represent ancient and unchanging evolutionary lineages"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Keystone species (like sea otters, elephants, coral) disproportionately influence ecosystems - their loss often triggers cascading extinctions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the current rate of species extinction compared to background rates?",
        "options": [
          "100-1000 times faster than natural background rates",
          "About the same as the natural background extinction rates",
          "Significantly slower than historical background rates",
          "Extinction no longer occurs naturally without human help"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Human activities (habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, overexploitation) are causing the sixth mass extinction event in Earth's history."
