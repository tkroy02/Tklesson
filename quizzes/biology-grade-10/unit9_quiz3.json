        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies specific to antigens, providing humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two main types of T cells and their respective functions?",
        "options": [
          "Helper T cells (activate immune cells) and Cytotoxic T cells (kill infected cells)",
          "Memory T cells (store information) and Plasma T cells (produce antibodies)",
          "Suppressor T cells (cause inflammation) and Regulatory T cells (engulf pathogens)",
          "All T cells perform identical functions across the body"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helper T cells (CD4+) activate B cells and other immune cells. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) directly kill virus-infected or cancerous cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What defines 'immunological memory' in the specific immune system?",
        "options": [
          "The ability to respond faster and stronger to previously encountered pathogens",
          "The brain's conscious memory of past sicknesses and symptoms",
          "A physical archive of all pathogens stored inside the liver",
          "The innate immune system's general reaction to any bacteria"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Memory B and T cells persist after an infection, enabling a rapid, robust response upon re-exposure to the same pathogen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between primary and secondary immune responses?",
        "options": [
          "Primary: slower and weaker; Secondary: faster and stronger due to memory cells",
          "Primary: involves only T cells; Secondary: involves only B cells",
          "Primary: is a specific response; Secondary: is a non-specific response",
          "Primary: is an innate response; Secondary: is an adaptive response"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First exposure (primary) has a lag period. Subsequent exposure (secondary) is rapid with high antibody levels because of existing memory cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an antigen?",
        "options": [
          "A specific molecule that triggers an immune response",
          "A type of white blood cell that hunts bacteria",
          "A protein produced by the body to neutralize viruses",
          "A hormone that coordinates the fever response"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Antigens are foreign proteins or polysaccharides on pathogens' surfaces recognized by specific antibodies or T cell receptors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the function of the MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex)?",
        "options": [
          "Self-identification markers on cells that present antigens to T cells",
          "Antibodies that physically mark pathogens for destruction",
          "Enzymes that directly digest the cell walls of bacteria",
          "Hormones that signal the bone marrow to produce more B cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MHC molecules on cell surfaces display peptide fragments for inspection by T cells to distinguish 'self' from 'non-self'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do Helper T cells coordinate the immune response?",
        "options": [
          "They secrete cytokines that activate B cells and Cytotoxic T cells",
          "They directly manufacture and release antibodies into the blood",
          "They act as physical barriers to prevent viral attachment to cells",
          "They suppress all other immune activity to prevent inflammation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helper T cells are the coordinators; their cytokine signals direct and amplify both humoral and cell-mediated responses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the key advantage of adaptive over innate immunity?",
        "options": [
          "Precision through specificity and the creation of immunological memory",
          "A much faster initial response time during the first hour of infection",
          "A lower overall energy and metabolic requirement for the body",
          "A simpler mechanism that requires significantly fewer cell types"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adaptive immunity targets specific pathogens precisely and remembers them for faster future protection, although it takes longer to develop initially."
