    "subtitle": "6.2 DNA Replication",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "DNA Copying Process",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must DNA replicate before cell division?",
        "options": [
          "So each daughter cell gets a complete set of genetic instructions",
          "To ensure phenotypic variation between the resulting daughter cells",
          "To provide the necessary raw materials for immediate protein synthesis",
          "To actively repair mutations present in the original parent sequence"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Before a cell divides (mitosis or meiosis), it must copy its DNA so that each new cell has a complete, identical set of genetic instructions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'semi-conservative' replication mean?",
        "options": [
          "Each new DNA molecule has one old strand and one new strand",
          "Only half of the total genomic sequence is copied during each cycle",
          "The process occurs slowly to conserve cellular metabolic energy",
          "New DNA molecules are constructed entirely from recycled nucleotides"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In semi-conservative replication, the original DNA strands separate, and each serves as a template for a new complementary strand. Each daughter DNA molecule contains one original strand and one new strand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which enzyme unwinds the DNA double helix at the start of replication?",
        "options": [
          "Helicase",
          "DNA polymerase",
          "Ligase",
          "Primase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Helicase is the enzyme that unwinds and separates the two DNA strands by breaking the hydrogen bonds between bases, creating a replication fork."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main function of DNA polymerase?",
        "options": [
          "Adds new nucleotides to build the new DNA strand",
          "Unwinds the double helix structure by breaking hydrogen bonds",
          "Catalyzes the formation of bonds between Okazaki fragments",
          "Synthesizes short RNA sequences to initiate the copying process"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA polymerase reads the template strand and adds complementary nucleotides to build the new DNA strand. It also proofreads to correct errors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are primers needed for DNA replication?",
        "options": [
          "DNA polymerase needs a starting point to begin adding nucleotides",
          "To chemically signal the exact termination point of replication",
          "To prevent the parent strands from reannealing during the process",
          "To increase the overall velocity of the nucleotide assembly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA polymerase cannot start a new strand from scratch. Primase makes short RNA primers that provide a 3' end for DNA polymerase to begin adding DNA nucleotides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between leading and lagging strands?",
        "options": [
          "Leading strand is continuous; lagging strand is in fragments",
          "Leading strand is synthesized faster than the lagging strand",
          "Leading strand utilizes an entirely different set of enzymes",
          "Leading strand exhibits a higher degree of replication accuracy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The leading strand is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork. The lagging strand is synthesized away from the fork in short Okazaki fragments that are later joined."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are Okazaki fragments?",
        "options": [
          "Short DNA segments synthesized on the lagging strand",
          "RNA sequences used to initiate the replication process",
          "Segments of parental DNA that are degraded and recycled",
          "Nucleotide errors that occur due to DNA polymerase slippage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Okazaki fragments are short segments of DNA synthesized on the lagging strand. They are later joined together by DNA ligase to form a continuous strand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which enzyme joins Okazaki fragments together?",
        "options": [
          "DNA ligase",
          "DNA polymerase",
          "Helicase",
          "Primase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments by forming phosphodiester bonds, creating a continuous DNA strand on the lagging strand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does DNA replication begin on a chromosome?",
        "options": [
          "At specific sequences called origins of replication",
          "At random locations along the sugar-phosphate backbone",
          "Exclusively at the telomeres located at chromosome ends",
          "At any location where a helicase molecule first attaches"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Replication starts at specific sequences called origins of replication. Multiple origins allow faster replication of long eukaryotic chromosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does DNA polymerase help maintain accuracy during replication?",
        "options": [
          "It proofreads and corrects mismatched nucleotides",
          "It reduces its catalytic speed when a mutation is detected",
          "It halts the replication fork entirely upon detecting an error",
          "It signals specialized repair enzymes to fix incorrect sequences"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA polymerase has proofreading ability - it can detect and remove incorrectly paired nucleotides, then replace them with correct ones. This keeps error rates very low (about 1 in 10 billion)."
