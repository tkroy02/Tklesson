        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Antibodies bind to critical sites on viruses or toxins, preventing them from attaching to and entering host cells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'specificity' mean in antibody-antigen interactions?",
        "options": [
          "Each antibody recognizes and binds to one specific antigen",
          "Antibodies can bind to any foreign molecule they happen to encounter",
          "Antigens determine which host cells they will infect based on shape",
          "Only certain genetically gifted people can produce effective antibodies"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to unique variable regions, each antibody is highly specific to a particular antigenic determinant (epitope), like a specialized key for a specific lock."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an epitope?",
        "options": [
          "The specific part of an antigen that an antibody binds to",
          "The entire complex molecule that makes up a single antigen",
          "The structural constant region found on every antibody molecule",
          "A type of receptor found on the surface of most immune cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A single antigen molecule may have multiple different epitopes, each capable of binding a different specific antibody."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the five classes of antibodies (immunoglobulins)?",
        "options": [
          "IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD",
          "IgA, IgB, IgC, IgD, IgE",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Different classes have different structures and functions: IgG (most common in blood), IgA (mucosal surfaces), IgM (first responder), IgE (allergies), IgD (B cell receptor)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is opsonization?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Opsonin' means 'to prepare for eating' - antibodies act as tags that make pathogens more recognizable and appetizing to phagocytes like macrophages."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does clonal selection explain antibody specificity?",
        "options": [
          "Only B cells with receptors for a specific antigen are activated and multiplied",
          "All B cells produce all types of antibodies randomly throughout the body",
          "T cells determine which antibodies B cells will produce for each infection",
          "Antigens select which antibodies they want to bind to based on cell density"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each B cell has unique receptors. When an antigen binds to matching receptors, that specific B cell is selected to clone itself, producing many identical cells secreting the same specific antibody."
