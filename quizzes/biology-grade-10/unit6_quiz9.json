    "subtitle": "6.9 Frameshift Mutations",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Reading Frame Alterations",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What causes a frameshift mutation?",
        "options": [
          "Insertion or deletion of nucleotides",
          "Substitution of one nucleotide",
          "Inversion of a DNA segment",
          "Duplication of a codon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted or deleted in numbers not divisible by three, shifting the reading frame."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are frameshift mutations often severe?",
        "options": [
          "They alter all downstream amino acids",
          "They only affect one amino acid",
          "They cannot be repaired",
          "They occur in essential genes only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the genetic code is read in triplets, adding or removing nucleotides changes every codon from that point onward, usually creating a nonfunctional protein."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If one nucleotide is deleted, how many amino acids are typically affected?",
        "options": [
          "All amino acids after the deletion",
          "Only one amino acid",
          "Exactly three amino acids",
          "No amino acids change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A single-nucleotide deletion shifts the reading frame, so every codon after the mutation is read incorrectly, changing the entire downstream sequence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mutation would NOT cause a frameshift?",
        "options": [
          "Deletion of three nucleotides",
          "Insertion of one nucleotide",
          "Deletion of two nucleotides",
          "Insertion of four nucleotides"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding or deleting multiples of three nucleotides inserts or removes whole amino acids but does not shift the reading frame."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a frameshift differ from a point mutation?",
        "options": [
          "Frameshift alters the reading frame; point mutation changes one codon",
          "Frameshift is always harmful; point mutation is harmless",
          "Frameshift occurs in DNA; point mutation in RNA",
          "Frameshift is reversible; point mutation is permanent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A point mutation (substitution) affects only one codon. A frameshift mutation (insertion/deletion) disrupts the triplet reading of all subsequent codons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What could reverse a frameshift caused by a single base insertion?",
        "options": [
          "A nearby single base deletion",
          "A substitution mutation",
          "A duplication event",
          "Repair enzymes only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A compensating deletion near the insertion can restore the reading frame, though the amino acid sequence between them will still be altered."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where would a frameshift have the smallest effect?",
        "options": [
          "Near the end of the coding sequence",
          "At the very beginning",
          "In the middle of the gene",
          "In a regulatory region"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A frameshift near the end affects fewer amino acids, so the protein might retain partial function if the altered region is non-critical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which disease is linked to frameshift mutations?",
        "options": [
          "Cystic fibrosis",
          "Sickle cell anemia",
          "Color blindness",
          "Huntington's disease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Many cystic fibrosis cases involve a three-nucleotide deletion (not a frameshift) or frameshift mutations in the CFTR gene."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if a frameshift creates a premature stop codon?",
        "options": [
          "A truncated protein is made",
          "Translation skips the stop codon",
          "The mRNA is degraded",
          "Translation restarts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the shifted reading frame includes a stop codon soon after the mutation, translation stops early, producing a shortened, usually nonfunctional protein."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can a frameshift mutation be silent?",
        "options": [
          "Almost never",
          "Frequently",
          "Only in introns",
          "When it occurs in mitochondria"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because it changes the entire downstream amino acid sequence, a frameshift almost always significantly alters the protein, making silent frameshifts extremely rare."
