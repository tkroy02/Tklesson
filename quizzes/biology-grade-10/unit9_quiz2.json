        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the biological definition of inflammation?",
        "options": [

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inflammation is characterized by redness, heat, swelling, and pain - all serving to isolate, destroy, and remove pathogens while healing tissue."
      },

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Neutrophils (first responders) and macrophages (clean-up crew) engulf and digest pathogens through phagocytosis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary immunological purpose of a moderate fever?",
        "options": [
          "To create an unfavorable environment for pathogen replication and growth",
          "To directly and instantly kill all circulating bacteria and viruses",
          "To exclusively speed up the production of specific antibodies",
          "To mechanically prevent further pathogen entry through the skin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moderate fever inhibits bacterial/viral replication, enhances phagocyte activity, and increases metabolic rate for repair processes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which chemical is released by mast cells to initiate the inflammatory response?",

          "Histamine",
          "Antibodies",
          "Insulin",
          "Hemoglobin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Histamine from mast cells and basophils causes vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, leading to inflammation signs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are interferons in the context of immune response?",
        "options": [
          "Proteins released by virus-infected cells to warn and protect neighboring cells",
          "Antibodies that specifically bind to and neutralize viral particles",
          "Hormones that regulate the production of all immune cell types",
          "Enzymes that directly digest the cell walls of invading bacteria"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Interferons are signaling proteins that help nearby cells heighten their anti-viral defenses, limiting viral spread."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of the complement system?",
        "options": [
          "A group of plasma proteins that enhance or 'complement' immune responses",
          "Specialized cells that provide physical support to phagocyte activity",
          "Antibodies that only work in conjunction with B cell activation",
          "Hormones that assist in reducing the pain associated with inflammation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Complement proteins circulate inactive until activated, then they can form membrane attack complexes (lysis), attract phagocytes, and coat pathogens (opsonization)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is 'pus' formed at the site of a persistent infection?",
        "options": [
          "The accumulation of dead neutrophils, tissue debris, and destroyed pathogens",
          "A high concentration of antibodies gathered against a specific bacteria",
          "The result of clotting factors sealing off a healthy area of tissue",
          "The accumulation of live, replicating viral particles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pus is a whitish-yellow substance containing dead neutrophils, macrophages, tissue cells, and pathogens - evidence of an ongoing phagocytic battle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the specific role of Natural Killer (NK) cells?",
        "options": [
          "To recognize and eliminate virus-infected or cancerous body cells",
          "To mass-produce antibodies against malignant tumors",
          "To engulf large quantities of bacteria through phagocytosis",
          "To release histamine during common environmental allergic reactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "NK cells patrol the body looking for abnormal cells (lacking proper 'self' markers) and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the second line of defense differ from the third line?",
        "options": [
          "The second line is non-specific and immediate; the third line is specific and develops memory",
          "The second line relies on antibodies while the third line uses only phagocytes",
          "The second line is much slower but offers significantly higher precision",
          "There is no functional or physiological difference between these two lines"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Second line: rapid (minutes/hours), attacks all pathogens similarly, no memory. Third line: slower (days), targets specific pathogens, creates immunological memory."
