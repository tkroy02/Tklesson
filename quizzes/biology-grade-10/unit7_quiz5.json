    "title": "Unit 7 Quiz 5, Grade 10 Biology",
    "subtitle": "7.5 Selection Mechanism",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "How Natural Selection Works",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the unit that natural selection acts upon?",
        "options": [
          "The individual organism",
          "The entire species",
          "Single genes only",
          "Ecosystems as a whole"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural selection acts on individuals—their survival and reproduction—but its effects are seen in changing trait frequencies across populations over generations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What changes as a result of natural selection?",
        "options": [
          "Trait frequencies in a population",
          "Individual organisms within their lifetime",
          "The genetic code itself",
          "Environmental conditions directly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While individuals are selected, populations evolve: alleles for advantageous traits become more common, while disadvantageous ones become rarer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What provides the raw material for natural selection?",
        "options": [
          "Genetic variation from mutations",
          "Environmental challenges alone",
          "Conscious effort by organisms",
          "Predictable trait changes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mutations create new genetic variations randomly. Natural selection acts on this existing variation—it doesn't create new traits, but filters them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What determines which traits are 'advantageous'?",
        "options": [
          "The current environment",
          "A fixed set of ideal traits",
          "Human judgment of fitness",
          "Traits that are always largest"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Advantage depends on context: camouflage helps where predators hunt by sight; antibiotic resistance helps where antibiotics are present. Environments change, so advantages change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does selection pressure work?",
        "options": [
          "Environmental factors affect survival chances",
          "Organisms choose their own traits",
          "Genes directly sense the environment",
          "All pressures help every organism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Selection pressures (predators, climate, food availability, diseases) make some traits more beneficial than others in a given place and time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is fitness in evolutionary terms?",
        "options": [
          "Reproductive success relative to others",
          "Physical strength and health",
          "Lifespan of an individual",
          "Ability to win competitions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Biological fitness measures how many offspring an individual leaves that survive to reproduce. It's about genes passed on, not just health or strength."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can natural selection create new traits?",
        "options": [
          "No, it only acts on existing variation",
          "Yes, it designs traits as needed",
          "Only in laboratory conditions",
          "Only through genetic engineering"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural selection can only increase or decrease frequency of existing traits. New traits arise randomly through mutations, then may be selected if beneficial."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an adaptation?",
        "options": [
          "A heritable trait that increases fitness",
          "Any trait an organism is born with",
          "A behavior learned during life",
          "A temporary response to environment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adaptations are inherited characteristics shaped by natural selection that improve an organism's chances of survival and reproduction in its environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How quickly can natural selection work?",
        "options": [
          "It depends on generation time and selection strength",
          "Always takes millions of years",
          "Instantly within one generation",
          "At a constant rate for all species"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bacteria can evolve resistance in days (short generations, strong antibiotic pressure). Larger animals with long generations evolve more slowly under milder selection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if the environment changes?",
        "options": [
          "Previously beneficial traits may become harmful",
          "All adaptations remain beneficial",
          "Organisms instantly develop new traits",
          "Natural selection stops working"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If environments change (climate, new predators, food sources), traits that were once advantageous may become disadvantages—leading to new selection pressures."
