    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental difference between nervous and endocrine system communication?",
        "options": [
          "Nervous uses electrical/chemical signals along neurons; endocrine uses hormones in blood",
          "The nervous system is the only one responsible for maintaining internal homeostasis",
          "The endocrine system operates completely independently of the brain's control",
          "The nervous system relies on blood flow to deliver its primary messages"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nervous system: neurons transmit electrochemical impulses along specific pathways. Endocrine system: glands secrete hormones into bloodstream for widespread distribution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which system generally produces faster but shorter-lasting responses?",
        "options": [
          "Nervous system",
          "Endocrine system",
          "Both are equally fast in all physiological scenarios",
          "Both produce equally long-lasting effects on target tissues"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Neural responses occur in milliseconds to seconds (e.g., pulling hand from hot surface). Hormonal responses take seconds to hours/days but effects persist longer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the target areas differ between the two systems?",
        "options": [
          "Nervous: precise, localized; Endocrine: widespread, general",
          "Nervous: widespread; Endocrine: highly localized to one organ",
          "Both target specific, localized areas with identical anatomical precision",
          "Both systems affect the entire body simultaneously without selection"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Neurons connect to specific muscles/glands (localized). Hormones circulate to all tissues but only affect cells with appropriate receptors (widespread but selective)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a key similarity between nervous and endocrine systems?",
        "options": [
          "Both use chemical messengers for communication",
          "Both transmit signals at identical electrochemical speeds",
          "Both rely exclusively on electrical impulses to function",
          "Neither system is involved in homeostatic regulation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both use chemicals: neurotransmitters at synapses (nervous) and hormones in blood (endocrine). Both are essential for maintaining homeostasis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the interaction between the two systems?",
        "options": [
          "They work together cooperatively, with nervous often controlling endocrine",
          "They work completely independently without any functional interaction",
          "The endocrine system always serves as the master controller of nerves",
          "They act as biological competitors for control over the same organs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hypothalamus (nervous tissue) controls the pituitary (endocrine gland). Nervous system can trigger hormone release; hormones can influence neural activity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which system is primarily responsible for rapid, precise movements like catching a ball?",
        "options": [
          "Nervous system (specifically somatic division)",
          "Endocrine system (through rapid steroid release)",
          "Both systems contribute equally to millisecond coordination",
          "Neither system is capable of controlling voluntary movement"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The somatic nervous system controls voluntary skeletal muscle contractions with precise timing and coordination."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which system regulates long-term processes like growth and development?",
        "options": [
          "Endocrine system",
          "Nervous system",
          "Both equally regulate the multi-year growth cycle",
          "Growth occurs independently of both control systems"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hormones like growth hormone and sex hormones regulate prolonged developmental processes over months to years."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a stress response, how do the two systems typically work together?",
        "options": [
          "Sympathetic nervous system provides immediate response; adrenal hormones sustain it",
          "The nervous system is the only pathway used during a crisis",
          "They work in a sequence where the endocrine system must finish first",
          "They produce opposing physical effects to balance the body's reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial stress: sympathetic NS acts within seconds. Adrenal glands then secrete cortisol/adrenaline, sustaining the response for minutes/hours."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is neuroendocrine integration?",
        "options": [
          "When neural stimuli trigger hormone release (e.g., hypothalamus-pituitary)",
          "When hormones are chemically converted into neurotransmitters",
          "When the two systems merge into a single physical organ",
          "When endocrine glands develop entirely from nervous tissue"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hypothalamus (nervous tissue) produces releasing hormones that control the pituitary (endocrine gland), linking the two systems functionally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are both systems essential for homeostasis?",
        "options": [
          "Nervous provides rapid adjustments; endocrine provides sustained regulation",
          "One system serves as a complete backup if the other system fails",
          "They control completely separate and unrelated body functions",
          "Only the nervous system is actually required for survival"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nervous system handles quick, fine-tuned responses; endocrine system provides slower, prolonged regulation."
