        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA bases pair specifically: Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T) via 2 hydrogen bonds, and Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C) via 3 hydrogen bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the shape of the DNA molecule?",
        "options": [
          "Double helix",
          "Single straight strand",
          "Triple helix structure",
          "Circular ring formation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA forms a double helix - two strands twisted around each other like a spiral staircase. Watson and Crick discovered this structure in 1953."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What forms the 'backbone' of each DNA strand?",
        "options": [
          "Alternating sugar and phosphate molecules",
          "Nitrogenous bases linked in a linear chain",
          "Hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs",
          "Lipid molecules arranged in a structural chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The DNA backbone is made of deoxyribose sugars and phosphate groups alternating. The bases project inward from this backbone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of bonds hold the two DNA strands together?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen bonds between complementary bases",
          "Covalent bonds between deoxyribose sugars",
          "Ionic bonds between alternating phosphate groups",
          "Peptide bonds between amino acid sequences"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak hydrogen bonds hold the two strands together. A-T pairs have 2 hydrogen bonds, G-C pairs have 3. This allows strands to separate for replication."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'antiparallel' mean regarding DNA strands?",
        "options": [
          "The two strands run in opposite directions",
          "The strands are parallel but carry opposite electrical charges",
          "One strand is structurally longer than its complement",
          "The two strands twist in opposite directions around the axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA strands are antiparallel: one runs 5'→3' direction, the other runs 3'→5'. The numbers refer to carbon atoms in the sugar molecule where bonds form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is complementary base pairing important for DNA function?",
        "options": [
          "It allows accurate DNA replication and information storage",
          "It makes DNA significantly more resistant to chemical damage",
          "It allows the DNA molecule to change shape within the nucleus",
          "It helps the DNA molecule dissolve in aqueous environments"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Complementary pairing ensures that when DNA replicates, each strand serves as a template to make an exact copy. It also allows information to be stored in the sequence of bases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does DNA differ from RNA in structure?",
        "options": [
          "DNA has deoxyribose and thymine; RNA has ribose and uracil",
          "DNA is single-stranded; RNA is double-stranded in structure",
          "DNA contains uracil; RNA contains thymine nitrogenous bases",
          "DNA is located in the cytoplasm; RNA is restricted to the nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Key differences: DNA has deoxyribose sugar, RNA has ribose; DNA has thymine, RNA has uracil; DNA is usually double-stranded, RNA is usually single-stranded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the sequence of DNA bases determine?",
        "options": [
          "The genetic instructions for building specific proteins",
          "The color and transparency of an organism's cells",
          "The specific speed at which DNA replication occurs",
          "The total strength of hydrogen bonds between strands"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The specific order of A, T, C, G bases forms the genetic code - like letters in an alphabet. This sequence determines which proteins are made, controlling all cell functions."
