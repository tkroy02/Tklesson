      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical property is a defining characteristic of all lipids?",
        "options": [
          "They are hydrophobic and insoluble in water",
          "They are composed of repeating amino acid monomers",
          "They always contain a polar phosphate group",
          "They are highly soluble in polar aqueous solvents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lipids consist primarily of non-polar hydrocarbon chains. Because they cannot form hydrogen bonds with water, they are hydrophobic and insoluble in polar solvents."
      },

          "Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus",
          "Nitrogen, Sulfur, and Magnesium",
          "Hydrogen, Helium, and Lithium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lipids are organic hydrocarbons containing C, H, and O, though they have a significantly lower proportion of oxygen compared to carbohydrates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of lipids regarding energy storage in animals?",
        "options": [
          "Provision of long-term energy storage",
          "Immediate release of anaerobic energy",

          "Structural support for external cell walls"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lipids are energy-dense molecules (9 kcal/g), making them the ideal medium for long-term energy storage in adipose tissue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Beyond energy storage, which of the following is a major biological role of lipids?",
        "options": [
          "Thermal insulation and organ protection",
          "Transportation of oxygen within the blood",
          "Encoding of hereditary genetic information",
          "Sourcing of nitrogen for cellular growth"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lipid layers provide thermal insulation to maintain body temperature and act as a cushion (shock absorber) for vital internal organs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do lipids provide more energy per gram compared to carbohydrates?",
        "options": [
          "They have a higher ratio of Carbon-Hydrogen bonds",
          "They are much larger molecules by molecular mass",
          "They contain high-energy metallic internal bonds",
          "They are easier to break down than simple glucose"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy in organic molecules is stored in $C-H$ bonds. Lipids have a much higher density of these bonds compared to the $C-O$ bonds prevalent in carbohydrates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In terms of polarity, how are most lipids classified?",
        "options": [
          "Non-polar",
          "Highly polar",
          "Ionic",
          "Amphoteric"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lipids are generally non-polar molecules with an even distribution of charge, which accounts for their inability to dissolve in water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group of lipids is characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings?",
        "options": [
          "Steroids",
          "Triglycerides",
          "Phospholipids",
          "Waxes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steroids, such as cholesterol and testosterone, are defined by a core structure of seventeen carbon atoms bonded in four fused rings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do lipids contribute to the structure of biological membranes?",
        "options": [
          "They form a bilayer that acts as a selective barrier",
          "They provide a rigid, solid casing for the cytoplasm",
          "They act as the main channels for active ion transport",
          "They prevent any substances from crossing the membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phospholipids form a bilayer where hydrophobic tails face inward, creating a semi-permeable barrier essential for cellular compartmentalization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a lipid used for waterproofing and preventing water loss in plants?",

          "Waxes",
          "Glycogen",
          "Hemoglobin",
          "Glucose"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Waxes are highly hydrophobic long-chain lipids that form the cuticle on leaf surfaces to minimize transpiration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are lipids generally not considered 'true polymers' like proteins or DNA?",
        "options": [
          "They lack a series of repeating monomer units in long chains",
          "They contain multiple types of different chemical elements",
          "They are too small to be classified as biological macromolecules",
          "They cannot be broken down through the process of hydrolysis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While they are macromolecules, lipids like triglycerides are discrete assemblies of different components (glycerol and fatty acids) rather than continuous chains of repeating monomers."
