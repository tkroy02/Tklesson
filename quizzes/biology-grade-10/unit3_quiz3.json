    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scientist is credited with proposing the Lock and Key model of enzyme action in 1894?",
        "options": [
          "Emil Fischer",
          "James Watson and Francis Crick",
          "Louis Pasteur",
          "Daniel Koshland"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Lock and Key model was proposed by German chemist Emil Fischer in 1894 to explain enzyme specificity and the complementary fit between enzyme and substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Lock and Key model, how does an enzyme recognize its specific substrate?",
        "options": [
          "The active site has a rigid, fixed shape that exactly matches the substrate",
          "The enzyme's tertiary structure is flexible and wraps around the substrate",
          "The substrate undergoes a conformational change to fit any nearby enzyme",
          "The enzyme utilizes electrical signals to attract the correct substrate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the Lock and Key model, the enzyme's active site is considered a rigid and pre-shaped structure that accepts only one specific key-like substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the 'Lock and Key' analogy, which component represents the 'lock'?",
        "options": [
          "The enzyme's active site",
          "The substrate molecule",
          "The resulting products",
          "The non-protein cofactor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The enzyme's active site is the 'lock'—a specific, unchanging structure. The substrate acts as the 'key' that must possess the correct dimensions to fit into it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What primary biological concept does the Lock and Key model effectively explain?",
        "options": [
          "Enzyme specificity",
          "The transition state stabilization process",
          "The recycling of enzymes after denaturation",
          "The effect of kinetic energy on reaction rates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The model was developed to explain why enzymes typically catalyze only one specific reaction with a particular substrate, known as enzyme specificity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the geometric relationship between an enzyme and its substrate in this model?",
        "options": [
          "They have complementary shapes that fit together precisely",
          "The substrate is significantly larger than the enzyme's active site",
          "The shapes are identical rather than complementary",
          "The shapes only match once the reaction is nearly complete"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The core of the Lock and Key model is that the active site and substrate have shapes that are complementary, much like the grooves of a key and the pins of a lock."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is considered a major scientific limitation of the Lock and Key model?",
        "options": [
          "It fails to account for the flexible shape changes enzymes undergo during catalysis",
          "It does not explain why enzymes are composed of amino acid chains",
          "It incorrectly suggests that enzymes are consumed in the reaction",
          "It fails to acknowledge that enzymes are biological catalysts"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The model assumes enzymes are rigid. Modern biology (the Induced Fit model) shows that enzymes are flexible and change shape slightly when substrates bind."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the Lock and Key model help visualize competitive inhibition?",
        "options": [
          "The inhibitor acts as a 'wrong key' that fits the lock but cannot turn it",
          "The inhibitor acts as a hammer that breaks the 'lock' permanently",
          "The inhibitor binds to the back of the 'lock' to close the keyhole",
          "The inhibitor changes the 'lock' into a different type of protein"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor mimics the shape of the substrate, essentially acting like a key that fits into the lock but fails to trigger a reaction, blocking the real substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the status of the enzyme after the products are released in this model?",
        "options": [
          "It remains chemically unchanged and is ready for reuse",
          "It is permanently fused to the products of the reaction",
          "It undergoes immediate degradation by the cell",
          "It must be reactivated by a specific hormone or enzyme"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A key principle of this model (and all enzyme catalysis) is that the enzyme is a catalyst; it facilitates the reaction and returns to its original state to be used again."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Lock and Key model still a valuable part of the Grade 10 curriculum?",
        "options": [
          "It provides a clear, intuitive introduction to the concept of specificity",
          "It is the most technically accurate model for all metabolic pathways",
          "It explains the role of activation energy more clearly than other models",
          "It is the only model that explains how enzymes work in extreme heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While refined by the Induced Fit model, the Lock and Key model is a perfect pedagogical tool for introducing the foundational concept of enzyme specificity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the correct sequence of events in this model?",
        "options": [
          "Enzyme + Substrate → E-S Complex → Enzyme + Products",
          "Substrate → Enzyme Degradation → Product Formation",
          "Product Formation → E-S Complex → Enzyme Recovery",
          "Enzyme Inactivation → Substrate Binding → Shape Recovery"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The process begins with the enzyme and substrate binding to form a complex (E-S Complex), followed by catalysis and the release of products, leaving the enzyme free."
