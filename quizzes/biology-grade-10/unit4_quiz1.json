        "question": "What would be the most immediate global consequence if photosynthesis were to cease entirely?",
        "options": [
          "Atmospheric oxygen would deplete and most food chains would collapse",
          "Animals would evolve to use infrared heat as a primary energy source",
          "The Earth's atmosphere would immediately dissipate into space",
          "Decomposition would stop, preventing the recycling of any nutrients"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without photosynthesis, there would be no replacement for the oxygen used by organisms, and the primary production of food would end, causing a total ecosystem collapse."
      },

          "Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria",
          "Green plants, fungi, and all soil bacteria",
          "All aquatic organisms including fish and coral polyps",
          "Only multicellular organisms with specialized leaf structures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis is not limited to plants; it is also performed by algae (protists) and certain prokaryotes like cyanobacteria."
