        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cerebrum (cerebral cortex) handles conscious thought, language, reasoning, sensory perception, and voluntary motor control."

          "Direct control of automatic respiratory functions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cerebellum fine-tunes motor commands, maintains posture and balance, and helps learn motor skills (like riding a bike)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary role of the thalamus?",
        "options": [
          "A relay station that sorts and directs sensory information",
          "The primary center for generating emotional responses",
          "The site of production for most cerebrospinal fluid",
          "The main controller of cardiovascular heart rate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The thalamus sorts and directs sensory signals (except smell) to appropriate cerebral cortex areas, acting as a sensory 'switchboard.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which processes does the hypothalamus regulate?",
        "options": [
          "Homeostasis and control of the pituitary gland",
          "The execution of voluntary skeletal muscle movements",
          "Advanced language comprehension and speech production",
          "The primary integration of visual sensory processing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hypothalamus maintains homeostasis by regulating temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep, and emotional responses, and controls the pituitary gland."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which structures provide physical and chemical protection for the CNS?",

          "Extensive networks of blood vessels and peripheral nerves"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Protection includes: skull/vertebrae (bone), meninges (membranes), cerebrospinal fluid (cushioning), and blood-brain barrier (chemical protection)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes gray matter in the CNS?",
        "options": [
          "Areas composed of neuron cell bodies and dendrites",
          "Vast tracts of myelinated axons forming signaling pathways",
          "Spaces filled exclusively with cerebrospinal fluid",
          "Outer protective membranes surrounding the brain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gray matter contains neuron cell bodies, dendrites, and unmyelinated axons—sites of neural processing. Found in cerebral cortex, brain nuclei, and spinal cord center."
      },

          "A dense network of blood vessels supplying the cortex"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "White matter consists of myelinated axons that connect different CNS regions. The myelin gives it a whitish appearance and enables fast signal transmission."
