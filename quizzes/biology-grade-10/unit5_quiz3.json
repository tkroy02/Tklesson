    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Gamete Formation Process",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main purpose of meiosis?",
        "options": [
          "To produce gametes (sex cells) with half the chromosome number",
          "To replicate somatic cells for the purposes of tissue repair",
          "To increase the total number of chromosomes within a zygote",
          "To convert haploid stem cells into diploid specialized cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Meiosis produces gametes (sperm and eggs) that have half the normal chromosome number. This ensures fertilization restores the full chromosome number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many divisions occur during meiosis?",
        "options": [
          "Two divisions (Meiosis I and Meiosis II)",
          "One division similar to standard mitosis",
          "Three divisions to maximize genetic variation",
          "A variable number depending on the organism"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Meiosis consists of two consecutive divisions: Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, and Meiosis II separates sister chromatids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to chromosome number during meiosis?",
        "options": [
          "It is halved (diploid to haploid)",
          "It remains constant (diploid to diploid)",
          "It is doubled (haploid to diploid)",
          "It fluctuates randomly during the second division"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A diploid (2n) cell undergoes meiosis to produce haploid (n) gametes. This reduction is crucial so fertilization can restore the diploid number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'crossing over' and when does it occur?",
        "options": [
          "Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during Prophase I",
          "Separation of individual sister chromatids during late Anaphase II",
          "The alignment of tetrads along the metaphase plate of the cell",
          "The final division of the cytoplasm during the cytokinesis phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crossing over occurs when homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange segments during Prophase I. This creates new combinations of genes, increasing genetic variation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many daughter cells result from meiosis?",
        "options": [
          "Four genetically different haploid cells",
          "Two genetically identical diploid cells",
          "Two genetically different haploid cells",
          "Four genetically identical haploid cells"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "One diploid cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid gametes. These four cells are genetically different from each other and from the parent cell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are homologous chromosomes?",
        "options": [
          "Chromosome pairs (one from each parent) with similar genes",
          "Identical sister chromatids produced during the S phase",
          "Chromosomes containing entirely unrelated genetic instructions",
          "The specific pair of sex chromosomes designated as X and Y"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Homologous chromosomes are matching pairs - one inherited from the mother, one from the father. They carry genes for the same traits but may have different alleles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is independent assortment and why is it important?",
        "options": [
          "Random alignment of homologous pairs during Metaphase I, creating genetic variation",
          "The physical separation of the cytoplasm into four distinct daughter cells",
          "The biochemical replication of DNA before the meiotic process begins",
          "The pairing process of homologous chromosomes during the Prophase I stage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During Metaphase I, homologous chromosome pairs line up randomly at the equator. This random orientation means each gamete gets a random mix of maternal and paternal chromosomes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does meiosis occur in animals?",
        "options": [
          "In gonads (testes and ovaries)",
          "In all somatic cells to facilitate growth",
          "Exclusively within the red bone marrow",
          "In epithelial cells to assist with repair"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In animals, meiosis occurs only in gonads: testes produce sperm (spermatogenesis) and ovaries produce eggs (oogenesis)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does meiosis contribute to genetic variation in offspring?",
        "options": [
          "Through crossing over and independent assortment",
          "By producing clones of the original parental cells",
          "By doubling the chromosome count in every gamete",
          "By suppressing mutations during the replication phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crossing over mixes genes on chromosomes, and independent assortment randomly distributes chromosomes to gametes. These processes ensure each gamete is genetically unique."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would happen if meiosis produced diploid gametes instead of haploid?",
        "options": [
          "Chromosome number would double with each generation",
          "The resulting offspring would have half the normal chromosome count",
          "Genetic variation would be completely eliminated from the population",
          "The process of fertilization would become physically impossible"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If diploid (2n) sperm fertilized a diploid (2n) egg, the zygote would be tetraploid (4n). This would lead to an exponential increase in chromosome number each generation."
