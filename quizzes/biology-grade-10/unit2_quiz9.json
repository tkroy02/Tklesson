          "Uracil",
          "Adenine",
          "Guanine",
          "Cytosine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RNA uses Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T) to pair with Adenine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does Biuret reagent NOT produce a positive result with free amino acids?",
        "options": [
          "It specifically reacts with peptide bonds, which are absent in single amino acids",
          "Amino acids are too small to reflect light in the visible purple spectrum",
          "The variable R-groups of amino acids chemically neutralize the copper ions",
          "Amino acids only react when they are heated to a rolling boil for five minutes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Biuret test requires at least two peptide bonds (a tripeptide or larger) to form the coordination complex with the copper ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule is generally shorter-lived and more chemically reactive due to its $$2'-hydroxyl$$ group?",
        "options": [
          "RNA (Ribonucleic acid)",
          "DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)",
          "Both are equally stable in aqueous solutions",
          "Neither, as both molecules are inorganic polymers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ribose sugar in RNA has a hydroxyl ($$-OH$$) group on the $$2'$$ carbon, making it more susceptible to hydrolysis than the deoxyribose in DNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a lab, you add Biuret reagent to a solution and it stays light blue. What is the most likely conclusion?",
        "options": [
          "The sample does not contain detectable proteins",
          "The sample contains a very high concentration of protein",
          "The sample contains genomic DNA instead of RNA",
          "The sample must be heated to see the purple color change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Light blue is the original color of the Biuret reagent; no color change indicates a negative result for protein."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary sugar found in the backbone of RNA?",

          "Amylose"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RNA stands for Ribonucleic Acid, reflecting its use of the pentose sugar ribose."

        "question": "Which of the following is a function often performed by RNA but NOT typically by DNA?",

          "Acting as a ribozyme to catalyze chemical reactions",
          "Storing the primary genetic code in the eukaryotic nucleus",
          "Forming a double-stranded antiparallel helical structure",
          "Containing phosphorus in the sugar-phosphate backbone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Some RNA molecules can fold into complex 3D shapes that allow them to catalyze biochemical reactions, similar to protein enzymes."

          "To provide the alkaline environment necessary for the reaction",
          "To act as a catalyst to speed up the chemical reaction",
          "To stain the amino acids so they become visible to the eye",
          "To break down the proteins into individual amino acid monomers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The complex between copper ions and peptide bonds only forms effectively under basic (alkaline) conditions."
