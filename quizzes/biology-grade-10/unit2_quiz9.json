        "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary structural difference between DNA and RNA?",
        "options": [
          "RNA contains ribose sugar and uracil, while DNA contains deoxyribose sugar and thymine",
          "DNA is always single-stranded, while RNA is always double-stranded",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA contains deoxyribose sugar (missing an oxygen at the 2' carbon) and thymine. RNA contains ribose sugar and uracil instead of thymine."

        "explanation": "mRNA carries the genetic code from DNA in the nucleus to ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which cellular locations are DNA and RNA primarily found?",
        "options": [
          "DNA is mainly in the nucleus; RNA is found in nucleus and cytoplasm",
          "Both are exclusively found in the nucleus",
          "DNA is in cytoplasm; RNA is in mitochondria",
          "Both are evenly distributed throughout the cell"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA is primarily located in the nucleus (with some in mitochondria and chloroplasts). RNA is synthesized in the nucleus but performs its functions in the cytoplasm."
      },

          "Messenger RNA (mRNA)",
          "Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)",
          "Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "tRNA molecules have an anticodon that matches mRNA codons and carry specific amino acids to the ribosome for polypeptide assembly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following nitrogenous bases is found in RNA but not in DNA?",
        "options": [
          "Uracil",
          "Thymine",
          "Guanine",
          "Adenine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RNA contains uracil instead of thymine. Both nucleic acids contain adenine, guanine, and cytosine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the typical three-dimensional structure of most DNA molecules?",
        "options": [
          "Double helix",
          "Single straight chain",
          "Triple-stranded coil",
          "Branched tree structure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA typically exists as a double helix - two complementary strands twisted around each other, as described by Watson and Crick."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement correctly describes the stability of DNA versus RNA?",
        "options": [
          "DNA is more chemically stable than RNA due to its deoxyribose sugar and double-stranded structure",
          "RNA is more stable because it contains uracil instead of thymine",
          "Both are equally stable under cellular conditions",
          "RNA is more stable because it's single-stranded and flexible"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA's deoxyribose sugar (lacking the 2' hydroxyl group) makes it less prone to hydrolysis, and its double-stranded structure provides additional stability compared to RNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which nucleic acid serves as the permanent storage of genetic information in cells?",
        "options": [
          "DNA",
          "mRNA",
          "rRNA",
          "tRNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA is the hereditary material that stores genetic information long-term. RNA molecules are typically transient copies used for protein synthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key functional difference between DNA and RNA?",

          "DNA stores genetic information; RNA helps express that information",
          "DNA catalyzes chemical reactions; RNA stores energy",
          "RNA stores genetic information; DNA transports amino acids",
          "DNA builds cell membranes; RNA forms structural components"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "DNA's primary function is long-term information storage. RNA has various roles in expressing that information, including mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA functions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of bond holds the two strands of DNA together?",

          "Disulfide bridges between nucleotides"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
