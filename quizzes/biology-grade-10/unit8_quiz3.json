    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the resting potential of a neuron?",
        "options": [
          "The voltage difference across the membrane when the cell is not signaling",
          "The phase of the action potential where sodium channels are open",
          "The maximum positive voltage reached during an electrical impulse",
          "The period of hyperpolarization following an action potential"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resting potential (-70 mV) is maintained by sodium-potassium pumps and leak channels, creating an electrical gradient ready for signaling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during depolarization?",
        "options": [
          "The membrane potential becomes less negative as sodium enters the cell",
          "The membrane potential becomes more negative as potassium leaves the cell",
          "The sodium-potassium pump restores the ionic balance to resting state",
          "The impulse is inhibited by the opening of chloride channels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Depolarization occurs when sodium ions rush into the neuron, making the inside less negative relative to outside—the rising phase of an action potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an action potential?",
        "options": [
          "A rapid, all-or-none change in membrane potential that travels along the axon",
          "A slow, graded electrical signal that decays over short distances",
          "The constant maintenance of a -70 mV charge across the bilayer",
          "The chemical transition of neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An action potential is a brief, all-or-none electrical impulse that travels along the axon when depolarization reaches threshold."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What causes repolarization of the neural membrane?",
        "options": [
          "Potassium ions leaving the neuron through voltage-gated channels",
          "Sodium ions entering the neuron through voltage-gated channels",
          "Calcium ions binding to intracellular receptors in the soma",
          "The active transport of chloride ions into the extracellular fluid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After depolarization, voltage-gated potassium channels open, allowing K⁺ to exit, restoring negative internal charge—repolarization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the refractory period?",
        "options": [
          "A brief interval during which the neuron cannot be stimulated to fire again",
          "The exact moment when the action potential reaches its peak voltage",
          "The measurement of the speed at which an impulse travels down the axon",
          "The physical distance between the myelin segments and nodes of Ranvier"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During the refractory period (absolute then relative), sodium channels are inactivated, preventing immediate re-firing and ensuring impulses travel one-way."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does myelination influence nerve impulses?",
        "options": [
          "It increases conduction speed via saltatory conduction between nodes",
          "It slows the impulse by increasing electrical resistance along the membrane",
          "It prevents the propagation of impulses to neighboring interneurons",
          "It reverses the direction of the impulse to facilitate feedback loops"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Myelin insulates axons, forcing action potentials to 'jump' between nodes of Ranvier—saltatory conduction—which is faster and more energy-efficient."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factors primarily determine the speed of an action potential?",
        "options": [
          "Axon diameter and the presence of a myelin sheath",
          "The total length of the dendritic tree and soma volume",
          "The quantity of ribosomes available in the cell body",
          "The density of synaptic vesicles in the axon terminal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Larger diameter axons and myelinated axons conduct impulses faster due to less resistance and saltatory conduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the significance of the threshold potential?",
        "options": [
          "It is the minimum membrane voltage required to trigger an action potential",
          "It represents the equilibrium potential for potassium ions alone",
          "It is the maximum voltage the membrane can sustain before damage",
          "It is the voltage reached during the peak of the refractory period"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Threshold is typically around -55 mV. If depolarization reaches this level, voltage-gated sodium channels open fully, causing an all-or-none action potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What occurs during hyperpolarization?",
        "options": [
          "The membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential",
          "The membrane potential crosses the 0 mV threshold to become positive",
          "The neuron enters a state of continuous, rapid-fire signaling",
          "Voltage-gated sodium channels remain in a permanently open state"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hyperpolarization occurs when potassium channels stay open slightly too long, making the interior more negative than resting potential, briefly lowering excitability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the all-or-none principle critical for neural signaling?",
        "options": [
          "It ensures the signal maintains full strength as it travels the axon",
          "It allows the neuron to modulate signal intensity by changing amplitude",
          "It prevents signals from reaching the central nervous system",
          "It causes signals to dissipate gradually over the length of the fiber"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once threshold is reached, the action potential fires fully regardless of stimulus strength. Intensity is coded by frequency of impulses, not size."
