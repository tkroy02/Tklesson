    "subtitle": "6.8 Point Mutations",
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Single Base Pair Changes",
    "duration": 12,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a point mutation?",
        "options": [
          "A change in a single DNA base pair",
          "The complete loss of an entire chromosome",
          "A large-scale duplication of a gene segment",
          "A physical break in the sugar-phosphate backbone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A point mutation involves the substitution, insertion, or deletion of just one nucleotide pair in DNA."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of point mutation changes one amino acid to another?",
        "options": [
          "Missense mutation",
          "Silent mutation",
          "Nonsense mutation",
          "Frameshift mutation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A missense mutation alters a codon so that it codes for a different amino acid, potentially changing protein function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a silent mutation?",
        "options": [
          "A DNA change that does not alter the resulting amino acid",
          "A mutation that completely halts protein production",
          "A mutation that occurs only in non-coding DNA regions",
          "A mutation that is physically present but never expressed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to codon redundancy, some base changes still code for the same amino acid, so the protein sequence is unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mutation creates a premature stop codon?",
        "options": [
          "Nonsense mutation",
          "Missense mutation",
          "Silent mutation",
          "Neutral mutation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A nonsense mutation changes an amino acid codon into a stop codon, causing early termination of translation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the DNA sequence AAA (lysine) changes to AAG, what occurs?",
        "options": [
          "A silent mutation",
          "A missense mutation",
          "A nonsense mutation",
          "A frameshift mutation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both AAA and AAG code for lysine, so this substitution does not change the amino acid—it's silent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which point mutation is likely most severe regarding protein function?",
        "options": [
          "Nonsense mutation near the start of the sequence",
          "Silent mutation located in the middle of the gene",
          "Missense mutation occurring at the very end of the sequence",
          "Any single point mutation occurring within an intron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A nonsense mutation early in the coding sequence produces a very short, nonfunctional protein, often with serious effects."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a transition mutation?",
        "options": [
          "Purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine change",
          "Purine to pyrimidine or pyrimidine to purine change",
          "A mutation that skips a base during the replication process",
          "A mutation that reverses the direction of the DNA strand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Transitions are substitutions between similar bases: A↔G (purines) or C↔T (pyrimidines). They are more common than transversions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which disease can result from a point mutation in hemoglobin?",
        "options": [
          "Sickle cell anemia",
          "Cystic fibrosis",
          "Huntington's disease",
          "Down syndrome"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single A→T point mutation in the beta-globin gene, changing glutamic acid to valine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of mutation changes CGA (arginine) to UGA?",
        "options": [
          "Nonsense mutation",
          "Missense mutation",
          "Silent mutation",
          "Reverse mutation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "UGA is a stop codon. Changing CGA (arginine) to UGA creates a premature stop—a nonsense mutation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where must a point mutation occur to most directly affect protein sequence?",
        "options": [
          "In an exon",
          "In an intron",
          "In a promoter region",
          "In telomeric DNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exons contain the coding sequence. Mutations in introns, promoters, or non-coding regions may not change the protein product."
