      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the central dogma of molecular biology?",
        "options": [
          "DNA → RNA → Protein",
          "RNA → DNA → Protein",
          "Protein → RNA → DNA",
          "DNA → Protein → RNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The central dogma describes the flow of genetic information: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is translated into protein. This is the fundamental principle of molecular biology."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is transcription?",

          "Making RNA from a DNA template",
          "Making DNA from an RNA template",
          "Synthesizing protein from an RNA template",
          "Copying DNA to produce additional DNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Transcription is the process where a segment of DNA is copied into RNA. The DNA sequence is 'transcribed' into a complementary RNA sequence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is translation?",
        "options": [

          "Making RNA from a DNA template",
          "Converting double-stranded DNA into single strands",
          "Changing existing RNA back into DNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Translation is the process where the RNA sequence (specifically mRNA) is 'translated' into a sequence of amino acids, forming a protein."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does transcription occur in eukaryotic cells?",
        "options": [
          "In the nucleus",
          "In the cytoplasm",
          "At the ribosomes",
          "On the cell membrane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In eukaryotes, transcription occurs in the nucleus where the DNA is located. The RNA then travels to the cytoplasm for translation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where does translation occur in cells?",
        "options": [
          "At ribosomes in the cytoplasm",
          "Inside the nuclear envelope",
          "Directly on the DNA molecule",
          "Exclusively in the mitochondria"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Translation occurs at ribosomes, which are located in the cytoplasm (free) or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the three main types of RNA involved in protein synthesis?",
        "options": [
          "mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA",
          "DNA, RNA, and protein",
          "mRNA, DNA, and tRNA",
          "rRNA, nRNA, and pRNA"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The three key RNAs are: mRNA (messenger - carries genetic code), tRNA (transfer - brings amino acids), and rRNA (ribosomal - forms ribosome structure)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is mRNA called 'messenger' RNA?",
        "options": [
          "It carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes",
          "It facilitates biochemical messages between different cells",
          "It communicates signals between the nucleus and the cytoplasm",
          "It provides the necessary signal for DNA to begin replication"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "mRNA acts as a messenger by carrying the genetic instructions from DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where proteins are made."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of rRNA in protein synthesis?",
        "options": [
          "It forms the structure and catalytic site of ribosomes",
          "It transports specific amino acids to the ribosome",
          "It acts as the primary carrier of the genetic code from DNA",
          "It assists helicase in the unwinding of the DNA double helix"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "rRNA (ribosomal RNA) combines with proteins to form ribosomes. Ribosomes are the 'workbenches' where translation occurs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the central dogma explain how genes work?",
        "options": [
          "Genes (DNA segments) are expressed as proteins through RNA intermediates",
          "Genes directly synthesize proteins without the need for RNA",
          "Proteins generate RNA which then synthesizes new DNA",
          "Genes store information but do not participate in cellular work"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A gene is a DNA sequence that codes for a protein. Through transcription (DNA→RNA) and translation (RNA→protein), the genetic information in the gene is expressed as a functional protein."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the central dogma considered a 'dogma' in biology?",
        "options": [
          "It was a fundamental principle that seemed universally true when proposed",
          "It is a scientific theory that cannot be questioned or tested",
          "It is a principle based on historical biological philosophy",
          "It is an observation that only applies to prokaryotic organisms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Francis Crick called it a 'dogma' in 1958 to emphasize its fundamental importance. While exceptions exist (like reverse transcription), it remains the core framework for understanding genetic information flow."
