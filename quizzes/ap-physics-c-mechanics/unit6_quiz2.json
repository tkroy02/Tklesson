      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on the differential equation $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -\\frac{g}{L}\\theta$, what is the period $T$ of a simple pendulum?",
        "options": [
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{L/g}$",
          "$\\sqrt{g/L}$",
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{g/L}$",
          "$1/(2\\pi) \\sqrt{L/g}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The standard SHM form is $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2\\theta$. Comparing, we identify $\\omega^2 = g/L$, so $\\omega = \\sqrt{g/L}$. The period is $T = 2\\pi/\\omega = 2\\pi/\\sqrt{g/L} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the motion of a pendulum not 'true' SHM for large angles?",
        "options": [
          "The string tension changes.",
          "The restoring torque is proportional to $\\sin\\theta$, not $\\theta$.",
          "Energy is not conserved at large angles.",
          "The moment of inertia increases with angle."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a simple pendulum, the restoring torque is $\\tau = -mgL\\sin\\theta$. True SHM requires a linear restoring torque $\\tau \\propto -\\theta$. Only when $\\theta$ is small does $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$ hold, making the motion approximately SHM. For large angles, the non‑linear $\\sin\\theta$ term causes the period to depend on amplitude."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a pendulum's length is quadrupled ($4L$), what happens to its frequency $f$?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It quadruples.",
          "It stays the same."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Frequency $f = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}$. If $L \\to 4L$, then $\\sqrt{g/L}$ becomes $\\sqrt{g/(4L)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{g/L}$. Thus, the frequency is halved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pendulum clock is taken to a high altitude where $g$ is slightly smaller. To keep the period the same, should you change the length?",
        "options": [
          "Shorten $L$",
          "Lengthen $L$",
          "Keep $L$ the same",
          "Increase the mass $m$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$. If $g$ decreases, $T$ would increase (clock runs slow). To keep $T$ constant, we must decrease $L$ to compensate: $L \\propto g$ for fixed $T$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a pendulum with $\\theta(t) = \\theta_{\\max}\\cos(\\omega t)$, what is the maximum angular acceleration $\\alpha_{\\max}$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\omega \\theta_{\\max}$",
          "$\\omega^2 \\theta_{\\max}$",
          "$g/L$",
          "$\\sqrt{g/L} \\theta_{\\max}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular acceleration: $\\alpha(t) = \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2 \\theta_{\\max}\\cos(\\omega t)$. The maximum magnitude occurs when $|\\cos(\\omega t)| = 1$, giving $\\alpha_{\\max} = \\omega^2 \\theta_{\\max}$. For a pendulum, $\\omega^2 = g/L$, so this also equals $(g/L)\\theta_{\\max}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the potential energy $U(\\theta)$ of a pendulum using the small‑angle approximation?",
        "options": [
          "$mgL(1 - \\cos\\theta)$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} m g L \\theta^2$",
          "$mgL\\theta$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} m L^2 \\omega^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Exact gravitational potential energy relative to the lowest point is $U = mgL(1-\\cos\\theta)$. For small $\\theta$, use the Taylor expansion $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$. Substituting gives $U \\approx mgL\\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}mgL\\theta^2$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the mass of the pendulum bob is doubled, what is the effect on the differential equation $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "The $\\omega^2$ term doubles.",
          "The equation remains unchanged.",
          "The oscillation becomes damped.",
          "The restoring torque becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The restoring torque is $\\tau = -mgL\\sin\\theta \\approx -mgL\\theta$ (small angles). The moment of inertia about the pivot is $I = mL^2$. Using $\\alpha = \\tau/I$, we get $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = \\frac{-mgL\\theta}{mL^2} = -\\frac{g}{L}\\theta$. The mass $m$ cancels, so the equation and thus the period are independent of mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The velocity of the bob at the bottom of the swing is $v_{\\max}$. What is the relationship between $v_{\\max}$ and the angular amplitude $\\theta_{\\max}$?",
        "options": [
          "$v_{\\max} = L\\omega\\theta_{\\max}$",
          "$v_{\\max} = \\sqrt{2gL(1-\\cos\\theta_{\\max})}$",
          "$v_{\\max} = \\sqrt{gL}\\theta_{\\max}$",
          "All of the above are consistent"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "(B) is exact from energy conservation: $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\max}^2 = mgL(1-\\cos\\theta_{\\max})$. For small angles, using $1-\\cos\\theta_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\theta_{\\max}^2$, this becomes $v_{\\max} \\approx \\sqrt{gL}\\theta_{\\max}$, which is (C). Also, in SHM, $v_{\\max} = \\omega A$, where $A = L\\theta_{\\max}$ and $\\omega = \\sqrt{g/L}$, giving $v_{\\max} = L\\sqrt{g/L}\\theta_{\\max} = \\sqrt{gL}\\theta_{\\max}$, which matches (A) if we note $L\\omega = L\\sqrt{g/L} = \\sqrt{gL}$. Thus all three expressions are consistent under the small‑angle approximation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the tension $T$ in the string at the lowest point of the swing for a pendulum with amplitude $\\theta_{\\max}$?",
        "options": [
          "$mg$",
          "$mg \\cos\\theta_{\\max}$",
          "$mg + m\\frac{v_{\\max}^2}{L}$",
          "$mg - m\\omega^2 L$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At the lowest point, the bob moves in a circular arc of radius $L$. The net radial (centripetal) force is $T - mg = m\\frac{v^2}{L}$. Solving for tension gives $T = mg + m\\frac{v^2}{L}$, where $v$ is the speed at the bottom. Since $v$ is maximum there, tension is maximum."

          "$0.5\\text{ m}$",
          "$1.0\\text{ m}$",
          "$2.0\\text{ m}$",
          "$9.8\\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$ with $T = 2\\text{ s}$ and $g \\approx 9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$: $2 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/9.8} \\implies \\sqrt{L/9.8} = 1/\\pi \\implies L/9.8 = 1/\\pi^2$. Since $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8$, we have $L \\approx 1.0\\text{ m}$."
