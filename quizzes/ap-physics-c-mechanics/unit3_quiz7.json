      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves where the potential is $U(x) = ax^4 - bx^2$. If released from rest at $x_0$ (where $U(x_0) = E_0$), what is its speed $v$ at any position $x$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(E_0 - ax^4 + bx^2)}$",
          "$\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(ax^4 - bx^2)}$",
          "$\\frac{1}{m}(E_0 - ax^4 + bx^2)$",
          "$\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(E_0 + ax^4 - bx^2)}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By conservation of mechanical energy: $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + (ax^4 - bx^2)$. Solving for $v$: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = E_0 - (ax^4 - bx^2) = E_0 - ax^4 + bx^2$. Therefore, $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(E_0 - ax^4 + bx^2)}$. This is a direct application of $K = E - U$."

        "question": "A block ($m$) is attached to a cubic spring where $F(x) = -kx^3$. If released from $x=A$, what is its maximum speed?",
        "options": [
          "$A^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2m}}$",
          "$A \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$",
          "$A^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$",
          "$\\frac{kA^4}{4m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find potential energy: $U(x) = -\\int_{0}^{x} F(x') dx' = -\\int_{0}^{x} (-kx'^3) dx' = \\int_{0}^{x} kx'^3 dx' = \\frac{1}{4}kx^4$. Initial energy: $E = U(A) = \\frac{1}{4}kA^4$. Maximum speed occurs when $U(x)=0$ (at $x=0$). Then $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2$. Equating: $\\frac{1}{4}kA^4 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 \\Rightarrow v_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^4}{2m}} = A^2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2m}}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total energy at launch: $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GmM}{R} = \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{GM}{R}\\right) - \\frac{GmM}{R} = -\\frac{GmM}{2R}$. At maximum distance, kinetic energy is zero: $E = -\\frac{GmM}{r_{max}}$. Equating: $-\\frac{GmM}{2R} = -\\frac{GmM}{r_{max}} \\Rightarrow r_{max} = 2R$. This is exactly the radius for a circular orbit at the launch speed, but here it describes the apogee of a radial trajectory."

          "$\\sqrt{2gL}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial height: $y_i = cL^2$. Final height: $y_f = 0$. Conservation of mechanical energy: $mgy_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. So $mg(cL^2) = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\Rightarrow v = \\sqrt{2gcL^2}$. The path shape doesn't matter for speed (only height difference) since the wire is frictionless and normal force does no work."

          "$E_f = K_f + W_f$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The work-energy theorem extended to include potential energy states: $\\Delta E_{mech} = W_{nc}$, where $W_{nc}$ is work done by non-conservative forces. Thus, $E_f - E_i = W_f$, so $E_f = E_i + W_f$. For friction, $W_f$ is negative, so $E_f < E_i$."

          "$E \\ge A/B$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A particle is 'unbound' if it can reach $r \\to \\infty$ with non-negative kinetic energy. Since $U(\\infty) = 0$, the condition is $E \\ge 0$. At $E = 0$, the particle reaches infinity with zero speed. This is analogous to escape velocity for gravitational potentials (where $A=0, B=GMm$)."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elastic potential energy converts entirely to gravitational potential energy: $\\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = mgh$. On the incline, the height gained is $h = d \\sin \\phi$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = mg(d \\sin \\phi) \\Rightarrow d = \\frac{kx^2}{2mg \\sin \\phi}$."

        "explanation": "$\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\hat{j}\\right)$. $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = 6xy$, at $(1,2)$: $6(1)(2)=12$. $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = 3x^2 + 3y^2$, at $(1,2)$: $3(1)^2 + 3(2)^2 = 3 + 12 = 15$. Therefore, $\\vec{F} = -(12\\hat{i} + 15\\hat{j}) = -12\\hat{i} - 15\\hat{j}$."

          "$\\int P dx = \\int Q dy$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a force to be conservative in 2D, the curl must vanish: $\\nabla \\times \\vec{F} = \\mathbf{0}$. In component form, this gives $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = 0$, or equivalently $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}$. This ensures the existence of a potential function $U(x,y)$ such that $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$."

        "explanation": "The vertical drop from release point to bottom is $h = L - L\\cos\\theta = L(1-\\cos\\theta)$. Conservation of energy: $mgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\Rightarrow mgL(1-\\cos\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Solving: $v = \\sqrt{2gL(1-\\cos\\theta)}$.
