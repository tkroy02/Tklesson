        "question": "A variable torque $\\tau(\\theta) = k\\theta^2$ is applied to a stationary disk with moment of inertia $I$. What is the angular velocity $\\omega$ after the disk has rotated through an angle $\\phi$?",

        "explanation": "Work done by the torque: $W = \\int_0^{\\phi} \\tau(\\theta) d\\theta = \\int_0^{\\phi} k\\theta^2 d\\theta = \\frac{1}{3}k\\phi^3$. By the Work‑Energy Theorem, $W = \\Delta K = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 - 0$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}k\\phi^3 = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$, so $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k\\phi^3}{3I}}$."

The moment of inertia about the pivot is $I = \\frac{1}{3}ML^2$. By the Work‑Energy Theorem: $\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 = Mg(L/2) \\implies \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{3}ML^2)\\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2}MgL$.

The work done to stretch a spring is $W = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(R\\theta)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kR^2\\theta^2$.
