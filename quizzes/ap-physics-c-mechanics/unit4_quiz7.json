          "$133.3\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Change in momentum: $\\Delta p = \\int_0^{0.01} (10^4 t - 10^6 t^2) dt = \\left[5000t^2 - \\frac{10^6}{3}t^3\\right]_0^{0.01} = 5000(10^{-4}) - \\frac{10^6}{3}(10^{-6}) = 0.5 - 0.333\\ldots = 0.1666\\ldots\\text{ N·s}$.

        "question": "A block of mass $m$ compresses a non‑linear spring with a force law $F(x) = -kx^3$. If the block has initial velocity $v_0$, what is the maximum compression $x_{\\text{max}}$?",

Integrating: $\\frac{1}{4}kx^4 \\big|_0^{x_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{1}{4}k x_{\\text{max}}^4 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$.

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Force is the negative gradient of potential: $F = -\\frac{dU}{dr}$. $U(r) = A r^{-12}$, so $\\frac{dU}{dr} = -12A r^{-13}$. Thus, $F = -(-12A r^{-13}) = \\frac{12A}{r^{13}}$. This is a repulsive force (positive for $A>0$), typical of hard‑core repulsion."

In time $dt$, a mass $dm = \\rho(Av\\,dt)$ hits the wall. So $\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\rho A v$, and $F = v (\\rho A v) = \\rho A v^2$."

Then $F = \\frac{d}{dt}[m(t)v(t)]$. Since $F$ is constant and $v(0)=0$, integrate from 0 to $t$: $Ft = m(t)v(t) - 0$. Thus $v(t) = \\frac{Ft}{M+Rt}$."
