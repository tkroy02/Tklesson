      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass $m$ is attached to a spring $k$. If the position is $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, find the acceleration $a(t)$ using the second derivative.",
        "options": [
          "$-A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$",
          "$-A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$",
          "$A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$",
          "$-A\\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First derivative: $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = -A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. Second derivative: $a(t) = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}[-A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)] = -A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$. This is the acceleration function."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the differential equation $m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0$, what value of $\\omega$ satisfies this equation?",
        "options": [
          "$k/m$",
          "$\\sqrt{m/k}$",
          "$\\sqrt{k/m}$",
          "$m/k$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Assume a solution of the form $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$. Then $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x$. Substituting into the equation: $m(-\\omega^2 x) + kx = 0 \\implies (-m\\omega^2 + k)x = 0$. For non‑trivial solutions, $-m\\omega^2 + k = 0 \\implies \\omega^2 = k/m$, so $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The total energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. What is the result of the time derivative $dE/dt$ for an ideal oscillator?",

          "$ma + kx$",

          "$0$",
          "$kA^2\\omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Differentiate: $\\frac{dE}{dt} = mv\\frac{dv}{dt} + kx\\frac{dx}{dt} = v(ma) + kx(v) = v(ma + kx)$. For SHM, $ma = -kx$, so $ma + kx = 0$. Thus, $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$, confirming that total mechanical energy is constant."

          "$2\\pi\\sqrt{d/g}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At static equilibrium, the spring force balances weight: $kd = mg \\implies k/m = g/d$. For a mass‑spring system, $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$, so $\\omega = \\sqrt{g/d}$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Velocity in SHM is $v(t) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. The sine function oscillates between $\\pm 1$, so the maximum speed (magnitude) is $v_{\\max} = A\\omega$."

          "$F = dU/dt$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a conservative one‑dimensional force, the force is the negative gradient of the potential energy: $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. Differentiating $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ gives $\\frac{dU}{dx} = kx$, so $F(x) = -kx$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Initial condition: $x(0) = A\\cos(\\phi) = A$. Therefore, $\\cos(\\phi) = 1$, which is satisfied when $\\phi = 0$ (or any integer multiple of $2\\pi$)."

          "$\\frac{3}{4}v_{\\max}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the energy relation $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, solve for $v$: $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}(A^2 - x^2)} = \\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - x^2}$. Substitute $x = A/2$: $v = \\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - A^2/4} = \\omega A\\sqrt{3/4} = v_{\\max} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, since $v_{\\max} = A\\omega$."

          "It is not periodic.",
          "The acceleration is not proportional to the first power of displacement.",
          "Energy is not conserved.",
          "The frequency is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "SHM is defined by a linear restoring force $F \\propto -x$, leading to the differential equation $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x$ with constant $\\omega$. For $F = -kx^3$, Newton's second law gives $\\ddot{x} = -(k/m)x^3$, which is not of the form $\\ddot{x} \\propto -x$. The motion is still periodic and energy‑conserving, but the period depends on amplitude, violating the definition of SHM."

          "The mass did not move.",
          "The spring force is non‑conservative.",
          "The net work done by the spring over a closed path is zero.",
          "The velocity is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Power is the rate of work: $P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$. Integrating over a full cycle gives the net work done by the force over that cycle: $W_{\\text{cycle}} = \\oint P dt = \\oint F v dt = \\oint F dx$. For a conservative force like the spring force, the work done over any closed path is zero. This confirms that the spring force conserves energy."
