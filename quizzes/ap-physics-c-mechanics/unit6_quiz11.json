      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The displacement of an object is $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$. At what time $t$ is the magnitude of the velocity $|v|$ increasing most rapidly?",
        "options": [
          "$t = 0$",
          "$t = T/4$",
          "$t = T/8$",
          "$t = T/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The magnitude of velocity is $|v| = A\\omega|\\sin(\\omega t)|$. Its rate of change is $\\frac{d|v|}{dt} = A\\omega^2|\\cos(\\omega t)|$ (considering sign separately). This rate is maximized when $|\\cos(\\omega t)| = 1$, which occurs at $t = 0, T/2, T$, etc. Equivalently, the acceleration magnitude $|a| = A\\omega^2|\\cos(\\omega t)|$ is maximum at those times."

        "question": "A particle moves in a potential $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Which integral represents the time it takes to travel from $x=0$ to $x=A/2$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\int_{0}^{A/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k/m(A^2-x^2)}} dx$",
          "$\\int_{0}^{A/2} \\frac{k}{m}x dx$",
          "$\\int_{0}^{A/2} \\sqrt{A^2-x^2} dx$",
          "$\\int_{0}^{A/2} \\frac{1}{\\omega x} dx$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From energy conservation: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, so $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}(A^2 - x^2)} = \\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - x^2}$ where $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$. Since $v = dx/dt$, we have $dt = \\frac{dx}{v} = \\frac{dx}{\\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - x^2}}$. Integrating from $0$ to $A/2$ gives the time."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the force on a particle is $F(x) = -kx + cx^2$, why is this motion non‑SHM for large $x$?",
        "options": [
          "The force is not always restoring.",
          "The potential energy is not quadratic.",
          "The differential equation is non‑linear.",
          "All of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "SHM requires a linear restoring force ($F \\propto -x$). Here, the $cx^2$ term makes the force non‑linear, so the differential equation is non‑linear. The potential is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 - \\frac{1}{3}cx^3$, which is not purely quadratic. For large enough $x$, the $+cx^2$ term can dominate, making $F$ positive (away from equilibrium) on one side, so the force is not always restoring."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass‑spring system is submerged in a fluid where $F_{drag} = -bv$. The power dissipated by the fluid at any instant is:",
        "options": [
          "$-bv$",
          "$-bv^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}bv^2$",
          "$-b \\frac{dv}{dt}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Power is $P = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}$. The drag force is $\\vec{F}_{drag} = -b\\vec{v}$, so $P = (-b\\vec{v}) \\cdot \\vec{v} = -bv^2$. The negative sign indicates energy is being removed from the mechanical system."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of the second derivative of position, $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$, at the exact moment the potential energy is zero?",

          "$-\\omega^2 A$",
          "$0$",
          "$\\omega^2 A$",
          "$g$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a spring, potential energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is zero only when $x = 0$. The acceleration is given by $a = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2 x$. At $x=0$, $a = 0$."

        "question": "A physical pendulum has a moment of inertia $I$. If you apply the small‑angle approximation to the torque equation $I\\alpha = -mgd\\sin\\theta$, the resulting angular frequency is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{g/d}$",

          "$\\sqrt{mgd/I}$",
          "$mgd/I$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$, the equation becomes $I\\ddot{\\theta} = -mgd\\theta$ or $\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{mgd}{I}\\theta = 0$. Comparing to $\\ddot{\\theta} + \\omega^2\\theta = 0$, we have $\\omega^2 = \\frac{mgd}{I}$, so $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{mgd}{I}}$."

          "$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{4}kA^2$",
          "$0$",
          "$kA^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$U(t) = \\frac{1}{2}kx(t)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2\\sin^2(\\omega t)$. The average of $\\sin^2(\\omega t)$ over a period is $1/2$. Therefore, $U_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}kA^2$."

        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "$T' < T_0$",
          "$T' > T_0$",
          "$T' = T_0$",
          "$T' = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The damped angular frequency is $\\omega' = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\gamma^2}$, which is less than the natural frequency $\\omega_0$. Since period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$, a smaller $\\omega$ means a larger period. Thus, $T' > T_0$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring is compressed a distance $x$ by a constant force $F_{\\text{ext}}$. The work done by the external force is $F_{\\text{ext}}x$, but the energy stored in the spring is $\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Why is there a difference?",
        "options": [
          "Calculus error: $F$ is not constant during compression.",
          "The rest of the work was converted to kinetic energy.",
          "Energy is lost to heat.",
          "Spring constant changes with distance."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $F_{\\text{ext}}$ is constant and the spring force is $F_{\\text{spring}} = -kx$, then the net force is $F_{\\text{ext}} - kx$. This net force accelerates the mass, giving it kinetic energy. The work‑energy theorem: $W_{\\text{ext}} = \\Delta U_{\\text{spring}} + \\Delta K$. So the 'extra' work $F_{\\text{ext}}x - \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ equals the kinetic energy gained."

        "question": "In a driven oscillator at resonance, the work done by the driving force per cycle is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Minimum",
          "Maximum",
          "Negative"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At resonance, the driving force is in phase with the velocity. Instantaneous power $P(t) = F(t)v(t)$ is always positive (or always negative, depending on sign convention), so energy is continuously fed into the oscillator. The work per cycle, $W = \\oint F dx = \\int_0^T P dt$, is maximized because the force and velocity are aligned throughout the cycle."
