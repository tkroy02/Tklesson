      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle of mass $m = 3\\text{ kg}$ is subjected to a force $F(t) = 12t^2$. If the particle starts from rest, what is its momentum at $t = 2\\text{ s}$?",
        "options": [
          "$8\\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m/s}$",
          "$24\\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m/s}$",
          "$32\\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m/s}$",
          "$48\\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Change in momentum equals impulse: $\\Delta p = \\int F \\, dt = \\int_0^2 12t^2 \\, dt = [4t^3]_0^2 = 4(8) - 0 = 32\\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m/s}$. Since initial momentum is zero, final momentum is $32\\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m/s}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sand-hauling truck leaks sand at a constant rate $\\lambda = dm/dt$. If a constant force $F$ is applied to the truck, which expression correctly represents Newton's Second Law for the system?",
        "options": [
          "$F = ma$",
          "$F = m\\frac{dv}{dt} + v\\lambda$",
          "$F = m\\frac{dv}{dt} - v\\lambda$",
          "$F = v\\lambda$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's Second Law in its general form is $F_{net} = \\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(mv)$. For mass changing at rate $\\lambda = \\frac{dm}{dt}$, the product rule gives $\\frac{d}{dt}(mv) = m\\frac{dv}{dt} + v\\frac{dm}{dt} = m\\frac{dv}{dt} + v\\lambda$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block is pushed by a force $F(x) = F_0 e^{-kx}$. What is the acceleration of the block as a function of position $x$?",

          "$\\frac{F_0}{m} e^{-kx}$",
          "$-\\frac{k F_0}{m} e^{-kx}$",
          "$\\frac{F_0}{mk} e^{-kx}$",
          "$F_0 e^{-kx}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At any instant, Newton's Second Law gives $a(x) = F(x)/m$, assuming no other forces. Therefore, $a(x) = \\frac{F_0}{m} e^{-kx}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object of mass $m$ is subject to a spring force $F = -kx$. Which differential equation represents this motion?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{k}{m}x = 0$",
          "$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\frac{k}{m}x = 0$",
          "$\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{k}{m}x = 0$",
          "$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \\frac{k}{m}x = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$F = ma$ gives $-kx = m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$. Rearranging: $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\frac{k}{m}x = 0$, which is the differential equation for simple harmonic motion."

          "$mg/c$",
          "$\\sqrt{mg/c}$",
          "$(mg/c)^2$",
          "$c/mg$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At terminal velocity, net force is zero: $mg - cv_T^2 = 0$ (taking downward positive). Solve: $cv_T^2 = mg \\Rightarrow v_T^2 = \\frac{mg}{c} \\Rightarrow v_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{mg}{c}}$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $F = ma$, $m$ refers to inertial mass, while in $F = mg$, $m$ refers to gravitational mass. The Principle of Equivalence states that:",
        "options": [
          "Inertial mass is always greater than gravitational mass.",
          "They are conceptually different but experimentally equal.",
          "They are only equal in a vacuum.",
          "Gravitational mass depends on the speed of the object."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Equivalence Principle (a cornerstone of general relativity) asserts that inertial mass and gravitational mass are physically equivalent. All experiments to date confirm they are equal to a very high precision, which is why the same symbol $m$ is used in both expressions."

        "question": "A rope of mass $M$ and length $L$ is pulled by a force $F$ on a frictionless surface. What is the tension $T$ in the rope at a distance $x$ from the end where the force is applied?",

          "$F(1 - x/L)$",
          "$F(L/x)$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The entire rope accelerates with $a = F/M$. Consider the segment from $x$ to $L$ (mass $M(L-x)/L$). The tension $T$ must accelerate this segment: $T = \\left(\\frac{M(L-x)}{L}\\right) a = \\frac{M(L-x)}{L} \\cdot \\frac{F}{M} = F\\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)$."

        "options": [
          "$g$",
          "$m_2 g / m_1$",
          "$m_2 g / (m_1 + m_2)$",
          "$(m_1 + m_2)g / m_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The net external force accelerating the system is the weight of the hanging mass: $F_{net} = m_2g$. The total mass being accelerated is $m_1 + m_2$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{F_{net}}{m_{total}} = \\frac{m_2g}{m_1 + m_2}$."

          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Impulse = $\\int_0^{\\pi/\\omega} F(t) \\, dt = F_0 \\int_0^{\\pi/\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\, dt = F_0 \\left[-\\frac{\\cos(\\omega t)}{\\omega}\\right]_0^{\\pi/\\omega} = \\frac{F_0}{\\omega}[-\\cos(\\pi) + \\cos(0)] = \\frac{F_0}{\\omega}(1 + 1) = \\frac{2F_0}{\\omega}$. Change in velocity $\\Delta v = \\frac{\\text{Impulse}}{m} = \\frac{2F_0}{m\\omega}$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For equilibrium, $\\sum \\mathbf{F} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{F}_1 + \\mathbf{F}_2 + \\mathbf{F}_3 = 0$. Compute $\\mathbf{F}_1 + \\mathbf{F}_2 = (3-2)\\hat{i} + (4+5)\\hat{j} = 1\\hat{i} + 9\\hat{j}$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{F}_3 = - (1\\hat{i} + 9\\hat{j}) = -1\\hat{i} - 9\\hat{j}$."
