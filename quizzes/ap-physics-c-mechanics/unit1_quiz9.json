    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a $v$-$t$ graph, the slope of the tangent line at any specific point $t$ represents:",
        "options": [
          "Average acceleration",
          "Instantaneous acceleration",
          "Total displacement",
          "Average velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time: $a(t) = \\frac{dv}{dt}$. On a velocity-time graph, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line at that point, representing the instantaneous acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The area under an $a$-$t$ curve between $t_1$ and $t_2$ represents:",
        "options": [
          "Instantaneous velocity",
          "Change in position ($\\Delta x$)",
          "Change in velocity ($\\Delta v$)",
          "Average acceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $a = \\frac{dv}{dt}$, integrating acceleration over a time interval gives the change in velocity: $\\Delta v = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} a(t) \\, dt$, which is the net area under the $a$-$t$ curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a position-time graph $x(t)$ is concave down ($\\cap$ shape), what does this indicate about the motion?",
        "options": [
          "The velocity is positive.",
          "The velocity is constant.",
          "The acceleration is negative.",
          "The particle is at rest."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Concavity is determined by the second derivative. For a position-time graph, the second derivative is acceleration: $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = a(t)$. Concave down means $a(t) < 0$ (negative acceleration)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point of inflection on an $x$-$t$ graph (where concavity changes) corresponds to:",
        "options": [
          "Maximum velocity",
          "Zero velocity",
          "A point where acceleration is zero",
          "A point where the particle changes direction"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An inflection point occurs where the second derivative changes sign. For $x(t)$, the second derivative is acceleration, so an inflection point corresponds to a moment when $a(t) = 0$. This is where acceleration changes sign, not necessarily where velocity is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The definite integral $\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) dt$ represents:",
        "options": [
          "Total distance traveled",
          "Net displacement",
          "Average acceleration",
          "Instantaneous position"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The integral of velocity over time gives displacement: $\\Delta x = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) \\, dt$. This is the net change in position, which accounts for direction. Total distance would require integrating the speed $|v(t)|$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a graph of velocity $v$ versus position $x$, the acceleration $a$ can be found by:",
        "options": [
          "The slope of the graph.",
          "The area under the graph.",
          "Multiplying the velocity $v$ by the slope $dv/dx$.",
          "Squaring the slope."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using the chain rule: $a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dv}{dx} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{dv}{dx} \\cdot v$. Therefore, acceleration is the product of the velocity $v$ and the slope $\\frac{dv}{dx}$ of the $v$-$x$ graph."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the area under a $v$-$t$ graph from $t=0$ to $t=2$ is $10\\text{ m}$, and the initial position is $x(0) = 5\\text{ m}$, what is the position at $t=2$?",
        "options": [
          "$5\\text{ m}$",
          "$10\\text{ m}$",
          "$15\\text{ m}$",
          "$20\\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The area under the $v$-$t$ graph gives the displacement from $t=0$ to $t=2$: $\\Delta x = 10\\text{ m}$. Final position = initial position + displacement: $x(2) = x(0) + \\Delta x = 5 + 10 = 15\\text{ m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the $v$-$t$ graph is a straight diagonal line, the corresponding $a$-$t$ graph is:",
        "options": [
          "A diagonal line with the same slope.",
          "A horizontal line.",
          "A parabola.",
          "Zero everywhere."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A straight line on a $v$-$t$ graph means velocity is a linear function: $v(t) = mt + b$. Acceleration is the derivative: $a(t) = m$, a constant. Therefore, the $a$-$t$ graph is a horizontal line at height $m$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the slope of the $x$-$t$ graph is zero, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "The acceleration is zero.",
          "The velocity is zero.",
          "The particle is at the origin.",
          "The particle is speeding up."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The slope of the position-time graph is the velocity: $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$. Zero slope means $v = 0$ at that instant. However, acceleration could be non-zero, and the particle may not be at the origin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the total distance from a $v$-$t$ graph that crosses the $t$-axis, you must:",
        "options": [
          "Find the net area (sum of positive and negative areas).",
          "Take the absolute value of the total net area.",
          "Sum the absolute values of the individual areas.",
          "Find the slope of the graph."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total distance is the integral of speed $|v(t)|$. If the $v$-$t$ graph goes above and below the $t$-axis, you must compute the area of each region separately, taking each as positive, and then sum them. This is not the same as the absolute value of the net area (which would give a smaller number if cancellations occur)."

        "50": "Good foundation. Focus on: slope of $v$-$t$ graph gives $a$, area under $a$-$t$ gives $\\Delta v$, area under $v$-$t$ gives $\\Delta x$, and concavity of $x$-$t$ gives $a$.",
        "0": "Start with the fundamental graphical relationships: slope = derivative, area = integral. For motion: $x$-$t$ slope = $v$; $v$-$t$ slope = $a$; $v$-$t$ area = $\\Delta x$; $a$-$t$ area = $\\Delta v$."
