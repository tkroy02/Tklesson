      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When calculating the moment of inertia of a flat rectangular plate ($L \\times W$) about an axis through its center and parallel to the width $W$, which dimension determines the inertia?",
        "options": [
          "$W$ only",
          "$L$ only",
          "Both $L$ and $W$ equally",
          "Neither; only mass matters"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the axis is parallel to the width $W$, the perpendicular distance of mass elements from the axis depends only on the length $L$. The plate behaves like a rod of length $L$ (with width $W$ extending perpendicular to the axis). The formula is $I = \\frac{1}{12}ML^2$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A non‑uniform rod of length $L$ has a linear density $\\lambda(x) = \\lambda_0 (x/L)$. What is the total mass $M$ of the rod?",
        "options": [
          "$\\lambda_0 L$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_0 L$",
          "$\\frac{1}{3}\\lambda_0 L$",
          "$\\lambda_0 L^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$M = \\int_0^L \\lambda(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\lambda_0 \\frac{x}{L} dx = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{L} \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^L = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{L} \\cdot \\frac{L^2}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_0 L$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the rod from Question 2, what is the moment of inertia $I$ about the end at $x=0$?",

          "$\\frac{2}{3} ML^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$I = \\int_0^L x^2 dm = \\int_0^L x^2 \\left(\\lambda_0 \\frac{x}{L}\\right) dx = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{L} \\int_0^L x^3 dx = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{L} \\cdot \\frac{L^4}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\\lambda_0 L^3$.\nFrom Q2, $M = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_0 L \\Rightarrow \\lambda_0 L = 2M$.\nThus, $I = \\frac{1}{4}(2M)L^2 = \\frac{1}{2}ML^2$."

        "options": [
          "Concentric shells",
          "Flat disks",
          "Thin rods",
          "Both A and B are valid methods"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Both methods work: (1) Integrate thin concentric spherical shells of radius $r$, each with $I_{shell} = \\frac{2}{3}r^2 dm$; (2) Integrate thin disks perpendicular to the axis, each with $I_{disk} = \\frac{1}{2}r^2 dm$. The second method requires relating the disk radius to the sphere's radius at each height."

        "options": [
          "$M$",
          "$2\\pi R \\cdot \\rho$",
          "$M/R$",
          "$\\int \\rho \\, dV$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a thin hoop, all mass is at distance $R$ from the axis. The moment of inertia is $I = \\int R^2 dm = R^2 \\int dm = MR^2$. The tiny thickness $dr$ is irrelevant for the $r^2$ factor because $r \\approx R$ for every element."

        "question": "For a 2D object in the $xy$-plane, if $I_x = 10 \\text{ kg·m}^2$ and $I_y = 15 \\text{ kg·m}^2$, what is $I_z$?",

          "$\\sqrt{10^2 + 15^2} \\text{ kg·m}^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perpendicular Axis Theorem: $I_z = I_x + I_y$. Here, $I_z = 10 + 15 = 25\\text{ kg·m}^2$."

          "$3L/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The center of mass of a uniform rod is at its midpoint, $L/2$. The distance between the axis at $L/4$ and the CM at $L/2$ is $D = L/2 - L/4 = L/4$."

        "question": "If a solid sphere ($I = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2$) and a hollow sphere ($I = \\frac{2}{3}MR^2$) are made of the same material and have the same mass, which is larger?",
        "options": [
          "The solid sphere (it's denser)",
          "The hollow sphere (it has a larger radius)",
          "They have the same radius",
          "Not enough information"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For the same mass and material, the hollow sphere must have a larger outer radius because it contains empty space. Since $I \\propto MR^2$ (with different coefficients), the larger $R$ of the hollow sphere generally makes its $I$ larger, though the exact comparison depends on the specific geometry and wall thickness."

        "explanation": "$I = \\int r^2 dm$ with $dm = \\rho(r) \\, dV = Cr \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 dr = 4\\pi C r^3 dr$. Then $I = \\int_0^R r^2 (4\\pi C r^3 dr) = 4\\pi C \\int_0^R r^5 dr$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The definition of moment of inertia for a point mass is $I = m r^2$, where $r$ is the perpendicular distance from the mass to the axis of rotation. This is the fundamental building block for all other inertia calculations."
