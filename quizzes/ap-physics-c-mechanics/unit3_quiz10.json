      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A motor pulls a block with a constant force $\\vec{F} = 20\\hat{i} + 10\\hat{j}$ N. At a specific moment, the block's velocity is $\\vec{v} = 3\\hat{i} - 2\\hat{j}$ m/s. What is the instantaneous power delivered by the motor?",
        "options": [
          "$40$ W",
          "$80$ W",
          "$50$ W",
          "$70$ W"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Instantaneous power is given by the dot product: $P = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v} = F_x v_x + F_y v_y = (20)(3) + (10)(-2) = 60 - 20 = 40$ W. The negative $v_y$ component reduces power because the force and velocity have opposite y-directions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The work done by a machine as a function of time is $W(t) = 2t^3 + 5t$. What is the instantaneous power at $t = 2$ seconds?",
        "options": [
          "$21$ W",
          "$29$ W",
          "$16$ W",
          "$26$ W"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Power is the time derivative of work: $P(t) = \\frac{dW}{dt}$. Here, $\\frac{d}{dt}(2t^3 + 5t) = 6t^2 + 5$. Evaluating at $t=2$: $P(2) = 6(2)^2 + 5 = 6\\times4 + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29$ W."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object of mass $m$ starts from rest and accelerates with constant acceleration $a$. How does the instantaneous power $P$ delivered to the object vary with time $t$?",
        "options": [
          "$P \\propto t$",
          "$P \\propto t^2$",
          "$P$ is constant.",
          "$P \\propto \\sqrt{t}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With constant acceleration, velocity $v = at$. The net force is constant: $F = ma$. Power $P = Fv = (ma)(at) = ma^2 t$. Thus, power increases linearly with time ($P \\propto t$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car moves at a constant speed $v$ against a resistive force (drag) proportional to the square of its speed, $F_{drag} = bv^2$. What is the power required to maintain this speed?",
        "options": [
          "$bv^2$",
          "$bv^3$",
          "$2bv$",
          "$bv$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At constant speed, the net force is zero, so the engine's forward force must equal the drag force: $F_{engine} = bv^2$. Power is $P = F_{engine} v = (bv^2)(v) = bv^3$. This cubic relationship shows why high-speed driving requires dramatically more power."

        "options": [
          "Total Energy",
          "Kinetic Energy",
          "Instantaneous Power",
          "Acceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$, the derivative of the work-time function is the instantaneous power. Graphically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point."

        "question": "A $1000$ kg elevator rises at a constant speed of $2$ m/s. What is the power delivered by the tension in the cable? ($g = 10 \\text{ m/s}^2$)",
        "options": [
          "$2,000$ W",
          "$10,000$ W",
          "$20,000$ W",
          "$5,000$ W"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At constant speed, net force is zero, so tension $T = mg = 1000 \\times 10 = 10,000$ N. Power delivered by tension: $P = T \\cdot v = (10,000 \\text{ N}) \\times (2 \\text{ m/s}) = 20,000$ W. (Note: This is the power input; motor power might differ due to efficiency.)"

        "question": "If the power delivered to a particle is constant, its kinetic energy $K$ as a function of time $t$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$K \\propto t$",
          "$K \\propto t^2$",
          "$K \\propto \\sqrt{t}$",
          "$K$ is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From $P = \\frac{dK}{dt}$, if $P$ is constant, then $\\frac{dK}{dt} = P \\Rightarrow dK = P dt$. Integrating: $K(t) = Pt + K_0$, where $K_0$ is initial kinetic energy. Thus, kinetic energy increases linearly with time."

          "$1,250$ N",
          "$50,000$ N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $P = Fv$, solve for force: $F = \\frac{P}{v} = \\frac{50,000 \\text{ W}}{25 \\text{ m/s}} = 2,000$ N. This assumes all engine power is used for pulling against resistance at constant speed."

        "question": "A force $F$ acts on an object such that its position is $x(t) = t^3$. If $F$ is constant, the power $P$ is proportional to:",

          "$t$",
          "$1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity: $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = 3t^2$. Power: $P(t) = F v(t) = F(3t^2) = 3F t^2$. Since $F$ is constant, $P \\propto t^2$."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "1 Watt = 1 Joule/second = 1 (N·m)/s. Since 1 N = 1 kg·m/s², we have: 1 W = (kg·m/s² · m) / s = kg·m²/s³. Option D (N·m) is Joule, not Watt."
