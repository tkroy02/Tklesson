    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A force is considered 'conservative' if and only if the work done by the force on an object moving between two points is:",
        "options": [
          "Proportional to the velocity of the object.",
          "Independent of the path taken between the points.",
          "Always equal to the change in kinetic energy.",
          "Zero along any straight-line path."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The fundamental mathematical definition of a conservative force is that the line integral $\\int_A^B \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}$ depends only on the endpoints $A$ and $B$, not on the specific path taken. This path independence allows us to define a potential energy function $U(\\vec{r})$ such that $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct calculus-based relationship between a 1D conservative force $F(x)$ and its associated potential energy $U(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$F(x) = \\frac{dU}{dx}$",
          "$F(x) = -\\int U(x) \\, dx$",
          "$F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$",
          "$F(x) = \\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In one dimension, the conservative force is the negative derivative of the potential energy: $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. The negative sign indicates that the force points in the direction of decreasing potential energy. This is the gradient relationship in 1D."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The potential energy function for a certain system is given by $U(x) = \\alpha x^3 - \\beta x$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are constants. Find the expression for the force $F(x)$ acting on the system.",
        "options": [
          "$3\\alpha x^2 - \\beta$",
          "$-3\\alpha x^2 + \\beta$",
          "$\\frac{\\alpha}{4}x^4 - \\frac{\\beta}{2}x^2$",
          "$-\\alpha x^2 + \\beta$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Applying $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$: $\\frac{d}{dx}(\\alpha x^3 - \\beta x) = 3\\alpha x^2 - \\beta$. Therefore, $F(x) = -(3\\alpha x^2 - \\beta) = -3\\alpha x^2 + \\beta$. This gives the force as a function of position."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves in a circular path of radius $R$ and returns to its starting point. If the only force acting on it is the conservative force of gravity, what is the net work done?",
        "options": [
          "$mg(2\\pi R)$",
          "$mgR$",
          "$0$ J",
          "It depends on the speed of the object."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For any conservative force, the work done over a closed path (where start and end points are identical) is zero: $\\oint \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r} = 0$. This is a direct consequence of path independence and is mathematically equivalent to $\\nabla \\times \\vec{F} = 0$ for the force field."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A potential energy graph $U(x)$ shows a 'well' (a local minimum) at $x = x_0$. What is the state of the particle at this point?",
        "options": [
          "Unstable equilibrium",
          "Stable equilibrium",
          "Maximum kinetic energy",
          "Neutral equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At a local minimum of $U(x)$, the force $F = -dU/dx = 0$, so it's an equilibrium point. Since the curvature $d^2U/dx^2 > 0$, any small displacement creates a restoring force ($F = -k\\Delta x$ for small $\\Delta x$), making it a stable equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a force is given by $\\vec{F} = (2xy)\\hat{i} + (x^2)\\hat{j}$, is this force conservative? (Hint: Check if $\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}$)",
        "options": [
          "Yes",
          "No",
          "Only if $x=y$",
          "Only at the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In 2D, a force $\\vec{F} = F_x\\hat{i} + F_y\\hat{j}$ is conservative if $\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}$. Here, $\\frac{\\partial (2xy)}{\\partial y} = 2x$ and $\\frac{\\partial (x^2)}{\\partial x} = 2x$. They are equal, so the force is conservative. This means it can be written as $-\\nabla U$ for some $U(x,y)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves from $x=1$ to $x=3$ in a potential field $U(x) = 10/x$. What is the work done by the conservative force?",
        "options": [
          "$10/3 - 10$",
          "$-(10/3 - 10)$",
          "$10 \\ln(3)$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a conservative force, $W_{cons} = -\\Delta U = -(U_f - U_i)$. Here, $U_i = 10/1 = 10$ J, $U_f = 10/3$ J. So $W_{cons} = -(10/3 - 10) = -(-20/3) = 20/3 \\approx 6.67$ J. Positive work indicates the force is in the direction of motion, moving to lower potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following forces is non-conservative?",
        "options": [
          "Gravitational force ($F = mg$)",
          "Spring force ($F = -kx$)",
          "Static friction force",
          "Kinetic friction force"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Kinetic friction is a classic non-conservative force. Its work depends on the path length and direction (always opposing motion), making it impossible to define a potential energy function. Static friction, while not conservative, does no work in pure rolling without slipping."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'stiffness' or effective spring constant of a potential energy well can be found using which calculus operation?",
        "options": [
          "The first derivative of $U(x)$",
          "The second derivative of $U(x)$ evaluated at the minimum",
          "The integral of $U(x)$",
          "The negative of the potential function"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Near a stable equilibrium at $x_0$, we can approximate $U(x) \\approx U(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2}k_{eff}(x-x_0)^2$, where $k_{eff} = \\left.\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}\\right|_{x=x_0}$. This is the curvature of the potential well, determining the oscillation frequency for small displacements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Total Mechanical Energy ($E = K + U$) is conserved only when:",
        "options": [
          "The net work done by all forces is zero.",
          "No non-conservative forces do work on the system.",
          "The object moves at a constant velocity.",
          "The potential energy is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The conservation of mechanical energy ($\\Delta E = 0$) is equivalent to $W_{nc} = 0$, where $W_{nc}$ is work done by non-conservative forces. If $W_{nc} = 0$, then $\\Delta K + \\Delta U = 0$, so $K_f + U_f = K_i + U_i$. Friction, air resistance, applied forces etc. can cause $W_{nc} \\neq 0$."
