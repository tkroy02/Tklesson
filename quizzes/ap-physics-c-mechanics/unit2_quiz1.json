    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Newton's Second Law is most accurately written in terms of momentum $\\mathbf{p}$ as:",
        "options": [
          "$\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}$",
          "$\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{p}}{dt}$",
          "$\\mathbf{F} = \\int \\mathbf{a} \\, dt$",
          "$\\mathbf{F} = \\Delta \\mathbf{p}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The most general form of Newton's Second Law is $\\mathbf{F}_{net} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{p}}{dt}$, where $\\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v}$. For constant mass, this reduces to $\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves such that its position is $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (3t)\\hat{i} + (5)\\hat{j}$. The net force acting on this object is:",
        "options": [
          "Constant and non-zero.",
          "Zero.",
          "Proportional to $t$.",
          "Directed in the $y$-direction."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Velocity $\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = 3\\hat{i}$, which is constant. Constant velocity means zero acceleration. By Newton's First Law, if the object is in equilibrium (no acceleration), the net force acting on it is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2\\text{ kg}$ mass is acted upon by a net force $\\mathbf{F}(t) = (6t)\\hat{i}$. If the mass starts from rest, what is its velocity at $t = 2\\text{ s}$?",
        "options": [
          "$3\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$6\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$12\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$24\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From Newton's Second Law: $a(t) = \\frac{F(t)}{m} = \\frac{6t}{2} = 3t\\text{ m/s}^2$. Velocity is the integral of acceleration: $v(t) = \\int a(t) \\, dt = \\int 3t \\, dt = \\frac{3}{2}t^2 + C$. With $v(0)=0$, $C=0$. So $v(t) = 1.5t^2$. At $t=2$: $v(2) = 1.5 \\times 4 = 6\\text{ m/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rocket ejects fuel at a constant rate, meaning $m(t)$ is decreasing. If the thrust force is constant, the acceleration of the rocket will:",
        "options": [
          "Remain constant.",
          "Decrease over time.",
          "Increase over time.",
          "Become zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Applying $\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{p}}{dt}$ to a system with variable mass leads to the rocket equation. For a constant thrust force and decreasing mass, Newton's Second Law ($a = F/m$) indicates that acceleration increases as mass decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ sits at rest on a rough incline of angle $\\theta$. The magnitude of the normal force $F_N$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$mg$",
          "$mg\\sin\\theta$",
          "$mg\\cos\\theta$",
          "$mg\\tan\\theta$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Resolving forces perpendicular to the incline: $F_N - mg\\cos\\theta = 0$ (since there's no acceleration perpendicular to the surface). Therefore, $F_N = mg\\cos\\theta$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The area under a Force vs. Time graph represents:",
        "options": [
          "Work done.",
          "Change in kinetic energy.",
          "Impulse (change in momentum).",
          "Power."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Impulse $\\mathbf{J} = \\int \\mathbf{F} \\, dt$, which is the area under the $F$-$t$ curve. By the Impulse-Momentum Theorem, $\\mathbf{J} = \\Delta \\mathbf{p}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person of mass $m$ stands on a scale in an elevator accelerating upward at $a$. The scale reading (Normal Force) is:",
        "options": [
          "$mg$",
          "$m(g + a)$",
          "$m(g - a)$",
          "$ma$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using Newton's Second Law for the person: $F_N - mg = ma$ (upward positive). Solving for the normal force: $F_N = mg + ma = m(g+a)$. This is the apparent weight."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ ($m_2 > m_1$) are connected by a string over a massless pulley. The acceleration of the system is:",
        "options": [
          "$g$",
          "$(m_2 - m_1)g / (m_1 + m_2)$",
          "$(m_1 + m_2)g / (m_2 - m_1)$",
          "$(m_2 / m_1)g$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The net force accelerating the system is the difference in weights: $F_{net} = m_2g - m_1g = (m_2 - m_1)g$. The total mass being accelerated is $m_1 + m_2$. Using $F_{net} = (m_{total})a$, we get $a = \\frac{(m_2 - m_1)g}{m_1 + m_2}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the potential energy of a particle is $U(x) = kx^2$, the force $F(x)$ acting on it is:",
        "options": [
          "$2kx$",
          "$-2kx$",
          "$kx$",
          "$-kx$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The conservative force is the negative gradient of the potential energy: $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. Here, $\\frac{d}{dx}(kx^2) = 2kx$, so $F(x) = -2kx$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is dropped from rest. If the air resistance is $F_D = -bv$, the differential equation for its motion is:",
        "options": [
          "$mg - bv = m\\frac{dv}{dt}$",
          "$mg + bv = m\\frac{dv}{dt}$",
          "$bv = m\\frac{dv}{dt}$",
          "$mg = m\\frac{dv}{dt}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Taking downward as positive: The net force is weight ($mg$ downward) minus the drag force ($bv$ upward, opposing velocity). So $mg - bv = m\\frac{dv}{dt}$."
