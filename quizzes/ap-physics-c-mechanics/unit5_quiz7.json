      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid cylinder of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping with velocity $v$. What is its total kinetic energy?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{2}Mv^2$",
          "$\\frac{3}{4}Mv^2$",
          "$Mv^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{4}Mv^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$K_{total} = K_{trans} + K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$. For a solid cylinder, $I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$, and with rolling without slipping, $\\omega = v/R$. Thus, $K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2}MR^2)(v/R)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}Mv^2$, so $K_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \\frac{1}{4}Mv^2 = \\frac{3}{4}Mv^2$."

        "question": "A hoop, a disk, and a solid sphere (all with same $M$ and $R$) are released from rest at the top of an incline. Which one reaches the bottom first?",
        "options": [
          "The hoop",
          "The disk",
          "The solid sphere",
          "They reach at the same time"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using energy conservation: $Mgh = \\frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2}Mv^2(1 + I/(MR^2))$. Solving for $v$: $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gh}{1 + I/(MR^2)}}$. The acceleration is proportional to $v^2$, so smaller $I/(MR^2)$ yields larger acceleration. Values: hoop = 1, disk = 1/2, sphere = 2/5. The sphere (smallest inertia factor) accelerates fastest and wins."

          "$v_{cm}$",
          "$2v_{cm}$",
          "Zero",
          "$R\\omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The velocity of any point on a rigid body is $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}_{cm} + \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}'$. For the contact point, $\\vec{r}' = -R\\hat{j}$ (if rolling in $+x$). Then $\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}' = (\\omega\\hat{k}) \\times (-R\\hat{j}) = \\omega R \\hat{i}$. Since $v_{cm} = \\omega R$ in the $+x$ direction, the sum is $v_{cm}\\hat{i} - v_{cm}\\hat{i} = 0$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cylinder rolls down an incline of angle $\\theta$. What is the magnitude of the static friction force $f_s$ required to maintain rolling without slipping?",
        "options": [
          "$Mg \\sin\\theta$",
          "$\\frac{1}{3} Mg \\sin\\theta$",
          "$\\mu_s Mg \\cos\\theta$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} Mg \\sin\\theta$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Equations of motion: $Mg\\sin\\theta - f_s = Ma$ (linear) and $f_s R = I\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2\\alpha$ (rotational). Rolling condition: $a = R\\alpha$. Substituting $\\alpha = a/R$ into the torque equation gives $f_s = \\frac{1}{2}Ma$. Plug into linear equation: $Mg\\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2}Ma = Ma \\implies Mg\\sin\\theta = \\frac{3}{2}Ma \\implies a = \\frac{2}{3}g\\sin\\theta$. Then $f_s = \\frac{1}{2}M(\\frac{2}{3}g\\sin\\theta) = \\frac{1}{3}Mg\\sin\\theta$."

        "question": "What is the work done by static friction on an object that rolls without slipping?",
        "options": [
          "Positive",
          "Negative",
          "Zero",
          "It depends on the distance"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Work is $W = \\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}_{point}$ where $d\\vec{r}_{point}$ is the displacement of the point of application. For rolling without slipping, the contact point is instantaneously at rest ($d\\vec{r}_{point} = 0$ over each infinitesimal time interval). Therefore, the static friction force does zero work. It transfers energy between translational and rotational forms but doesn't change the total mechanical energy."

        "question": "A ball rolls without slipping up an incline. In which direction does the static friction force act?",
        "options": [
          "Down the incline",
          "Up the incline",
          "It is zero",
          "Perpendicular to the incline"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When rolling uphill, gravity provides a torque that tends to increase angular velocity (if the ball rotates forward). However, to maintain the rolling condition $v = R\\omega$, the angular deceleration must match the linear deceleration. Static friction acts up the incline to provide a torque that slows the rotation appropriately, preventing slipping."

          "$g$",

          "$\\frac{g}{1 + Mr^2/I}$",
          "$\\frac{I g}{Mr^2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Forces: $Mg - T = Ma$. Torque about the center: $Tr = I\\alpha$. With the string unwinding, $a = r\\alpha$. Substituting $\\alpha = a/r$ gives $Tr = I(a/r) \\implies T = Ia/r^2$. Plug into force equation: $Mg - Ia/r^2 = Ma \\implies Mg = a(M + I/r^2) \\implies a = \\frac{Mg}{M + I/r^2} = \\frac{g}{1 + I/(Mr^2)}$."

          "$v = R\\omega$",
          "$F = ma$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The condition $v_{cm} = R\\omega$ is the kinematic constraint for rolling without slipping. When slipping occurs, the translational velocity and angular velocity are independent—they are no longer coupled by this geometric relationship. The other equations remain fundamental laws of motion (energy, torque, Newton's second law)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A disk is sliding on a frictionless surface with velocity $v$ (not rotating). It then hits a rough patch. What happens to its translational velocity?",

          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the disk hits the rough surface, kinetic friction acts opposite to the direction of motion. This friction force both decelerates the center of mass ($a = -f_k/M$) and applies a torque that starts the disk rotating ($\\alpha = f_k R/I$). The disk will continue to slow down until the rolling condition $v = R\\omega$ is satisfied, after which static friction takes over and rolling continues without further loss of mechanical energy."
