        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile is launched from the origin. If its acceleration vector is $\\mathbf{a}(t) = 0\\hat{i} - g\\hat{j}$, which expression represents its velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ given initial velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0 = v_{ox}\\hat{i} + v_{oy}\\hat{j}$?",
        "options": [
          "$(v_{ox}t)\\hat{i} + (v_{oy}t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2)\\hat{j}$",

        "explanation": "Integrate acceleration: $\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\int \\mathbf{a}(t) \\, dt = \\int (0\\hat{i} - g\\hat{j}) \\, dt = C_x\\hat{i} + (-gt + C_y)\\hat{j}$. Applying initial conditions: $\\mathbf{v}(0) = v_{ox}\\hat{i} + v_{oy}\\hat{j}$ gives $C_x = v_{ox}$ and $C_y = v_{oy}$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{v}(t) = v_{ox}\\hat{i} + (v_{oy} - gt)\\hat{j}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile is launched from $y=0$ with an initial vertical velocity $v_{oy}$. Using the integral of the vertical velocity $v_y(t) = v_{oy} - gt$, at what time $t > 0$ does the displacement $\\Delta y$ return to zero?",

Set $\\Delta y = 0$: $v_{oy}t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow t(v_{oy} - \\frac{1}{2}gt) = 0$. The non-zero solution is $t = 2v_{oy}/g$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The direction of the velocity vector is given by the angle it makes with the horizontal: $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{v_y}{v_x})$, where $v_y$ is the vertical component and $v_x$ is the horizontal component."

          "Its velocity is $g$ downward."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At the peak, the vertical velocity is zero, but the horizontal velocity is constant. The acceleration, however, remains constant throughout the flight: $\\mathbf{a} = 0\\hat{i} - g\\hat{j}$, so its magnitude is $g$ downward."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since the projectile starts and ends at the same vertical level ($y=0$), the net displacement vector is $\\Delta \\mathbf{r} = R\\hat{i} + 0\\hat{j}$. Its magnitude is simply $R$."
