      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system consists of two particles. Particle 1 has mass $m$ and velocity $v(t) = \\alpha t \\hat{i}$. Particle 2 has mass $2m$ and is initially at rest. If the total momentum of the system is conserved, what must be the external force acting on the system?",
        "options": [
          "$m\\alpha$",
          "$3m\\alpha$",
          "$0$",
          "$-m\\alpha$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Conservation of total momentum means $\\frac{d\\vec{P}}{dt} = 0$. By Newton’s second law for systems, $\\frac{d\\vec{P}}{dt} = \\vec{F}_{ext}$. Therefore, $\\vec{F}_{ext} = 0$. The changing velocities of the particles must be due to internal forces between them."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ slides on a frictionless horizontal surface with velocity $v_0$. It collides with and sticks to a second block of mass $M$ that is attached to a spring with spring constant $k$. During the instant of the collision, which quantity is conserved for the two‑block system?",
        "options": [
          "Kinetic Energy only",
          "Momentum only",
          "Both Momentum and Kinetic Energy",
          "Neither Momentum nor Kinetic Energy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The collision is perfectly inelastic (they stick), so kinetic energy is not conserved. However, during the very short time of impact, the spring force is not yet significant because the spring compression is still small (the spring force takes time to build up). Thus, the net external horizontal force during the collision is negligible, and momentum is conserved. After the collision, the spring exerts a force, so momentum is no longer conserved."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two objects of mass $m$ and $3m$ move toward each other with speeds $3v$ and $v$ respectively. They collide and stick together. What is the final velocity of the combined mass?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$v$",
          "$2v$",
          "$1.5v$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Take the direction of the $m$ object as positive. Initial momentum: $P_i = m(3v) + 3m(-v) = 3mv - 3mv = 0$. For a perfectly inelastic collision, momentum is conserved (no external forces during impact), so $P_f = 0$. The combined mass $4m$ must therefore be at rest: $v_f = 0$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A shell is fired from a cannon. At the highest point of its trajectory, it explodes into three fragments of equal mass. Fragment 1 falls vertically at speed $v$. Fragment 2 moves horizontally at speed $v$ in the original direction of the shell. What is the velocity vector of Fragment 3?",
        "options": [
          "$v \\hat{i} + v \\hat{j}$",
          "$(3v_0 - v)\\hat{i} + v \\hat{j}$",
          "$v \\hat{i} - v \\hat{j}$",
          "$2v \\hat{i} + v \\hat{j}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Let the shell’s velocity at the peak be $v_0 \\hat{i}$ (horizontal). Initial momentum: $\\vec{P}_i = 3m v_0 \\hat{i}$. After explosion, $\\vec{P}_f = m(-v \\hat{j}) + m(v \\hat{i}) + m\\vec{v}_3$. Conservation of momentum gives $3m v_0 \\hat{i} = mv \\hat{i} - mv \\hat{j} + m\\vec{v}_3$. Divide by $m$: $3v_0 \\hat{i} = v \\hat{i} - v \\hat{j} + \\vec{v}_3$. Solve: $\\vec{v}_3 = (3v_0 - v)\\hat{i} + v \\hat{j}$."

        "question": "A uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ lies on a frictionless table. A piece of putty with mass $m$ hits one end of the rod perpendicularly and sticks to it. During this process:",
        "options": [
          "Linear momentum is conserved, but angular momentum is not.",
          "Angular momentum is conserved, but linear momentum is not.",
          "Both linear and angular momentum are conserved.",
          "Only kinetic energy is conserved."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "There are no external horizontal forces, so linear momentum is conserved. There is also no external torque about any point (the impact force is internal after sticking, and any contact forces with the table are vertical), so angular momentum is conserved. Kinetic energy is not conserved because the collision is inelastic (the putty sticks)."

        "question": "An object of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$ collides elastically with an object of mass $2m$ at rest. After the collision, the first object moves at an angle $\\theta$ relative to its original path. To find the final velocities, one must use:",
        "options": [
          "One conservation of momentum equation.",
          "Two conservation of momentum equations (x and y).",
          "Two conservation of momentum equations and one conservation of energy equation.",
          "Only the conservation of energy equation."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A 2D elastic collision has more unknowns than a 1D collision. Typically we have four unknowns: the two components of $\\vec{v}_1'$ and the two components of $\\vec{v}_2'$. However, symmetry or given angles can reduce them. In general, we need both components of momentum conservation (giving two equations) and conservation of kinetic energy (a third equation) to solve for the unknowns. In this problem, knowing $\\theta$ reduces the unknowns, but we still need all three conservation laws to solve completely."

        "question": "A rain cloud of mass $M_0$ moves at constant velocity $v$. It begins to fall through a mist, picking up mass at a rate of $dM/dt = k$. What external force is required to keep the cloud moving at the same constant velocity $v$?",
        "options": [
          "$kv$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} kv^2$",
          "$0$",
          "$M_0 g$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The momentum of the cloud is $P = M(t)v$, where $M(t) = M_0 + kt$. The external force needed is $F_{ext} = \\frac{dP}{dt} = v \\frac{dM}{dt} = vk$. This force opposes the natural tendency of the system to slow down when mass is added (since the added mass initially has zero horizontal momentum)."
