      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A torque that varies with time is applied to a wheel ($I=2\\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$) according to $\\tau(t) = 6t^2$. If the wheel starts from rest, what is its angular velocity at $t=2\\text{ s}$?",
        "options": [
          "$4\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$8\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$12\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$24\\text{ rad/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From Newton's second law for rotation: $\\alpha(t) = \\tau(t)/I = (6t^2)/2 = 3t^2$. Angular velocity is the integral of angular acceleration: $\\omega = \\int_0^2 \\alpha(t) dt = \\int_0^2 3t^2 dt = [t^3]_0^2 = 8\\text{ rad/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A motor provides a torque $\\tau(\\omega) = \\tau_0 - k\\omega$ to a grindstone. What is the terminal angular velocity of the grindstone?",
        "options": [
          "$\\tau_0 / k$",
          "Zero",
          "$\\tau_0 k$",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Terminal velocity occurs when angular acceleration $\\alpha = 0$. Since $\\tau = I\\alpha$, this requires $\\tau(\\omega) = 0$. Solving $\\tau_0 - k\\omega = 0$ gives $\\omega = \\tau_0/k$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sphere ($I = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2$) is subject to a torque $\\tau(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta)$. What is the work done by this torque as the sphere rotates from $\\theta = 0$ to $\\theta = \\pi$?",

          "$0$",
          "$1$",
          "$2$",
          "$\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rotational work is the integral of torque with respect to angular displacement: $W = \\int_{\\theta_i}^{\\theta_f} \\tau(\\theta) d\\theta = \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta = [-\\cos(\\theta)]_0^\\pi = (-\\cos\\pi) - (-\\cos 0) = (1) - (-1) = 2\\text{ J}$."

          "$P/\\omega^2$",
          "$P\\sqrt{\\omega}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In rotational motion, power is given by $P = \\tau\\omega$. For constant power $P$, solving for torque gives $\\tau = P/\\omega$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rod is pivoted at its end. A force is applied at the other end such that the torque decreases as the rod rotates: $\\tau(\\theta) = \\tau_0(1 - \\theta/\\pi)$. At what angle $\\theta$ is the angular velocity maximized?",

          "$2\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Angular velocity increases while torque is positive (providing positive angular acceleration). The torque becomes zero when $\\tau_0(1 - \\theta/\\pi) = 0 \\implies \\theta = \\pi$. At this point, acceleration stops being positive, and velocity is at its maximum value."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A disk of moment of inertia $I$ is slowed by a resistive torque $\\tau = -k\\sqrt{\\omega}$. How does the angular velocity $\\omega(t)$ behave?",

          "$\\omega \\propto t^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Starting from $I\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = -k\\omega^{1/2}$, separate variables: $\\omega^{-1/2} d\\omega = (-k/I) dt$. Integrate: $\\int_{\\omega_0}^{\\omega} \\omega^{-1/2} d\\omega = \\int_0^t (-k/I) dt \\implies 2[\\sqrt{\\omega}]_{\\omega_0}^{\\omega} = -\\frac{k}{I}t$. Solving gives $\\sqrt{\\omega} = \\sqrt{\\omega_0} - \\frac{kt}{2I}$, so $\\omega(t) = (\\sqrt{\\omega_0} - \\frac{kt}{2I})^2$."

          "$1/2 I \\omega^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rotational kinetic energy is $K = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$. Differentiating with respect to time: $\\frac{dK}{dt} = I\\omega\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = I\\omega\\alpha$. Since $\\tau = I\\alpha$, this becomes $\\frac{dK}{dt} = \\tau\\omega$."

        "question": "A thin rod ($M, L$) is falling from a vertical position. The torque due to gravity is $\\tau(\\theta) = Mg\\frac{L}{2}\\sin\\theta$. To find the angular velocity $\\omega$ at any angle $\\theta$, you should integrate:",

          "$MgL \\cos\\theta$",
          "$\\int \\alpha(t) dt$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When torque is expressed as a function of angle, use the identity $\\alpha = \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = \\omega\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\theta}$. Then $\\tau(\\theta) = I\\alpha = I\\omega\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\theta}$. Rearranging: $\\tau(\\theta) d\\theta = I\\omega d\\omega$. Integrating gives $\\frac{1}{I}\\int \\tau(\\theta) d\\theta = \\int \\omega d\\omega$, which is the work-energy theorem in rotational form."

          "$18\\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By Newton's second law for rotation, net torque equals the time derivative of angular momentum: $\\tau = \\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(4t^3 + 2t) = 12t^2 + 2$. At $t=1\\text{ s}$, $\\tau = 12(1)^2 + 2 = 14\\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m}$."

          "$FR$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The torque exerted by the string is $\\tau = FR$ (constant). Work done by a torque is $W = \\int \\tau d\\theta$. Since $\\tau$ is constant, $W = \\tau \\int d\\theta = FR\\theta$."
