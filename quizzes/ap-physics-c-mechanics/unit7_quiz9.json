      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point mass is located at a distance $r < R$ from the center of a thin uniform spherical shell of mass $M$ and radius $R$. What is the gravitational potential $V$ at that point?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$-GM/R$",
          "$-GM/r$",
          "$-GMr/R^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While the field $g$ is zero inside the shell, the potential $V$ is constant. Since $V$ must be continuous at the surface ($r=R$), its value inside is the same as its value at the surface: $-GM/R$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A planet has a density profile $\\rho(r) = \\rho_0 (R/r)$. What is the mass $M$ enclosed within radius $R$?",
        "options": [
          "$2\\pi \\rho_0 R^3$",
          "$4\\pi \\rho_0 R^3$",
          "$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho_0 R^3$",
          "$\\pi \\rho_0 R^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$M = \\int_0^R (\\rho_0 \\frac{R}{r})(4\\pi r^2) dr = 4\\pi \\rho_0 R \\int_0^R r \\, dr = 4\\pi \\rho_0 R [\\frac{r^2}{2}]_0^R = 2\\pi \\rho_0 R^3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a planet with uniform density, if you travel from the surface toward the center, the gravitational field strength:",
        "options": [
          "Increases as $1/r^2$",
          "Decreases linearly with $r$",
          "Remains constant",
          "Decreases as $1/r$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inside a uniform sphere, $g(r) = \\frac{GM(r)}{r^2} = \\frac{G}{r^2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi G \\rho r$, which is linear in $r$. As $r \\to 0$, $g \\to 0$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which graph correctly represents the gravitational potential $V$ as a function of $r$ for a solid planet?",
        "options": [
          "A $1/r$ curve for all $r$.",
          "A horizontal line inside, $1/r$ curve outside.",
          "A parabola inside, $1/r$ curve outside.",
          "A linear line inside, $1/r$ curve outside."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The integral of a linear field ($g \\propto r$) is a quadratic potential ($V \\propto r^2$). Outside, the field is $1/r^2$, so the potential is $1/r$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what distance $r$ inside a uniform planet of radius $R$ is the gravitational acceleration $g$ equal to $1/3$ of its surface value?",
        "options": [
          "$R/9$",
          "$R/\\sqrt{3}$",
          "$R/3$",
          "$2R/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $g_{\\text{in}}(r) = g_s \\cdot (r/R)$, then $g_s/3 = g_s \\cdot (r/R)$ implies $r = R/3$."

      {

        "question": "If a spherical cavity is hollowed out of a uniform solid sphere, the gravitational field inside the cavity is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero.",
          "Non-zero and uniform (constant vector).",
          "Pointing toward the center of the cavity.",
          "Varying as $1/r^2$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a classic AP C 'superposition' problem. The field is the vector subtraction of the planet's field and the 'missing' mass's field, which results in a constant vector $\\vec{g} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi G \\rho \\vec{d}$, where $\\vec{d}$ is the vector between the centers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Gauss's Law for Gravitation is written as $\\oint \\vec{g} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = -4\\pi G M_{\\text{enc}}$. What does the negative sign signify?",
        "options": [
          "The mass is negative.",

          "Gravity is a repulsive force.",
          "The flux is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The area vector $d\\vec{A}$ points outward from a closed surface, but the gravitational field $\\vec{g}$ points inward toward the mass. The dot product is therefore negative."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The mass of a non-uniform sphere of radius $R$ is $M$. If the density is $\\rho(r) = Cr^2$, what is the constant $C$?",
        "options": [
          "$M / (\\pi R^5)$",
          "$5M / (4\\pi R^5)$",

          "$M / (4\\pi R^5)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$M = \\int_0^R (Cr^2)(4\\pi r^2) dr = 4\\pi C \\int_0^R r^4 dr = \\frac{4\\pi C R^5}{5}$. Solving for $C$ gives $5M / (4\\pi R^5)$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite orbits a planet at an altitude $h = R$. What is the gravitational field $g$ at the satellite's location compared to the surface field $g_s$?",

          "$g_s / 9$",
          "$g_s$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The distance from the center is $r = R + h = 2R$. Since $g \\propto 1/r^2$, the field is $g_s / (2^2) = g_s / 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the gravitational field zero inside a hollow shell?",
        "options": [
          "There is no mass inside.",
          "The distance $r$ is zero.",
          "The vector sum of the pull from all parts of the shell cancels out.",
          "The potential is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Even though you are closer to one side of the shell, there is 'more' mass on the further side. Calculus shows these two effects cancel exactly at every point inside the shell."
