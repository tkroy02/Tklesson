        "question": "A particle of mass $m$ moves in a potential $U(x) = ax^4 - bx^2$. At what points is the particle in stable equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "$x = 0$",
          "$x = \\pm \\sqrt{b/2a}$",
          "$x = \\pm \\sqrt{b/a}$",
          "$x = \\pm \\sqrt{2b/a}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium occurs where the force $F = -dU/dx = 0$. $U'(x) = 4ax^3 - 2bx = 2x(2ax^2 - b) = 0$, giving $x = 0$ and $x = \\pm\\sqrt{b/(2a)}$. Stable equilibrium requires $U''(x) > 0$: $U''(x) = 12ax^2 - 2b$. At $x=0$, $U'' = -2b$ (unstable if $b>0$). At $x = \\pm\\sqrt{b/(2a)}$, $U'' = 12a\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right) - 2b = 6b - 2b = 4b > 0$, so these are stable minima."

          "$F = -\\frac{1}{2}kx$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Force is the negative gradient of the potential: $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. Differentiating $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ gives $\\frac{dU}{dx} = kx$. Therefore, $F(x) = -kx$, which is a linear restoring force—the defining condition for simple harmonic motion."

        "question": "Given a potential $U(x) = U_0 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{a}{x}\\right)^{12} - 2\\left(\\frac{a}{x}\\right)^6 \\right]$ (Lennard‑Jones), the effective spring constant $k$ at equilibrium is found by:",

        "explanation": "For small oscillations around a stable equilibrium, the motion is approximately SHM with effective spring constant $k_{\\text{eff}} = \\left. \\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \\right|_{\\text{min}}$. First find the equilibrium position $x_{\\text{eq}}$ where $U'(x)=0$, then compute $U''(x_{\\text{eq}})$. This second derivative gives the curvature of the potential well, which determines the frequency: $\\omega = \\sqrt{k_{\\text{eff}}/m}$."

          "$\\sqrt{(\\gamma+\\delta)/m}$"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For small oscillations near $x=0$ (the equilibrium), the $x^4$ term is negligible compared to the $x^2$ term. The effective spring constant is $k_{\\text{eff}} = U''(0) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(\\gamma x^2 + \\delta x^4)\\big|_{x=0} = 2\\gamma + 12\\delta x^2\\big|_{x=0} = 2\\gamma$.

          "Oscillations are impossible at $x=0$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Stable equilibrium requires $U'(x)=0$ and $U''(x)>0$. For $U(x)=\\sin x$, $U'(x)=\\cos x$. At $x=0$, $\\cos 0 = 1 \\neq 0$, so $x=0$ is not an equilibrium point. The nearest stable equilibrium is at $x = \\pi/2 + n\\pi$? Actually, $\\cos x=0$ at $x=\\pi/2$, but $U''(\\pi/2) = -\\sin(\\pi/2) = -1 < 0$, so that's unstable. The stable minima are at $x = -\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2, \\dots$ where $\\sin x = -1$ and $U'' > 0$. Thus, small oscillations do not occur around $x=0$."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For a conservative spring force $F_{\\text{spring}} = -kx$, the work done by an external force to stretch the spring slowly from equilibrium to $x=A$ is $W_{\\text{ext}} = \\int_0^A kx dx = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. This work is stored as elastic potential energy $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From energy conservation: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + U(x) = E \\implies v = \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(E - U(x))}$. Then $dt = \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(E - U(x))}}$.

        "options": [
          "Yes, it is periodic.",
          "No, because $U''(x)$ is not defined or is zero at the equilibrium.",
          "No, because the force is constant magnitude, not proportional to $x$.",
          "Both B and C."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "SHM requires a restoring force linear in displacement, $F = -kx$, which arises from a quadratic potential $U \\propto x^2$. For $U \\propto |x|$, the force is $F = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -\\text{sign}(x) \\cdot \\text{constant}$, a constant‑magnitude step function. This does not satisfy the SHM differential equation $\\ddot{x} + \\omega^2 x = 0$. Moreover, $U''(x)$ is zero everywhere except at $x=0$, where it is undefined."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Multiplying $m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0$ by $v = \\dot{x}$ gives $m\\dot{x}\\ddot{x} + kx\\dot{x} = 0$. Recognizing $\\dot{x}\\ddot{x} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{x}^2)$ and $x\\dot{x} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{dt}(x^2)$, we obtain $\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\right) = 0$.
