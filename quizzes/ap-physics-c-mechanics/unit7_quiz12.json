      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose we drill a hole through the Earth along its diameter and drop a small mass $m$ down the hole. Assume the Earth is not rotating and has a uniform density. Which of the following describes the potential energy of the object as a function of distance $r$ from the center (where $r < R_E$)?",
        "options": [
          "$-\\frac{GM_E m r^2}{2R_E^3} + C$",
          "$-\\frac{GM_E m r^2}{4R_E^3}$",
          "$-\\frac{GM_E m r^2}{8R_E^3}$",
          "$-\\frac{GM_E m r^4}{16R_E^3}$",
          "$-\\frac{GM_E m r^3}{4R_E}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inside a uniform sphere, the force is linear: $F(r) = -\\frac{GM_E m r}{R_E^3}$. Since $U(r) = -\\int F(r) dr$, we integrate with respect to $r$ to get $U(r) = \\frac{GM_E m r^2}{2R_E^3} + C$. (Note: To make $U(\\infty) = 0$, the full expression is usually $U(r) = \\frac{GM_E m r^2}{2R_E^3} - \\frac{3GM_E m}{2R_E}$)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For all gravitational problems involving $F = -GMm/r^2$ (outside a spherical mass), where do we consider the mass to be concentrated?",
        "options": [
          "On the object's surface",
          "At the object's center",
          "Distributed throughout the object",
          "Halfway between the center and surface",
          "It varies depending on the density"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the Shell Theorem, a spherically symmetric mass distribution exerts a gravitational force on external objects as if all its mass were concentrated at a single point at its center."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a hole were cut straight through the Earth and a ball of mass $m$ were dropped into it, what path would the ball follow?",
        "options": [
          "Fall straight through and come out the other side",
          "The ball will oscillate",
          "Stop once it reaches the center",
          "Never make it to the center",
          "Rebound as if it hit a floor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because the force inside is proportional to the displacement from the center ($F = -kr$), the ball will undergo Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), oscillating back and forth between the two sides of the Earth."

          "$1/1$",
          "$1/100$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By conservation of angular momentum ($m v_A r_A = m v_B r_B$), the speed is inversely proportional to the radius: $v_B/v_A = r_A/r_B = 1/5$."
      },

        "question": "A satellite is orbiting Earth in an elliptical orbit with radii $r_A$ and $r_B$. If $r_B = 5r_A$, what is the ratio $F_B/F_A$ of the force on the satellite at point B to point A?",

          "$1/100$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The gravitational force follows the inverse-square law ($F \\propto 1/r^2$). If the radius is 5 times larger, the force is $1/5^2 = 1/25$ as strong."

        "explanation": "$F = \\frac{(6.67 \\times 10^{-11})(1)(1)}{2^2} \\approx 1.6 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ N}$. The order of magnitude is $10^{-11}$."
