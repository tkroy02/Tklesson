      {

        "question": "A particle moves in a circle of radius $r$. If its tangential acceleration $a_t$ is constant, how does the centripetal acceleration $a_c$ change with the distance $s$ traveled (starting from rest)?",
        "options": [
          "$a_c \\propto s$",
          "$a_c \\propto s^2$",
          "$a_c \\propto \\sqrt{s}$",
          "$a_c$ remains constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For constant tangential acceleration starting from rest, kinematics gives $v^2 = 2 a_t s$. Centripetal acceleration is $a_c = v^2/r = (2a_t/r) s$. Therefore, $a_c$ is directly proportional to the distance traveled $s$."

        ],
        "explanation": "At an angle $\\theta$ measured downward from the horizontal, the component of gravity tangent to the circular path is $mg \\cos \\theta$ (the cosine term because when $\\theta=0$, the full weight is tangential). Applying Newton's Second Law tangentially: $m a_t = mg \\cos \\theta \\Rightarrow a_t = g \\cos \\theta$.",

        "answer": "A",

Thus, $a_t = (c n s^{n-1}) (c s^n) = c^2 n s^{2n-1}$. For $a_t$ to be constant (independent of $s$), the exponent of $s$ must be zero: $2n - 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow n = 1/2$."

The normal force $N$ becomes zero at separation. Applying Newton's 2nd Law radially inward: $mg \\cos\\phi - N = m v^2/R$. With $N=0$, $mg \\cos\\phi = m(2gh)/R$. Also, geometry gives $\\cos\\phi = (R-h)/R$. Substitute: $g \\frac{R-h}{R} = \\frac{2gh}{R} \\Rightarrow R - h = 2h \\Rightarrow 3h = R \\Rightarrow h = R/3$."

        "explanation": "The net force in non-uniform circular motion has two components: centripetal (perpendicular to velocity) and tangential (parallel to velocity). The centripetal component does zero work ($\\vec{F}_c \\perp \\vec{v}$). Only the tangential component $F_t$ does work, and that work equals the change in kinetic energy by the Work-Energy Theorem: $W_{net} = \\int F_t \\, ds = \\Delta K$.
