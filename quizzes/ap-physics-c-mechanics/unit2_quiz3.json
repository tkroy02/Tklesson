    "topic": "Newton's Laws of Motion",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an inertial reference frame, which of the following should never be included on a Free-Body Diagram?",
        "options": [
          "Tension",
          "Centrifugal Force",
          "Static Friction",
          "Normal Force"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A Free-Body Diagram (FBD) only includes forces that are the result of real physical interactions (e.g., tension, friction, normal, gravity). Centrifugal force is a 'fictitious' or 'pseudo-force' that appears only in non-inertial (accelerating) reference frames to explain motion relative to that frame."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block is on a plane inclined at angle $\\theta$. Which coordinate system is generally most efficient for setting up the equations of motion?",
        "options": [
          "$x$ horizontal, $y$ vertical.",
          "$x$ parallel to the incline, $y$ perpendicular to the incline.",
          "$x$ along the direction of gravity.",
          "Polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Aligning one axis parallel to the incline and the other perpendicular simplifies the analysis. The component of gravity parallel to the incline is $mg\\sin\\theta$, and perpendicular is $mg\\cos\\theta$. Typically, acceleration occurs along the incline, so $\\sum F_y = 0$ often holds, making calculations easier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ is pressed against a vertical wall by a horizontal force $P$. What is the magnitude of the Normal Force $F_N$ exerted by the wall?",
        "options": [
          "$mg$",
          "$P$",
          "$\\sqrt{P^2 + (mg)^2}$",
          "$P - mg$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Consider horizontal forces on the block. The only horizontal forces are the applied force $P$ (toward the wall) and the normal force $F_N$ (exerted by the wall, away from the wall). For equilibrium in the horizontal direction, $P - F_N = 0$, so $F_N = P$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When solving a system where a string passes over a pulley with significant mass (rotational dynamics), how do the tensions $T_1$ and $T_2$ on either side of the pulley compare?",
        "options": [
          "$T_1$ must equal $T_2$.",
          "$T_1$ and $T_2$ are only equal if the system is at rest.",
          "$T_1$ and $T_2$ are unequal to provide a net torque.",
          "Tensions are irrelevant in rotational FBDs."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If the pulley has mass and/or friction, it requires a net torque to rotate. This net torque is provided by a difference in the tensions on either side: $\\tau_{net} = (T_1 - T_2)R$, where $R$ is the pulley radius. Therefore, $T_1 \\neq T_2$ when the pulley is accelerating."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block is at rest on a floor. A force $F$ is applied at an angle $\\phi$ below the horizontal. As $F$ increases, the Normal Force:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases.",
          "Increases.",
          "Stays the same.",
          "Becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Resolve the applied force: $F_y = F\\sin\\phi$ downward. The vertical force balance is $F_N - mg - F\\sin\\phi = 0$, so $F_N = mg + F\\sin\\phi$. Since $\\sin\\phi > 0$, increasing $F$ increases $F_N$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an FBD of a 'system' consisting of two blocks connected by a string, the tension in the string is:",
        "options": [
          "An external force.",
          "An internal force.",
          "Zero if the blocks have the same mass.",
          "Equal to the net force on the system."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When defining the system as both blocks together, forces between components of the system (like the tension in the connecting string) are internal forces. Internal forces do not appear in the net force equation for the system as a whole; they cancel in pairs by Newton's Third Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ sits on a frictionless wedge of mass $M$. If the wedge is accelerated horizontally at $a$ such that the block does not slide, the FBD of the block must show:",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal force $ma$ pointing backward.",
          "The Normal Force having a horizontal component equal to $ma$.",
          "Gravity acting at an angle.",
          "Friction pointing up the incline."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In an inertial frame (watching from the ground), the block accelerates horizontally with the wedge at $a$. The only horizontal force acting on the block (since the wedge is frictionless) is the horizontal component of the Normal Force. Therefore, $N\\sin\\theta = ma$, where $\\theta$ is the incline angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a car rounding a banked curve at constant speed, the FBD should show:",
        "options": [
          "$F_g$, $F_N$, and $F_c$.",
          "$F_g$ and $F_N$ only (if frictionless).",
          "$F_g$, $F_N$, and $F_{centrifugal}$.",
          "$F_g$ and Friction only."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Centripetal force' is not a separate force; it is the net force toward the center of the circular path. In a frictionless banked turn, the only real forces are gravity ($F_g$) and the normal force ($F_N$). Their vector sum provides the necessary centripetal force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two blocks are in contact on a frictionless surface. Block A ($m_A$) is pushed by force $F$. The force that Block A exerts on Block B is:",
        "options": [
          "$F$",
          "$F \\cdot \\frac{m_B}{m_A + m_B}$",
          "$F \\cdot \\frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B}$",
          "$m_B g$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The two blocks move together as a system with acceleration $a = F/(m_A + m_B)$. Isolating Block B: the only horizontal force on it is the contact force $F_{A\\to B}$. So $F_{A\\to B} = m_B a = m_B \\cdot \\frac{F}{m_A + m_B} = F \\cdot \\frac{m_B}{m_A + m_B}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Free-Body Diagram for an object experiencing air resistance $F_D = -bv$, the drag vector must always point:",
        "options": [
          "Toward the ground.",
          "In the direction of acceleration.",
          "Opposite to the velocity vector.",
          "Perpendicular to the Normal Force."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By definition, a linear drag (or air resistance) force always opposes the instantaneous direction of motion. Therefore, it points opposite to the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$."
