      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an underdamped system, the term $Ae^{-(b/2m)t}$ is called the 'envelope' of the motion. What does it represent?",
        "options": [
          "The frequency of the motion.",
          "The time‑varying amplitude of the oscillation.",
          "The total mechanical energy.",
          "The phase constant."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The general solution for an underdamped oscillator is $x(t) = Ae^{-(b/2m)t} \\cos(\\omega' t + \\phi)$. The exponential factor $e^{-(b/2m)t}$ multiplies the oscillatory cosine term, causing the maximum displacement (the amplitude) to decay exponentially over time. This decaying factor is the 'envelope' that bounds the oscillation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the frequency of an underdamped oscillator ($\\omega'$) lower than the natural frequency ($\\omega_0$)?",
        "options": [
          "The spring becomes weaker over time.",
          "The resistive force 'drags' the motion, increasing the time for each cycle.",
          "The mass of the system effectively increases.",
          "Gravity acts against the motion."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The damped frequency is $\\omega' = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - (b/(2m))^2}$, where $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k/m}$. The damping force $F_d = -bv$ opposes the velocity, effectively adding an extra retarding term that slows the oscillation, making the period longer and the frequency smaller."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want a screen door to close quickly but not slam (overshoot), which damping regime should you use?",
        "options": [
          "Underdamped",
          "Overdamped",
          "Critically Damped",
          "Undamped"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Critical damping ($b^2 = 4mk$) provides the fastest possible approach to equilibrium without oscillating (overshooting). An underdamped door would swing back and forth; an overdamped door would close too slowly; critical damping gives a quick, smooth closure."

        "question": "What happens to the mechanical energy in a damped oscillator?",
        "options": [
          "It is conserved.",
          "It is converted into thermal energy at a rate proportional to $v^2$.",
          "It increases linearly.",
          "It oscillates between kinetic and potential forever."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The damping force $F_d = -bv$ is non‑conservative. The power dissipated is $P = F_d \\cdot v = -bv^2$, so $\\frac{dE}{dt} = -bv^2$. Energy leaves the mechanical system (converted to thermal energy in the damper) at a rate proportional to the square of the instantaneous speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the limit where $b \\to 0$, what does the damped differential equation become?",
        "options": [
          "$m\\ddot{x} = 0$",
          "$m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0$",
          "$kx = 0$",
          "$v = \\text{constant}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The damped oscillator equation is $m\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + kx = 0$. Setting $b = 0$ eliminates the velocity‑dependent term, leaving $m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0$, which is the equation for undamped simple harmonic motion."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the underdamped position equation $x(t) = Ae^{-\\gamma t} \\cos(\\omega' t + \\phi)$, what is the specific relationship for the damping coefficient $\\gamma$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\gamma = b/m$",
          "$\\gamma = b/(2m)$",
          "$\\gamma = \\sqrt{b/m}$",
          "$\\gamma = b^2/(4m^2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The characteristic equation of $m\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + kx = 0$ is $mr^2 + br + k = 0$. For underdamping, the roots are complex: $r = -\\frac{b}{2m} \\pm i\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m} - (\\frac{b}{2m})^2}$. The real part $\\frac{b}{2m}$ is the decay constant $\\gamma$ in the exponential envelope $e^{-\\gamma t}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system is 'Overdamped' when the roots of the characteristic equation are:",
        "options": [
          "Purely imaginary",
          "Complex conjugates with a negative real part",
          "Two distinct negative real numbers",
          "A single repeated negative real number"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Overdamping occurs when $b^2 > 4mk$. The discriminant $b^2 - 4mk$ is positive, so the roots $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4mk}}{2m}$ are both real, distinct, and negative. The solution is a sum of two decaying exponentials with no oscillatory component."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an underdamped oscillator, what is the time constant $\\tau$ required for the amplitude to drop to $1/e$ of its initial value?",
        "options": [
          "$m/b$",
          "$2m/b$",
          "$b/(2m)$",
          "$k/b$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The amplitude is given by $A(t) = A_0 e^{-(b/(2m))t}$. We set $e^{-(b/(2m))\\tau} = e^{-1}$ to find the time for the amplitude to fall to $A_0/e$. Thus, $(b/(2m))\\tau = 1$, so $\\tau = 2m/b$. This $\\tau$ is the time constant of the exponential decay."

        "question": "How does the rate of energy dissipation $dE/dt$ behave in a damped system?",
        "options": [
          "It is constant over time.",
          "It is zero at the equilibrium position $x=0$.",
          "It is most negative when the speed $|v|$ is at its maximum.",
          "It is most negative when the displacement $|x|$ is at its maximum."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Power dissipation is $P = \\frac{dE}{dt} = -bv^2$. Therefore, the rate of energy loss is proportional to the square of the instantaneous speed. The speed is maximum when the mass passes through equilibrium ($x=0$), so energy is dissipated most rapidly at those instants."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of the 'Damping Ratio' $\\zeta$ (zeta) for a system that is Critically Damped?",
        "options": [
          "$\\zeta = 0$",
          "$0 < \\zeta < 1$",
          "$\\zeta = 1$",
          "$\\zeta > 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The damping ratio is defined as $\\zeta = \\frac{b}{2\\sqrt{mk}}$. Critical damping occurs when $b^2 = 4mk$, i.e., $b = 2\\sqrt{mk}$. Substituting gives $\\zeta = \\frac{2\\sqrt{mk}}{2\\sqrt{mk}} = 1$ exactly."
