    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves in a field where the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} - \\frac{2}{x}$. At what position $x$ is the particle in equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "$x = 0.5$",
          "$x = 1.0$",
          "$x = 2.0$",
          "$x = 4.0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium occurs where $F = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$. Rewrite $U(x) = x^{-2} - 2x^{-1}$. Differentiate: $\\frac{dU}{dx} = -2x^{-3} + 2x^{-2} = 2x^{-2}(-x^{-1} + 1)$. Set equal to zero: $2x^{-2}(1 - \\frac{1}{x}) = 0$. Since $x^{-2} \\neq 0$, we have $1 - \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on the function in Question 1, what is the nature of the equilibrium at that point?",
        "options": [
          "Stable",
          "Unstable",
          "Neutral",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To determine stability, compute the second derivative: $\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6x^{-4} - 4x^{-3}$. At $x=1$: $\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6 - 4 = 2 > 0$. Since the second derivative is positive, the equilibrium point is a local minimum of potential energy, indicating stable equilibrium."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A force $\\vec{F} = (3x^2)\\hat{i} + (4y)\\hat{j}$ acts on an object. What is the change in potential energy $\\Delta U$ if the object moves from $(0,0)$ to $(2,3)$?",
        "options": [
          "$-18$ J",
          "$-26$ J",
          "$26$ J",
          "$8$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a conservative force, $\\Delta U = -\\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}$. Compute: $\\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r} = \\int_0^2 3x^2 dx + \\int_0^3 4y dy = [x^3]_0^2 + [2y^2]_0^3 = 8 + 18 = 26$ J. Therefore, $\\Delta U = -26$ J. The potential energy decreases by 26 J as the object moves."

        "question": "If the power delivered to an object is given by $P(t) = 4t^3$, what is the total work done on the object from $t=0$ to $t=2$ seconds?",

          "$8$ J",
          "$16$ J",
          "$32$ J",
          "$64$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work is the time-integral of power: $W = \\int_0^2 P(t) dt = \\int_0^2 4t^3 dt = [t^4]_0^2 = 2^4 = 16$ J."
      },

          "Kinetic Energy",
          "Work Done",
          "Power"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By definition, work done by a variable force is $W = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x) dx$. Graphically, this is the area under the $F$ vs. $x$ curve between the limits. For a net force, this equals the change in kinetic energy, but the area directly represents work."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle with total energy $E = 10$ J moves in a region where $U(x) = 2x^2$. What are the 'turning points' of the motion?",
        "options": [
          "$x = \\pm 5$",

          "$x = \\pm 10$",
          "$x = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Turning points occur where kinetic energy is zero: $K = E - U(x) = 0 \\Rightarrow U(x) = E$. Here, $2x^2 = 10 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 5 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm \\sqrt{5}$. These are the points where the particle reverses direction."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object of mass $m$ is subject to a resistive force $F = -kv$. The power required to keep the object moving at a constant velocity $v$ is:",
        "options": [

          "$\\frac{1}{2}kv^2$",
          "$k$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To maintain constant velocity, an external force must exactly balance the resistive force: $F_{ext} = +kv$ (opposite direction). Power delivered by this force is $P = F_{ext} \\cdot v = (kv)(v) = kv^2$."

          "$4AL^3$",
          "$-4AL^3$",
          "$AL^4$",
          "$-AL^5/5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Force is $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -\\frac{d}{dx}(-Ax^4) = -(-4Ax^3) = 4Ax^3$. At $x = L$, $F = 4AL^3$. The force is repulsive (positive for positive A)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following conditions proves a force is non-conservative?",
        "options": [
          "The work done depends on the path taken.",
          "The work done over a closed loop is zero.",
          "The force can be derived from a potential energy function.",
          "The force is always perpendicular to the velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A conservative force is path-independent: work depends only on endpoints. If work differs for different paths between the same two points, the force is non-conservative (e.g., friction). Option B defines a conservative force; C is true for conservative forces; D describes forces like magnetic force (which can be non-conservative but also path-dependent)."

          "The negative Power of gravity",
          "The Kinetic Energy",
          "The total mechanical energy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Power delivered by gravity is $P_{grav} = \\vec{F}_g \\cdot \\vec{v} = mg(-v)$ if downward is positive. Meanwhile, $U = mgy$, so $\\frac{dU}{dt} = mg \\frac{dy}{dt} = mg(-v) = -mgv$. Thus, $\\frac{dU}{dt} = -P_{grav}$. The potential energy decreases at the same rate gravity does positive work."
