      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves from $\\vec{r}_i = 2\\hat{i} - 3\\hat{j}$ m to $\\vec{r}_f = -1\\hat{i} + 5\\hat{j}$ m under a constant force $\\vec{F} = 10\\hat{i} + 2\\hat{j}$ N. Calculate the work done.",

          "$-14$ J",
          "$-16$ J",
          "$46$ J",
          "$-44$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, find displacement: $\\Delta \\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_f - \\vec{r}_i = (-1 - 2)\\hat{i} + (5 - (-3))\\hat{j} = -3\\hat{i} + 8\\hat{j}$. Then compute the dot product: $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\vec{r} = (10)(-3) + (2)(8) = -30 + 16 = -14$ J. Negative work means the force opposes the direction of motion on net."

        "question": "The power delivered to an object is $P(t) = 4t + 2$ Watts. Find the work done by the force from $t = 0$ to $t = 3$ seconds.",

          "$14$ J",
          "$24$ J",
          "$18$ J",
          "$42$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work is the time-integral of power: $W = \\int_{0}^{3} P(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{3} (4t + 2) dt$. The antiderivative is $2t^2 + 2t$. Evaluating from 0 to 3: $[2(3)^2 + 2(3)] - 0 = 18 + 6 = 24$ J."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves along the y-axis from $y = 0$ to $y = 10$ m. A constant force $\\vec{F} = 6\\hat{i} - 8\\hat{j}$ N acts on it. What is the work done?",

          "$0$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The displacement vector is purely in the y-direction: $\\Delta \\vec{r} = 0\\hat{i} + 10\\hat{j}$. Work is $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\vec{r} = (6)(0) + (-8)(10) = -80$ J. Only the y-component of the force does work since displacement is purely vertical."

          "$W = \\oint \\vec{C} \\cdot d\\vec{r} = 0$",
          "$W = \\oint \\vec{C} \\cdot d\\vec{r} = \\vec{C} \\cdot 2\\pi R$",
          "$W$ depends on the area of the loop.",
          "$W$ is non-zero if the loop is non-circular."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a constant force, work is path-independent. Over a closed loop, the net displacement is zero, so $\\oint d\\vec{r} = 0$. Thus, $W = \\vec{C} \\cdot \\oint d\\vec{r} = \\vec{C} \\cdot 0 = 0$. This confirms that a constant force is conservative."

          "$W$",
          "$4W$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Work is defined by $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\vec{r}$. It depends only on the force and the displacement, not on the mass of the object. The mass affects acceleration and kinetic energy change, but the work performed by the given force $\\vec{F}$ remains the same."

        "explanation": "Power is $P(t) = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}(t)$. At $t=5$, $\\vec{v} = 3\\hat{i} - 10\\hat{j}$. So $P = (4\\hat{i}) \\cdot (3\\hat{i} - 10\\hat{j}) = (4)(3) + (0)(-10) = 12$ W."

          "$40$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The z-component of the position is constant ($z=5$), so $\\Delta z = 0$. The force has only a $\\hat{k}$ component, so $W = F_z \\Delta z = (5)(0) = 0$ J. Even though the object moves in x and y, the force is perpendicular to that motion, so it does no work."

          "Always positive",
          "Proportional to velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By definition, a conservative force is one for which the work done in moving between two points is independent of the path taken. Constant forces satisfy this property because $\\vec{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\vec{r}$ depends only on the endpoints."
