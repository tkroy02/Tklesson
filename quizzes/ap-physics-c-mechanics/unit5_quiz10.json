        "question": "A particle moves in a potential field $U(r)$ that depends only on the distance from the origin. Using $\\vec{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}$, prove why $\\vec{L}$ is conserved.",
        "options": [
          "$\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$ is always parallel to $\\vec{r}$, so $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} = 0$.",
          "The potential energy is constant.",
          "The velocity is always perpendicular to the force.",
          "The mass is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a spherically symmetric potential $U(r)$, the force is $\\vec{F} = -\\frac{dU}{dr}\\hat{r}$, which is radial (parallel or anti‑parallel to $\\vec{r}$). The torque about the origin is $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} = 0$ because $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{F}$ are parallel. Since $\\vec{\\tau} = d\\vec{L}/dt$, it follows that $\\vec{L}$ is constant."

        "question": "A disk with moment of inertia $I$ is subject to a time‑varying torque $\\tau(t) = \\tau_0 e^{-kt}$. If the disk starts with angular momentum $L_0$, what is $L(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The change in angular momentum is $\\Delta L = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\tau(t) dt = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\tau_0 e^{-kt} dt = \\left[ -\\frac{\\tau_0}{k} e^{-kt} \\right]_0^{\\infty} = \\frac{\\tau_0}{k}$. Therefore, $L(\\infty) = L_0 + \\Delta L = L_0 + \\frac{\\tau_0}{k}$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum conservation with no external torque gives $\\frac{dL}{dt} = 0$. Since $L(t) = I(t)\\omega(t)$, applying the product rule yields $\\frac{d}{dt}(I\\omega) = I\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} + \\omega\\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$. Substituting $dI/dt = I_0\\beta$ gives the differential equation governing $\\omega(t)$."

        "explanation": "Since angular momentum is conserved, $L$ is constant. Kinetic energy is $K = \\frac{L^2}{2I}$. The change in kinetic energy equals the work done by internal forces: $W = \\Delta K = \\frac{L^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{I_f} - \\frac{1}{I_i}\\right) = \\int_{I_i}^{I_f} \\frac{L^2}{2} d(I^{-1})$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Before the collision, only the moving clay ball contributes to angular momentum about the pivot. For a point mass, $\\vec{L} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}$. The ball's momentum $\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to the rod, and the lever arm is $x$. Thus, $L_{initial} = |\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}| = x \\cdot mv$."

          "$dA/dt = \\int L dt$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a small time $dt$, the area swept out is $dA = \\frac{1}{2}|\\vec{r} \\times d\\vec{r}|$. Dividing by $dt$ gives $\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2}|\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}|$. Since $\\vec{L} = m(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v})$, we have $\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{L}{2m}$. For a central force, $L$ is constant, so $dA/dt$ is constant (Kepler's second law)."

          "Zero."
        ],
        "explanation": "The frictional torque is an internal torque between the two disks. For each disk, the angular impulse equals the change in its angular momentum: $\\int \\tau_{A\\text{ on }B} dt = \\Delta L_B$ and $\\int \\tau_{B\\text{ on }A} dt = \\Delta L_A$. By Newton's third law, $\\tau_{A\\text{ on }B} = -\\tau_{B\\text{ on }A}$, so the net angular impulse on the system is zero, and total angular momentum is conserved.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum is $L(t) = I_{\\text{total}}(t)\\omega = (I_{\\text{rod}} + m(ut)^2)\\omega$. To maintain constant $\\omega$, a torque must supply $\\tau = \\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}[I_{\\text{rod}}\\omega + m u^2 t^2 \\omega] = 2m u^2 t \\omega$.

The first term is $\\vec{v}_i \\times m_i\\vec{v}_i = 0$. The second term is $\\sum \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_{i}$, where $\\vec{F}_{i}$ is the net force on particle $i$. Splitting $\\vec{F}_{i}$ into internal and external parts, the internal torques cancel pairwise due to Newton's third law.
