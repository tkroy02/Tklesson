      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A planet has twice the mass and twice the radius of Earth. How does its escape speed compare to Earth's?",
        "options": [
          "It is the same.",
          "It is $\\sqrt{2}$ times larger.",
          "It is 2 times larger.",
          "It is half as large."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Escape speed is $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$. If both $M$ and $R$ double, the ratio $M/R$ is unchanged, so $v_{esc}$ is the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is launched from a planet's surface with a speed $v > v_{esc}$, what will be its 'final' speed at a distance very far from the planet ($v_{\\infty}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$v - v_{esc}$",
          "$\\sqrt{v^2 - v_{esc}^2}$",
          "$0$",
          "$\\sqrt{v_{esc}^2 - v^2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Energy conservation: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\infty}^2$. Since $\\frac{GMm}{R} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{esc}^2$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_{esc}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\infty}^2$. Cancel $\\frac{1}{2}m$ and solve: $v_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{v^2 - v_{esc}^2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the mass of the escaping object ($m$) absent from the final escape speed formula?",
        "options": [
          "Heavy objects don't experience gravity.",
          "The kinetic energy and potential energy are both proportional to $m$, so it cancels.",
          "The formula only works for small satellites.",
          "It is an approximation for $m \\ll M$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Setting the total energy at infinity to zero: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} = 0$. The mass $m$ appears in both terms and can be canceled, leaving $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$ independent of $m$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A black hole is an object where the escape speed at the 'event horizon' is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "The speed of sound.",
          "The orbital speed of Earth.",
          "The speed of light ($c$).",
          "Infinity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The event horizon is defined as the surface at which the escape speed equals the speed of light $c$. This gives the Schwarzschild radius $R_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much more kinetic energy does a satellite in a circular orbit need to escape?",
        "options": [
          "It already has enough.",
          "It needs its kinetic energy to be doubled.",
          "It needs its kinetic energy to be quadrupled.",
          "It needs to stop moving first."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A satellite in a circular orbit of radius $R$ has kinetic energy $K_{\\text{orbit}} = \\frac{GMm}{2R}$. The escape kinetic energy is $K_{\\text{escape}} = \\frac{GMm}{R}$. Thus, the required additional kinetic energy is $\\frac{GMm}{2R}$, which is exactly equal to its current kinetic energy—so it must double its kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a planet's radius is compressed to $1/4$ of its original size while mass stays the same, the escape speed:",
        "options": [
          "Doubles.",
          "Quadruples.",
          "Stays the same.",
          "Decreases by half."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$v_{esc} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R}}$. If $R$ becomes $R/4$, then $1/\\sqrt{R}$ becomes $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ times larger. So the escape speed doubles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Launching a rocket from a high‑altitude mountain reduces the required escape speed because:",
        "options": [
          "The air is thinner.",
          "The starting radius $R$ is larger.",
          "$G$ is smaller.",
          "The rocket is closer to the Sun."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Escape speed depends on the distance from the planet's center: $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$. Starting from a higher altitude means a larger $R$, which slightly reduces the required escape speed. (Though the effect is small for realistic mountains, the principle is correct.)"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The integral $\\int_R^{\\infty} \\frac{GMm}{r^2} dr$ represents:",
        "options": [
          "The total energy of the planet.",
          "The work required to move mass $m$ to infinity.",
          "The force of gravity at infinity.",
          "The escape velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work done against gravity to move an object from radius $R$ to infinity is $W = \\int_R^{\\infty} F_{\\text{ext}} dr$, where $F_{\\text{ext}} = +\\frac{GMm}{r^2}$ (the external force needed to balance gravity). Thus, $W = \\int_R^{\\infty} \\frac{GMm}{r^2} dr = \\frac{GMm}{R}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which trajectory is associated with a launch speed exactly equal to $v_{esc}$?",
        "options": [
          "Circle",
          "Ellipse",
          "Parabola",
          "Hyperbola"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a gravitational orbit, $E < 0$ gives an ellipse (circle is a special case), $E = 0$ gives a parabola, and $E > 0$ gives a hyperbola. Launching with exactly escape speed yields $E = 0$, so the trajectory is parabolic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Earth had no atmosphere, would the escape speed for a pebble be different than for a space shuttle?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, the shuttle is heavier.",
          "No, the escape speed is independent of the object's mass.",
          "Yes, because of the engine power.",
          "No, but only if they are launched at the same angle."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Escape speed $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$ depends only on the planet's mass and radius, not on the escaping object's mass. In the absence of atmospheric drag, both would need the same launch speed to escape."

        "50": "Good foundational understanding. Focus on: escape speed formula $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{2GM/R}$, energy conservation $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} = 0$ for escape, and the fact that mass cancels in the derivation.",
        "0": "Start with the energy‑balance condition for escape: kinetic energy at launch equals the magnitude of the gravitational potential energy. That is, $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{GMm}{R}$, which simplifies to $v = \\sqrt{2GM/R}$."
