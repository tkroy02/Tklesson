      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A net force $F(t) = F_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$ acts on a particle of mass $m$ starting from rest at $t = 0$. What is the magnitude of the momentum of the particle at time $t = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{F_0}{\\omega}$",
          "$\\frac{2F_0}{\\omega}$",
          "$\\frac{F_0 \\pi}{\\omega}$",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Momentum change equals impulse: $\\Delta p = \\int_0^{\\pi/\\omega} F(t)\\,dt = \\int_0^{\\pi/\\omega} F_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\,dt = \\left[-\\frac{F_0}{\\omega} \\cos(\\omega t)\\right]_0^{\\pi/\\omega}$. Evaluating: $\\frac{F_0}{\\omega}(-\\cos\\pi + \\cos0) = \\frac{F_0}{\\omega}(-(-1) + 1) = \\frac{2F_0}{\\omega}$. Since the particle starts from rest, $p(t) = \\Delta p = \\frac{2F_0}{\\omega}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2\\text{ kg}$ object is subject to an impulse where the force is given by $F(t) = 12t - 3t^2$ (in Newtons) from $t=0$ to $t=2\\text{ s}$. If the object was initially moving at $-2\\text{ m/s}$, what is its final velocity?",
        "options": [
          "$6\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$8\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$14\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$16\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First compute impulse: $J = \\int_0^2 F(t)\\,dt = \\int_0^2 (12t - 3t^2)\\,dt = \\left[6t^2 - t^3\\right]_0^2 = (24 - 8) = 16\\text{ N·s}$. Impulse equals change in momentum: $J = m(v_f - v_i) = 2(v_f - (-2)) = 2(v_f + 2)$. So $16 = 2v_f + 4 \\Rightarrow 2v_f = 12 \\Rightarrow v_f = 6\\text{ m/s}$."

          "$2\\alpha t$",

          "$2\\alpha$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By definition, $F(t) = \\frac{dp}{dt}$. Differentiate $p(t) = \\alpha t^2 + \\beta$ with respect to $t$: $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 2\\alpha t$. Therefore $F(t) = 2\\alpha t$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A kinetic energy vs. time graph for a particle shows $K(t) = bt^2$. Which of the following expresses the magnitude of the net force $F$ as a function of time, assuming the mass $m$ is constant and the particle moves in one dimension?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{2mb}$",
          "$2bt$",
          "$\\sqrt{\\frac{2b}{m}}$",
          "$b/m$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kinetic energy is $K = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$, so $p = \\sqrt{2mK} = \\sqrt{2m b t^2} = t\\sqrt{2mb}$. Then force is $F = \\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(t\\sqrt{2mb}) = \\sqrt{2mb}$. This is constant, independent of time. The force magnitude is $\\sqrt{2mb}$."

        "options": [
          "Yes, by integrating $F(x) dx$.",
          "No, impulse requires force as a function of time $F(t)$.",
          "Yes, because $F = ma$.",
          "Only if $n=1$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Impulse is defined as $J = \\int F(t)\\,dt$. If the force is given as a function of position, $F(x)$, you must know how $x$ varies with time, $x(t)$, to rewrite $F(x(t))$ and integrate over time. Without $x(t)$, the impulse cannot be determined from $F(x)$ alone."
