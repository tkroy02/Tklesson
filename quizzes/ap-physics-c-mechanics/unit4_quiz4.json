      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system of total mass $M$ is initially at rest. A time‑dependent net external force $\\vec{F}(t) = kt^2$ is applied to the system. What is the velocity of the center of mass as a function of time?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{kt^3}{3M}$",
          "$\\frac{kt^3}{M}$",
          "$\\frac{2kt}{M}$",
          "$\\frac{kt^2}{M}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newton’s second law for the center of mass: $F_{ext} = M \\frac{dv_{cm}}{dt}$. Thus $\\frac{dv_{cm}}{dt} = \\frac{kt^2}{M}$. Integrate from $t=0$ to $t$ with $v_{cm}(0)=0$: $v_{cm}(t) = \\frac{k}{M} \\int_0^t t'^2 \\, dt' = \\frac{k}{M} \\cdot \\frac{t^3}{3} = \\frac{kt^3}{3M}$."

        "question": "The position of the center of mass of a $4\\text{ kg}$ system is given by $x_{cm}(t) = 3t^3 - 2t$. What is the net external force acting on the system at $t = 2\\text{ s}$?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "First, find the acceleration of the center of mass: $v_{cm}(t) = \\frac{dx_{cm}}{dt} = 9t^2 - 2$, $a_{cm}(t) = \\frac{dv_{cm}}{dt} = 18t$. At $t=2$, $a_{cm} = 18(2) = 36\\text{ m/s}^2$. Then $F_{ext} = M \\, a_{cm} = (4\\text{ kg})(36\\text{ m/s}^2) = 144\\text{ N}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system's total momentum is given by the function $p(t) = \\alpha t + \\beta e^{-\\gamma t}$. The net external force on the system is zero when:",
        "options": [
          "$t = 0$",
          "$t = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\gamma}{\\alpha}\\right)$",

          "The force is never zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Net external force is $F_{ext} = \\frac{dp}{dt} = \\alpha - \\beta \\gamma e^{-\\gamma t}$. Set $F_{ext}=0$: $\\alpha = \\beta \\gamma e^{-\\gamma t} \\Rightarrow e^{-\\gamma t} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta \\gamma}$. Taking natural logs: $-\\gamma t = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta \\gamma}\\right) \\Rightarrow t = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta \\gamma}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\gamma}{\\alpha}\\right)$ (using $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln x$)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A variable mass system (like a leaking tank) has a total mass $M(t) = M_0 - bt$. If it moves with a constant velocity $v$, what external force must be applied to maintain this motion?",

          "$bv$",

          "$M_0 v$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Momentum $p(t) = M(t)v = (M_0 - bt)v$. Then $F_{ext} = \\frac{dp}{dt} = v \\frac{dM}{dt} = v(-b) = -bv$. The negative sign indicates the external force must oppose the direction of motion to compensate for the loss of mass (which, if unopposed, would cause an increase in speed because momentum is conserved in the absence of external forces)."
