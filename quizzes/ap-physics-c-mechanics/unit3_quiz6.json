      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The force of universal gravitation is $F(r) = -\\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$. What is the associated potential energy function $U(r)$, assuming $U(\\infty) = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "$U(r) = \\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$",
          "$U(r) = -\\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}$",
          "$U(r) = \\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}$",
          "$U(r) = -\\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since $F = -\\frac{dU}{dr}$, we have $U(r) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} F(r) dr = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} (-\\frac{GmM}{r^2}) dr = \\int_{\\infty}^{r} \\frac{GmM}{r^2} dr$. Integrating: $[ -\\frac{GmM}{r} ]_{\\infty}^{r} = (-\\frac{GmM}{r}) - (-0) = -\\frac{GmM}{r}$. The negative potential indicates a bound system: zero at infinity, negative at finite distances."

        "question": "A 'non-linear' spring exerts a force $F(x) = -kx - \\beta x^3$. What is the work required to compress this spring from $x=0$ to $x=X$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{2}kX^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\beta X^4$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}kX^2 + \\beta X^3$",

          "$\\frac{1}{2}(k + \\beta)X^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The work done by an external agent against the spring force equals the increase in elastic potential energy. Since $F_{spring} = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$, we have $U(x) = -\\int F_{spring} dx = \\int (kx + \\beta x^3) dx = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\beta x^4 + C$. Taking $U(0)=0$, the work required is $U(X) = \\frac{1}{2}kX^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\beta X^4$."

        "explanation": "Initial distance from planet center: $r_i = R$. Final distance: $r_f = R + h = 2R$. $U_i = -\\frac{GmM}{R}$, $U_f = -\\frac{GmM}{2R}$. $\\Delta U = U_f - U_i = (-\\frac{GmM}{2R}) - (-\\frac{GmM}{R}) = \\frac{GmM}{2R}$. Note: Near Earth's surface, $\\Delta U \\approx mgh = mgR$, but this exact form uses the full $1/r$ potential."

        "question": "A block of mass $m$ falls from a height $h$ onto a vertical spring with constant $k$. At the moment of maximum compression $x$, which equation represents the conservation of energy?",

          "$mgh = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Taking the reference point for gravitational potential at the point of maximum compression, the block starts at height $(h+x)$ above this point. Initial energy: $E_i = mg(h+x)$ (all potential). Final energy at max compression: $E_f = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ (all elastic potential, velocity = 0). Conservation gives $mg(h+x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$."

          "$mgR$",

          "$0$",
          "$-\\frac{GmM}{R}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Escape velocity is the minimum speed needed to reach infinity with zero kinetic energy. At infinity, $U(\\infty)=0$ and we want $K(\\infty)=0$, so total energy $E_{\\infty}=0$. Conservation: $E_{surface} = E_{\\infty} = 0$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{2}mv_e^2 - \\frac{GmM}{R} = 0$, yielding $v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$."

          "The spring constant $k$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For any potential energy function $U(x)$, the force is given by $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. The derivative $dU/dx$ is the slope of the U-x graph. Therefore, the slope at any point equals $-F(x)$. For a spring, $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, so slope = $kx$, and $F = -kx$ (Hooke's Law)."

          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Gravitational potential energy: $U = -\\frac{GmM}{r}$. Total energy: $E = K + U = \\frac{GmM}{2r} - \\frac{GmM}{r} = -\\frac{GmM}{2r}$. For circular orbits, note that $K = -\\frac{1}{2}U$, so $E = \\frac{1}{2}U = -K$. The negative total energy indicates a bound orbit."

          "$k/x^2$",
          "$-k \\ln(x)$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using $F = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$: $\\frac{d}{dx}(k/x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(kx^{-1}) = -kx^{-2} = -k/x^2$. Therefore, $F = -(-k/x^2) = k/x^2$. This is a repulsive inverse-square force (like between two like charges)."

          "It increases by a factor of 6.",
          "It increases by a factor of 9.",
          "It remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a linear spring, $U_s = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. If $x \\rightarrow 3x$, then $U_s \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}k(3x)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(9x^2) = 9 \\times (\\frac{1}{2}kx^2) = 9U_s$. Potential energy scales with the square of displacement."

        "options": [
          "It is the same.",
          "It is doubled.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It is quadrupled."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gravitational potential energy: $U = -\\frac{GmM}{R}$, where $m$ is the object's mass, $M$ is the planet's mass, and $R$ is the planet's radius. If $M$ doubles while $R$ remains constant, $U$ doubles (becomes more negative by a factor of 2)."
