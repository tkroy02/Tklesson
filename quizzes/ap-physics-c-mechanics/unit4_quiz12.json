Additionally, each falling link hits with speed $v = \\sqrt{2gy}$ and is brought to rest; the impulse force is $v \\frac{dm}{dt} = \\sqrt{2gy} \\cdot \\frac{M}{L} \\frac{dy}{dt}$. But $\\frac{dy}{dt} = v = \\sqrt{2gy}$, so the impact force = $\\frac{M}{L}(2gy)$. Total force $F = \\frac{M}{L}yg + \\frac{M}{L}(2gy) = 3\\frac{M}{L}gy$. When $y = L$, $F = 3Mg$."
