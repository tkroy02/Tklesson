        "question": "A particle of mass $m$ is at rest at $t=0$. A time-dependent force $F(t) = Ft^2$ is applied. What is the velocity of the particle at time $t$?",

Integrate: $\\int_0^v m v \\, dv = \\int_0^x kx \\, dx \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\Rightarrow v^2 = \\frac{k}{m}x^2 \\Rightarrow v = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}x$ (positive for motion in $+x$)."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The thrust force provides the net external force, so $m \\frac{dv}{dt} = Ru$ (A). With $m(t) = m_0 - Rt$, acceleration is $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{Ru}{m_0 - Rt}$ (B). Integrating (with $v(0)=0$) gives the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation: $v(t) = u \\ln(\\frac{m_0}{m_0 - Rt}) = u \\ln(\\frac{m_0}{m})$ (C). All statements are correct."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation of motion is $m\\frac{dv}{dt} = mg - bv$. This is separable: $\\frac{dv}{g - (b/m)v} = dt$. Integrate with $v(0)=0$: $v(t) = \\frac{mg}{b}(1 - e^{-bt/m})$. This is the velocity for linear drag, approaching terminal velocity $v_T = mg/b$."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The magnitude of the drag force is $cv^2$ (opposite velocity). Applying Newton's Second Law in the direction opposite motion gives $ma = -cv^2$, so $a = -\\frac{c}{m}v^2$. The acceleration magnitude is proportional to $v^2$."

        "explanation": "Power is related to force and velocity by $P = Fv$. Therefore, the net force $F = P/v$. Using $F = ma$, we have $ma = P/v \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{P}{mv}$."
