      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A planet in an elliptical orbit moves from perihelion to aphelion. What happens to its angular momentum $L$ and its kinetic energy $K$?",
        "options": [
          "$L$ is constant; $K$ increases.",
          "$L$ decreases; $K$ decreases.",
          "$L$ is constant; $K$ decreases.",
          "$L$ increases; $K$ is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Because gravity is a central force (always directed toward the Sun), the torque about the Sun is zero, so angular momentum $L$ is conserved. As the planet moves from perihelion (closest) to aphelion (farthest), gravitational potential energy increases. Since total mechanical energy $E$ is also conserved, kinetic energy must decrease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At perihelion ($r_p$) and aphelion ($r_a$), the velocity vector is perpendicular to the radius vector. If the speed at perihelion is $v_p$, what is the speed $v_a$ at aphelion?",
        "options": [
          "$v_p (r_a/r_p)$",
          "$v_p (r_p/r_a)$",
          "$v_p \\sqrt{r_p/r_a}$",
          "$v_p (r_p/r_a)^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At both apsides, the velocity is perpendicular to the radius vector, so $L = mvr$ at each point. Conservation of angular momentum gives $m v_p r_p = m v_a r_a$. Thus, $v_a = v_p (r_p/r_a)$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The total energy of a satellite in an elliptical orbit is $E = -1.0 \\times 10^{10}$ J. If the satellite's speed is increased such that $E$ becomes exactly 0, the new trajectory will be:",
        "options": [
          "A larger ellipse.",
          "A circle.",
          "A parabola.",
          "A hyperbola."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For gravitational orbits, $E < 0$ corresponds to bound elliptical (including circular) orbits, $E = 0$ corresponds to an unbound parabolic trajectory (just enough energy to escape to infinity with zero residual speed), and $E > 0$ corresponds to a hyperbolic trajectory."

        "question": "According to Kepler's Third Law, if the semi‑major axis $a$ of an orbit is doubled, the period $T$ increases by a factor of:",
        "options": [
          "$2$",
          "$\\sqrt{2}$",
          "$2.83$ ($2\\sqrt{2}$)",
          "$4$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Kepler's third law states $T^2 \\propto a^3$. If $a \\to 2a$, then $a^3 \\to 8a^3$, so $T^2 \\to 8T^2$, hence $T \\to \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.83$ times the original period."

        "options": [
          "$K > |U|$",
          "$K = |U|$",
          "$K < |U|$",
          "$K = U$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a bound orbit, total energy $E = K + U < 0$. Since $U$ is negative, $U = -|U|$, we have $K - |U| < 0$, so $K < |U|$."

        "question": "A comet orbits the Sun. At point A, its distance is $r$ and speed is $v$. At point B, its distance is $3r$. If the angle between $\\vec{v}_B$ and $\\vec{r}_B$ is $30^\\circ$, what is $v_B$?",
        "options": [
          "$v/3$",
          "$2v/3$",
          "$v/6$",
          "$v/(3 \\sin 30^\\circ)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum conservation: $m v r \\sin 90^\\circ = m v_B (3r) \\sin 30^\\circ$. Since $\\sin 90^\\circ = 1$ and $\\sin 30^\\circ = 1/2$, we have $v r = v_B (3r) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} v_B r$. Cancel $r$: $v = \\frac{3}{2} v_B$, so $v_B = \\frac{2}{3} v$."

          "Semi‑minor axis",
          "It is constant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gravitational force magnitude is $F_g = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}$. It is largest when the distance $r$ is smallest, which occurs at perihelion (closest approach to the central body)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The eccentricity of Earth's orbit is very small ($e \\approx 0.017$). This means Earth's orbit is nearly:",

          "Parabolic",
          "Linear",
          "Circular",
          "Hyperbolic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Eccentricity $e$ measures the deviation from a circle: $e=0$ is a perfect circle, $0<e<1$ is an ellipse, $e=1$ is a parabola, $e>1$ is a hyperbola. An eccentricity of 0.017 is very close to 0, indicating a nearly circular orbit."

        "question": "Kepler's Second Law implies that a planet spends the most time in which part of its orbit?",
        "options": [
          "Near the Sun (moving fast)",
          "Far from the Sun (moving slow)",
          "It spends equal time in all equal arc‑lengths.",
          "It depends on the planet's mass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Kepler's second law (equal areas in equal times) means the planet moves fastest when close to the Sun and slowest when far away. Since it covers a given arc‑length more slowly when far away, it spends a longer time in the outer portions of the ellipse."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the mass of the central star is doubled, how does the period $T$ of a planet with a constant semi‑major axis $a$ change?",

          "Increases by $\\sqrt{2}$",
          "Decreases by $\\sqrt{2}$",
          "Doubles",
          "Stays the same"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From Kepler's third law (derived from Newton's law of gravitation): $T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{GM}$. Thus, $T \\propto 1/\\sqrt{M}$. If $M$ doubles, $T$ becomes $1/\\sqrt{2}$ times the original period."
