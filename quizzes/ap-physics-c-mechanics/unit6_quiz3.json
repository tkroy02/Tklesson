      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $0.5\\text{ kg}$ mass is attached to a spring and oscillates. If the position is $x(t) = 0.2\\cos(10t)$, what is the spring constant $k$?",
        "options": [
          "$5\\text{ N/m}$",
          "$50\\text{ N/m}$",
          "$10\\text{ N/m}$",
          "$20\\text{ N/m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$, we identify $\\omega = 10\\text{ rad/s}$. For a mass‑spring system, $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$. Thus, $10 = \\sqrt{k/0.5} \\implies 100 = k/0.5 \\implies k = 50\\text{ N/m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what position $x$ is the magnitude of the velocity $|v|$ at its maximum?",
        "options": [
          "$x = A$",
          "$x = -A$",
          "$x = 0$",
          "$x = A/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Velocity in SHM is $v(t) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. The maximum magnitude $v_{max} = A\\omega$ occurs when $|\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)| = 1$. At those instants, the position $x = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) = 0$, i.e., the equilibrium point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the amplitude $A$ of a mass‑spring system, what happens to the period $T$?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The period $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k}$ is derived from the differential equation $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\\frac{k}{m}x$, which is linear and homogeneous. The amplitude does not appear; it is determined by initial conditions. Therefore, the period is independent of amplitude."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass on a spring has an acceleration $a(t) = -100x(t)$. What is the frequency $f$ of the oscillation?",
        "options": [
          "$10\\text{ Hz}$",
          "$10\\pi\\text{ Hz}$",
          "$5/\\pi\\text{ Hz}$",
          "$100\\text{ Hz}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Comparing $a = -100x$ with the SHM form $a = -\\omega^2x$ gives $\\omega^2 = 100$, so $\\omega = 10\\text{ rad/s}$. Frequency $f = \\omega/(2\\pi) = 10/(2\\pi) = 5/\\pi\\text{ Hz}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the maximum acceleration $a_{max}$ of a system with amplitude $A$ and spring constant $k$?",
        "options": [
          "$kA/m$",
          "$\\sqrt{k/m}A$",
          "$k/m$",
          "$mA/k$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From Newton’s second law: $ma = -kx$. At maximum displacement $x = A$, the acceleration magnitude is greatest: $|a_{max}| = \\frac{kA}{m}$. This can also be written as $a_{max} = A\\omega^2$ since $\\omega^2 = k/m$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass is attached to a vertical spring. How does the equilibrium position change compared to a horizontal spring?",
        "options": [
          "It doesn't change.",
          "It shifts by $\\Delta x = mg/k$.",
          "It shifts by $\\Delta x = k/mg$.",
          "The system no longer oscillates."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a vertical spring, gravity adds a constant force. At equilibrium, the spring force balances gravity: $k\\Delta x = mg$, where $\\Delta x$ is the stretch from the natural (unstretched) length. This shifts the equilibrium point downward by $\\Delta x = mg/k$, but the differential equation about this new equilibrium is still $\\frac{d^2x'}{dt^2} = -\\frac{k}{m}x'$, so the angular frequency $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$ is unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the total mechanical energy $E$ as a function of $x$ and $v$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$",
          "$mv + kx$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2\\cos(\\omega t)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In SHM, the total mechanical energy is conserved and equals the sum of kinetic energy $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and elastic potential energy $\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. This sum is constant and also equals $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2$ (or $\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2A^2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a mass $m$ is moving with speed $v_0$ as it passes through equilibrium, what is the amplitude $A$ of its subsequent motion?",
        "options": [
          "$v_0\\sqrt{m/k}$",
          "$v_0\\sqrt{k/m}$",
          "$v_0^2(m/k)$",
          "$v_0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium ($x=0$), all energy is kinetic: $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$. At maximum displacement ($x=A$), all energy is potential: $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. Equating these gives $\\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 \\implies A = v_0\\sqrt{m/k}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring is cut in half. What happens to the spring constant $k_{\\text{new}}$ of each half?",
        "options": [
          "$k/2$",
          "$k$",
          "$2k$",
          "$4k$"
        ],
        "explanation": "For an ideal spring, the spring constant is inversely proportional to its length. If the original spring of length $L$ has constant $k$, then each half of length $L/2$ has constant $k_{\\text{new}} = (L / (L/2))k = 2k$. A shorter spring is stiffer because the same force produces less extension.",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass‑spring system is undergoing SHM. If the mass is replaced by a mass $4m$, how does the maximum velocity $v_{max}$ change, assuming the total energy remains the same?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2$. If $E$ is constant and $m$ becomes $4m$, then $\\frac{1}{2}(4m)v_{max,\\text{new}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{max,\\text{old}}^2$. Canceling common factors gives $4v_{max,\\text{new}}^2 = v_{max,\\text{old}}^2$, so $v_{max,\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{2}v_{max,\\text{old}}$."
