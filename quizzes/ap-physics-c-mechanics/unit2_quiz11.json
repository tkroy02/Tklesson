      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ rests on a larger block of mass $M$, which rests on a frictionless horizontal surface. A horizontal force $F$ is applied to the lower block $M$. If the blocks move together without slipping, the magnitude of the friction force exerted by $M$ on $m$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$F$",
          "$\\mu_s mg$",
          "$\\frac{m}{M+m}F$",
          "$\\frac{M}{M+m}F$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since the blocks move together, they have the same acceleration $a$. Treat them as a single system: $F = (M + m)a \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{F}{M+m}$. Now consider block $m$ alone. The only horizontal force on it is the static friction $f_s$ from $M$, which provides its acceleration. So $f_s = m a = m \\cdot \\frac{F}{M+m} = \\frac{m}{M+m}F$."

        "question": "An astronaut of mass $m$ is in space, pushing away a satellite of mass $M$. If the astronaut exerts a time-dependent force $F(t) = F_0 e^{-kt}$ on the satellite, the ratio of the astronaut's acceleration to the satellite's acceleration ($a_m / a_M$) at any time $t$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$1$",
          "$M / m$",
          "$m / M$",
          "$e^{-kt}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By Newton's 3rd Law, the force on the satellite equals the force on the astronaut: $F_{sat} = F_{ast} = F(t)$. Applying Newton's 2nd Law: For the satellite: $F(t) = M a_M$. For the astronaut: $F(t) = m a_m$. Since the magnitudes of force are equal, $M a_M = m a_m$. Therefore, $a_m / a_M = M / m$. This ratio is constant and independent of the time-varying magnitude $F(t)$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two blocks are connected by a heavy rope of mass $m_r$. A force $F$ pulls the system. According to Newton's Third Law, the force the rope exerts on the front block is _________ the force the front block exerts on the rope.",
        "options": [
          "Greater than",
          "Less than",
          "Equal to",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action (force), there is an equal and opposite reaction. The force the rope exerts on the block and the force the block exerts on the rope are a Third Law pair. They are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, regardless of any other masses or accelerations in the system."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'Man-in-a-Balloon' problem, a man of mass $m$ climbs a rope ladder hanging from a hot air balloon of mass $M$ that is floating stationary. As the man accelerates upward at $a_{rel}$ relative to the ladder, the balloon:",
        "options": [
          "Remains stationary.",
          "Accelerates downward such that the center of mass of the system remains stationary.",
          "Accelerates upward to maintain equilibrium.",
          "Moves at constant velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Assuming no net external forces (like buoyancy adjusting to keep the balloon at rest initially), the center of mass of the man-balloon system must remain stationary. When the man exerts a force to climb up, the balloon experiences an equal and opposite force (Newton's 3rd Law). Therefore, as the man accelerates upward relative to the ladder, the balloon accelerates downward relative to the ground, so that the system's center of mass does not move."

        "question": "A rocket is accelerating in deep space. The force that accelerates the rocket is the:",
        "options": [
          "Force of the exhaust gases pushing against the surrounding vacuum.",
          "Reaction force of the expelled gases pushing back on the rocket.",
          "Internal pressure of the combustion chamber alone.",
          "Gravitational pull of the nearest planet."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The rocket engine expels gas at high speed backward. By Newton's 3rd Law, the expelled gas exerts an equal and opposite forward reaction force on the rocket. This is the thrust force. It does not require an external medium to 'push against'; the reaction is between the rocket and its own expelled mass."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two particles with charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are released from rest. At a specific moment, $q_1$ experiences an acceleration $a_1$. If $m_2 = 3m_1$, what is the magnitude of the acceleration of $q_2$?",
        "options": [
          "$a_1$",
          "$3a_1$",
          "$a_1 / 3$",
          "$9a_1$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By Newton's 3rd Law, the electrostatic force $F$ on each particle has the same magnitude: $F_{12} = -F_{21}$. Applying Newton's 2nd Law: For $q_1$, $F = m_1 a_1$. For $q_2$, $F = m_2 a_2$. Equating magnitudes: $m_1 a_1 = m_2 a_2$. Given $m_2 = 3 m_1$, we have $m_1 a_1 = 3 m_1 a_2 \\Rightarrow a_2 = a_1 / 3$."

        "question": "A person stands in an elevator that is accelerating upward. The action-reaction pair for the Normal force $N$ exerted by the floor on the person is:",
        "options": [
          "The weight of the person.",
          "The force of the person pushing down on the floor.",
          "The tension in the elevator cable.",
          "$mg + ma$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An action-reaction pair consists of two forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and act on two different objects. The normal force $N$ is the force the floor (object A) exerts on the person (object B). Its reaction partner is the force the person (object B) exerts down on the floor (object A). The person's weight is the gravitational force the Earth exerts on the person; its reaction is the gravitational force the person exerts on the Earth, not the normal force."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wedge of mass $M$ sits on a frictionless table, and a block of mass $m$ slides down its frictionless incline. Which of the following is an action-reaction pair?",
        "options": [
          "The component $mg \\sin \\theta$ and the acceleration of the block.",
          "The normal force of the wedge on the block and the normal force of the block on the wedge.",
          "The weight of the block and the normal force of the table on the wedge.",
          "There are no action-reaction pairs because the system is accelerating."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Action-reaction pairs are forces of interaction between two objects. The normal force the wedge exerts on the block and the normal force the block exerts on the wedge are a classic Newton's 3rd Law pair. They are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and act on the two different objects (block and wedge)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider a system where the mass is changing, such as a conveyor belt dropping sand onto a cart. To maintain a constant velocity $v$, a force $F = v(dm/dt)$ must be applied. This force is necessary because the sand:",
        "options": [
          "Exerts a backward reaction force on the cart as it is accelerated to velocity $v$.",
          "Increases the friction coefficient.",
          "Creates a vacuum behind the cart.",
          "Negates gravity."
        ],
        "explanation": "This is a variable mass system. The general form of Newton's 2nd Law is $F_{ext} = \\frac{dp}{dt} = m\\frac{dv}{dt} + v\\frac{dm}{dt}$. The sand comes to rest relative to the cart with horizontal speed $0$, so it must be accelerated to the cart's speed $v$ upon landing. This momentum transfer requires a force. If we want $dv/dt = 0$, then $F_{ext} = v\\frac{dm}{dt}$. This force counteracts the backward reaction force the sand exerts on the cart as it is accelerated forward.",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A horse pulls a cart. If the force the horse exerts on the cart is equal and opposite to the force the cart exerts on the horse, how does the system move?",
        "options": [
          "It cannot move because the forces cancel out.",
          "It moves because the horse exerts a force on the ground greater than the cart's friction.",
          "It moves only if the horse is more massive than the cart.",
          "It moves because the action-reaction pairs act on the same object."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The forces between the horse and the cart are an internal action-reaction pair. They cancel each other when considering the horse-cart system as a whole, but they do not cancel for the individual objects. For the system to accelerate, there must be a net external force. The horse pushes backward on the ground, and by Newton's 3rd Law, the ground pushes forward on the horse. This external force (ground on horse) is what accelerates the entire horse-cart system forward, provided it overcomes any friction from the cart's wheels."
