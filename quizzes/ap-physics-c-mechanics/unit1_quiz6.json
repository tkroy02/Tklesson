At $t = \\pi/2$, $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$, $\\cos(\\pi/2)=0$, so $\\mathbf{a} = (-2(1))\\hat{i} + 0\\hat{j} = -2\\hat{i}$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In uniform circular motion, the centripetal acceleration is always directed toward the center of the circle, perpendicular to the tangential velocity vector. Therefore, $\\mathbf{a} \\perp \\mathbf{v}$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The dot product $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}$ gives the rate of change of kinetic energy per unit mass. If it is positive, the acceleration has a component in the same direction as the velocity, so the particle is gaining speed."
