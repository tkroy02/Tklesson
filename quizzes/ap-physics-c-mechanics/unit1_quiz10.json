      {

        "question": "A car (A) moves East at $30\\text{ m/s}$ and a truck (B) moves East at $20\\text{ m/s}$. What is the velocity of the car relative to the truck ($\\mathbf{v}_{A/B}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$10\\text{ m/s}$ East",
          "$10\\text{ m/s}$ West",

          "$50\\text{ m/s}$ West"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Relative velocity formula: $\\mathbf{v}_{A/B} = \\mathbf{v}_A - \\mathbf{v}_B = 30\\hat{i} - 20\\hat{i} = 10\\hat{i}\\text{ m/s}$. Since East is positive, this is $10\\text{ m/s}$ East."

        "question": "A train moves North at $40\\text{ m/s}$. A passenger on the train walks toward the back of the train at $2\\text{ m/s}$ relative to the train. What is the passenger's velocity relative to the ground?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Define North as positive. Passenger relative to train: $\\mathbf{v}_{P/T} = -2\\hat{j}$ (backward means South relative to the train). Train relative to ground: $\\mathbf{v}_{T/G} = 40\\hat{j}$. Then $\\mathbf{v}_{P/G} = \\mathbf{v}_{P/T} + \\mathbf{v}_{T/G} = -2\\hat{j} + 40\\hat{j} = 38\\hat{j}\\text{ m/s}$, or $38\\text{ m/s}$ North."

          "In the direction of the net velocity vector."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The time to cross depends only on the component of velocity perpendicular to the river banks: $t = \\frac{L}{v_\\perp}$, where $L$ is the river width. To minimize $t$, maximize $v_\\perp$ by aiming directly across (perpendicular to the current)."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "To cancel the downstream drift caused by the river current, the swimmer must aim upstream at an angle such that the upstream component of their swimming velocity exactly equals the speed of the current downstream."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In inertial (non-accelerating) frames connected by a constant relative velocity $\\mathbf{u}$, accelerations are related by $\\mathbf{a}' = \\mathbf{a}$ because $\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}}{dt} = 0$. Acceleration is invariant under Galilean transformation."

Then $\\mathbf{v}_{R/P} = \\mathbf{v}_{R/G} - \\mathbf{v}_{P/G} = (-6\\hat{j}) - (8\\hat{i}) = -8\\hat{i} - 6\\hat{j}$.

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Airspeed is the plane's speed relative to the air. Ground speed is its speed relative to the ground. With a headwind (opposite direction), ground speed = airspeed - wind speed = $200 - 50 = 150\\text{ km/h}$."
