      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rocket ship is sitting on the surface of a planet with a mass of $1 \\times 10^{27} \\text{ kg}$ and a radius of $6.67 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ m}$. What is the planet's escape velocity?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{200} \\text{ m/s}$",
          "$100 \\text{ m/s}$",
          "$100\\sqrt{2} \\text{ m/s}$",
          "$50 \\text{ m/s}$",
          "$10 \\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Use the formula $v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$. $v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot (6.67 \\times 10^{-11}) \\cdot (1 \\times 10^{27})}{6.67 \\times 10^{12}}} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 10^{(-11+27-12)}} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 10^4} = 100\\sqrt{2} \\text{ m/s}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "There are two planets, each with the same surface gravity ($g$), but Planet 1 has a greater radius and is less massive than Planet 2. Which of these planets has a greater escape velocity?",
        "options": [
          "Planet 1",
          "Planet 2",
          "Both have the same escape velocity",
          "Not enough information"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We know $g = \\frac{GM}{R^2}$ and $v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$. We can rewrite escape velocity in terms of $g$: $v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{2gR}$. If $g$ is the same for both, the planet with the larger radius $R$ must have the greater escape velocity."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Satellite A remains in a stable circular orbit of $2R_E$ above the Earth's center. If satellite B were to maintain a stable circular orbit of $4R_E$ above the Earth's center, what velocity must it maintain with respect to satellite A?",
        "options": [
          "$v_B = v_A\\sqrt{2}$",
          "$v_B = 2v_A$",
          "$v_B = v_A$",
          "$v_B = v_A/\\sqrt{2}$",
          "$v_B = v_A/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For circular orbits, $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$. This means $v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}}$. If the radius doubles from $2R_E$ to $4R_E$, the velocity changes by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{2}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A meteor follows an elliptical orbit around the sun. When does the meteor swipe through the greatest area in time $t$?",
        "options": [
          "When it is the closest to the sun",
          "When it is the furthest away from the sun",
          "It is impossible to maintain an elliptical orbit",
          "The meteor sweeps through equal areas in equal time anywhere in the orbit",
          "None of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This is Kepler's Second Law (Law of Equal Areas). Since angular momentum is conserved in a central force field, the areal velocity $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ is constant throughout the entire orbit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite of mass $m$ is traveling in an elliptical orbit about the Earth. At its furthest distance $r_B$ its velocity is $v_B$. What is its velocity at point A, which is a distance $r_A$ from the Earth's center?",

          "$v_A = \\frac{v_B}{r_A}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conservation of angular momentum states $L_A = L_B$. At the apsides (perihelion/aphelion), the velocity is perpendicular to the radius, so $m v_A r_A = m v_B r_B$. Solving for $v_A$ gives $\\frac{v_B r_B}{r_A}$."

          "$T_2 = T_1/2$",
          "$T_2 = T_1/4$",

          "$T_2 = 8T_1$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By Kepler's Third Law, $T^2 \\propto r^3$. If $r$ becomes $1/4r$, then $T^2$ becomes $(1/4)^3 = 1/64$ of its original value. Taking the square root, $T$ becomes $1/8 T_1$."

        "options": [
          "2 hr",
          "4 hr",
          "6 hr",
          "8 hr",
          "32 hr"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ratio of the radii is $r_2/r_1 = (2 \\times 10^6)/(8 \\times 10^6) = 1/4$. Using $\\frac{T_2^2}{T_1^2} = \\frac{r_2^3}{r_1^3}$, we get $T_2^2 = T_1^2 \\cdot (1/4)^3 = 16^2 \\cdot (1/64) = 256/64 = 4$. Therefore, $T_2 = \\sqrt{4} = 2$ hours."

          "$R_{\\text{new}} = R/7$",
          "$R_{\\text{new}} = R/4$",

          "$R_{\\text{new}} = 4R$",
          "$R_{\\text{new}} = 7R$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$T^2 \\propto r^3$. If $T$ increases by a factor of 8, $T^2$ increases by $8^2 = 64$. To satisfy the proportion, $r^3$ must increase by 64, which means $r$ must increase by $\\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$. Thus, $R_{\\text{new}} = 4R$."

          "$E = -\\frac{4GMm}{R_E}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distance from the center is $r = R_E + 2R_E = 3R_E$. The total mechanical energy for a circular orbit is $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r}$. Substituting $r = 3R_E$ gives $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2(3R_E)} = -\\frac{GMm}{6R_E}$."

          "The Moon exerts an equal and opposite force",
          "The astronaut is not accelerating",
          "The astronaut is in a constant state of free fall",
          "In space, the astronaut has no mass"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "'Weightlessness' is the absence of a normal force. Both the satellite and the astronaut are accelerating toward the center of the Earth at the same rate ($g$ at that altitude). Because they are falling together, there is no contact force between the astronaut and the floor of the satellite."
