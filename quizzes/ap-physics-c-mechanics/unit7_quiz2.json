The field inside a uniform sphere is $\\vec{g} = -\\frac{4}{3}\\pi G \\rho \\vec{r}$. For the cavity (a smaller sphere of negative density), the field inside its region is also linear in $\\vec{r}'$, where $\\vec{r}'$ is measured from the cavity center.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Let the distance from $M$ to the zero‑field point be $x$. The fields due to each star must balance: $\\frac{GM}{x^2} = \\frac{G(4M)}{(L-x)^2}$. Cancel $GM$: $\\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{4}{(L-x)^2}$. Take square roots: $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{2}{L-x} \\implies L-x = 2x \\implies 3x = L \\implies x = L/3$."

        "explanation": "Choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $r$ and length $h$, coaxial with the string. By symmetry, $\\vec{g}$ is radial and constant on the lateral surface. The enclosed mass is $M_{enc} = \\lambda h$. Gauss's law: $\\oint \\vec{g} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = -4\\pi G M_{enc}$. The flux is $g \\cdot (2\\pi r h)$. Thus, $g (2\\pi r h) = -4\\pi G (\\lambda h)$.
