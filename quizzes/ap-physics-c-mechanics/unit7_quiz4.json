    "topic": "Negative gravitational potential energy meaning, Kinetic energy in circular orbits, Total mechanical energy in circular orbits, Escape velocity from a surface, Maximum height from given launch speed, Potential inside a uniform sphere, Work to change orbital radii, Speed of a free‑fall from infinity, Binding energy of an orbiting satellite, Potential integrals for arbitrary mass distributions",

    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the absolute gravitational potential energy always negative?",
        "options": [
          "Gravity is a repulsive force.",
          "Work must be done by an external agent to move a mass to the zero‑point at infinity.",
          "Mass can be negative in certain frames.",
          "It is an arbitrary convention with no physical meaning."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The zero of gravitational potential energy is conventionally set at infinite separation. Because gravity is attractive, bringing two masses together from infinity releases energy (negative work is done by gravity). Therefore, any bound configuration has negative potential energy relative to infinity."

        "question": "A satellite of mass $m$ is in a circular orbit of radius $R$ around a planet of mass $M$. What is its kinetic energy $K$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{GMm}{R}$",
          "$\\frac{GMm}{2R}$",
          "$-\\frac{GMm}{2R}$",
          "$\\frac{2GMm}{R}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For circular motion, $\\frac{GMm}{R^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{R} \\implies v^2 = \\frac{GM}{R}$. Kinetic energy $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m \\cdot \\frac{GM}{R} = \\frac{GMm}{2R}$."

          "$\\frac{GMm}{2R}$",
          "$-\\frac{GMm}{2R}$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Potential energy is $U = -\\frac{GMm}{R}$. Total energy is $E = K + U = \\frac{GMm}{2R} - \\frac{GMm}{R} = -\\frac{GMm}{2R}$. Notice that $E = -K$ and $E = \\frac{1}{2}U$ for circular orbits."

          "$\\sqrt{GM/2R}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Escape velocity is the minimum speed such that the total energy is zero at infinity: $\\frac{1}{2}mv_{esc}^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} = 0$. Solving gives $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$."

          "$2R$",
          "The rocket escapes."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Energy conservation: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} = -\\frac{GMm}{R+h}$. Substitute $v^2 = GM/R$: $\\frac{1}{2}m\\frac{GM}{R} - \\frac{GMm}{R} = -\\frac{GMm}{R+h} \\implies -\\frac{GMm}{2R} = -\\frac{GMm}{R+h} \\implies 2R = R+h \\implies h = R$."

          "$V \\propto 1/r$",
          "$V$ is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inside a uniform sphere, $g(r) = \\frac{GMr}{R^3}$. Since $\\vec{g} = -\\nabla V$, integrating $g$ with respect to $r$ gives $V(r) = -\\int g dr = -\\frac{GM}{2R^3}r^2 + C$. The constant $C$ is chosen so that $V$ is continuous at $r=R$. Thus $V \\propto r^2$ inside."

          "$-\\frac{GMm}{4R}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work equals the change in total mechanical energy. $E(r) = -\\frac{GMm}{2r}$. So $W = E(2R) - E(R) = -\\frac{GMm}{4R} - \\left(-\\frac{GMm}{2R}\\right) = \\frac{GMm}{4R}$."

          "$2GM/R$",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Starting from rest at infinity, total energy is zero. At the surface, $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R}$. Setting $E=0$ gives $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{GMm}{R} \\implies v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$, which is exactly the escape velocity."

          "$2\\frac{GMm}{R}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Binding energy is the absolute value of the total mechanical energy, because you must supply $+\\frac{GMm}{2R}$ to raise the total energy from $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2R}$ to $E = 0$ (unbound at infinity)."

          "Both B and C"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Option B: The superposition principle for potentials: $V(\\vec{r}) = -G \\int \\frac{dm}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}$ (with appropriate sign convention). Option C: The fundamental definition relating field to potential: $V(\\vec{r}) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{\\vec{r}} \\mathbf{g} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$. Both are valid ways to compute the potential."
