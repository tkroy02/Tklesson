      {

        "question": "A uniform rod of length $L$ and total mass $M$ lies along the $x$-axis from $x=0$ to $x=L$. What is its $x_{cm}$?",
        "options": [
          "$L/4$",
          "$L/3$",
          "$L/2$",
          "$2L/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a uniform rod, linear density $\\lambda = M/L$. The center of mass is $x_{cm} = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L x \\, dm = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L x \\lambda \\, dx = \\frac{1}{M} \\frac{M}{L} \\int_0^L x \\, dx = \\frac{1}{L} \\cdot \\frac{L^2}{2} = \\frac{L}{2}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A non‑uniform rod of length $L$ has a linear density that varies as $\\lambda(x) = \\alpha x$. Where is its center of mass?",
        "options": [
          "$L/2$",
          "$2L/3$",
          "$3L/4$",
          "$L/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First compute the total mass: $M = \\int_0^L \\lambda(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\alpha x \\, dx = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}L^2$. Then $x_{cm} = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L x \\lambda(x) dx = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_0^L \\alpha x^2 dx = \\frac{\\alpha L^3/3}{\\alpha L^2/2} = \\frac{2}{3}L$."

        "question": "A thin triangular plate of uniform density has vertices at $(0,0)$, $(L,0)$, and $(0,H)$. What is the $x$-coordinate of its center of mass?",
        "options": [
          "$L/2$",
          "$L/4$",
          "$L/3$",
          "$2L/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For any uniform triangle, the center of mass (centroid) lies at the arithmetic mean of the vertices' coordinates: $x_{cm} = \\frac{0 + L + 0}{3} = \\frac{L}{3}$, $y_{cm} = \\frac{0 + 0 + H}{3} = \\frac{H}{3}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When setting up an integral for a 2D object like a semi‑circle, which coordinate system is usually most efficient?",
        "options": [
          "Cartesian ($x, y$)",
          "Polar ($r, \\theta$)",
          "Spherical ($\\rho, \\theta, \\phi$)",
          "Cylindrical ($r, \\theta, z$)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A semi‑circle is naturally described in polar coordinates because its boundary is simply $r = R$, $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$. The area element $dA = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$ and the symmetry make integration straightforward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rod of length $L$ has density $\\lambda(x) = \\lambda_0 (1 + \\frac{x}{L})$. Compared to a uniform rod, the center of mass of this rod is:",
        "options": [
          "Closer to $x=0$",
          "Exactly at $x=L/2$",
          "Closer to $x=L$",
          "At the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The density increases linearly with $x$, so more mass is concentrated toward the right end. Therefore the center of mass lies to the right of the midpoint $L/2$. One can compute exactly: $M = \\int_0^L \\lambda_0(1+\\frac{x}{L})dx = \\frac{3}{2}\\lambda_0 L$, $\\int x\\,dm = \\lambda_0\\int_0^L x(1+\\frac{x}{L})dx = \\frac{5}{6}\\lambda_0 L^2$, giving $x_{cm} = \\frac{5}{9}L > L/2$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a hole is drilled into a uniform circular disk, how do we find the new center of mass?",
        "options": [
          "Integrate only over the hole.",
          "Use the method of 'negative mass' for the hole.",
          "The center of mass does not change.",
          "The center of mass moves toward the hole."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The easiest approach is to treat the original solid disk as having mass $M$ at $\\vec{r}_{disk}$, and then subtract the mass that was removed (the hole) as a 'negative mass' $-m$ located at $\\vec{r}_{hole}$. The new center of mass is $\\vec{r}_{cm} = \\frac{M\\vec{r}_{disk} - m\\vec{r}_{hole}}{M - m}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A thin wire is bent into a semi‑circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin. Using the symmetry about the $y$‑axis, what can we conclude about $x_{cm}$?",
        "options": [
          "$x_{cm} = R$",
          "$x_{cm} = 0$",
          "$x_{cm} = R/2$",
          "$x_{cm} = 2R/\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The semi‑circle is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis (i.e., if you reflect the left half across the $y$-axis, you get the right half). Therefore the center of mass must lie on the line of symmetry, which is the $y$-axis, so $x_{cm}=0$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a 3D solid sphere of uniform density, where is the center of mass located?",
        "options": [
          "On the surface.",
          "At the geometric center.",
          "At $3/4$ of the radius.",
          "It depends on the total mass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A uniform sphere possesses spherical symmetry: every point on the surface is equidistant from a central point. The center of mass must coincide with that point of symmetry, i.e., the geometric center."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the center of mass of a cone, you would typically slice it into infinitesimal:",
        "options": [
          "Vertical strips ($dx$)",
          "Concentric shells ($dr$)",
          "Horizontal disks ($dy$)",
          "Cubes ($dx\\,dy\\,dz$)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a right circular cone standing on its base, slicing horizontally gives circular disks of radius $r(y)$ that vary linearly with height. Each disk has mass $dm = \\rho \\pi [r(y)]^2 dy$, and its own center of mass is at height $y$. This turns the 3D problem into a 1D integral over $y$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the $dm$ expression for a uniform circular plate of radius $R$ and mass $M$ if we use polar coordinates?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{M}{\\pi R^2} r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$",
          "$\\frac{M}{L} dr$",
          "$\\frac{M}{\\pi R^2} dr \\, d\\theta$",
          "$M r^2 dr$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The area density is $\\sigma = \\frac{M}{\\pi R^2}$. In polar coordinates, the area element is $dA = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$, so $dm = \\sigma \\, dA = \\frac{M}{\\pi R^2} \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$."
