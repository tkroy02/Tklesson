    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle’s position is given by $x(t) = \\frac{1}{3}t^3 - 4t + 5$. At what time $t$ does the particle's velocity reach its minimum value?",
        "options": [
          "$t = 0\\text{ s}$",
          "$t = 1\\text{ s}$",
          "$t = 2\\text{ s}$",
          "$t = 4\\text{ s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = t^2 - 4$. This is a parabola opening upward with vertex at $t = 0$ (since $v(t)$ is symmetric about $t=0$). For $t \\ge 0$, the minimum occurs at $t=0$, where $v(0) = -4\\text{ m/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The acceleration of a body is $a(t) = 12t$. If $v(0) = 2\\text{ m/s}$ and $x(0) = 1\\text{ m}$, what is the position function $x(t)$?",
        "options": [
          "$2t^3 + 2t + 1$",
          "$6t^2 + 2t + 1$",
          "$4t^3 + 2$",
          "$2t^3 + 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Integrate acceleration: $v(t) = \\int a(t) \\, dt = \\int 12t \\, dt = 6t^2 + C_1$. Use $v(0)=2$: $6(0)^2 + C_1 = 2 \\Rightarrow C_1 = 2$, so $v(t) = 6t^2 + 2$. Integrate velocity: $x(t) = \\int v(t) \\, dt = \\int (6t^2 + 2) \\, dt = 2t^3 + 2t + C_2$. Use $x(0)=1$: $0 + 0 + C_2 = 1 \\Rightarrow C_2 = 1$. Thus $x(t) = 2t^3 + 2t + 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves in the $xy$-plane with a velocity $\\mathbf{v}(t) = (4t^3)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} - (2t)\\mathbf{\\hat{j}}$. What is the magnitude of the acceleration vector at $t = 1\\text{ s}$?",
        "options": [
          "$10\\text{ m/s}^2$",

          "$16.5\\text{ m/s}^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acceleration $\\mathbf{a}(t) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = (12t^2)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} - 2\\mathbf{\\hat{j}}$. At $t=1$: $\\mathbf{a} = 12\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} - 2\\mathbf{\\hat{j}}$. Magnitude = $\\sqrt{(12)^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 4} = \\sqrt{148} \\approx 12.165 \\approx 12.16\\text{ m/s}^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object's position graph $x(t)$ has an inflection point at $t = 4\\text{ s}$, which of the following must be true at that instant?",
        "options": [
          "The velocity is zero.",
          "The velocity is at a local maximum or minimum.",
          "The acceleration is at a local maximum.",
          "The object has changed direction."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An inflection point on $x(t)$ occurs where $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = a(t) = 0$. Since $a(t)$ is the derivative of velocity, $a(t)=0$ indicates a critical point of $v(t)$. Therefore, velocity is at a local maximum or minimum (or possibly a point of inflection itself)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves along the x-axis with $v(t) = \\sin(t)$. What is the total distance traveled from $t = 0$ to $t = 2\\pi$?",

          "$4\\text{ m}$",
          "$2\\pi\\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Velocity changes sign at $t=\\pi$. Displacement from $0$ to $\\pi$: $\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin t \\, dt = [-\\cos t]_0^{\\pi} = (1) - (-1) = 2\\text{ m}$. Displacement from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$: $\\int_{\\pi}^{2\\pi} \\sin t \\, dt = [-\\cos t]_{\\pi}^{2\\pi} = (-1) - (1) = -2\\text{ m}$. Total distance = $|2| + |-2| = 4\\text{ m}$."

        "options": [
          "$50\\text{ km/h}$ at $37^\\circ$ South of East",
          "$50\\text{ km/h}$ at $37^\\circ$ North of East",
          "$10\\text{ km/h}$ East",
          "$70\\text{ km/h}$ North-East"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\mathbf{v}_A = 30\\hat{j}$, $\\mathbf{v}_B = 40\\hat{i}$. Relative velocity: $\\mathbf{v}_{B/A} = \\mathbf{v}_B - \\mathbf{v}_A = 40\\hat{i} - 30\\hat{j}$. Magnitude = $\\sqrt{40^2 + (-30)^2} = 50\\text{ km/h}$. Direction: $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{-30}{40}) = -36.9^\\circ \\approx -37^\\circ$, measured from the positive x-axis (East). This is $37^\\circ$ South of East."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "$e^{-kt}$",
          "$1/t$",
          "$\\sqrt{t}$",
          "$\\ln(t)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Separate variables: $\\frac{dv}{dt} = -kv^2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{dv}{v^2} = -k \\, dt$. Integrate: $\\int v^{-2} \\, dv = \\int -k \\, dt \\Rightarrow -\\frac{1}{v} = -kt + C$. Using $v(0)=v_0$: $-\\frac{1}{v_0} = C$. So $-\\frac{1}{v} = -kt - \\frac{1}{v_0} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{v} = kt + \\frac{1}{v_0} \\Rightarrow v(t) = \\frac{1}{kt + 1/v_0}$, which behaves like $1/t$ for large $t$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile is launched with initial velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$ at an angle $\\theta$. If air resistance is ignored, the rate of change of the speed $\\frac{d|\\mathbf{v}|}{dt}$ at the very peak of the trajectory is:",
        "options": [
          "$-g$",
          "$0$",
          "$g$",
          "$g\\sin\\theta$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the peak, the vertical velocity is zero, so the velocity is purely horizontal. Acceleration is purely vertical ($-g\\hat{j}$). Since acceleration is perpendicular to velocity, it has no component along the direction of motion. Therefore, the instantaneous rate of change of speed ($\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\hat{v}$) is zero."

          "$12\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$15\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Average velocity = $\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{x(4)-x(1)}{4-1}$. $x(4) = 16 + 20 = 36$, $x(1) = 1 + 5 = 6$. So $v_{avg} = \\frac{36-6}{3} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10\\text{ m/s}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The range of a projectile on level ground is $R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}$. To find the angle that maximizes the range, we set $dR/d\\theta = 0$. This occurs when:",

          "$\\theta = 90^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Differentiate $R$ with respect to $\\theta$: $\\frac{dR}{d\\theta} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\cdot 2\\cos(2\\theta)$. Set equal to zero: $2\\cos(2\\theta) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\cos(2\\theta) = 0 \\Rightarrow 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\Rightarrow \\theta = 45^\\circ$."
