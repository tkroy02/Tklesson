      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Who determined the value of the universal gravitational constant ($G$)?",
        "options": [
          "Newton",
          "Galileo",
          "Einstein",
          "Schrödinger",
          "Cavendish"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "While Newton formulated the inverse-square law, he could not calculate the constant $G$. In 1798, Henry Cavendish used a torsion balance to measure the incredibly weak gravitational attraction between lead spheres, effectively 'weighing the Earth.'"

        "type": "mcq",

          "Einstein",
          "Schrödinger",
          "Cavendish"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isaac Newton published the law in 1687, proposing that the same force pulling an apple to the ground also keeps the Moon in its orbit, governed by $F_g = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two large objects of equal mass $m$ are separated by a distance $r$ and exert a gravitational pull of magnitude $F$. If the distance between the two objects is reduced to $r/4$, what is the new gravitational force acting on each object?",

          "$16F$"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Because $F_g \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}$, reducing the distance by a factor of 4 increases the force by a factor of $4^2 = 16$."

          "$39.2 \\text{ m/s}^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distance from the center is $r = R_E + R_E = 2R_E$. Since $g \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}$, doubling the distance from the center reduces $g$ by a factor of $2^2 = 4$. $9.8 / 4 = 2.45 \\text{ m/s}^2$."

          "$a_2 = 9a_1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The acceleration due to gravity follows the inverse-square law $g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}$. If the distance triples ($3R$), the field strength becomes $(1/3)^2 = 1/9$ of the original value."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work done by gravity is $W_g = -\\Delta U = -(U_f - U_i)$. $U_i = -\\frac{GMm}{R}$ and $U_f = -\\frac{GMm}{2R}$. $W_g = -(-\\frac{GMm}{2R} - (-\\frac{GMm}{R})) = -(\\frac{GMm}{2R}) = -\\frac{GMm}{2R}$."
