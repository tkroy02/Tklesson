        "question": "Two spheres have the same mass and the same radius. One is hollow (a shell) and the other is solid. Which has a larger moment of inertia about an axis through its center?",
        "options": [
          "The solid sphere",
          "The hollow sphere",
          "They are the same",
          "It depends on the material"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a hollow spherical shell, all mass is at distance R from the center, giving $I = \\frac{2}{3}MR^2$. For a solid sphere, mass is distributed from 0 to R, giving $I = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2$. Since $\\frac{2}{3} > \\frac{2}{5}$, the hollow sphere has a larger moment of inertia."

          "$dm = (L/M) dx$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a uniform rod, linear density $\\lambda = M/L$. A small element of length $dx$ has mass $dm = \\lambda dx = (M/L) dx$."

          "The distance from the origin to the center of mass"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The parallel axis theorem relates the moment of inertia about an axis through the center of mass ($I_{cm}$) to the moment of inertia about a parallel axis a distance $D$ away: $I = I_{cm} + MD^2$."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a thin hoop, every mass element is at the same distance $R$ from the axis. So $I = \\int R^2 dm = R^2 \\int dm = MR^2$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$I \\propto R^2$. If $R \\to 2R$, then $I \\to (2)^2 I = 4I$. So it quadruples."
