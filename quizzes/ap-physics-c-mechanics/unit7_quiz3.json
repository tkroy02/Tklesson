      {

        "question": "A planet has a mass $M$ and radius $R$. If a hole is drilled to the center, at what distance from the center is the gravitational field strength half of its surface value?",
        "options": [
          "$R/4$",

          "$R/8$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a uniform sphere, the gravitational field inside is $g(r) = \\frac{GM}{R^3}r$ (linear in $r$). At the surface, $g(R) = \\frac{GM}{R^2}$. Setting $g(r) = \\frac{1}{2} g(R)$ gives $\\frac{GM}{R^3}r = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{GM}{R^2} \\implies r = \\frac{R}{2}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The linear mass density is $\\lambda = \\frac{M}{\\pi R}$ (half a full circle). A mass element $dm = \\lambda R d\\theta = \\frac{M}{\\pi} d\\theta$ produces a field of magnitude $dg = \\frac{G dm}{R^2} = \\frac{GM}{\\pi R^2} d\\theta$ directed toward the element. Only the vertical (y) component survives by symmetry. That component is $dg_y = dg \\sin\\theta$. Integrating from $\\theta = 0$ to $\\pi$ yields $\\int_0^\\pi \\frac{GM}{\\pi R^2} \\sin\\theta d\\theta$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Surface field: $g_s = \\frac{GM}{R^2}$. Field at height $h$: $g_h = \\frac{GM}{(R+h)^2}$. Dividing, $\\frac{g_s}{g_h} = \\frac{(R+h)^2}{R^2} = (1 + \\frac{h}{R})^2$. Thus, $g_s = g_h (1 + h/R)^2$."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "At the midpoint, the distance to each star is $L/2$. The field magnitude from one star is $\\frac{GM}{(L/2)^2} = \\frac{4GM}{L^2}$. The two fields are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (each points toward its respective star). Thus, they cancel vectorially, giving a net field of zero."

        "answer": "A",

        "explanation": "The field along the axis is $g(z) = \\frac{GMz}{(R^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$. To maximize, set $\\frac{dg}{dz} = 0$. Differentiate: $\\frac{dg}{dz} = GM \\frac{(R^2+z^2)^{3/2} - z \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}(R^2+z^2)^{1/2}(2z)}{(R^2+z^2)^3} = 0$. This simplifies to $(R^2+z^2) - 3z^2 = 0$, or $R^2 = 2z^2$, so $z = R/\\sqrt{2}$."
