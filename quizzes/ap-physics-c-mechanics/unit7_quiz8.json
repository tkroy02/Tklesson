      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Kepler’s Second Law states that $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ is constant. This is a direct consequence of which physical principle?",
        "options": [
          "Conservation of Energy",
          "Conservation of Linear Momentum",
          "Conservation of Angular Momentum",
          "Newton’s Third Law"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For any central force, the torque $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$ is zero because the force is radial. Since $\\vec{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt}$, angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ is constant. Because $\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{L}{2m}$, the areal velocity must also be constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an elliptical orbit, the distance $r$ varies. Which of the following expressions correctly relates the speed $v$ and radius $r$ at two different points in the orbit?",
        "options": [
          "$v_1 r_1 = v_2 r_2$",
          "$v_1 r_1 \\sin \\phi_1 = v_2 r_2 \\sin \\phi_2$",
          "$v_1^2 r_1 = v_2^2 r_2$",
          "$v_1 / r_1 = v_2 / r_2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is the general form of the conservation of angular momentum: $L = mvr \\sin \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the angle between the velocity and radius vectors. At perihelion and aphelion, $\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1$, simplifying the expression to $v_p r_p = v_a r_a$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The derivation of Kepler's Third Law for a circular orbit involves setting $\\frac{mv^2}{r}$ equal to $\\frac{GMm}{r^2}$. To find the period $T$, what calculus-based substitution for $v$ is used?",
        "options": [
          "$v = \\frac{dr}{dt}$",
          "$v = \\int a \\, dt$",
          "$v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$",
          "$v = \\omega^2 r$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since the speed is constant in a circular orbit, $v = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$. Substituting this into the force balance equation and squaring both sides leads to $T^2 = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM}\\right)r^3$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A planet orbits a star of mass $M$ in an ellipse with semi-major axis $a$. If the star's mass were to triple, by what factor would the constant $k$ in $T^2 = ka^3$ change?",
        "options": [
          "It would triple.",
          "It would remain the same.",
          "It would be divided by 3.",
          "It would be divided by $\\sqrt{3}$."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The constant in Kepler's Third Law is $k = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM}$. Because $M$ is in the denominator, tripling the mass reduces the constant to $1/3$ of its original value."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which integral represents the total area $A$ of an elliptical orbit in polar coordinates?",
        "options": [
          "$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} r^2 \\, d\\theta$",
          "$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\, d\\theta$",
          "$\\int_{0}^{R} 2\\pi r \\, dr$",
          "$\\oint \\vec{r} \\cdot d\\vec{r}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The infinitesimal area $dA$ in polar coordinates is defined as $\\frac{1}{2}r^2 d\\theta$. Integrating this from $0$ to $2\\pi$ gives the total area enclosed by the orbit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a planet in an elliptical orbit, the semi-major axis is $a$. What is the total mechanical energy $E$ of the system?",
        "options": [
          "$-\\frac{GMm}{a}$",
          "$-\\frac{GMm}{2a}$",
          "$\\frac{GMm}{2a}$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For any bound orbit (ellipse or circle), the total energy is constant and depends only on the semi-major axis: $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2a}$. This is the same as the circular energy formula where $r$ is replaced by $a$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite in an elliptical orbit has a velocity $v_p$ at perihelion (distance $r_p$). If the distance at aphelion is $r_a = 4r_p$, what is the velocity $v_a$ at aphelion?",
        "options": [
          "$4v_p$",

          "$v_p / 2$",
          "$v_p / 16$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By conservation of angular momentum at the apsides ($L = mvr$): $m v_p r_p = m v_a (4r_p)$. Solving for $v_a$ gives $v_p / 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a planet's eccentricity $e$ is $0.5$, what is the ratio of the perihelion distance to the semi-major axis ($r_p / a$)?",
        "options": [
          "$0.5$",
          "$1.5$",
          "$1.0$",
          "$0.25$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distance at perihelion is $r_p = a(1 - e)$. If $e = 0.5$, then $r_p = a(1 - 0.5) = 0.5a$. Therefore, the ratio $r_p/a$ is $0.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The eccentricity of a parabola is $e = 1$. This implies that a comet on a parabolic trajectory has a total mechanical energy $E$ of:",
        "options": [
          "$E < 0$",
          "$E > 0$",
          "$E = 0$",
          "$E = -\\infty$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A parabolic trajectory represents the 'threshold' of escape. It is the boundary between bound (elliptical, $E < 0$) and unbound (hyperbolic, $E > 0$) orbits. Therefore, its energy is exactly zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do planets move faster when they are closer to the Sun? (Calculus reasoning)",
        "options": [
          "Because the gravitational force $F \\propto 1/r^2$ is stronger.",
          "To conserve angular momentum, as $r$ decreases, $v$ must increase.",
          "Because the potential energy is becoming more negative, increasing $K$.",
          "Both B and C are correct."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Both energy and angular momentum conservation require higher speeds at smaller radii. As $r$ decreases, $U$ decreases (becomes more negative), requiring $K$ to increase. Simultaneously, $L = mvr$ requires $v$ to increase as $r$ decreases."
