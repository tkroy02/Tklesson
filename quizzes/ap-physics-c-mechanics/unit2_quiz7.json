      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two blocks of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ are connected by a light string over a frictionless pulley. $m_1$ sits on a horizontal surface with coefficient of kinetic friction $\\mu_k$, and $m_2$ hangs vertically. If the system is released from rest, the acceleration $a$ of the system is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{m_2g}{m_1 + m_2}$",
          "$\\frac{(m_2 - \\mu_k m_1)g}{m_1 + m_2}$",
          "$\\frac{(m_2 + \\mu_k m_1)g}{m_1 + m_2}$",
          "$\\frac{\\mu_k (m_1 + m_2)g}{m_2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Forces on $m_2$: $m_2g - T = m_2a$. Forces on $m_1$: $T - f_k = m_1a$, where $f_k = \\mu_k N = \\mu_k m_1 g$. Adding the two equations eliminates $T$: $m_2g - \\mu_k m_1 g = (m_1 + m_2)a$. Solve for $a$: $a = \\frac{(m_2 - \\mu_k m_1)g}{m_1 + m_2}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $M$ is pulled along a frictionless table by a rope of mass $m$. A force $F$ is applied to the end of the rope. What is the tension at the midpoint of the rope?",
        "options": [
          "$F$",
          "$\\frac{M + m/2}{M + m}F$",
          "$\\frac{M}{M+m}F$",
          "$\\frac{m/2}{M+m}F$"
        ],
        "explanation": "Acceleration of the entire system: $a = F/(M + m)$. Consider the point halfway along the rope. The tension $T_{mid}$ must accelerate the block $M$ and the half-rope segment of mass $m/2$ that is behind it. Thus: $T_{mid} = (M + m/2)a = (M + m/2) \\cdot \\frac{F}{M+m} = \\frac{M + m/2}{M+m} F$.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object of mass $m$ is subject to a net force $F(t) = F_0 e^{-bt}$. If the object starts from rest at $t=0$, what is its terminal velocity as $t \\to \\infty$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acceleration: $a(t) = F(t)/m = \\frac{F_0}{m} e^{-bt}$. Velocity: $v(t) = \\int_0^t a(t')\\, dt' = \\frac{F_0}{m} \\int_0^t e^{-bt'}\\, dt' = \\frac{F_0}{m} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{b} e^{-bt'} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{F_0}{mb}(1 - e^{-bt})$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $e^{-bt} \\to 0$, so $v_{\\text{term}} = \\frac{F_0}{mb}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block is held against the front of a cart. The cart accelerates horizontally with acceleration $a$. If the coefficient of static friction between the block and the cart is $\\mu_s$, what is the minimum acceleration $a$ required to prevent the block from sliding down?",
        "options": [
          "$\\mu_s g$",
          "$g / \\mu_s$",
          "$g$",
          "$\\mu_s / g$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To prevent sliding, static friction must balance gravity: $f_s = mg$. The normal force $N$ is provided by the cart's acceleration: $N = ma$. The maximum static friction is $f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N = \\mu_s ma$. To hold the block: $mg \\le \\mu_s m a \\Rightarrow a \\ge g / \\mu_s$. So the minimum acceleration is $a_{min} = g / \\mu_s$."

        "question": "A particle of mass $m$ moves in a circle of radius $R$. Its speed increases with time according to $v(t) = kt$. The magnitude of the net force on the particle at time $t$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$mk$",
          "$m\\sqrt{k^2 + (k^2t^2/R)^2}$",
          "$m(k^2t^2/R)$",
          "$m\\sqrt{k^2 + (kt^2/R)^2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The net force is the vector sum of the tangential force ($F_t = m a_t$) and the radial/centripetal force ($F_r = m a_r$). Here, $a_t = dv/dt = k$, and $a_r = v^2/R = (kt)^2 / R = k^2 t^2 / R$. Therefore, $F_{\\text{net}} = m \\sqrt{a_t^2 + a_r^2} = m\\sqrt{k^2 + (k^2t^2/R)^2}$."

        "question": "A wedge of mass $M$ with a frictionless inclined surface (angle $\\theta$) rests on a frictionless horizontal floor. A block of mass $m$ is placed on the wedge. As the block slides down, the wedge moves. Which of the following is true about the normal force $N$ between the block and the wedge?",
        "options": [
          "$N = mg \\cos\\theta$",
          "$N < mg \\cos\\theta$",
          "$N > mg \\cos\\theta$",
          "$N = mg / \\cos\\theta$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the wedge were fixed, $N$ would equal $mg\\cos\\theta$. However, because the wedge accelerates horizontally away from the block, the block's acceleration perpendicular to the incline is less than the fixed-incline case. Applying Newton's 2nd law perpendicular to the incline: $mg\\cos\\theta - N = m a_{\\perp}$, where $a_{\\perp}$ is a component of the wedge's acceleration. Since $a_{\\perp} > 0$, $N = mg\\cos\\theta - m a_{\\perp} < mg\\cos\\theta$."

        "question": "A bead of mass $m$ slides without friction on a vertical circular wire of radius $R$. If the bead is released from the top of the wire (slightly offset), what is the normal force exerted by the wire on the bead when it has swung down to an angle $\\theta$ from the vertical?",
        "options": [
          "$mg(3\\cos\\theta - 2)$",
          "$mg \\cos\\theta$",
          "$mg(1 - \\cos\\theta)$",
          "$3mg(1 - \\cos\\theta)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Use energy conservation: $mgR(1 - \\cos\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. At angle $\\theta$, the radial component of gravity is $mg\\cos\\theta$ pointing inward. Applying Newton's 2nd law radially inward: $N + mg\\cos\\theta = m v^2 / R$. Substitute $v^2$ from energy: $N + mg\\cos\\theta = 2mg(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. Thus, $N = 2mg(1 - \\cos\\theta) - mg\\cos\\theta = mg(2 - 2\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\theta) = mg(2 - 3\\cos\\theta)$. The inward normal force is $N = mg(3\\cos\\theta - 2)$ (a positive result when $\\cos\\theta > 2/3$)."

        "question": "A system consists of two blocks $m_1$ and $m_2$ connected by a spring and placed on a frictionless surface. A constant horizontal force $F$ is applied to $m_2$. The acceleration of the center of mass of the system is:",
        "options": [
          "$F / m_2$",
          "$F / (m_1 + m_2)$",
          "$(F - kx) / (m_1 + m_2)$",
          "$F / m_1$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a system of particles, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net,ext}} = M_{\\text{tot}} \\vec{a}_{\\text{cm}}$. The only external horizontal force is $F$ applied to $m_2$. The spring force is internal. Therefore, $F = (m_1 + m_2) a_{\\text{cm}} \\Rightarrow a_{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{F}{m_1 + m_2}$."

        "question": "A small block is placed on the inside of a rough hollow cone rotating about its vertical axis with angular velocity $\\omega$. If the block is to remain at a constant height $h$, the friction force must balance the 'tendency' to slide. This scenario requires balancing forces in which two directions?",
        "options": [
          "Vertical and Horizontal (Radial)",
          "Tangential and Radial",
          "Parallel and Perpendicular to the cone surface",
          "Both A and C are valid coordinate systems"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "You can analyze this problem using different coordinate systems. System A: Vertical and horizontal (radial) axes. In this view, friction has both vertical and horizontal components. System C: Axes parallel and perpendicular to the cone's surface. Here, friction acts parallel to the surface, while the normal force is perpendicular. Both sets of axes are valid and will yield the same result; the choice is a matter of mathematical convenience. The correct answer is D: both are valid."

          "$0 = m\\frac{dv}{dt} + v(kv)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Momentum $p = mv$. The rate of change is $\\frac{dp}{dt} = m\\frac{dv}{dt} + v\\frac{dm}{dt}$. The external force is gravity: $F_{ext} = mg$. Given $\\frac{dm}{dt} = kv$, the equation becomes $mg = m\\frac{dv}{dt} + v(kv) = m\\frac{dv}{dt} + k v^2$."
