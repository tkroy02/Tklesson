      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At resonance, what is the relationship between the driving frequency $\\omega_d$ and the natural frequency $\\omega_0$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\omega_d \\ll \\omega_0$",
          "$\\omega_d = \\omega_0$",
          "$\\omega_d \\gg \\omega_0$",
          "$\\omega_d = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Resonance occurs when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency of the system ($\\omega_d = \\omega_0$). At this point, the amplitude of oscillation is maximized because the denominator in the amplitude formula $A = \\frac{F_0/m}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_d^2)^2 + (b\\omega_d/m)^2}}$ is minimized (reducing to $b\\omega_0/m$ if $\\omega_d = \\omega_0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the damping constant $b$ affect the resonance peak?",
        "options": [
          "It makes the peak taller and sharper.",
          "It makes the peak broader and shorter.",
          "It shifts the peak to a higher frequency.",
          "It has no effect on the peak."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Greater damping increases the term $(b\\omega_d/m)^2$ in the denominator of the amplitude formula, which reduces the maximum amplitude at resonance and also makes the amplitude curve wider (less sharply peaked). The resonance peak becomes lower and broader as $b$ increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a driven system, the oscillator eventually moves at which frequency?",
        "options": [
          "The natural frequency $\\omega_0$",
          "The damped frequency $\\omega'$",
          "The driving frequency $\\omega_d$",
          "The average of $\\omega_0$ and $\\omega_d$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The complete solution consists of a transient (homogeneous) part and a steady‑state (particular) part. The transient part oscillates at the damped natural frequency $\\omega'$ and decays exponentially due to damping. The steady‑state part oscillates exactly at the driving frequency $\\omega_d$ and persists as long as the driving force is applied."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At very high driving frequencies ($\\omega_d \\to \\infty$), what happens to the amplitude $A$?",
        "options": [
          "It approaches infinity.",
          "It approaches $F_0/k$.",
          "It approaches zero.",
          "It stays constant."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the amplitude formula, the dominant term in the denominator as $\\omega_d \\to \\infty$ is $m^2\\omega_d^4$. Thus, $A \\approx \\frac{F_0/m}{m\\omega_d^2} = \\frac{F_0}{m^2\\omega_d^2} \\to 0$. Physically, the system cannot respond quickly enough to a very rapidly oscillating force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the phase relationship between the driving force and displacement at resonance?",
        "options": [
          "They are in phase ($0^\\circ$).",
          "They are out of phase ($180^\\circ$).",
          "Displacement lags force by $90^\\circ$.",
          "Displacement leads force by $90^\\circ$."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At resonance, the driving force is in phase with the velocity (maximizing power transfer $P = Fv$). Since velocity is the derivative of displacement, displacement lags the velocity by $90^\\circ$, and therefore lags the force by $90^\\circ$ as well."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The power delivered to a driven oscillator is maximized when:",
        "options": [
          "The velocity is at its maximum and in phase with the force.",
          "The displacement is at its maximum.",
          "The damping is as high as possible.",
          "The driving frequency is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Instantaneous power is $P(t) = F(t)v(t)$. Average power over a cycle is $\\langle P \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} F_0 v_0 \\cos\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the phase between force and velocity. Maximum power occurs when $\\phi = 0$ (force and velocity in phase) and $v_0$ is as large as possible, which happens at resonance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an undamped driven oscillator ($b=0$), what happens to the amplitude exactly at $\\omega_d = \\omega_0$?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes zero.",
          "It remains $F_0/k$.",
          "It mathematically approaches infinity.",
          "It oscillates between two values."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With $b=0$, the amplitude formula is $A = \\frac{F_0/m}{|\\omega_0^2 - \\omega_d^2|}$. When $\\omega_d = \\omega_0$, the denominator vanishes and the amplitude diverges to infinity. In a real system, some damping always exists to limit the amplitude, or the system would fail mechanically."

        "question": "Which physical phenomenon is an example of resonance?",
        "options": [
          "A wine glass shattering from a specific vocal pitch.",
          "The swaying of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in wind.",
          "Pushing a child on a swing at just the right moment.",
          "All of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All three are classic examples of resonance: the glass has a natural frequency that matches the sound frequency; the bridge had a structural frequency matched by wind vortices; a swing is driven at its natural frequency to build amplitude. Each involves an external periodic force matching the system's natural frequency."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the low‑frequency limit ($\\omega_d \\to 0$), the amplitude $A$ approaches:",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$F_0/k$",
          "$F_0/m$",
          "Infinity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When $\\omega_d$ is very small, the driving force changes so slowly that the system behaves quasi‑statically. The amplitude approaches $A = F_0/k$, which is the static displacement of a spring with constant $k$ under a constant force $F_0$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Quality Factor' $Q$ of an oscillator is higher if:",
        "options": [
          "The damping is low.",
          "The energy loss per cycle is high.",
          "The resonance curve is very wide.",
          "The driving force is very large."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The quality factor $Q = \\omega_0 / \\Delta\\omega$, where $\\Delta\\omega$ is the full width at half maximum of the resonance peak. Low damping yields a narrow, tall resonance peak (small $\\Delta\\omega$), hence a large $Q$. Equivalently, $Q = \\frac{\\omega_0 m}{b}$, so $Q$ is inversely proportional to the damping coefficient $b$."
