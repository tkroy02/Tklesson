      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given a potential energy function $U(x) = 2x^3 - 5x$, what is the force $F(x)$ acting on the particle at $x = 2$ m?",
        "options": [
          "$19$ N",
          "$-19$ N",
          "$11$ N",
          "$-11$ N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The force is the negative derivative of the potential: $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. Compute $\\frac{dU}{dx} = 6x^2 - 5$. Thus, $F(x) = -(6x^2 - 5) = -6x^2 + 5$. At $x=2$: $F(2) = -6(4) + 5 = -24 + 5 = -19$ N. Negative indicates force is in the $-x$ direction."

        "question": "A particle is in 'stable equilibrium' at a certain position. Which of the following calculus conditions must be true at that point?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$ and $\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} > 0$",
          "$\\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$ and $\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} < 0$",
          "$\\frac{dU}{dx} > 0$ and $\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 0$",
          "$U(x) = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium occurs where $F = -dU/dx = 0$, so $dU/dx = 0$. For stable equilibrium, the point is a local minimum of $U(x)$, requiring $d^2U/dx^2 > 0$ (concave up). At a local maximum ($d^2U/dx^2 < 0$), equilibrium is unstable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the force acting on an object is $F(x) = -kx^3$, what is the expression for the potential energy $U(x)$ (assuming $U(0) = 0$)?",
        "options": [
          "$3kx^2$",
          "$-3kx^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{4}kx^4$",
          "$-\\frac{1}{4}kx^4$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$, we have $U(x) = -\\int F(x) dx + C$. $U(x) = -\\int (-kx^3) dx = \\int kx^3 dx = \\frac{1}{4}kx^4 + C$. Setting $U(0)=0$ gives $C=0$, so $U(x) = \\frac{1}{4}kx^4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a $U(x)$ vs. $x$ graph, what does a steep negative slope indicate about the force?",
        "options": [
          "A strong force in the negative $x$ direction.",
          "A strong force in the positive $x$ direction.",
          "Zero net force.",
          "The kinetic energy is at a minimum."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Force is the negative of the slope: $F = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. A steep negative slope means $\\frac{dU}{dx}$ is large negative, so $F = -(\\text{large negative}) = \\text{large positive}$. Thus, the force is strong in the $+x$ direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a 3D potential energy function $U(x, y, z)$, the force vector is found using the gradient operator ($\\nabla$): $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$. This means:",
        "options": [
          "$\\vec{F} = -(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z})$",
          "$\\vec{F} = -(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\hat{j} + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\\hat{k})$",
          "$\\vec{F} = \\int U \\, dV$",
          "$\\vec{F}$ is always perpendicular to the energy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The gradient in Cartesian coordinates is $\\nabla U = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\hat{j} + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\\hat{k}$. The force is the negative of this vector: $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$. This gives the force components as $F_x = -\\partial U/\\partial x$, etc."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A potential function is $U(x) = \\frac{A}{x^2}$. What is the force function $F(x)$?",
        "options": [
          "$-2A/x^3$",
          "$2A/x^3$",
          "$A/x$",
          "$-A/x$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rewrite $U(x) = Ax^{-2}$. Then $\\frac{dU}{dx} = -2Ax^{-3} = -2A/x^3$. Force: $F = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -(-2A/x^3) = 2A/x^3$. This is a repulsive inverse-cubic force."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the second derivative of potential energy $\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}$ is zero over a range of $x$, the equilibrium is:",
        "options": [
          "Stable",
          "Unstable",
          "Neutral",
          "Non-existent"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Neutral equilibrium occurs when $U(x)$ is constant (flat) over a region, meaning $dU/dx = 0$ and $d^2U/dx^2 = 0$. If displaced slightly, no net force acts to restore or further displace the object; it stays in its new position."

        "question": "Which point on a $U(x)$ graph represents the highest kinetic energy for a particle with total energy $E$?",
        "options": [
          "The point where $U(x)$ is maximum.",
          "The point where $U(x)$ is minimum.",
          "The point where $U(x) = E$.",
          "The point where the slope is steepest."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From conservation: $K(x) = E - U(x)$. Kinetic energy is maximized when $U(x)$ is minimized, since $E$ is constant. At the minimum of $U(x)$, $U_{min}$ is smallest, so $K_{max} = E - U_{min}$ is largest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A potential function $U(x)$ has a local maximum at $x = L$. If a particle is placed at $x = L$ and nudged slightly, it will:",
        "options": [
          "Return to $x = L$.",
          "Accelerate away from $x = L$.",
          "Remain at its new position.",
          "Oscillate around $x = L$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A local maximum is an unstable equilibrium. At the maximum, $dU/dx = 0$ (force = 0), but $d^2U/dx^2 < 0$. Any displacement creates a force in the direction away from the maximum ($F = -dU/dx$ points downhill). The particle accelerates away, not returning."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Lennard-Jones potential (often used in chemistry/physics) has the form $U(r) = \\frac{A}{r^{12}} - \\frac{B}{r^6}$. At the equilibrium position $r_0$, what is the value of the force?",
        "options": [
          "Maximum",
          "Minimum",
          "Zero",
          "$A - B$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium is defined by zero net force: $F(r) = -\\frac{dU}{dr} = 0$. For any potential, including Lennard-Jones, the equilibrium separation $r_0$ satisfies $dU/dr = 0$, so $F(r_0)=0$. For Lennard-Jones, $r_0$ is where attractive and repulsive parts balance."
