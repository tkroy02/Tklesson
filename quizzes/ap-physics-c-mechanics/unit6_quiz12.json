        "question": "A mass $m$ is subject to a potential $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{dU}{dt}$ is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "$kx$",
          "$kvx$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}kv^2$",
          "$ma$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\frac{dU}{dx} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt}$. Since $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, $\\frac{dU}{dx} = kx$. Also, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = v$. Therefore, $\\frac{dU}{dt} = kx v$."

        "question": "A block of mass $M$ is attached to a spring with constant $k$. If the block is given an initial velocity $v_0$ at the equilibrium position ($x=0$), what is the amplitude $A$ derived from energy conservation?",
        "options": [

          "$M v_0 / k$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total mechanical energy at $t=0$ is all kinetic: $E = \\frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2$. At maximum displacement, all energy is potential: $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. Equating: $\\frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. Solving for $A$ gives $A = v_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{k}}$."

        "question": "In the differential equation $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 x = 0$, the general solution is $x(t) = c_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + c_2 \\sin(\\omega t)$. If $x(0) = x_0$ and $v(0) = v_0$, what is $c_2$?",
        "options": [
          "$x_0$",
          "$v_0$",
          "$v_0 / \\omega$",
          "$-v_0 \\omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From the position function: $x(0) = c_1 = x_0$. Velocity is $v(t) = -c_1\\omega\\sin(\\omega t) + c_2\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)$. At $t=0$, $v(0) = c_2\\omega = v_0$, so $c_2 = \\frac{v_0}{\\omega}$."

        "options": [
          "It stays the same (like SHM).",
          "It decreases.",
          "It increases.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a potential $U \\propto x^n$, dimensional analysis or solving the energy integral shows that $T \\propto E^{(2-n)/(2n)}$. For $n=4$, $T \\propto E^{-1/4}$. Doubling $E$ multiplies $T$ by $2^{-1/4} \\approx 0.84$, so the period decreases."

          "$-\\theta^2 / 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Taylor expansion of $\\sin\\theta$ around $\\theta=0$ is $\\sin\\theta = \\theta - \\frac{\\theta^3}{3!} + \\frac{\\theta^5}{5!} - \\dots$. The next term after $\\theta$ is $-\\frac{\\theta^3}{6}$."

          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{m / \\rho g A}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newton's second law: $m\\ddot{x} = -\\rho g A x$. This is of the form $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x$ with $\\omega^2 = \\frac{\\rho g A}{m}$. Hence, $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho g A}{m}}$."

          "$2\\pi/3$",
          "$\\pi/6$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condition 1: $x(0) = A\\cos\\phi = A/2 \\implies \\cos\\phi = 1/2$, so $\\phi = \\pm \\pi/3$ (or $\\pm 60^\\circ$). Condition 2: Moving toward equilibrium from positive $x$ means $v(0) < 0$. $v(t) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t+\\phi)$, so $v(0) = -A\\omega\\sin\\phi$. For $v(0) < 0$, $\\sin\\phi$ must be positive. Among $\\pm \\pi/3$, $\\sin(\\pi/3) > 0$, $\\sin(-\\pi/3) < 0$. Therefore, $\\phi = \\pi/3$."

          "$kx^2$"

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} (-kx) dx = -k \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} x dx = -k\\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{x_1}^{x_2} = -\\frac{k}{2}(x_2^2 - x_1^2) = \\frac{1}{2}k x_1^2 - \\frac{1}{2}k x_2^2$. This is the work done by the spring force, which equals the negative change in potential energy."

        "question": "In a damped oscillator, the 'Quality Factor' $Q$ is defined as $2\\pi \\frac{\\text{Energy Stored}}{\\text{Energy Lost per Cycle}}$. If damping $b$ increases, what happens to $Q$?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The energy lost per cycle increases with damping coefficient $b$. Since $Q$ is inversely proportional to the energy lost per cycle, increasing $b$ decreases $Q$. Quantitatively, $Q = \\frac{\\omega_0 m}{b}$ for a lightly damped oscillator."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The integral $\\int_{0}^{\\theta_0} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\theta_0}}$ cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials, trig functions). It is an example of an elliptic integral. The exact period of a simple pendulum for arbitrary amplitude involves such integrals."
