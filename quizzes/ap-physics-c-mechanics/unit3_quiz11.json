      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Particle A is in a two-particle system where Particle B remains at rest. If the total mechanical energy of the system is $-2.0$ J, which of the following is true based on the provided graph?",
        "image": "images/mechC1.png",
        "options": [
          "The system has zero potential energy.",
          "Particle A has $2.0$ J of kinetic energy.",
          "The system has $2.0$ J of total mechanical energy.",
          "Particle A is always at $x = 0.40$ m.",
          "Particle A oscillates between $x = 0.20$ m and approximately $0.65$ m."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "From the U(x) graph, the total energy line at E = -2.0 J intersects the potential curve at two x-values: the turning points. Between these points, U(x) ≤ E, so kinetic energy K = E - U ≥ 0. Thus, the particle oscillates between these intersections. The exact values given (0.20 m and ~0.65 m) come from reading the specific intersections on the graph."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on the same graph, the x-component of the force on particle A when it is at $x = 0.15$ m is most nearly:",

          "$20$ N"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Force is $F_x = -dU/dx$. On the linear segment between x = 0.1 m and x = 0.2 m, U drops from 0 J to -2.0 J. The slope is: $\\frac{-2.0 \\, \\text{J}}{0.1 \\, \\text{m}} = -20 \\, \\text{J/m}$. Therefore, $F_x = -(-20 \\, \\text{N}) = 20 \\, \\text{N}$. A positive force means it points in the +x direction, consistent with the potential slope being negative."

        "question": "A particle is subjected to a conservative force whose potential energy function is $U(x) = (x - 2)^3 - 12x$. Which of the following represents a position of stable equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "$x = -4$",
          "$x = -2$",
          "$x = 0$",

          "$x = 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Equilibrium occurs where $F = -dU/dx = 0$. Compute: $\\frac{dU}{dx} = 3(x-2)^2 - 12$. Set to 0: $3(x-2)^2 = 12 \\Rightarrow (x-2)^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow x-2 = \\pm 2$, giving $x = 0$ or $x = 4$. To test stability, find $\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(x-2)$. At $x=0$: $6(-2) = -12 < 0$ (unstable maximum). At $x=4$: $6(2) = 12 > 0$ (stable minimum)."

          "$\\frac{2}{3(1-e^{-3t})}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Net force: $F = m \\frac{dv}{dt}$. First, $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(2e^{-3t}) = -6e^{-3t} \\, \\text{m/s}^2$. Then $F = (0.5 \\, \\text{kg})(-6e^{-3t}) = -3e^{-3t} \\, \\text{N}$. The negative sign indicates the force opposes the direction of motion (deceleration)."

        "question": "A potential energy function is $U(x) = k \\sin(x)$. At which position in the range $0 < x < \\pi$ is the force acting on the particle equal to zero?",
        "options": [
          "$x = 0$",

          "$x = \\pi/2$",
          "$x = \\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Force: $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -k \\cos(x)$. Setting $F = 0$ gives $\\cos(x) = 0$. In the interval $0 < x < \\pi$, this occurs only at $x = \\pi/2$. At $x = 0$ and $x = \\pi$, $\\cos(x) = \\pm 1$, so force is nonzero."

          "A point of maximum kinetic energy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$dU/dx = 0$ implies zero force (equilibrium). $d^2U/dx^2 < 0$ means the potential curve is concave down—a local maximum. This is unstable equilibrium: any small displacement produces a force away from the point, like a ball on top of a hill."

          "$8$ N"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The force components are given by $F_x = -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}$ and $F_y = -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$. Here, $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = 4x^2$, so $F_y = -4x^2$. At $(1,2)$: $F_y = -4(1)^2 = -4 \\, \\text{N}$."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "First, find the force: $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -\\left(-\\frac{a}{x^2} + b\\right) = \\frac{a}{x^2} - b$. The magnitude of a one-dimensional force is its absolute value, so $|F| = \\left| \\frac{a}{x^2} - b \\right|$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The work done BY a conservative force as a particle moves from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is $10$ J. If $U(x_1) = -5$ J, what is $U(x_2)$?",

          "$-10$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a conservative force, $W_{\\text{conservative}} = -\\Delta U = -[U(x_2) - U(x_1)]$. Given $W = 10$ J and $U(x_1) = -5$ J: $10 = -[U(x_2) - (-5)] = -[U(x_2) + 5]$. Thus, $U(x_2) + 5 = -10 \\Rightarrow U(x_2) = -15$ J."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a $U(x)$ vs. $x$ graph is a straight line with a positive slope, what is true about the force $F(x)$?",

          "It is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Force is $F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. For a straight line, $\\frac{dU}{dx}$ is constant (the slope). If the slope is positive, then $F(x) = -\\text{(positive constant)}$, so the force is constant and negative."
