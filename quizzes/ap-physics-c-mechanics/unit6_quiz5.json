      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system is described by the equation $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -25x$. What is the period $T$ of this oscillation?",
        "options": [
          "$5$",
          "$5\\pi$",
          "$2\\pi/5$",
          "$25$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Compare to the standard SHM form $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x$. Here $\\omega^2 = 25$, so $\\omega = 5\\text{ rad/s}$. The period is $T = 2\\pi/\\omega = 2\\pi/5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the position of a $2\\text{ kg}$ mass is $x(t) = 3\\cos(4t)$, what is the maximum restoring force exerted by the spring?",
        "options": [
          "$12\\text{ N}$",
          "$24\\text{ N}$",
          "$48\\text{ N}$",
          "$96\\text{ N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "From $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$, we have $A = 3\\text{ m}$, $\\omega = 4\\text{ rad/s}$. The angular frequency is related to the spring constant by $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m} \\implies k = m\\omega^2 = 2 \\times 16 = 32\\text{ N/m}$. The maximum restoring force occurs at maximum displacement: $F_{\\text{max}} = kA = 32 \\times 3 = 96\\text{ N}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At $t = 0$, an oscillator is at $x = 0$ and moving in the positive direction. What is the phase constant $\\phi$ if using the form $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$\\pi/2$",
          "$-\\pi/2$",
          "$\\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Substitute $t=0$: $x(0) = A\\cos\\phi = 0 \\implies \\phi = \\pm\\pi/2$. The velocity is $v(t) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. At $t=0$, $v(0) = -A\\omega\\sin\\phi$. For $v(0) > 0$, $\\sin\\phi$ must be negative. Thus, $\\phi = -\\pi/2$ (or $3\\pi/2$)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the total work done by the spring as the mass moves from $x = A$ to $x = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$-\\frac{1}{2} kA^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} kA^2$",
          "$kA$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The spring force is $F_s = -kx$. Work done by the spring is $W = \\int_{A}^{0} F_s dx = \\int_{A}^{0} (-kx) dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\right]_{A}^{0} = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}kA^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. This is positive because the spring force is in the same direction as the displacement as it moves toward equilibrium."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass $m$ is attached to two identical springs of constant $k$ in parallel. The effective $\\omega$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{k/m}$",
          "$\\sqrt{2k/m}$",
          "$\\sqrt{k/2m}$",
          "$2\\sqrt{k/m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For springs in parallel, the forces add, so the net force for a displacement $x$ is $F = -kx - kx = -2kx$. The equation of motion is $m\\ddot{x} = -2kx$ or $\\ddot{x} + (2k/m)x = 0$. Thus, $\\omega^2 = 2k/m$, so $\\omega = \\sqrt{2k/m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the derivative of the total energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ with respect to time?",
        "options": [
          "$mv + kx$",
          "$ma + kx$",
          "$0$",
          "$P$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Differentiating: $\\frac{dE}{dt} = mv\\frac{dv}{dt} + kx\\frac{dx}{dt} = v(ma) + kx(v) = v(ma + kx)$. For SHM, Newton's second law gives $ma = -kx$, so $ma + kx = 0$. Hence, $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$, confirming energy conservation."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vertical spring is stretched by $d$ when a mass is hung on it. If it is then set into oscillation, the angular frequency $\\omega$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{g/d}$",
          "$\\sqrt{d/g}$",
          "$\\sqrt{mg/k}$",
          "$2\\pi\\sqrt{d/g}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Static equilibrium gives $k d = mg$, so $k/m = g/d$. For a mass‑spring system, $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$, therefore $\\omega = \\sqrt{g/d}$. This shows that the frequency can be determined solely from the static stretch $d$ and gravity, without knowing $k$ or $m$ individually."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$, at what time $t$ does the mass first reach maximum speed?",
        "options": [
          "$T/4$",
          "$T/2$",
          "$T$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity is $v(t) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)$. The speed is maximum when $|\\sin(\\omega t)| = 1$. The first positive time this occurs is $\\omega t = \\pi/2$. Since $\\omega = 2\\pi/T$, we have $(2\\pi/T)t = \\pi/2 \\implies t = T/4$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a spring where the force is $F = -kx^3$ (non‑linear), is the motion SHM?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, because it is periodic.",
          "No, because $a$ is not proportional to $x$.",
          "Yes, because energy is conserved.",
          "No, because it won't oscillate."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Simple harmonic motion is defined by a linear restoring force: $F \\propto -x$, leading to the differential equation $\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x$. For $F = -kx^3$, the acceleration is $a = -\\frac{k}{m}x^3$, which is not proportional to $x$. The motion is still periodic (oscillatory) and energy is conserved, but it is not SHM because the period depends on amplitude and the equation of motion is non‑linear."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $M$ is moving at $v_0$ and hits a spring. It compresses the spring by $\\Delta x$ and stops. The time taken to stop is:",
        "options": [
          "$T/2$",
          "$T/4$",
          "$M v_0 / k$",
          "$1/v_0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the block first contacts the spring, it is at equilibrium ($x=0$) with speed $v_0$. It comes to rest momentarily at maximum compression $\\Delta x$. This corresponds to moving from equilibrium to an extreme position—exactly one‑quarter of a full oscillation cycle. Since the period is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{M/k}$, the time to stop is $T/4 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\sqrt{M/k}$."
