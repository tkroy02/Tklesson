        "question": "A satellite is in a circular orbit of radius $R$. If its total mechanical energy is $E$, what is its kinetic energy?",
        "options": [
          "$E$",
          "$-E$",
          "$2E$",
          "$-E/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a circular orbit, $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2R}$ and $K = \\frac{GMm}{2R}$. Therefore, $K = -E$. Since $E$ is negative for a bound orbit, $K$ is positive."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work done by gravity is $W = \\int \\vec{F}_g \\cdot d\\vec{r}$, where $\\vec{F}_g = -\\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\hat{r}$ and $d\\vec{r} = dr\\,\\hat{r}$. Thus, $W = \\int_{R}^{2R} \\left(-\\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\right) dr$."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For a circular orbit, $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$. If the radius becomes $3r$, the new speed is $v' = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{3r}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{3}}$."

          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The minimum work equals the binding energy, i.e., the energy needed to raise the total mechanical energy from its current value to zero. For a circular orbit, $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2R}$. Thus, $W_{\\text{ext}} = 0 - E = \\frac{GMm}{2R}$."

          "$T \\propto 1/v^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "From $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$, we get $r = GM/v^2$. Kepler's third law gives $T \\propto r^{3/2}$. Substituting, $T \\propto (1/v^2)^{3/2} = 1/v^3$."

          "The total energy $E$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By definition, the force is the negative gradient of the potential energy: $F = -\\frac{dU}{dr}$. Therefore, $\\frac{dU}{dr} = -F$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The period for a circular orbit is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{GM}}$. For a uniform sphere, $M = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 \\rho$. Substituting, $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{G \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 \\rho}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi G\\rho}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi}{G\\rho}}$, which is independent of $R$ and $M$ and depends only on $\\rho$."

          "$4R$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Kinetic energy in a circular orbit is $K = \\frac{GMm}{2r}$. If $K$ doubles, $\\frac{GMm}{2r}$ doubles, so $r$ must be halved: $r_{\\text{new}} = R/2$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The angular momentum $L$ of a satellite in circular orbit is given by $L = mvr$. Substituting $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$ gives $L$ as a function of $r$. What is $L(r)$?",

          "$L$ is independent of $r$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$L = mvr = m \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\right) r = m\\sqrt{GM} \\sqrt{r}$. Therefore, $L \\propto \\sqrt{r}$."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In uniform circular motion, the acceleration is purely centripetal (radially inward), while the velocity is purely tangential. These two vectors are always perpendicular; they are never parallel."
