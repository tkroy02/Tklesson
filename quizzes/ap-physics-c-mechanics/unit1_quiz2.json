      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle’s position along the x-axis is given by $x(t) = \\frac{1}{3}t^3 - 4t + 2$. At what time $t > 0$ is the velocity zero?",
        "options": [
          "$t = 1\\text{ s}$",
          "$t = 2\\text{ s}$",
          "$t = 4\\text{ s}$",
          "$t = 8\\text{ s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = t^2 - 4$. Setting $v = 0$: $t^2 - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow t^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow t = \\pm 2\\text{ s}$. Taking $t > 0$ gives $t = 2\\text{ s}$."

          "$-2\\text{ m/s}^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$a(t) = \\frac{dv}{dt} = 5 \\cdot (-2)e^{-2t} = -10e^{-2t}$. At $t=0$, $e^{-2\\cdot0} = 1$, so $a(0) = -10\\text{ m/s}^2$."

          "$24\\text{ m/s}$"

        "explanation": "$v(t) = \\int a(t) \\, dt = \\int (6t - 2) \\, dt = 3t^2 - 2t + C$. Since $v(0)=0$, $C=0$. Thus, $v(t) = 3t^2 - 2t$. At $t=3$: $v(3) = 3(9) - 2(3) = 27 - 6 = 21\\text{ m/s}$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Displacement $\\Delta x = \\int_{1}^{2} v(t) \\, dt = \\int_{1}^{2} (3t^2 + 2t) \\, dt = [t^3 + t^2]_{1}^{2} = (8 + 4) - (1 + 1) = 12 - 2 = 10\\text{ m}$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time: $a(t) = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\frac{dx}{dt}) = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$."

        "explanation": "Velocity $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = -2t + 6$. Set $v = 0$: $-2t + 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow t = 3\\text{ s}$. Position at maximum: $x(3) = -(3)^2 + 6(3) = -9 + 18 = 9\\text{ m}$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Constant positive acceleration means $x(t) = \\frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_0t + x_0$ with $a > 0$, which is a quadratic function with positive leading coefficient—a parabola opening upward."
