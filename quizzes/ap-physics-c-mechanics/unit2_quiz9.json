        "question": "A particle of mass $m$ moves in a circle of radius $R$. The tangential force acting on the particle is given by $F_t(t) = At$. If the particle starts from rest at $t=0$, the centripetal acceleration $a_c$ as a function of time is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{A^2 t^4}{4m^2 R}$",
          "$\\frac{At^2}{2mR}$",
          "$\\frac{A^2 t^2}{m^2 R}$",
          "$\\frac{At}{m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tangential acceleration: $a_t(t) = \\frac{F_t}{m} = \\frac{A}{m}t$. Integrate to find speed: $v(t) = \\int_0^t a_t(t') \\, dt' = \\frac{A}{m} \\cdot \\frac{t^2}{2} = \\frac{At^2}{2m}$. Centripetal acceleration is $a_c = \\frac{v^2}{R} = \\frac{1}{R} \\left(\\frac{At^2}{2m}\\right)^2 = \\frac{A^2 t^4}{4m^2 R}$."

        "question": "An object moves in a circle of radius $R$ such that its speed $v$ depends on the distance traveled $s$ according to $v = \\sqrt{ks}$, where $k$ is a constant. The magnitude of the total acceleration of the object is:",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The total acceleration $a$ is the vector sum of tangential $a_t$ and centripetal $a_c$ components. First, centripetal: $a_c = v^2/R = ks/R$. Tangential: $a_t = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dv}{ds} \\cdot \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{d}{ds}(\\sqrt{ks}) \\cdot v = \\frac{k}{2\\sqrt{ks}} \\cdot \\sqrt{ks} = \\frac{k}{2}$. Therefore, $a = \\sqrt{a_t^2 + a_c^2} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{k}{2})^2 + (\\frac{ks}{R})^2}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The tangential component of gravity is $mg\\sin\\theta$ (positive in the direction of motion along the wire). Applying Newton's Second Law tangentially: $m\\frac{dv}{dt} = mg\\sin\\theta$. Therefore, the tangential acceleration (rate of change of speed) is $\\frac{dv}{dt} = g\\sin\\theta$."

        "question": "A rotating disk slows down due to a frictional torque proportional to its angular velocity, $\\tau = -b\\omega$.

Using $\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = \\omega \\frac{d\\omega}{d\\theta}$, we get $I \\omega \\frac{d\\omega}{d\\theta} = -b\\omega \\Rightarrow I \\, d\\omega = -b \\, d\\theta$. Integrate from $\\omega_0$ to $0$: $\\int_{\\omega_0}^{0} I \\, d\\omega = -b \\int_{0}^{\\Delta\\theta} d\\theta \\Rightarrow -I\\omega_0 = -b \\Delta\\theta \\Rightarrow \\Delta\\theta = \\frac{I\\omega_0}{b}$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by the central force: $\\frac{mv^2}{R} = \\frac{k}{R^3} \\Rightarrow mv^2 = \\frac{k}{R^2}$. Angular momentum is $L = mvR$. Square this: $L^2 = m^2 v^2 R^2 = m^2 \\left(\\frac{k}{m R^2}\\right) R^2 = mk$. Therefore, $L = \\sqrt{mk}$."

        "question": "A conical pendulum consists of a mass $m$ on a string of length $L$ swinging in a horizontal circle. If the string makes an angle $\\theta(t)$ with the vertical that is slowly increasing, the work done by the tension force $T$ as the mass moves through an infinitesimal displacement $d\\vec{r}$ is:",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In circular motion (even with a slowly changing $\\theta$), the instantaneous velocity of the mass is tangential to its circular path. The tension force $\\vec{T}$ always points along the string, toward the pivot. At any instant, this force has a radial component (providing centripetal acceleration) and a vertical component. The infinitesimal displacement $d\\vec{r}$ is tangential. Therefore, $\\vec{T}$ is perpendicular to $d\\vec{r}$, making the dot product $\\vec{T} \\cdot d\\vec{r} = 0$. The tension does zero work during the displacement."

        "question": "An object is launched horizontally inside a smooth hemispherical bowl of radius $R$ from the rim. To find the normal force at the bottom of the bowl, one must use:",
        "options": [
          "$N = mg$",
          "$\\int mg \\, dh = \\Delta K$ then $\\sum F_r = N - mg = mv^2/R$",
          "$N = m v_0^2 / R$",
          "$N = 3mg$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a two-step process. First, use conservation of mechanical energy (since the bowl is smooth/frictionless) to find the speed $v$ at the bottom. The vertical drop is $R$, so $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgR \\Rightarrow v^2 = 2gR$. Then, at the bottom, apply Newton's Second Law radially upward: $N - mg = m\\frac{v^2}{R} = m\\frac{2gR}{R} = 2mg \\Rightarrow N = 3mg$. Therefore, the method involves an energy equation followed by a radial force balance."

        "question": "A car increases its speed at a constant rate $a_t$ as it goes around a turn of radius $R$. If the coefficient of static friction is $\\mu_s$, the car will begin to skid at the speed $v$ such that:",
        "options": [
          "$\\mu_s g = v^2/R$",

          "$v = \\sqrt{\\mu_s g R}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Static friction provides the net horizontal force needed for both the centripetal acceleration ($v^2/R$) and the tangential acceleration ($a_t$). The total required friction force is $f_s = m\\sqrt{a_t^2 + (v^2/R)^2}$. Skidding occurs when this required force exceeds the maximum static friction: $m\\sqrt{a_t^2 + (v^2/R)^2} > \\mu_s m g$. At the threshold, $\\mu_s g = \\sqrt{a_t^2 + (v^2/R)^2}$."

          "$m \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{v}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Power is the rate at which a force does work: $P = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}$. For a satellite in a perfectly circular orbit, $\\vec{F}_g \\perp \\vec{v}$, so $P=0$. Here, the radius is decreasing, meaning there is a radial component of velocity ($\\vec{v}_{radial}$) pointing inward. The gravitational force $\\vec{F}_g$ is also radial (inward). Therefore, $\\vec{F}_g$ is parallel to $\\vec{v}_{radial}$, and the dot product is non-zero. The power delivered is $P = \\vec{F}_g \\cdot \\vec{v}_{radial}$."
