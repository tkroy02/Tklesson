      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle's acceleration is given by $a(t) = 4t - 2$. If the particle starts from rest, what is its velocity at $t = 3\\text{ s}$?",
        "options": [
          "$10\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$12\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$15\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$18\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Integrate acceleration: $v(t) = \\int a(t) \\, dt = \\int (4t - 2) \\, dt = 2t^2 - 2t + C$. With $v(0)=0$, $C=0$. Therefore, $v(t) = 2t^2 - 2t$. At $t=3$: $v(3) = 2(9) - 2(3) = 18 - 6 = 12\\text{ m/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The position of an object is $x(t) = At^3 + Bt^2$. What is the 'jerk' (the rate of change of acceleration) of this object?",
        "options": [
          "$2B$",
          "$3At$",
          "$6A$",
          "$6At + 2B$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Velocity: $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = 3At^2 + 2Bt$. Acceleration: $a(t) = \\frac{dv}{dt} = 6At + 2B$. Jerk: $j(t) = \\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(6At + 2B) = 6A$, which is constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object's acceleration is $a(v) = -kv$. If the initial velocity is $v_0$, which expression describes the velocity over time?",
        "options": [
          "$v(t) = v_0 - kt$",
          "$v(t) = v_0 e^{-kt}$",
          "$v(t) = v_0 - \\frac{1}{2}kt^2$",
          "$v(t) = \\ln(v_0 - kt)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The differential equation is $\\frac{dv}{dt} = -kv$. Separate variables: $\\frac{dv}{v} = -k \\, dt$. Integrate: $\\int \\frac{dv}{v} = \\int -k \\, dt \\Rightarrow \\ln v = -kt + C$. Exponentiate: $v(t) = e^{-kt + C} = e^C e^{-kt}$. Using $v(0)=v_0$ gives $e^C = v_0$, so $v(t) = v_0 e^{-kt}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle's acceleration is $a(x) = 3x^2$. If it starts from rest at $x=0$, what is its velocity as a function of $x$?",
        "options": [
          "$v = x^3$",
          "$v = \\sqrt{2x^3}$",
          "$v = 2x^3$",
          "$v = \\sqrt{x^3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Use the chain rule: $a = v \\frac{dv}{dx}$. So $v \\frac{dv}{dx} = 3x^2$. Separate and integrate: $\\int v \\, dv = \\int 3x^2 \\, dx \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}v^2 = x^3 + C$. With $v=0$ at $x=0$, $C=0$. Thus $\\frac{1}{2}v^2 = x^3 \\Rightarrow v^2 = 2x^3 \\Rightarrow v = \\sqrt{2x^3}$."

        "options": [
          "$g$",
          "$9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "Zero",
          "Maximum"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Terminal velocity occurs when the net force (and thus net acceleration) is zero. Set $a = 0$: $g - bv_T = 0 \\Rightarrow v_T = g/b$. At this point, the downward gravitational force balances the upward drag force, resulting in constant velocity and zero acceleration."

          "$13\\text{ m}$",
          "$17\\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Integrate acceleration: $v(t) = \\int 6t \\, dt = 3t^2 + C_1$. With $v(0)=0$, $C_1=0$. Integrate velocity: $x(t) = \\int 3t^2 \\, dt = t^3 + C_2$. With $x(0)=5$, $C_2=5$. So $x(t) = t^3 + 5$. At $t=2$: $x(2) = 8 + 5 = 13\\text{ m}$."

          "$\\frac{k}{n+1} T^{n+1}$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}kT^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Change in velocity is the definite integral of acceleration: $\\Delta v = \\int_0^T a(t) \\, dt = \\int_0^T kt^n \\, dt = k \\left[ \\frac{t^{n+1}}{n+1} \\right]_0^T = \\frac{k}{n+1} T^{n+1}$."

          "$18\\text{ s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity: $v(t) = \\int a(t) \\, dt = \\int (-2t) \\, dt = -t^2 + C$. With $v(0)=9$, $C=9$. So $v(t) = 9 - t^2$. Set $v(t)=0$: $9 - t^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow t^2 = 9 \\Rightarrow t = 3\\text{ s}$ (taking the positive root)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the acceleration-time graph is a straight line with a non-zero positive slope, the velocity-time graph is:",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal line",
          "A diagonal line",
          "A parabola opening upward",
          "A parabola opening downward"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A straight-line $a(t)$ with positive slope means $a(t) = mt + b$ with $m > 0$. Integrating: $v(t) = \\int (mt + b) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{2}mt^2 + bt + C$, which is a quadratic (parabola). Since the coefficient of $t^2$ ($m/2$) is positive, the parabola opens upward."
