      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system consists of two blocks $m_1$ and $m_2$ connected by a light string. $m_1$ is on a frictionless horizontal table, and $m_2$ is hanging. A third mass $m_3$ is placed on top of $m_1$. The coefficient of static friction between $m_1$ and $m_3$ is $\\mu_s$. What is the maximum mass $m_2$ can have such that $m_3$ does not slip relative to $m_1$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\mu_s(m_1 + m_3)$",
          "$\\frac{\\mu_s(m_1 + m_3)m_3}{m_1}$",
          "$\\frac{\\mu_s(m_1 + m_3)^2}{m_1}$",
          "$\\frac{\\mu_s(m_1 + m_3)m_1}{g}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the whole system (m1+m2+m3), acceleration is $a = \\frac{m_2 g}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3}$. For m3 not to slip, the friction force $f_s = m_3 a$ must be $\\le \\mu_s m_3 g$. So $a \\le \\mu_s g$. Therefore, $\\frac{m_2 g}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3} = \\mu_s g$. Solve for $m_2$: $m_2 = \\mu_s(m_1 + m_2 + m_3) \\Rightarrow m_2 - \\mu_s m_2 = \\mu_s(m_1 + m_3) \\Rightarrow m_2(1 - \\mu_s) = \\mu_s(m_1 + m_3)$. Typically, $\\mu_s$ is small, so the maximum $m_2 \\approx \\mu_s(m_1 + m_3)$ for small $\\mu_s$."

        "question": "A 5 kg block is connected to a 10 kg block by a heavy rope of mass 2 kg. A force of 34 N pulls the 10 kg block horizontally. What is the tension at the midpoint of the 2 kg rope?",

          "12 N",
          "14 N",

        ],
        "explanation": "Total mass = 5 + 10 + 2 = 17 kg. Acceleration of the whole system: $a = F / M_{total} = 34 / 17 = 2 \\text{ m/s}^2$. The midpoint of the rope is a point that must accelerate the 5 kg block and the half of the rope behind it (mass 1 kg). Therefore, $T_{mid} = (5 + 1) \\cdot a = 6 \\cdot 2 = 12$ N.",

        "question": "A wedge of mass $M$ and angle $\\theta$ is pushed horizontally with an acceleration $a$ such that a block of mass $m$ remains stationary relative to the wedge. If the surface of the wedge is frictionless, the acceleration $a$ must be:",
        "options": [

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For the block to be stationary relative to the wedge, the net force perpendicular to the incline must balance. Set up axes relative to the wedge. In the wedge's accelerating frame, there is a pseudo-force $ma$ to the left acting on $m$. The components along and perpendicular to the incline are: Perpendicular: $N - mg \\cos\\theta = ma \\sin\\theta$. Parallel: $mg \\sin\\theta = ma \\cos\\theta$. From the parallel equation: $mg \\sin\\theta = ma \\cos\\theta \\Rightarrow a = g \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} = g \\tan\\theta$."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Acceleration of the center of mass is the second derivative: $\\vec{a}_{cm} = \\frac{d^2\\vec{r}_{cm}}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t^2\\hat{i} + 5\\hat{j}) = (12t)\\hat{i} + 0\\hat{j}$. At $t = 2$ s, $\\vec{a}_{cm} = (24 \\text{ m/s}^2)\\hat{i}$. The total external force is $\\vec{F}_{ext} = M_{total} \\vec{a}_{cm} = 3 \\times 24 = 72$ N in the $\\hat{i}$ direction."

        "question": "A chain of length $L$ and mass $M$ is held on a table with $1/3$ of its length hanging over the edge. If it is released from rest, the acceleration of the chain the instant it starts moving is:",

          "$g$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let mass per unit length be $\\lambda = M/L$. At the instant of release, the hanging mass is $m_h = \\lambda(L/3) = M/3$. The weight of this hanging part ($m_h g$) is the net external force pulling the entire chain. The total mass to be accelerated is $M$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{F_{net}}{M_{total}} = \\frac{(M/3)g}{M} = g/3$."

          "$g(y/L)^2$",
          "$gL/y$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At a given moment, let $y$ be the length that has fallen over the edge. Hanging mass = $\\lambda y$. The net external force is $\\lambda y g$. The total mass is still $M = \\lambda L$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{\\lambda y g}{\\lambda L} = \\frac{g}{L} y$. This leads to the differential equation $\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = \\frac{g}{L} y$, which is the equation for exponential growth/sinusoidal motion depending on initial conditions."

          "Constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The acceleration of the center of mass depends only on the total external force and the total mass. The spring force is internal. Therefore, $\\vec{F}_{ext} = F(t)\\hat{i} = kt \\hat{i}$. So $\\vec{a}_{cm} = \\frac{\\vec{F}_{ext}}{m_1 + m_2} = \\frac{kt}{m_1 + m_2}\\hat{i}$."

To accelerate himself and the platform upward with acceleration $a$, the force $F$ he must exert on the rope is (assume 2 rope segments pull the platform up):",

          "$(M+m)g$",
          "$\\frac{1}{3}(M+m)(g+a)$"
        ],
        "explanation": "This is a movable pulley system. If two segments of the rope pull upward on the combined 'man + platform' system, then $2T$ is the total upward tension force. The net force equation for the system is: $2T - (M+m)g = (M+m)a \\Rightarrow T = \\frac{1}{2}(M+m)(g+a)$. This tension $T$ is the force the man must exert on the rope.",

          "$Rv$",
          "$2Rv^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sand has zero horizontal velocity before landing. To accelerate it to the belt's speed $v$, a horizontal force $F$ must be applied. From Newton's 2nd Law in variable mass form: $F = \\frac{dp}{dt} = v\\frac{dm}{dt} = Rv$ (since $dv/dt=0$). Power delivered by this force is $P = F v = Rv \\cdot v = R v^2$. Note: Half of this power increases the kinetic energy of the sand ($\\frac{1}{2}Rv^2$), while the other half is dissipated as heat/internal energy due to the inelastic collision."

          "0 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the blocks accelerate together, the friction between them is static. Consider block $A$ alone: the only horizontal force is the static friction $f_s$ from block $B$. This force provides the acceleration for block $A$: $f_s = m_A a = (2 \\text{ kg})(2 \\text{ m/s}^2) = 4 \\text{ N}$. By Newton's 3rd Law, the reaction force is the friction that block $A$ exerts on block $B$, which is also 4 N in the opposite direction. The magnitude of this action-reaction pair is 4 N."
