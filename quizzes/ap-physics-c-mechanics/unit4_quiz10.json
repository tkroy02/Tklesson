    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rocket in deep space ($F_{ext} = 0$) has an exhaust velocity $u$ relative to the rocket. If it ejects mass at a constant rate $R = -dm/dt$, what is its acceleration $a$ as a function of its current mass $m$?",
        "options": [
          "$R u / m$",
          "$R / mu$",
          "$m u / R$",
          "$R u m$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From the variable‑mass equation: $m\\frac{dv}{dt} = u\\frac{dm}{dt}$ (where $u$ is the relative speed of the exhaust). Since $\\frac{dm}{dt} = -R$ (negative because mass decreases), we have $m a = -u(-R) = uR$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{R u}{m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sand‑filled conveyor belt drops sand vertically onto a cart moving at constant velocity $v$. If the sand is added at a rate $\\sigma = dm/dt$, what horizontal force $F$ is required to keep the cart moving at $v$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sigma v$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma v^2$",
          "$0$",
          "$\\sigma g$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal momentum: $p = m(t) v$. Since $v$ is constant, $F = \\frac{dp}{dt} = v \\frac{dm}{dt} = \\sigma v$. This force is needed to accelerate the incoming sand from rest (horizontally) to speed $v$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rocket of mass $m$ is hovering stationary near the Earth's surface. At what rate must it eject fuel with exhaust velocity $u$ to remain at rest?",
        "options": [
          "$mu / g$",
          "$mg / u$",
          "$g / mu$",
          "$mg$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For hovering, thrust must equal weight: $u \\left|\\frac{dm}{dt}\\right| = mg$. Therefore $\\left|\\frac{dm}{dt}\\right| = \\frac{mg}{u}$. The negative sign indicates mass loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rocket's mass decreases exponentially: $m(t) = M_0 e^{-bt}$. If it starts from rest in deep space with constant relative exhaust velocity $u$, what is its velocity $v(t)$?",
        "options": [
          "$ubt$",
          "$u \\ln(bt)$",
          "$u e^{-bt}$",
          "$u/b$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rocket equation gives $v(t) = u \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_0}{m(t)}\\right) = u \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_0 e^{-bt}}\\right) = u \\ln(e^{bt}) = ubt$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a rain‑clogged truck moving through a storm, $dm/dt > 0$. If no external horizontal force is applied, the truck's velocity will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Stay the same",
          "Oscillate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If no external horizontal force acts, horizontal momentum is conserved: $p = m(t)v(t) = \\text{constant}$. Since $m(t)$ increases, $v(t)$ must decrease to keep the product constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A flatcar of mass $M$ is filled with $m_0$ amount of water. At $t=0$, it starts moving under a constant force $F$ while water leaks out the bottom at a rate $R$. The mass of the car at time $t$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$M + m_0 - Rt$",
          "$M + m_0 + Rt$",
          "$(M+m_0)e^{-Rt}$",
          "$M - Rt$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial total mass = $M + m_0$. Water leaks at constant rate $R$, so the mass lost by time $t$ is $Rt$. Thus, $m(t) = M + m_0 - Rt$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of the rocket equation $\\Delta v = u \\ln(M_0/M_f)$, the term $M_0/M_f$ is often called the:",
        "options": [
          "Specific Impulse",
          "Mass Ratio",
          "Thrust Coefficient",
          "Delta‑V"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The ratio $M_0/M_f$ (initial mass to final mass) is the mass ratio. It is a key parameter in rocket performance."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A chain of mass $M$ and length $L$ is being lifted at a constant velocity $v$. The power required to lift the chain when a length $y$ is off the ground is:",
        "options": [
          "$(\\frac{M}{L}yg)v$",
          "$(\\frac{M}{L}yg + \\frac{M}{L}v^2)v$",
          "$\\frac{M}{L}v^3$",
          "$Mgv$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The total force has two parts: (1) supporting the weight of the lifted part: $F_{weight} = \\frac{M}{L} y g$; (2) supplying the impulse to accelerate each new link from rest to $v$: $F_{impulse} = v \\frac{dm}{dt} = v \\cdot \\frac{M}{L} \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{M}{L} v^2$. Total force $F = \\frac{M}{L}yg + \\frac{M}{L}v^2$. Power $P = F v = \\left(\\frac{M}{L}yg + \\frac{M}{L}v^2\\right)v$."

          "$ma$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By the product rule: $\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(m v) = m \\frac{dv}{dt} + v \\frac{dm}{dt}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a rocket ejects fuel at a relative velocity $u$ equal to the rocket's current forward velocity $v$, what is the velocity of the exhaust relative to the ground?",

          "$v$",
          "$0$",
          "$-u$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Exhaust velocity relative to ground = rocket velocity relative to ground + exhaust velocity relative to rocket: $\\vec{v}_{exhaust, ground} = \\vec{v} + \\vec{v}_{exhaust, rocket}$. Since the exhaust is ejected opposite to motion, $\\vec{v}_{exhaust, rocket} = -u \\hat{v}$. If $u=v$, then $\\vec{v}_{exhaust, ground} = v\\hat{v} - v\\hat{v} = 0$."
