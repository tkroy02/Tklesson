      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ is at rest on a horizontal surface. A force $F$ is applied at an angle $\\theta$ above the horizontal. If the coefficient of static friction is $\\mu_s$, what is the maximum value of $F$ that can be applied before the block starts to slip?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{\\mu_s mg}{\\cos\\theta + \\mu_s \\sin\\theta}$",
          "$\\frac{\\mu_s mg}{\\cos\\theta - \\mu_s \\sin\\theta}$",
          "$\\frac{\\mu_s mg}{\\sin\\theta + \\mu_s \\cos\\theta}$",
          "$\\mu_s mg \\cos\\theta$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resolve forces: Vertical: $N + F\\sin\\theta = mg \\Rightarrow N = mg - F\\sin\\theta$. Horizontal: $F\\cos\\theta = f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N = \\mu_s (mg - F\\sin\\theta)$. Solve for $F$: $F\\cos\\theta + \\mu_s F\\sin\\theta = \\mu_s mg \\Rightarrow F(\\cos\\theta + \\mu_s \\sin\\theta) = \\mu_s mg \\Rightarrow F = \\frac{\\mu_s mg}{\\cos\\theta + \\mu_s \\sin\\theta}$."

        "question": "A block is sliding down an incline with an angle $\\alpha$. The coefficient of kinetic friction $\\mu_k$ varies with the distance $x$ traveled down the incline according to $\\mu_k(x) = bx$, where $b$ is a constant. The acceleration of the block as a function of $x$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$g(\\sin\\alpha - bx \\cos\\alpha)$",
          "$g(\\cos\\alpha - bx \\sin\\alpha)$",
          "$g\\sin\\alpha - bx$",
          "$g(1 - bx)\\sin\\alpha$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Along the incline: Net force $= mg\\sin\\alpha - f_k$. Kinetic friction: $f_k = \\mu_k N = \\mu_k mg\\cos\\alpha = (bx) mg\\cos\\alpha$. So, $ma = mg\\sin\\alpha - bmg\\cos\\alpha \\, x$. Divide by $m$: $a = g\\sin\\alpha - bg\\cos\\alpha \\, x = g(\\sin\\alpha - bx \\cos\\alpha)$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'Road and Track' experiment, a car travels at a constant speed $v$ around a flat circular curve of radius $R$. If the coefficient of static friction is $\\mu_s$, what is the minimum radius $R$ required to prevent skidding?",
        "options": [
          "$v^2 / (\\mu_s g)$",
          "$\\mu_s v^2 / g$",
          "$v / (\\mu_s g)$",
          "$\\sqrt{v^2 / \\mu_s g}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Friction provides the centripetal force: $f_{s,max} = \\mu_s mg$. This must equal the required centripetal force: $\\mu_s mg = \\frac{mv^2}{R_{min}}$. Solve for $R_{min}$: $R_{min} = \\frac{v^2}{\\mu_s g}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A heavy crate is being pushed across a floor. As the magnitude of the applied horizontal force increases, the force of static friction:",
        "options": [
          "Remains constant until it reaches $\\mu_s N$.",
          "Decreases linearly.",
          "Increases linearly until it reaches $\\mu_s N$.",
          "Increases exponentially."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Static friction is a responsive force that exactly opposes an applied force up to its maximum value $f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N$. Therefore, as the applied horizontal force increases from zero, the static friction force increases linearly to match it, until it hits the maximum limit."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $M$ is placed against a vertical wall. A horizontal force $P$ is applied to hold it in place. If the coefficient of static friction is $\\mu_s$, what is the minimum force $P$ required to keep the block from falling?",
        "options": [
          "$Mg / \\mu_s$",
          "$\\mu_s Mg$",
          "$Mg$",
          "$Mg \\sin\\theta$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the block not to fall, the maximum static friction force ($f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N$) must balance the weight $Mg$. The normal force $N$ is provided by the applied force $P$, so $N = P$. Therefore, $\\mu_s P \\ge Mg \\Rightarrow P_{min} = \\frac{Mg}{\\mu_s}$."

        "question": "Which of the following statements is true regarding the 'Angle of Repose'?",
        "options": [
          "It is the maximum angle of an incline at which an object will remain stationary.",
          "It depends on the mass of the object.",
          "It is defined as $\\tan\\theta = \\mu_k$.",
          "It is only applicable to rolling objects."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The angle of repose $\\theta_r$ is the steepest angle at which a surface can be inclined before an object on it starts to slide down. At this angle, the component of gravity down the incline equals the maximum static friction: $mg\\sin\\theta_r = \\mu_s mg\\cos\\theta_r$, leading to $\\tan\\theta_r = \\mu_s$. It is independent of mass and applies to sliding, not just rolling."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ is connected to a spring with constant $k$ on a rough horizontal surface ($\\mu_s, \\mu_k$). If the block is pulled a distance $x$ and released, it will stop moving when:",
        "options": [
          "The spring force is less than or equal to the maximum static friction force.",
          "The kinetic energy is exactly zero.",
          "The velocity reaches its maximum value.",
          "The displacement $x$ is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Upon release, the block oscillates but kinetic friction dissipates energy. Motion ceases when the block's displacement is such that the restoring spring force $|kx|$ is not sufficient to overcome the maximum static friction force ($\\mu_s mg$). At that point, static friction can hold the block stationary, even if the spring is still stretched or compressed. The block stops permanently when $|kx| \\le \\mu_s mg$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an object moving through a fluid at high Reynolds numbers, the drag force (a form of fluid friction) is typically proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "The square of the velocity ($v^2$).",
          "The velocity ($v$).",
          "The square root of the velocity ($\\sqrt{v}$).",
          "The inverse of the velocity ($1/v$)."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At high Reynolds numbers (turbulent flow), inertial forces dominate over viscous forces. The drag force is well-approximated by $F_d = \\frac{1}{2} C_D \\rho A v^2$, where $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, $\\rho$ is fluid density, and $A$ is cross-sectional area. Thus, it is proportional to $v^2$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two blocks are stacked on a frictionless table. Block A (top) has mass $m$ and Block B (bottom) has mass $M$. The coefficient of static friction between A and B is $\\mu_s$. What is the maximum horizontal force $F$ that can be applied to Block B so that Block A does not slide relative to B?",
        "options": [
          "$\\mu_s mg$",
          "$\\mu_s (m+M)g$",
          "$\\mu_s Mg$",
          "$\\mu_s mg (M/m)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Consider the two blocks as a system: acceleration $a = F / (m+M)$. For Block A not to slip, the static friction on it must provide its acceleration: $f_s = ma = m \\cdot \\frac{F}{m+M}$. This friction cannot exceed $\\mu_s N_A = \\mu_s mg$. Therefore, $\\frac{mF}{m+M} \\le \\mu_s mg$. Solving gives $F_{max} = \\mu_s (m+M)g$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When considering the microscopic view of friction, the actual area of contact between two surfaces is generally:",
        "options": [
          "Much smaller than the apparent geometric area of contact.",
          "Equal to the apparent geometric area of contact.",
          "Much larger than the apparent geometric area of contact.",
          "Dependent only on the temperature of the materials."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the microscopic level, even polished surfaces are rough. Contact occurs only at the asperities (high points). The sum of these tiny contact areas—the real area of contact—is typically only a small fraction (often less than 1%) of the apparent macroscopic area. The frictional force is proportional to this real area of contact."
