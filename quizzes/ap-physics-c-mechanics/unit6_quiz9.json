        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform thin rod of length $L$ and mass $M$ is pivoted at one end. What is the distance $d$ used in the period formula?",
        "options": [
          "$L$",
          "$L/2$",
          "$L/3$",
          "$L/\\sqrt{12}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a physical pendulum, $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the center of mass. For a uniform rod pivoted at one end, the center of mass is at the geometric center, which is $L/2$ from the pivot."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the rod in Question 1, what is the Moment of Inertia $I$ about the pivot at the end?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{12} ML^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} ML^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{3} ML^2$",
          "$ML^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using the parallel axis theorem: $I = I_{\\text{cm}} + Md^2$. For a rod about its center, $I_{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{1}{12}ML^2$, and $d = L/2$. So $I = \\frac{1}{12}ML^2 + M(L/2)^2 = \\frac{1}{12}ML^2 + \\frac{1}{4}ML^2 = \\frac{1}{3}ML^2$. Direct integration $\\int_0^L x^2 (M/L) dx$ gives the same result."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the period $T$ of the uniform rod ($I = \\frac{1}{3}ML^2$) pivoted at its end?",
        "options": [
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{L/g}$",
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{2L/3g}$",
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{L/2g}$",
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{3L/2g}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The period of a physical pendulum is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{I/(Mgd)}$. Substituting $I = \\frac{1}{3}ML^2$ and $d = L/2$: $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}ML^2}{Mg(L/2)}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{3g}}$."

        "options": [
          "$MR^2$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} MR^2$",
          "$2MR^2$",
          "$\\frac{3}{2} MR^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The hoop's moment of inertia about its center is $I_{\\text{cm}} = MR^2$. The nail is at a distance $R$ from the center (on the rim). Using the parallel axis theorem: $I = I_{\\text{cm}} + MR^2 = MR^2 + MR^2 = 2MR^2$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a physical pendulum is moved to a pivot point closer to its Center of Mass, what happens to the period $T$?",
        "options": [
          "It always decreases.",
          "It always increases.",
          "It initially decreases, then increases as $d \\to 0$.",
          "It stays the same."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The period is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{I/(Mgd)}$. As $d$ decreases, $I$ also decreases (since $I = I_{\\text{cm}} + Md^2$). The ratio $I/d$ initially decreases (lowering $T$) but as $d$ becomes very small, $I \\approx I_{\\text{cm}}$ (constant) while $d$ in the denominator drives the ratio $I/d \\to \\infty$, so $T$ increases. There is a minimum period at $d = \\sqrt{I_{\\text{cm}}/M}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a physical pendulum is pivoted exactly at its Center of Mass ($d=0$), what is its behavior?",
        "options": [
          "It oscillates very quickly.",
          "It does not oscillate (neutral equilibrium).",
          "It oscillates with $T = 2\\pi$.",
          "It immediately falls."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The restoring torque is $\\tau = -Mgd\\sin\\theta$. When $d = 0$, the torque is zero for any $\\theta$. The system is in neutral equilibrium—any displacement results in no restoring torque, so it does not oscillate."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Simple Pendulum' is a special case of a physical pendulum where $I = md^2$. Substituting this into $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{I/Mgd}$ yields:",
        "options": [
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{g/d}$",
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{d/g}$",
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{I/g}$",
          "$2\\pi \\sqrt{m/k}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a simple pendulum, all mass is concentrated at a point distance $d$ (the string length) from the pivot, so $I = Md^2$. Substituting: $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{(Md^2)/(Mgd)} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{d/g}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Center of Oscillation' is the point at distance $L_{\\text{eq}} = I/(Md)$ from the pivot. Why is this point significant?",
        "options": [
          "It is where the period is the same as a simple pendulum of length $L_{\\text{eq}}$.",
          "It is the center of mass.",
          "It is where the torque is zero.",
          "It is where the mass is concentrated."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equivalent length $L_{\\text{eq}} = I/(Md)$ is defined so that the physical pendulum has the same period as a simple pendulum of length $L_{\\text{eq}}$. If all mass were concentrated at the center of oscillation, the period would be unchanged."

        "question": "A disk of radius $R$ is pivoted at its edge ($I_{\\text{edge}} = \\frac{3}{2}MR^2$). Its equivalent simple pendulum length $L_{\\text{eq}}$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$R$",
          "$R/2$",
          "$3R/2$",
          "$2R/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$L_{\\text{eq}} = I/(Md)$. Here $I = \\frac{3}{2}MR^2$ (about the edge) and $d = R$ (distance from pivot to CM). So $L_{\\text{eq}} = (\\frac{3}{2}MR^2)/(MR) = \\frac{3}{2}R$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the differential equation $\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{Mgd}{I}\\theta = 0$, what does the term $\\frac{Mgd}{I}$ represent?",

          "Frequency $f$",
          "Period $T$",
          "Angular Frequency squared $\\omega^2$",
          "Amplitude $A$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The standard form of the SHM differential equation is $\\ddot{x} + \\omega^2 x = 0$. Comparing with $\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{Mgd}{I}\\theta = 0$, we identify $\\omega^2 = \\frac{Mgd}{I}$. Thus, $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{Mgd}{I}}$ and $T = 2\\pi/\\omega = 2\\pi\\sqrt{I/(Mgd)}$."
