    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A constant force $\\vec{F} = F_0\\hat{i} + F_0\\hat{j}$ acts on a particle. The particle moves along a straight path from the origin to $(L, L)$. Which expression represents the work done?",
        "options": [
          "$F_0 L$",
          "$2F_0 L$",
          "$\\sqrt{2} F_0 L$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work is the dot product $\\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{d}$, where $\\vec{d}$ is the displacement vector. Here, $\\vec{d} = L\\hat{i} + L\\hat{j}$. Thus, $W = (F_0)(L) + (F_0)(L) = 2F_0 L$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is subject to a constant force $\\vec{F}$. The work done is defined by the line integral $W = \\int_{\\vec{r}_1}^{\\vec{r}_2} \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}$. If $\\vec{F}$ is constant, this integral simplifies to:",
        "options": [
          "$\\vec{F} \\cdot (\\vec{r}_2 - \\vec{r}_1)$",
          "$\\vec{F} \\cdot (\\vec{r}_2 + \\vec{r}_1)$",
          "$|\\vec{F}| \\int dr$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} F r^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\vec{F}$ is constant, it can be pulled out of the integral: $\\vec{F} \\cdot \\int_{\\vec{r}_1}^{\\vec{r}_2} d\\vec{r} = \\vec{F} \\cdot (\\vec{r}_2 - \\vec{r}_1)$. This is a key property: work done by a constant force depends only on the net displacement, not the path."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The position of a particle is given by $\\vec{r}(t) = (2t)\\hat{i} + (3t^2)\\hat{j}$. A constant force $\\vec{F} = 5\\hat{i}$ acts on the particle. Find the work done by this force from $t=0$ to $t=2$.",
        "options": [
          "$10$ J",
          "$20$ J",

          "$60$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At $t=0$, $\\vec{r}(0) = (0,0)$. At $t=2$, $\\vec{r}(2) = (4, 12)$. The displacement $\\Delta \\vec{r} = 4\\hat{i} + 12\\hat{j}$. Work $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\vec{r} = (5\\hat{i}) \\cdot (4\\hat{i} + 12\\hat{j}) = 20$ J. Note: the $\\hat{j}$ component of displacement contributes nothing because the force has no $\\hat{j}$ component."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves along the x-axis from $x=a$ to $x=b$ under a constant force $\\vec{F}$ that makes an angle $\\theta$ with the x-axis. Using the integral definition $W = \\int_a^b F_x dx$, the work is:",

          "$F \\cos\\theta (b-a)$",
          "$\\int_a^b F \\cos\\theta d\\theta$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$F_x$ is the component of the force along the axis of motion, which is $F \\cos\\theta$. Since the force is constant, $F \\cos\\theta$ is constant. Integrating a constant from $a$ to $b$ yields $F \\cos\\theta (b-a)$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the power $P$ delivered by a constant force is given by $P = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}$, and an object moves with constant velocity $\\vec{v}$ for time $T$, what is the calculus-based derivation for Work?",
        "options": [
          "$W = \\int_0^T (\\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}) dt$",
          "$W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}$",
          "$W = \\int P^2 dt$",
          "$W = \\vec{F} \\times \\vec{v} T$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, power is the rate of doing work: $P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$. Therefore, work is the integral of power over time: $W = \\int P dt = \\int_0^T (\\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}) dt$. For constant $\\vec{F}$ and $\\vec{v}$, this simplifies to $(\\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v})T$."

          "$m \\vec{a}$",
          "$\\int \\vec{v} dt$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Work-Energy Theorem states that the net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy: $W_{net} = \\Delta K = K_f - K_i = \\Delta(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2)$. This is a direct consequence of Newton's second law and calculus."

          "$30$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "First, find the displacement: $\\Delta \\vec{r} = (4-1)\\hat{i} + (6-2)\\hat{j} = 3\\hat{i} + 4\\hat{j}$. Then compute the dot product: $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\vec{r} = (2)(3) + (3)(4) = 6 + 12 = 18$ J."

          "Greater than the straight-line path.",
          "Dependent on the arc length $\\pi R$.",
          "The same as the straight-line path.",
          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a constant force, work is path-independent. It depends only on the displacement vector $\\Delta \\vec{r}$ from the start point to the end point. This is why gravity near Earth's surface (approximately constant $\\vec{g}$) is a conservative force."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$W = F_x \\Delta x + F_y \\Delta y + F_z \\Delta z$. Since all displacements are 1 meter: $W = (1)(1) + (2)(1) + (3)(1) = 6$ J."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Even though the path is a parabola, for a constant force, work is path-independent. We only need the start $(0,0)$ and end points. At $x=2$, $y=4$, so the end point is $(2, 4)$. Displacement $\\Delta \\vec{r} = 2\\hat{i} + 4\\hat{j}$. $W = (3)(2) + (2)(4) = 6 + 8 = 14$ J."
