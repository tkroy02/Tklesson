      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $\\vec{v} = v_0 \\hat{i}$ collides with an identical particle at rest. After the collision, the first particle moves with velocity $\\vec{v}_1 = \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{i} + \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{j}$. What is the velocity vector $\\vec{v}_2$ of the second particle?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{i} - \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{j}$",
          "$\\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{i} + \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{j}$",

          "$v_0 \\hat{i} - \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{j}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By conservation of momentum: $m v_0 \\hat{i} = m\\left(\\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{i} + \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{j}\\right) + m\\vec{v}_2$. Solving: $\\vec{v}_2 = v_0 \\hat{i} - \\left(\\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{i} + \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{j}\\right) = \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{i} - \\frac{v_0}{2} \\hat{j}$."

        "question": "In an elastic collision between two identical masses where one is initially at rest, if the collision is not head‑on, the angle between their final velocity vectors is always:",
        "options": [

          "$180^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For equal masses with one initially at rest, momentum conservation gives $\\vec{v}_i = \\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{v}_2$, and energy conservation gives $v_i^2 = v_1^2 + v_2^2$. Squaring the momentum equation yields $v_i^2 = v_1^2 + v_2^2 + 2\\vec{v}_1\\cdot\\vec{v}_2$. Substituting the energy relation shows $2\\vec{v}_1\\cdot\\vec{v}_2 = 0$, so $\\vec{v}_1 \\perp \\vec{v}_2$."

          "$20 \\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $y$-component of impulse is $J_y = \\int_0^{0.2} 20 \\, dt = 20(0.2) = 4 \\text{ N·s}$. Since the initial $y$-velocity is zero, $J_y = m(v_{fy} - 0) \\Rightarrow 4 = 2 v_{fy} \\Rightarrow v_{fy} = 2 \\text{ m/s}$."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Internal forces do not affect the motion of the center of mass. As long as no external force acts on the system, $\\vec{F}_{ext}=0$, so $\\vec{a}_{cm}=0$ and $\\vec{v}_{cm}$ remains constant."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Only the component perpendicular to the wall changes. The perpendicular component changes from $v_\\perp = v\\cos\\theta$ to $-v\\cos\\theta$. The change in momentum is $m\\Delta v_\\perp = m(v\\cos\\theta - (-v\\cos\\theta)) = 2mv\\cos\\theta$."

        "explanation": "Compute initial $x$-momenta: $p_{1x} = (1)(10\\cos30^\\circ) = 10(0.8660) = 8.66 \\text{ kg·m/s}$; $p_{2x} = (2)(5\\cos(-60^\\circ)) = 10(0.5) = 5.0 \\text{ kg·m/s}$. Since momentum is conserved in the $x$-direction (no external forces), $P_{fx} = 8.66 + 5.0 = 13.66 \\approx 13.7 \\text{ kg·m/s}$."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The impact parameter measures how “off‑center” the collision is. $b=0$ means the projectile is aimed directly at the target’s center, so the velocities before and after the collision lie along the same line — a 1D (head‑on) collision."

        "answer": "C",

For $m=1$, $F_x = 6 \\text{ N}$, $F_y = 12 \\text{ N}$. The magnitude is $|\\vec{F}| = \\sqrt{6^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{36+144} = \\sqrt{180} \\approx 13.4 \\text{ N}$."
