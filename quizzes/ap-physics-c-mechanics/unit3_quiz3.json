    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle is acted upon by a force $F(x) = ax^2 + b$. Which integral expression represents the work done as the particle moves from $x = x_1$ to $x = x_2$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} (ax^2 + b) \\, dx$",
          "$(ax_2^2 + b)(x_2 - x_1)$",
          "$\\frac{d}{dx} (ax^2 + b)|_{x_1}^{x_2}$",
          "$\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} (2ax) \\, dx$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, work done by a variable force in one dimension is $W = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x) \\, dx$. This is the fundamental calculus formulation: the infinitesimal work is $dW = F(x) dx$, so total work is the definite integral."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring exerts a restorative force $F(x) = -kx$. How much work is done by the spring as a block moves from equilibrium ($x=0$) to $x = D$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{2} kD^2$",
          "$-\\frac{1}{2} kD^2$",
          "$-kD$",
          "$kD^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$W = \\int_{0}^{D} (-kx) \\, dx = [-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2]_0^D = -\\frac{1}{2}kD^2$. The negative sign indicates the spring force opposes the displacement, so the spring does negative work on the block (the block does positive work on the spring)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A force is defined as $F(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 5$ N. Calculate the work done by this force from $x = 0$ to $x = 2$ m.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$W = \\int_{0}^{2} (3x^2 - 2x + 5) \\, dx = [x^3 - x^2 + 5x]_0^2$. Evaluating: $(8 - 4 + 10) - (0) = 14$ J. This demonstrates polynomial integration in work calculations."

          "$W_2 = 4W_1$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$W_1 = \\int_{0}^{A} kx \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. $W_2 = \\int_{A}^{2A} kx \\, dx = [\\frac{1}{2}kx^2]_A^{2A} = \\frac{1}{2}k(4A^2 - A^2) = \\frac{3}{2}kA^2 = 3 \\times (\\frac{1}{2}kA^2) = 3W_1$. The work increases non-linearly with displacement."

          "$0$ J"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$W = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} F_0 e^{-\\alpha x} \\, dx = [-\\frac{F_0}{\\alpha} e^{-\\alpha x}]_0^{\\infty}$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $e^{-\\alpha x} \\to 0$. At $x=0$, $e^{0}=1$. Thus, $W = (0) - (-\\frac{F_0}{\\alpha}) = F_0/\\alpha$. This shows convergence for exponentially decaying forces."

          "$\\frac{1}{3} F_0 x_0$"

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The work equals the area under the F-x curve. A straight line from the origin forms a right triangle with base $x_0$ and height $F_0$. Area = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} x_0 F_0$."

        "explanation": "$W = \\int_{L}^{2L} kx^{-2} \\, dx = [-kx^{-1}]_L^{2L} = [-\\frac{k}{x}]_L^{2L}$. Evaluating: $(-\\frac{k}{2L}) - (-\\frac{k}{L}) = -\\frac{k}{2L} + \\frac{k}{L} = \\frac{k}{2L}$. This inverse-square force yields finite work over finite displacements."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From calculus, $W = \\int F(x) dx$, so by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $\\frac{dW}{dx} = F(x)$. This means the work function's derivative with respect to position is the force. Graphically, the integral (area under the curve) gives the accumulated work."
