      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem is derived from Newton’s Second Law ($F = ma$). Which calculus identity allows us to change the integral $\\int m a \\, dx$ into an integral with respect to velocity?",
        "options": [
          "$a = \\frac{dv}{dt}$",
          "$a = v \\frac{dv}{dx}$",
          "$a = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$",
          "$a = \\int v \\, dt$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the chain rule: $a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dv}{dx} \\frac{dx}{dt} = v \\frac{dv}{dx}$. Substituting into the work integral: $\\int m a \\, dx = \\int m (v \\frac{dv}{dx}) dx = \\int mv \\, dv$. Integrating gives $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, the change in kinetic energy. This is the fundamental calculus derivation of the theorem."

        "question": "A particle ($m = 2$ kg) is subject to a net force $F(x) = 3x^2 + 4x$. If it starts from rest at $x=0$, what is its kinetic energy ($K$) at $x=2$ m?",
        "options": [
          "$16$ J",
          "$20$ J",
          "$8$ J",
          "$32$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem: $W_{net} = \\Delta K = K_f - K_i$. $W = \\int_{0}^{2} (3x^2 + 4x) \\, dx = [x^3 + 2x^2]_0^2 = (8 + 8) - 0 = 16$ J. Since initial kinetic energy $K_i = 0$, $K_f = 16$ J."

          "It increases.",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$W_{net} = \\Delta K = K_f - K_i$. If $W_{net} < 0$, then $K_f < K_i$. Since kinetic energy $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is proportional to the square of speed, a decrease in kinetic energy means the speed decreases. The object is slowing down."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem: $W = \\Delta K = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2 - v_i^2)$. At $x=0$, $v(0)=0$. At $x=L$, $v(L)=\\beta L^{1/2}$. So $W = \\frac{1}{2}m[(\\beta L^{1/2})^2 - 0] = \\frac{1}{2}m\\beta^2 L$."

        "explanation": "Work done: $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\vec{r} = (4)(3) + (-3)(2) = 12 - 6 = 6$ J. Initial kinetic energy: $K_i = \\frac{1}{2}(2)(2)^2 = 4$ J. By the theorem: $K_f = K_i + W = 4 + 6 = 10$ J."

          "Yes, but only if the friction is constant.",
          "Yes, $W_{net}$ includes work from all forces, including friction.",
          "No, because friction generates heat."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem is a direct mathematical consequence of Newton's Second Law ($F_{net} = ma$). It holds universally: $W_{net} = \\Delta K$, where $W_{net}$ is the work done by all forces (conservative and non-conservative). The energy 'lost' to heat via friction appears as negative work in the equation."

          "$2C$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem in differential form: $dW = dK$. Since $dW = F(x) dx$ and $dK = d(Cx^2) = 2Cx \\, dx$, we have $F(x) dx = 2Cx \\, dx$. Therefore, $F(x) = 2Cx$. This shows force as the derivative of kinetic energy with respect to position when kinetic energy is expressed as a function of $x$."

        "explanation": "Work done from $0$ to $D$: $W = \\int_{0}^{D} kx^3 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{4}kD^4 = K_f$ (starting from rest). If displacement doubles to $2D$, new kinetic energy = $\\frac{1}{4}k(2D)^4 = \\frac{1}{4}k(16D^4) = 16 \\times (\\frac{1}{4}kD^4)$. Thus, kinetic energy increases by a factor of $16$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work done by the spring force ($F = -kx$) from $x=0.1$ m to $x=0$: $W = \\int_{0.1}^{0} (-kx) \\, dx = [-\\frac{1}{2}kx^2]_{0.1}^0 = 0 - (-\\frac{1}{2}(200)(0.1)^2) = 1.0$ J. Positive work here means the spring force transfers energy to the block."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Power is defined as the rate of doing work: $P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$. Therefore, the total work done over time is $W = \\int P \\, dt$. By the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem, $W = \\Delta K$, so $\\Delta K = \\int P \\, dt$. This connects the time-integral of power to the change in kinetic energy."
