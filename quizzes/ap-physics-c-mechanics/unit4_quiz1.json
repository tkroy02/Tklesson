      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system consists of three masses: $2\\text{ kg}$ at $(0,0)$, $3\\text{ kg}$ at $(4,0)$, and $5\\text{ kg}$ at $(2,4)$. What is the $x$-coordinate of the center of mass?",
        "options": [
          "$2.0$",
          "$2.2$",
          "$2.4$",
          "$3.0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The $x$-coordinate of the center of mass is given by $x_{cm} = \\frac{\\sum m_i x_i}{\\sum m_i}$. Here, $x_{cm} = \\frac{(2)(0) + (3)(4) + (5)(2)}{2+3+5} = \\frac{0 + 12 + 10}{10} = \\frac{22}{10} = 2.2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two particles of masses $m$ and $3m$ are separated by a distance $L$. How far from the mass $m$ is the center of mass located?",
        "options": [
          "$0.25L$",
          "$0.33L$",
          "$0.50L$",
          "$0.75L$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Place $m$ at $x=0$ and $3m$ at $x=L$. Then $x_{cm} = \\frac{(m)(0) + (3m)(L)}{m + 3m} = \\frac{3mL}{4m} = \\frac{3}{4}L = 0.75L$. So the center of mass is located 0.75L from mass $m$ (and 0.25L from mass $3m$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $60\\text{ kg}$ person stands on one end of a $20\\text{ kg}$ uniform plank of length $4\\text{ m}$. If the plank is on frictionless ice, where is the center of mass of the person-plank system relative to the person?",
        "options": [
          "$0.5\\text{ m}$",
          "$1.0\\text{ m}$",
          "$2.0\\text{ m}$",
          "$0.8\\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Place the person at $x=0$. The plank’s mass is concentrated at its geometric center, $x = 2$ m. Then $x_{cm} = \\frac{(60)(0) + (20)(2)}{60 + 20} = \\frac{40}{80} = 0.5$ m. So the center of mass is 0.5 m away from the person toward the center of the plank."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A square plate of side $L$ has a uniform mass density. If a smaller square of side $L/2$ is cut out from the top-right corner, the center of mass of the remaining piece shifts:",
        "options": [
          "Toward the top‑right",
          "Toward the bottom‑left",
          "It does not shift",
          "Toward the center of the cutout"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Removing mass from one region is equivalent to adding negative mass at that location. The original center of mass was at the geometric center. Removing mass from the top‑right pulls the center of mass in the opposite direction—toward the bottom‑left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a continuous object with non-uniform density, the $x$-coordinate of the center of mass is defined by which integral?",
        "options": [
          "$\\int x \\, dx$",
          "$\\frac{1}{M} \\int x^2 \\, dm$",
          "$\\frac{1}{M} \\int x \\, dm$",
          "$\\int \\rho(x) \\, dx$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a continuous mass distribution, $x_{cm} = \\frac{1}{M} \\int x \\, dm$, where $dm = \\rho(x)dV$ (or the appropriate differential mass element). This generalizes the discrete formula $\\frac{\\sum m_i x_i}{\\sum m_i}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the net external force on a system is zero, what can be said about the velocity of the center of mass ($v_{cm}$)?",
        "options": [
          "It must be zero.",
          "It is constant.",
          "It is increasing.",
          "It depends on the internal forces."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From Newton’s second law for systems: $\\vec{F}_{ext} = M \\vec{a}_{cm}$. If $\\vec{F}_{ext} = 0$, then $\\vec{a}_{cm} = 0$, so $\\vec{v}_{cm}$ is constant (could be zero or non‑zero). Internal forces do not affect the motion of the center of mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2\\text{ kg}$ mass moves at $3\\text{ m/s}$ to the right, and a $1\\text{ kg}$ mass moves at $6\\text{ m/s}$ to the left. What is the velocity of the center of mass?",
        "options": [
          "$0\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$1\\text{ m/s}$ right",
          "$3\\text{ m/s}$ left",
          "$4.5\\text{ m/s}$ right"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Take right as positive. Then $v_1 = +3\\text{ m/s}$, $v_2 = -6\\text{ m/s}$. $v_{cm} = \\frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \\frac{(2)(3) + (1)(-6)}{2+1} = \\frac{6-6}{3} = 0\\text{ m/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An internal explosion breaks an object (initially at rest) into two fragments of unequal mass. After the explosion, the center of mass of the two fragments:",
        "options": [
          "Moves toward the larger mass",
          "Moves toward the smaller mass",
          "Remains at rest",
          "Moves at a constant non-zero velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Explosions are internal forces; the net external force on the system is zero. Since $\\vec{F}_{ext} = 0$, the acceleration of the center of mass is zero. If the object was initially at rest, the center of mass remains at rest regardless of how the fragments fly apart."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The position of the center of mass of a system of particles is $(2, 3)$. If a new particle is added at $(2, 3)$, the center of mass will:",
        "options": [
          "Move up",
          "Move to the right",
          "Remain at $(2, 3)$",
          "Move toward the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Adding mass exactly at the existing center of mass is like adding mass at the balance point of a seesaw—the balance point does not change. Mathematically, the new center of mass is the weighted average of all masses; adding mass at the old $\\vec{r}_{cm}$ leaves the average unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform wire is bent into a semi‑circle of radius $R$. The center of mass is located:",
        "options": [
          "At the center of the circle",
          "On the axis of symmetry, outside the wire",
          "On the wire itself",
          "At a distance $R$ from the center"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a uniform semi‑circular arc, symmetry dictates the center of mass lies on the perpendicular bisector of the diameter (the axis of symmetry). Its exact location is at $(0,\\,2R/\\pi)$ if the diameter lies along the x‑axis. This point is inside the enclosed area but not on the wire itself. More precisely, it lies along the symmetry axis, below the diameter line."

        "90": "Mastery of center of mass concepts. You can compute COM for discrete systems, understand the continuous integral definition, apply symmetry, analyze COM motion under zero external force, and predict shifts when mass is added or removed.",
        "70": "Strong analytical skills. Review: the general integral definition $\\vec{r}_{cm} = \\frac{1}{M} \\int \\vec{r} \\, dm$, the effect of internal forces on COM motion, and using symmetry to locate COM for continuous objects (like semi‑circles).",
        "50": "Good foundational knowledge. Focus on: the formula $x_{cm} = \\frac{\\sum m_i x_i}{M}$, the principle that COM moves as if all mass were concentrated there under external forces, and that adding/removing mass shifts COM toward/away from the change.",
        "0": "Start with simple two‑mass systems to practice $x_{cm}$ calculations. Then explore how COM moves when masses move, and understand that internal forces (like explosions) do not change the COM motion if external forces are zero."
