        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A non‑uniform rod of length $L$ has a linear mass density $\\lambda(x) = \\lambda_0 \\frac{x}{L}$. If the rod is moving with a center‑of‑mass velocity $v_{cm}$, what is the total linear momentum of the rod?",
        "options": [
          "$\\frac{1}{2} \\lambda_0 L v_{cm}$",
          "$\\lambda_0 L v_{cm}$",
          "$\\frac{1}{3} \\lambda_0 L v_{cm}$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2} \\lambda_0 L^2 v_{cm}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total momentum is always $P = M_{total} v_{cm}$. First compute total mass: $M = \\int_0^L \\lambda(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\lambda_0 \\frac{x}{L} dx = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{L} \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^L = \\frac{\\lambda_0 L}{2}$. Hence, $P = \\frac{\\lambda_0 L}{2} v_{cm}$."

        "question": "A system consists of two masses $m$ and $2m$. The $x$‑coordinate of the center of mass is $x_{cm} = 2t^2$. What is the total net external force acting on the system?",
        "options": [

          "$12m$",
          "$4(3m)t$",
          "$12(m)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, find $a_{cm}$: $x_{cm} = 2t^2 \\Rightarrow v_{cm} = 4t \\Rightarrow a_{cm} = 4$. Total mass = $m + 2m = 3m$. Then $F_{ext} = M_{total} a_{cm} = 3m \\times 4 = 12m$ (units: Newtons)."

        "question": "A $2 \\text{ kg}$ block is at rest on a frictionless surface. A time‑dependent force $F(t) = 6t^2$ is applied. At $t=2 \\text{ s}$, the block undergoes a perfectly inelastic collision with a $4 \\text{ kg}$ block at rest. What is the final velocity of the combined mass?",

          "$8.0 \\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Impulse delivered to the $2\\text{ kg}$ block: $J = \\int_0^2 6t^2 dt = [2t^3]_0^2 = 16 \\text{ N·s}$. Its velocity just before collision is $v = J/m = 16/2 = 8\\text{ m/s}$. Total momentum before collision = $2\\times8 + 4\\times0 = 16\\text{ kg·m/s}$. After sticking, combined mass = $6\\text{ kg}$, so $v_f = 16/6 \\approx 2.67\\text{ m/s}$."

        "question": "An object of mass $M$ is moving with velocity $v \\hat{i}$. It explodes into two pieces: $m_1 = M/4$ and $m_2 = 3M/4$. If $m_1$ is observed to be at rest immediately after the explosion, what is the velocity of $m_2$?",
        "options": [

          "$\\frac{1}{3} v \\hat{i}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Momentum conservation: $Mv = \\frac{M}{4}(0) + \\frac{3M}{4} v_2$. Cancel $M$: $v = \\frac{3}{4}v_2 \\Rightarrow v_2 = \\frac{4}{3}v$."

          "$\\frac{M}{L}(yg + 2v^2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Force needed = weight of lifted part + force to accelerate each new link from rest to $v$. Weight = $(\\frac{M}{L}y)g$. Impulsive term: $\\frac{dp}{dt} = v \\frac{dm}{dt} = v (\\frac{M}{L} \\frac{dy}{dt}) = \\frac{M}{L}v^2$. Total $F = \\frac{M}{L}(yg + v^2)$."

        "options": [
          "The CoM follows the original parabolic trajectory until the first piece hits the ground.",
          "The CoM stops moving horizontally.",
          "The CoM falls vertically.",
          "The CoM moves faster than the original projectile."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The explosion is an internal force; the only external force is gravity. Therefore, $\\vec{a}_{cm} = \\vec{g}$, exactly as before the explosion. The center of mass continues along the original parabolic path regardless of the fragments' individual motions."

          "$70 \\text{ N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Change in momentum: $\\Delta p = m(v_f - v_i) = 0.1(15 - (-20)) = 3.5 \\text{ N·s}$. The area under a triangular force‑time curve is $J = \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2}(0.01)(F_{max})$. Set $J = \\Delta p$: $0.005F_{max} = 3.5 \\Rightarrow F_{max} = 700 \\text{ N}$."

          "$m_1 < m_2$",
          "It is possible for any mass ratio."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If $m_1 = m_2$, the angle between the two outgoing velocities is $90^\\circ$, but $m_1$ itself cannot be at $90^\\circ$ to its original direction. If $m_1 > m_2$, $m_1$ can only scatter forward (angles less than $90^\\circ$). Only when $m_1 < m_2$ can $m_1$ be deflected sideways or backward, including exactly $90^\\circ$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "König's theorem: $K_{lab} = \\frac{1}{2} M v_{cm}^2 + K'$, where $K'$ is the kinetic energy relative to the center of mass (i.e., $K_{cm}$). So $K_{lab} = K_{cm} + \\frac{1}{2} M v_{cm}^2$."

          "A line with a positive slope (linear increase).",

          "A curve that approaches a horizontal asymptote."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a rocket with constant exhaust velocity $u$ and constant mass‑ejection rate $R$, $a(t) = \\frac{R u}{M(t)} = \\frac{R u}{M_0 - R t}$. As $t$ increases, $M(t)$ decreases, so $a(t)$ increases hyperbolically—it curves upward, increasing at an increasing rate until the fuel is exhausted."
