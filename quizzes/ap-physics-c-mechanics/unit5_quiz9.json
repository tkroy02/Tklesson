      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid cylinder and a thin hoop of the same mass $M$ and radius $R$ rotate with the same angular velocity $\\omega$. Which has the larger angular momentum?",
        "options": [
          "The cylinder",
          "The hoop",
          "They are equal",
          "It depends on the length of the cylinder"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum is $L = I\\omega$. For a solid cylinder, $I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$; for a thin hoop, $I = MR^2$. Since both have the same $\\omega$, the object with the larger moment of inertia (the hoop) has the larger angular momentum: $L_{\\text{hoop}} = MR^2\\omega$ versus $L_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2\\omega$."

        "question": "A figure skater is spinning with their arms extended. When they pull their arms in, their angular momentum:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Remains constant",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the absence of external torques, angular momentum is conserved. Pulling the arms in decreases the moment of inertia $I$, but the angular velocity $\\omega$ increases such that $L = I\\omega$ remains constant. (Kinetic energy increases because work is done by the skater's muscles, but angular momentum stays the same.)"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the net torque acting on a rigid body is constant and non‑zero, the angular momentum $L(t)$ will be:",
        "options": [
          "Constant",
          "A linear function of time",
          "A quadratic function of time",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The rotational analog of Newton’s second law is $\\tau = \\frac{dL}{dt}$. If $\\tau$ is constant, then $\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\tau \\implies L(t) = \\tau t + L_0$, where $L_0$ is the initial angular momentum. This is linear in $t$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform disk ($I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$) is rotating. If the radius of the disk somehow doubles while the mass and angular velocity remain constant, the angular momentum:",

          "Doubles",
          "Quadruples",
          "Remains the same",
          "Decreases by half"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$L = I\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2\\omega$. If $R$ doubles to $2R$, then $R^2$ becomes $4R^2$. Thus, $L_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{2}M(4R^2)\\omega = 4 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2}MR^2\\omega \\right) = 4L$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rigid body is rotating about a fixed axis. If the angular momentum is given by $L(t) = 5t^2 + 2t$, what is the net torque at $t = 3\\text{ s}$?",
        "options": [
          "17 N·m",
          "30 N·m",
          "32 N·m",
          "47 N·m"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Torque is the time derivative of angular momentum: $\\tau = \\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(5t^2 + 2t) = 10t + 2$. At $t = 3\\text{ s}$, $\\tau = 10(3) + 2 = 32\\text{ N·m}$."

        "question": "For a system consisting of a disk and a person standing on its rim, the total angular momentum is $L = (I_{\\text{disk}} + I_{\\text{person}})\\omega$. If the person walks toward the center, $\\omega$ increases because:",
        "options": [
          "External torque is applied.",
          "The moment of inertia of the system decreases.",
          "The person's linear momentum increases.",
          "Work is being done by gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The person and disk form an isolated system with respect to vertical axis rotation (neglecting friction at the axle). As the person moves inward, their distance from the axis decreases, so $I_{\\text{person}} = mr^2$ decreases. Since no external torque acts, angular momentum $L = I\\omega$ is conserved. A smaller $I$ means $\\omega$ must increase to keep $L$ constant."

        "options": [
          "Linear momentum",
          "Kinetic energy",
          "Angular momentum",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "explanation": "The pivot exerts an external force on the rod‑mass system, so linear momentum is not conserved. The collision may be inelastic, so kinetic energy is not conserved. However, the force from the pivot acts at the pivot point ($\\vec{r} = 0$), so it produces zero torque about the pivot. Thus, angular momentum about the pivot is conserved.",
        "answer": "C"

          "$L\\omega$",
          "$L\\alpha$",
          "$\\tau\\omega$",
          "$dL/dt$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Power is the rate of doing work: $P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$. Since $dW = \\tau d\\theta$, we have $P = \\tau \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\tau\\omega$."

        "question": "A star collapses from a radius $R$ to $R/10$. If it was rotating with $\\omega_0$, what is its new angular velocity $\\omega_f$ (assuming it remains a uniform sphere)?",
        "options": [
          "$10\\omega_0$",
          "$100\\omega_0$",
          "$\\omega_0 / 10$",
          "$\\omega_0 / 100$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum is conserved: $I_i \\omega_i = I_f \\omega_f$. For a uniform solid sphere, $I \\propto MR^2$, so $I_f/I_i = (R_f/R_i)^2 = (1/10)^2 = 1/100$. Thus, $\\omega_f = \\omega_i (I_i/I_f) = \\omega_i \\times 100 = 100\\omega_0$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A planet orbits the sun in an elliptical path. The angular momentum of the planet about the sun is $L = I\\omega$. Does $I$ remain constant?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, because the mass is constant.",
          "No, because the distance $r$ from the sun changes.",
          "Yes, because it is a rigid body.",
          "No, because the sun’s gravity changes."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The planet is effectively a point mass, so its moment of inertia about the sun is $I = mr^2$. In an elliptical orbit, the distance $r$ from the sun varies, so $I$ is not constant. However, because gravity is a central force (directed toward the sun), the torque about the sun is zero, and angular momentum $L = I\\omega$ remains constant throughout the orbit."
