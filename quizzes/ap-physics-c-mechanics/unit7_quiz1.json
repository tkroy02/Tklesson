        "question": "A mass $M$ is at the origin $(0,0)$. A mass $m$ is at $(3,4)$. What is the unit vector $\\hat{r}$ pointing from $M$ toward $m$?",
        "options": [
          "$3\\hat{i} + 4\\hat{j}$",
          "$0.6\\hat{i} + 0.8\\hat{j}$",

          "$5\\hat{i} + 5\\hat{j}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The displacement vector from $M$ to $m$ is $\\vec{r} = 3\\hat{i} + 4\\hat{j}$. Its magnitude is $r = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$. The unit vector is $\\hat{r} = \\vec{r}/r = (3/5)\\hat{i} + (4/5)\\hat{j} = 0.6\\hat{i} + 0.8\\hat{j}$."

        "options": [
          "$0.6\\hat{i} + 0.8\\hat{j}$",
          "$-0.6\\hat{i} - 0.8\\hat{j}$",
          "$0.8\\hat{i} - 0.6\\hat{j}$",
          "Toward the origin."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The gravitational force on $m$ is attractive, directed toward the source mass $M$ at the origin. Since $\\hat{r}$ points from $M$ to $m$, the force is in the direction of $-\\hat{r} = -0.6\\hat{i} - 0.8\\hat{j}$."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a continuous mass distribution, the total vector force on a test mass $m$ is obtained by integrating over all mass elements $dm$: $\\vec{F} = -Gm \\int \\frac{\\hat{r}}{r^2} dm$, where $\\hat{r}$ is the unit vector from $dm$ to $m$ and $r$ is the distance between them."

          "$-\\frac{GM}{r^3} \\hat{r}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The gravitational force on a test mass $m$ due to $M$ is $\\vec{F} = -\\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\hat{r}$. Dividing by $m$ gives the field: $\\vec{g} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{m} = -\\frac{GM}{r^2}\\hat{r}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "Because gravity is a conservative force.",
          "Because mass is the 'source' (or sink) of the field lines (Gauss's Law for Gravity).",
          "Because the field is an inverse square.",
          "Gravity has no divergence."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gauss's Law for gravity states $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{g} = -4\\pi G \\rho$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density. Where there is no mass ($\\rho = 0$), the divergence is zero. Mass acts as a 'source' (or more precisely, a sink, because $\\vec{g}$ points inward) of gravitational field lines."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The vector force is $\\vec{F} = -\\frac{GMm}{r^3} \\vec{r}$, where $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j} + z\\hat{k}$ and $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. Therefore, the $x$‑component is $F_x = -\\frac{GMm}{r^3} x$."

          "They are unrelated."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's third law in vector form: the force on object 1 due to object 2 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force on object 2 due to object 1. That is, $\\vec{F}_{12} = -\\vec{F}_{21}$."

          "$0$",
          "$-\\frac{GM}{2\\pi R^2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By symmetry, every mass element $dm$ on the ring produces a field vector pointing radially inward from that element. At the center, the contributions from diametrically opposite elements exactly cancel. The vector sum (integral) over the entire ring is zero."

          "You only count the largest mass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The net gravitational force on a particle is the vector sum of the individual forces due to all other masses: $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\sum_i \\vec{F}_i$. This is the principle of superposition."

          "$GM/r$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gravity is a conservative force, meaning the work done by it around any closed path is zero. Mathematically, this is equivalent to $\\nabla \\times \\vec{g} = 0$. This allows us to define a gravitational potential $V$ such that $\\vec{g} = -\\nabla V$."
