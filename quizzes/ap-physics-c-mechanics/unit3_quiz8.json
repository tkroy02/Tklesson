      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ slides a distance $d$ along a horizontal surface with a position-dependent coefficient of friction $\\mu(x) = \\alpha x$. What is the work done by friction from $x=0$ to $x=L$?",
        "options": [
          "$-\\alpha mgL$",
          "$-\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha mgL^2$",
          "$-\\alpha mgL^2$",
          "$-\\frac{1}{3}\\alpha mgL^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Kinetic friction force: $f_k(x) = \\mu(x) N = (\\alpha x)(mg)$. Since friction opposes motion, the work is $W_{nc} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\vec{f}_k \\cdot d\\vec{x} = \\int_{0}^{L} -f_k(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\alpha mg x \\, dx = \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha mg x^2\\right]_{0}^{L} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha mg L^2$."

        "question": "A particle moves through a fluid where the resistive force is $F_r = -bv$. If the particle's speed changes from $v_0$ to $v_f$ over a distance $d$, how is the work done by the fluid expressed?",
        "options": [
          "$\\int_{0}^{d} -bv \\, dx$",
          "$-bvd$",
          "$\\int_{v_0}^{v_f} -bv \\, dv$",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work is defined as $W = \\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{x}$. For this force, $W = \\int_{0}^{d} (-bv) \\, dx$, where $v$ is a function of position. Option C incorrectly integrates with respect to velocity. Option D gives the net change in kinetic energy, which equals the total work done by all forces (not just the fluid)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2$ kg block is pushed against a spring ($k=100$ N/m) by $0.2$ m. When released, it slides across a rough patch that does $-1.5$ J of work before the block leaves the spring's reach. What is its kinetic energy then?",
        "options": [
          "$2.0$ J",
          "$0.5$ J",
          "$1.5$ J",
          "$3.5$ J"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Initial mechanical energy is all elastic potential: $E_i = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(100)(0.2)^2 = 2.0$ J. Using the extended work-energy theorem: $E_f = E_i + W_{nc}$, where $W_{nc} = -1.5$ J (work done by friction). Thus, $E_f = 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5$ J. Since the block has left the spring, this is purely kinetic energy."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A crate slides down an incline of height $h$ and angle $\\theta$. If it reaches the bottom with speed $v$, how much work was done by friction?",

          "$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - mgh$",
          "$mgh - \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$",
          "$-mgh$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Apply $\\Delta E_{mech} = W_{nc}$. Initial energy: $E_i = mgh$ (gravitational potential). Final energy: $E_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ (kinetic). Thus, $W_{nc} = E_f - E_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - mgh$. Since friction slows the crate, this value is negative (as $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 < mgh$)."

        "options": [
          "Because friction is a vector.",
          "Because the force of friction is always opposite to the direction of displacement.",
          "Because friction is a conservative force.",
          "Because friction depends on the normal force."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work is $W = \\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{x} = \\int F \\cos\\theta \\, dx$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between force and displacement. For kinetic friction, $\\theta = 180^\\circ$, so $\\cos 180^\\circ = -1$. Hence, the integrand is always negative, making $W < 0$ for any finite displacement."

          "$\\frac{1}{2} F_b d$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The braking force $F_b$ opposes motion, so work done by braking: $W_{nc} = -F_b d$. By the work-energy theorem: $K_f - K_i = W_{nc} = -F_b d$. Since $K_f = 0$, we have $-K_i = -F_b d \\Rightarrow K_i = F_b d$."

          "The Thermal Energy generated."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy: $W_{net} = \\Delta K$. The net force is $F_{net} = F_{grav} + F_{air}$, so $\\int (F_{grav} + F_{air}) \\, dy = \\Delta K$. This is the work-energy theorem in integral form."

          "Becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Friction is a non-conservative force; its work depends on the path length. Work done by kinetic friction: $W_f = -f \\times \\text{(total path length)}$. If the path length doubles, the magnitude of work doubles (becomes more negative)."

        "question": "A $5$ kg block is pulled $10$ m up a $30^\\circ$ incline by a $50$ N force parallel to the incline. If friction does $-20$ J of work, what is the net work done? ($g = 10 \\text{ m/s}^2$)",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Calculate each work component:\n1. Work by applied force: $W_{app} = F_{app} \\cdot d = 50 \\times 10 = 500$ J.\n2. Work by gravity: $W_g = -mgh = -mg(d\\sin\\theta) = -5\\times 10 \\times (10\\times 0.5) = -250$ J.\n3. Work by friction: $W_f = -20$ J.\nNet work: $W_{net} = W_{app} + W_g + W_f = 500 - 250 - 20 = 230$ J.\nAlternatively, $W_{net} = \\Delta K$ if starting and ending at rest."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the presence of friction, mechanical energy ($K+U$) is not conserved; it decreases by the amount converted to thermal energy (heat). However, total energy (mechanical + thermal + any other forms) is conserved. Thus, $\\Delta(K + U + E_{thermal}) = 0$, or equivalently $\\Delta K + \\Delta U = -\\Delta E_{thermal}$."
