        "question": "A particle of mass $m$ moves at a constant velocity $v$ along a straight line $y = d$. What is the magnitude of its angular momentum about the origin $(0,0)$?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$mvd$",
          "$mv\\sqrt{x^2 + d^2}$",
          "It changes as the particle moves"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum magnitude about a point is $L = mvr_\\perp$, where $r_\\perp$ is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of motion. For the line $y = d$, the perpendicular distance to the origin is $|d|$, which is constant. Thus, $L = mvd$ and remains constant as the particle moves."

        "question": "A particle moves in the $xy$-plane with position $\\vec{r} = 3\\hat{i} + 4\\hat{j}$ and velocity $\\vec{v} = 5\\hat{i}$. What is its angular momentum vector?",
        "options": [

          "$15m\\hat{k}$",
          "$-15m\\hat{k}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\vec{L} = m(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}) = m[(3\\hat{i} + 4\\hat{j}) \\times (5\\hat{i})] = m[3\\cdot 5(\\hat{i}\\times\\hat{i}) + 4\\cdot 5(\\hat{j}\\times\\hat{i})] = m[0 + 20(-\\hat{k})] = -20m\\hat{k}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a central force (like gravity) acts on a particle, why is its angular momentum about the force center conserved?",
        "options": [
          "Because the force is constant.",
          "Because the torque $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$ is zero.",
          "Because the particle moves in a circle.",
          "Because kinetic energy is conserved."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a central force, $\\vec{F}$ is directed along the line joining the particle and the force center, i.e., $\\vec{F} \\parallel \\vec{r}$. The torque about the center is $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} = 0$ (cross product of parallel vectors). Since $\\tau = d\\vec{L}/dt$, zero torque implies angular momentum is constant."

          "Remains zero",
          "Increases linearly with time $t$",
          "Increases with the square of time $t^2$",
          "Remains constant and non‑zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Position: $\\vec{r} = d\\hat{i} - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\hat{j}$, velocity: $\\vec{v} = -gt\\hat{j}$. $\\vec{L} = m(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}) = m[(d\\hat{i} - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\hat{j}) \\times (-gt\\hat{j})] = m[d(-gt)(\\hat{i}\\times\\hat{j}) + (\\frac{1}{2}gt^2)(gt)(\\hat{j}\\times\\hat{j})] = m(-gdt)\\hat{k}$. Magnitude $|\\vec{L}| = mgdt$, which increases linearly with $t$."

          "$mR\\omega$",
          "$mR^2\\omega$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\omega$",
          "$mR\\omega^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a point mass in circular motion, $v = R\\omega$, and the position vector is perpendicular to velocity, so $L = m(R)(R\\omega) = mR^2\\omega$. This is also $L = I\\omega$ with $I = mR^2$ for the point mass."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two particles of equal mass $m$ move in opposite directions with speed $v$ along parallel lines separated by a distance $d$. The total angular momentum of this system is:",

          "$2mvd$",
          "$mvd/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum depends on the choice of origin, but for any origin, the total $\\vec{L}$ of this system about any point is constant and equals $mvd$ (magnitude). This is because the two particles form a 'couple'—equal and opposite linear momenta separated by a perpendicular distance $d$—so their total angular momentum is independent of origin and equals $d \\times (mv)$."

          "At the point furthest from the origin (apogee)",
          "At the point closest to the origin (perigee)",
          "Speed is constant",
          "At the semi‑minor axis"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum is conserved: $L = mvr_\\perp$, where $r_\\perp$ is the perpendicular distance from the origin to the velocity vector. At perigee, $r_\\perp$ is minimum (equal to the radius itself if velocity is perpendicular to radius), so $v$ must be maximum to keep $L$ constant. At apogee, $r_\\perp$ is maximum, so $v$ is minimum."

          "Power"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The rotational form of Newton's second law: net torque equals the rate of change of angular momentum, $\\vec{\\tau}_{net} = d\\vec{L}/dt$. This is the exact analog of $\\vec{F}_{net} = d\\vec{p}/dt$ for linear motion."

          "In the $xy$‑plane",
          "Along the $+z$ axis",
          "Along the $-z$ axis",
          "It changes direction"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The particle moves in a circle of radius 1 in the $xy$-plane. Velocity is $\\vec{v}(t) = -\\sin(t)\\hat{i} + \\cos(t)\\hat{j}$. $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v} = (\\cos(t)\\hat{i} + \\sin(t)\\hat{j}) \\times (-\\sin(t)\\hat{i} + \\cos(t)\\hat{j}) = (\\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t))\\hat{k} = \\hat{k}$. So angular momentum is constant and points along $+z$."

          "$L/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum about the center is $L = mvr$, where $r$ is the loop radius. If $v$ stays the same and $r$ doubles, then $L_{new} = mv(2r) = 2(mvr) = 2L$."
