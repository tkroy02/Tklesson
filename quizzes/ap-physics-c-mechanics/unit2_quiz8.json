      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is dropped from rest in a fluid where the drag force is $F_D = -bv$. Which graph best represents the acceleration $a$ of the ball as a function of its velocity $v$?",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal line.",
          "A downward sloping linear line with a negative intercept.",
          "A downward sloping linear line with a positive intercept.",
          "An upward sloping parabola."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's Second Law: $mg - bv = ma$. Solve for acceleration: $a = g - \\frac{b}{m}v$. This is a linear equation of the form $y = mx + b$ with $y$-intercept $g$ (positive) and slope $-\\frac{b}{m}$ (negative). Therefore, the graph is a straight line sloping downward from a positive intercept on the $a$-axis."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two spheres, A and B, have the same radius but sphere A is twice as massive as sphere B. If they both experience a drag force $F_D = -bv$, what is the ratio of their terminal velocities $v_{T,A} / v_{T,B}$?",
        "options": [
          "$1:2$",
          "$1:1$",
          "$2:1$",
          "$4:1$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At terminal velocity, net force is zero: $mg = b v_T$. Therefore, $v_T = \\frac{mg}{b}$. Since $b$ depends on size and shape (and the spheres have the same radius), $b$ is the same for both. Thus, $v_T \\propto m$. If $m_A = 2 m_B$, then $v_{T,A} / v_{T,B} = m_A / m_B = 2/1$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A skydiver falls through the air where $F_D = cv^2$. If the skydiver doubles their cross-sectional area by spreading their limbs (assuming $c \\propto \\text{Area}$), the new terminal velocity will be:",
        "options": [
          "$1/\\sqrt{2}$ times the original.",
          "$1/2$ times the original.",
          "$\\sqrt{2}$ times the original.",
          "2 times the original."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For quadratic drag, terminal velocity is found from $mg = c v_T^2 \\Rightarrow v_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{mg}{c}}$. If $c$ is proportional to area, then doubling the area doubles $c$ ($c_{new} = 2c_{old}$). The new terminal velocity is $v_{T,new} = \\sqrt{\\frac{mg}{2c_{old}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{mg}{c_{old}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} v_{T,old}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which differential equation describes a mass $m$ being launched horizontally with initial velocity $v_0$ on a surface with no friction but significant air resistance $F_D = -bv$?",
        "options": [
          "$m\\frac{dv}{dt} = mg - bv$",
          "$m\\frac{dv}{dt} = -bv$",
          "$m\\frac{dv}{dt} = bv$",
          "$m\\frac{dv}{dt} = -bv^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since the launch is horizontal, gravity acts vertically and does not affect the horizontal motion. The only horizontal force is the drag force $F_D = -bv$ (opposing velocity). Therefore, Newton's Second Law in the horizontal direction is $m\\frac{dv}{dt} = -bv$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the object in Question 4, what is the velocity $v(t)$ of the object?",
        "options": [
          "$v(t) = v_0 - \\frac{b}{m}t$",
          "$v(t) = v_0 e^{-(b/m)t}$",
          "$v(t) = v_0 \\ln(t)$",
          "$v(t) = v_0 e^{-(m/b)t}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The differential equation is $\\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{b}{m}v$. This is separable: $\\frac{dv}{v} = -\\frac{b}{m} dt$. Integrate: $\\int_{v_0}^{v} \\frac{dv'}{v'} = -\\frac{b}{m} \\int_0^t dt' \\Rightarrow \\ln\\left(\\frac{v}{v_0}\\right) = -\\frac{b}{m}t$. Therefore, $v(t) = v_0 e^{-(b/m)t}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At $t = 0$, an object is dropped from rest in a resistive medium. At what time $t$ will the object reach approximately $63\\%$ of its terminal velocity? (Assume $F_D = -bv$)",
        "options": [
          "$m/b$",
          "$b/m$",
          "$mg/b$",
          "$\\ln(2) \\cdot m/b$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For linear drag, $v(t) = v_T (1 - e^{-(b/m)t})$, where $v_T = mg/b$. The fraction of terminal velocity is $v(t)/v_T = 1 - e^{-(b/m)t}$. Setting this equal to $0.63$: $1 - e^{-(b/m)t} = 0.63 \\Rightarrow e^{-(b/m)t} = 0.37 \\approx 1/e$. Therefore, $-(b/m)t = -1 \\Rightarrow t = m/b$. This is the characteristic time constant $\\tau$ of the system."

          "$mgh$",
          "$0$",
          "$-mgh$",
          "$-1/2 m v_T^2$"
        ],
        "explanation": "At terminal velocity, the drag force $F_D$ is equal and opposite to the weight: $F_D = -mg$ (since downward is positive). Work done by a constant force is $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{d}$. Over a downward displacement $h$, the work done by drag is $W_D = (-mg) \\cdot (+h) = -mgh$.",

        "options": [
          "Half that of Object 1.",
          "Equal to Object 1.",
          "Twice that of Object 1.",
          "Four times that of Object 1."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For linear drag, $v_T = \\frac{mg}{b}$. Since $m$ and $b$ (same shape) are identical, $v_T \\propto g$. Therefore, if gravity doubles ($g_2 = 2g_1$), the terminal velocity also doubles: $v_{T,2} = 2 v_{T,1}$."

        "options": [
          "Finite and equal to $mv_0/c$.",
          "Infinite, as the velocity approaches zero asymptotically.",
          "Finite and equal to $\\frac{m}{c} \\ln(v_0)$.",
          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Use $a = v \\frac{dv}{dx}$: $m v \\frac{dv}{dx} = -c v^2 \\Rightarrow \\frac{dv}{dx} = -\\frac{c}{m}v$. This gives $\\frac{dv}{v} = -\\frac{c}{m} dx$. Integrating from $v_0$ to $v$: $\\ln(v/v_0) = -\\frac{c}{m} x \\Rightarrow v(x) = v_0 e^{-(c/m)x}$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $v \\to 0$ asymptotically. Theoretically, it takes an infinite distance to come to a complete stop."

          "$\\frac{mg \\tan\\theta}{k}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The component of gravity down the incline is $mg \\sin\\theta$. The friction force opposes motion: $f = kv$. At terminal velocity, these forces balance: $mg \\sin\\theta = k v_T \\Rightarrow v_T = \\frac{mg \\sin\\theta}{k}$."
