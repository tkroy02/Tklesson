        "question": "A rocket of initial mass $M_0$ is in deep space. It burns fuel at a constant rate $R = -dm/dt$ with an exhaust velocity $u$ relative to the rocket. According to the rocket equation, the change in velocity $\\Delta v$ after the mass has decreased to $M_f$ is:",
        "options": [
          "$u \\ln(M_0 / M_f)$",
          "$u (M_0 / M_f)$",
          "$R u / M_f$",
          "$u \\ln(M_f / M_0)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From Newton’s second law for variable mass: $m\\frac{dv}{dt} = -u\\frac{dm}{dt}$ (with $F_{ext}=0$). Separating variables: $dv = -u\\frac{dm}{m}$. Integrating from $v_0$ to $v_f$ and $M_0$ to $M_f$: $v_f - v_0 = -u \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_f}{M_0}\\right) = u \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_0}{M_f}\\right)$."

        "question": "In the Center‑of‑Mass frame of a two‑body system, the two particles always move:",
        "options": [
          "In the same direction.",
          "With the same speed.",
          "In exactly opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.",
          "Perpendicular to each other."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By definition, the total momentum in the center‑of‑mass frame is zero: $\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = 0$. Therefore $\\vec{p}_2 = -\\vec{p}_1$. Their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Their speeds may differ if the masses are different."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Soft' collision is one where the force of impact is modeled as $F(t) = F_0 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi t}{T})$ for $0 < t < T$. What is the total impulse delivered?",
        "options": [
          "$F_0 T$",
          "$F_0 T / 2$",
          "$2 F_0 T / \\pi$",
          "$F_0 T / \\pi$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Impulse: $J = \\int_0^T F_0 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{T}\\right) dt$. Use $\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$. Then $J = \\frac{F_0}{2} \\int_0^T \\left(1-\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right) dt = \\frac{F_0}{2} \\left[ t - \\frac{T}{2\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right) \\right]_0^T = \\frac{F_0}{2} \\left( T - 0 \\right) = \\frac{F_0 T}{2}$."

        "question": "A particle of mass $m$ with velocity $v \\hat{i}$ collides with a stationary mass $M$. In the Center‑of‑Mass frame, the velocity of the mass $m$ before the collision is:",
        "options": [
          "$v$",
          "$v\\left(\\frac{M}{m+M}\\right)$",
          "$v\\left(\\frac{m}{m+M}\\right)$",
          "$0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The CoM velocity is $v_{cm} = \\frac{mv}{m+M}$. In the CoM frame, the velocity of $m$ is $v' = v - v_{cm} = v - \\frac{mv}{m+M} = \\frac{(m+M)v - mv}{m+M} = \\frac{Mv}{m+M}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A flexible heavy chain of length $L$ and linear density $\\lambda$ is held so that its lower end just touches a scale. It is released from rest. As a length $x$ has fallen onto the scale, the force reading on the scale is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\lambda x g$",
          "$2\\lambda x g$",
          "$3\\lambda x g$",
          "$\\lambda L g$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Two contributions: (1) Weight of the chain already on the scale: $F_{weight} = \\lambda x g$. (2) Impulsive force due to momentum transfer of falling links: $F_{impulse} = \\frac{dp}{dt} = v\\frac{dm}{dt}$. For free‑fall, $v = \\sqrt{2gx}$ and $\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\lambda v$. So $F_{impulse} = \\lambda v^2 = \\lambda(2gx) = 2\\lambda x g$. Total force = $3\\lambda x g$."

        "question": "If a 2D collision is elastic, the magnitude of the velocity of each particle in the Center‑of‑Mass frame:",
        "options": [
          "Increases.",
          "Decreases.",
          "Remains unchanged.",
          "Is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the CoM frame, total momentum is zero, so $\\vec{p}_1 = -\\vec{p}_2$. Elasticity means kinetic energy is conserved. The only way both momentum and kinetic energy can be conserved is if each particle’s speed (magnitude of velocity) remains the same before and after the collision. Their directions change."

        "options": [
          "$\\vec{A} / b$",
          "$\\vec{A} b$",
          "$0$",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Impulse $\\vec{J} = \\int_0^\\infty \\vec{A}e^{-bt} dt = \\vec{A} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{b}e^{-bt} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\vec{A}\\left(0 - (-\\frac{1}{b})\\right) = \\frac{\\vec{A}}{b}$."

        "question": "For a variable mass system where $m(t)$ is decreasing, the term $v_{rel} \\frac{dm}{dt}$ in the equation of motion is called:",
        "options": [
          "Inertial Force",
          "Thrust",
          "Centripetal Force",
          "Drag"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The term $v_{rel} \\frac{dm}{dt}$ is the thrust force exerted on the system by the expelled mass. If $v_{rel}$ is opposite to the direction of motion, thrust adds to the acceleration; if in the same direction, it acts as a drag."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A coefficient of restitution $e=0.5$ for a 1D collision implies that:",
        "options": [
          "Half of the momentum is lost.",
          "Half of the initial kinetic energy is lost.",
          "The relative velocity of separation is half the relative velocity of approach.",
          "The masses are equal."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The coefficient of restitution is defined as $e = \\frac{|v_{2f} - v_{1f}|}{|v_{1i} - v_{2i}|}$ (relative speed after / relative speed before). $e=0.5$ means the separation speed is half the approach speed. Momentum is always conserved if there are no external forces; kinetic energy loss depends on both $e$ and the masses."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $1 \\text{ kg}$ object moving at $10 \\text{ m/s}$ collides with a $1 \\text{ kg}$ object at rest. If the collision is perfectly inelastic, the kinetic energy of the system in the Center‑of‑Mass frame after the collision is:",
        "options": [
          "$25 \\text{ J}$",
          "$50 \\text{ J}$",
          "$12.5 \\text{ J}$",
          "$0 \\text{ J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In a perfectly inelastic collision, the two objects stick together. In the CoM frame, the combined object moves with the CoM velocity, which is zero in that frame (since total momentum is zero). Therefore the final kinetic energy in the CoM frame is exactly zero."
