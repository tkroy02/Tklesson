      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2\\text{ kg}$ object moving at $4\\text{ m/s}$ to the right collides with a $3\\text{ kg}$ object moving at $1\\text{ m/s}$ to the left. What is the velocity of the center of mass of the two‑object system?",
        "options": [
          "$1.0\\text{ m/s}$ right",
          "$1.5\\text{ m/s}$ right",
          "$2.5\\text{ m/s}$ right",
          "$1.0\\text{ m/s}$ left"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Define right as positive. Then $v_1 = +4$ m/s, $v_2 = -1$ m/s. $v_{cm} = \\frac{m_1v_1 + m_2v_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \\frac{(2)(4) + (3)(-1)}{2+3} = \\frac{8 - 3}{5} = 1$ m/s. Positive means to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile is launched and explodes into several fragments while in mid‑air. Ignoring air resistance, the center of mass of the fragments will:",
        "options": [
          "Fall straight down from the point of explosion.",
          "Continue along the original parabolic path.",
          "Move in the direction of the largest fragment.",
          "Stop moving horizontally."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The explosion forces are internal; the only external force is gravity. Therefore $\\vec{F}_{ext} = M\\vec{g}$, so $\\vec{a}_{cm} = \\vec{g}$. Since $\\vec{a}_{cm}$ is unchanged from before the explosion, the center of mass continues on the same parabolic trajectory it would have followed without the explosion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $60\\text{ kg}$ man stands at the rear of a $40\\text{ kg}$ boat of length $4\\text{ m}$ that is at rest in still water. If the man walks to the front of the boat, the center of mass of the man‑boat system:",
        "options": [
          "Moves $2.4\\text{ m}$ forward.",
          "Moves $1.6\\text{ m}$ forward.",
          "Remains at the same location relative to the shore.",
          "Moves $4.0\\text{ m}$ forward."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Neglecting water resistance, there is no external horizontal force on the system. Therefore, the horizontal acceleration of the center of mass is zero. If it started at rest relative to the shore, its horizontal position relative to the shore cannot change. The man and boat move relative to each other, but the system's center of mass stays fixed horizontally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two masses, $m_1 = 2\\text{ kg}$ and $m_2 = 8\\text{ kg}$, are connected by a compressed spring and released on a frictionless surface. If $m_1$ accelerates at $12\\text{ m/s}^2$ to the left, what is the acceleration of the center of mass?",
        "options": [
          "$0\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "$3\\text{ m/s}^2$ right",
          "$2.4\\text{ m/s}^2$ left",
          "$9.6\\text{ m/s}^2$ right"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The spring force is internal. With no external horizontal forces, $\\sum F_{ext} = 0$, so $\\vec{a}_{cm} = 0$. The individual masses accelerate in opposite directions, but the center of mass (the balance point) does not accelerate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system's total momentum changes from $20\\text{ kg}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{m/s}$ to $50\\text{ kg}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{m/s}$ over $3$ seconds. What was the net external force on the system?",
        "options": [
          "$10\\text{ N}$",
          "$30\\text{ N}$",
          "$70\\text{ N}$",
          "$150\\text{ N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By Newton’s second law for systems: $\\vec{F}_{ext} = \\frac{d\\vec{P}}{dt}$. Over the interval, $\\Delta \\vec{P} = 50 - 20 = 30$ kg·m/s, $\\Delta t = 3$ s, so the average external force magnitude is $\\frac{30}{3} = 10$ N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system of particles is acted upon by a net external force $\\vec{F}$, the velocity of the center of mass $\\vec{v}_{cm}$ will:",
        "options": [
          "Always be in the direction of $\\vec{F}$.",
          "Change in the direction of $\\vec{F}$.",
          "Remain constant.",
          "Be perpendicular to $\\vec{F}$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $\\vec{F}_{ext} = M\\vec{a}_{cm}$, the acceleration of the center of mass is in the direction of the net external force. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, so $\\vec{v}_{cm}$ changes in the direction of $\\vec{F}$. The velocity itself may not initially be aligned with the force."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $4\\text{ kg}$ block is at rest on a frictionless table. A $1\\text{ kg}$ ball is thrown at $10\\text{ m/s}$ and sticks to the block. The velocity of the center of mass after the collision is:",
        "options": [
          "$2\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$2.5\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$10\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$0\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "No external horizontal forces act, so the horizontal component of $\\vec{v}_{cm}$ is constant. Before the collision: $v_{cm} = \\frac{(1)(10) + (4)(0)}{1+4} = 2$ m/s. After the perfectly inelastic collision, the combined object moves at $2$ m/s, which is exactly $v_{cm}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object of mass $M$ is moving with velocity $v_{cm}$. If internal parts of the object begin to move toward each other, $v_{cm}$ will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase.",
          "Decrease.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Decrease if the object is accelerating."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Internal forces cannot change the total momentum of the system. Since $\\vec{P} = M\\vec{v}_{cm}$, the center‑of‑mass velocity is unaffected by purely internal motions."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a system of two stars in a binary orbit with no other masses nearby, the center of mass of the two stars:",
        "options": [
          "Orbits one of the stars.",
          "Moves in a straight line at constant velocity (or remains at rest).",
          "Accelerates due to the gravity between the stars.",
          "Oscillates back and forth."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The gravitational attraction between the stars is an internal force. With no external forces on the two‑star system, the center of mass experiences zero acceleration. Therefore it moves with constant velocity (or stays at rest if initially at rest)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ is rotating about its center while the center itself moves at $v$. The total linear momentum of the rod is:",
        "options": [
          "$Mv$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}Mv^2$",
          "$Mv + I\\omega$",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total linear momentum of any system is $\\vec{P} = M\\vec{v}_{cm}$, regardless of any internal motion (rotation, vibration, etc.). Here $\\vec{v}_{cm} = v$, so $\\vec{P} = Mv$."

        "70": "Strong analytical skills. Review: distinguishing internal from external forces, using $\\vec{F}_{ext} = M\\vec{a}_{cm}$ to determine COM acceleration, and remembering that $\\vec{P} = M\\vec{v}_{cm}$ always.",
        "50": "Good conceptual grasp. Focus on: computing $v_{cm}$ from $\\frac{\\sum m_i v_i}{\\sum m_i}$, recognizing that COM follows original path during an explosion, and that internal movements (like walking on a boat) shift parts but not the system’s COM horizontally if $F_{ext}=0$.",
