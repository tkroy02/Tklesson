        "question": "A system follows the equation $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -16x$. What is the period $T$ of the oscillation?",
        "options": [
          "$4\\pi$",
          "$4$",
          "$\\pi/2$",
          "$1/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The standard SHM equation is $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2x$. Comparing with the given equation, we have $\\omega^2 = 16$, so $\\omega = 4\\text{ rad/s}$. The period is $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = \\frac{2\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$."

        "question": "Which of the following functions is NOT a valid solution to the SHM differential equation $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2x$?",
        "options": [
          "$x(t) = A\\sin(\\omega t)$",
          "$x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$",
          "$x(t) = Ae^{-\\omega t}$",
          "$x(t) = B\\sin(\\omega t) + C\\cos(\\omega t)$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For SHM, the second derivative must equal $-\\omega^2$ times the original function. $A\\sin(\\omega t)$, $A\\cos(\\omega t)$, and their linear combinations all satisfy this. However, for $x(t) = Ae^{-\\omega t}$, $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \\omega^2 Ae^{-\\omega t} = +\\omega^2 x$, not $-\\omega^2 x$. This is exponential decay, not oscillatory motion."

          "$\\pi$",
          "$-\\pi/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Setting $t=0$ gives $x(0) = A\\cos(\\phi)$. For this to equal $A$, we need $\\cos(\\phi) = 1$, which occurs when $\\phi = 0$ (or any integer multiple of $2\\pi$)."

          "$A\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time. Using the chain rule: $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}[A\\cos(\\omega t)] = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)$."

          "$10\\text{ rad/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a mass‑spring system, $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50\\text{ N/m}}{2\\text{ kg}}} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\text{ rad/s}$."

          "$3\\text{ m}$",
          "$36\\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The form $a = -\\omega^2 x$ indicates SHM with $\\omega^2 = 9$, so $\\omega = 3\\text{ rad/s}$. At the equilibrium position ($x=0$), the velocity is maximum: $v_{max} = A\\omega$. Given $v_{max} = 12\\text{ m/s}$, we have $12 = A(3)$, so $A = 4\\text{ m}$."

          "$k/m$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is $a(t) = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -A\\omega^2\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$. The magnitude of the maximum acceleration occurs when $|\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)| = 1$, giving $a_{max} = A\\omega^2$."

          "$T$ increases.",
          "$T$ decreases.",
          "$T$ stays the same.",
          "$T$ becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The differential equation for a horizontal mass‑spring system is $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\frac{k}{m}x = 0$, which contains no gravity term. Thus, $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$ and $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k}$ are independent of $g$. (For a vertical spring, gravity affects the equilibrium position but not the period.)"

          "$I/MgD$",
          "$D/g$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The standard form for SHM is $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2\\theta$. Directly comparing with $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} = -\\frac{MgD}{I}\\theta$ gives $\\omega^2 = \\frac{MgD}{I}$. This is the angular frequency squared for a physical pendulum, where $M$ is the mass, $g$ is gravity, $D$ is the distance from pivot to center of mass, and $I$ is the moment of inertia about the pivot."

          "$-5\\sin(\\pi/4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, find the velocity function: $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}[5\\cos(2t + \\pi/4)] = -5 \\cdot 2 \\sin(2t + \\pi/4) = -10\\sin(2t + \\pi/4)$. Then evaluate at $t=0$: $v(0) = -10\\sin(\\pi/4)$."
