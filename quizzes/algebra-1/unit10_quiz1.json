      {
  "type": "multiple_response",
  "question": "What is a polynomial?",
  "options": [
    "An expression with one or more terms",
    "An expression with whole number exponents",
    "Any algebraic expression with variables",
    "An expression with no negative exponents",
    "Can include division by a variable"
  ],
  "answer": ["A", "B", "D"],
  "explanation": "A polynomial has: 1) One or more terms, 2) Variables with whole number (non-negative integer) exponents only, 3) No division by a variable, 4) Operations limited to addition, subtraction, and multiplication."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many terms does the polynomial $3x^2 - 5x + 7$ have?",
        "options": [
          "3 terms",
          "2 terms",
          "4 terms",
          "1 term"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The polynomial has three terms: $3x^2$, $-5x$, and $+7$. Terms are separated by addition or subtraction signs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the degree of the term $4x^3y^2$?",

          "Degree 5",
          "Degree 3",
          "Degree 2",
          "Degree 6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of its variables. For $4x^3y^2$, the exponents are 3 and 2, so degree = 3 + 2 = 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of polynomial is $2x - 5$?",
        "options": [
          "Binomial",
          "Monomial",
          "Trinomial",
          "Constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A binomial has exactly two terms. $2x - 5$ has two terms: $2x$ and $-5$."

          "Degree 3",
          "Degree 2",
          "Degree 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree among its terms. The terms have degrees: $x^4$ (degree 4), $-3x^2$ (degree 2), $2x$ (degree 1), and $-1$ (degree 0). The highest is 4."

          "$4x^3 + 7$",
          "$2x - 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sqrt{x} + 3$ is not a polynomial because $\\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$ has a fractional exponent. Polynomials require non-negative integer exponents only."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the constant term in the polynomial $3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7$?",

          "$-2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The constant term is the term without any variables. In $3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7$, the constant term is $-7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the leading coefficient of $2x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 4$?",

          "$-4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the term with the highest degree. The highest degree term is $2x^3$, so the leading coefficient is 2."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which polynomial is in standard form?",
        "options": [

          "$-1 + 5x - 2x^2 + 4x^3$",
          "$5x - 1 + 4x^3 - 2x^2$",
          "All are in standard form"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard form arranges terms in descending order by degree. Only $4x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1$ has terms arranged from highest degree (3) to lowest degree (0)."
      },
