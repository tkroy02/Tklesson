    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expression 5³, what does the 3 represent?",
        "options": [
          "The base",
          "The exponent",
          "The coefficient",
          "The power"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In 5³, 5 is the base and 3 is the exponent. The exponent tells how many times to multiply the base by itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 2⁴ equal to?",
        "options": [
          "8",
          "16",
          "6",
          "24"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "2⁴ = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16. The exponent 4 means multiply 2 by itself 4 times."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would you write 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 using exponents?",
        "options": [
          "3⁵",
          "5³",
          "15³",
          "3¹⁵"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "3 multiplied by itself 5 times is written as 3⁵. The base is 3, the exponent is 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of 10²?",

          "20",
          "100",
          "12",
          "102"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "10² = 10 × 10 = 100. Any number squared is that number multiplied by itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expression x⁵, how many times is x used as a factor?",
        "options": [
          "2 times",
          "3 times",
          "5 times",
          "It depends on x"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "x⁵ means x × x × x × x × x. The exponent 5 indicates x is used as a factor 5 times."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 7¹ equal to?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "7",
          "70"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Any number raised to the first power equals itself. 7¹ = 7, x¹ = x, etc."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you read 4³?",
        "options": [
          "Four times three",
          "Four to the third power",
          "Four cubed",
          "Both B and C"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "4³ can be read as 'four to the third power' or 'four cubed.' Exponents of 2 are 'squared', exponents of 3 are 'cubed.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 5 × 5 × 5 written in exponential form?",
        "options": [
          "3⁵",
          "5³",
          "15",
          "125"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "5 appears as a factor 3 times, so it's 5³. The result is 125, but the question asks for the exponential form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a² = 25, what could 'a' equal?",
        "options": [
          "5 only",
          "-5 only",
          "5 or -5",
          "12.5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both 5² = 25 and (-5)² = 25. When squaring a negative number, the result is positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The area of a square with side length s is s². What is the area of a square with side length 6?",
        "options": [
          "12",
          "24",
          "30",
          "36"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Area = s² = 6² = 6 × 6 = 36. This shows a real-world application of exponents in geometry."

        "70": "Good work! You grasp basic exponents but review squared vs. cubed and negative bases.",
        "50": "A fair attempt. Focus on: 1) Base × base × base... (exponent tells how many times), 2) Any number¹ = itself, 3) Squared = exponent 2, cubed = exponent 3.",
        "0": "Keep practicing! Remember: Exponent tells how many times to multiply the base by itself. 5³ = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125."
