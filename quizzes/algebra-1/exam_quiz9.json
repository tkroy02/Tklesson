        "options": [
          "$\\frac{x + 3}{x + 4}$",

          "$\\frac{x + 2}{x - 4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Factor numerator: $x^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2)$. Factor denominator: $x^2 - 2x - 8 = (x - 4)(x + 2)$. Cancel $(x + 2)$ (for $x \\neq -2$) to get $\\frac{x - 3}{x - 4}$."

    "$4(8 + 3) = (4 \\times 8) + (4 \\times 3)$",
    "$7 + 0 = 7$"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The Distributive Property states that multiplying a number by a sum yields the same result as multiplying the number by each addend and adding the products: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$. Option A shows the Associative Property, option B shows the Commutative Property, and option D shows the Identity Property of Addition."

          "$5r + 1.25 \\leq 60$",

          "$5r + 1.25 \\geq 60$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total cost = entry fee + cost per ride × number of rides: $5 + 1.25r$. This must be less than or equal to \\$60, so $1.25r + 5 \\leq 60$."
