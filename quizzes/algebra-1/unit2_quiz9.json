      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the ratio of 12 to 18 in simplest form?",
        "options": ["2:3", "3:2", "4:6", "6:9"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "12:18 = (12÷6):(18÷6) = 2:3. Divide both parts by their greatest common factor (6)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels 240 miles in 4 hours. What is its average speed?",
        "options": ["60 mph", "40 mph", "80 mph", "960 mph"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate = distance ÷ time = 240 miles ÷ 4 hours = 60 miles per hour."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is a unit rate?",
        "options": ["$3.50 per pound", "2 apples for $1", "3:5 ratio", "4 cups to 2 quarts"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A unit rate has a denominator of 1. '$3.50 per pound' means $3.50 for 1 pound."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 5 pencils cost $1.25, what is the unit price per pencil?",
        "options": ["$0.25", "$0.20", "$0.30", "$0.15"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unit price = total cost ÷ quantity = $1.25 ÷ 5 = $0.25 per pencil."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A recipe uses flour and sugar in a 3:2 ratio. For 15 cups of flour, how much sugar is needed?",
        "options": ["10 cups", "9 cups", "12 cups", "8 cups"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Flour:Sugar = 3:2. Set up proportion: 3/2 = 15/x. Cross multiply: 3x = 30 → x = 10 cups of sugar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which rate is fastest?",
        "options": ["60 miles in 1 hour", "100 miles in 2 hours", "150 miles in 3 hours", "200 miles in 4 hours"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Find unit rates: A=60 mph, B=50 mph, C=50 mph, D=50 mph. 60 mph is fastest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A printer prints 24 pages in 3 minutes. What is its rate in pages per minute?",
        "options": ["8 ppm", "6 ppm", "12 ppm", "9 ppm"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate = pages ÷ minutes = 24 ÷ 3 = 8 pages per minute."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 4:5 and there are 12 boys, how many girls are there?",
        "options": ["15", "16", "18", "20"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Boys:Girls = 4:5. Set up: 4/5 = 12/g. Cross multiply: 4g = 60 → g = 15 girls."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which shows equivalent ratios?",
        "options": ["3:4 and 9:12", "2:5 and 4:8", "1:3 and 2:6", "Both A and C"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A: 3×3=9, 4×3=12 ✓. B: 2×2=4, 5×2=10 (not 8) ✗. C: 1×2=2, 3×2=6 ✓. So both A and C are equivalent."

        "options": ["$15/hour", "$12/hour", "$18/hour", "$20/hour"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hourly wage = total earnings ÷ hours = $180 ÷ 12 = $15 per hour."
