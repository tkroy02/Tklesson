    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the ratio of x to y is 2:3 and x = 12, what is y?",
        "options": ["18", "8", "24", "9"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set up proportion: x/y = 2/3 → 12/y = 2/3. Cross multiply: 2y = 36 → y = 18."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels at 60 miles per hour. What is its speed in feet per second? (1 mile = 5280 ft)",
        "options": ["88 ft/sec", "60 ft/sec", "44 ft/sec", "176 ft/sec"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convert: 60 miles/hour × (5280 ft/1 mile) × (1 hour/3600 sec) = (60×5280)/3600 = 316800/3600 = 88 ft/sec."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The ratio of two numbers is 3:5. Their sum is 64. What is the larger number?",
        "options": ["40", "24", "32", "48"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let the numbers be 3x and 5x. Equation: 3x + 5x = 64 → 8x = 64 → x = 8. Larger number = 5×8 = 40."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Apples cost $0.50/lb. Oranges cost $2.00/kg. Which is cheaper? (1 kg = 2.2 lbs)",
        "options": ["Apples", "Oranges", "Same price", "Not enough info"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convert oranges to $/lb: $2.00/kg ÷ 2.2 lb/kg ≈ $0.91/lb. Compare: Apples $0.50/lb < Oranges $0.91/lb."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for k: (x+3)/5 = (2x-1)/3. What is the value of x?",
        "options": ["14", "7", "-4", "2"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cross multiply: 3(x+3) = 5(2x-1) → 3x+9 = 10x-5 → 9+5 = 10x-3x → 14 = 7x → x = 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A printer prints pages at a rate of (3t+6) pages in (t+2) minutes. What is its unit rate in pages/minute?",
        "options": ["3 pages/min", "(3t+6)/(t+2) pages/min", "2 pages/min", "6 pages/min"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate = (3t+6)/(t+2). Factor numerator: 3(t+2)/(t+2) = 3 (for t≠-2). Unit rate = 3 pages/minute."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The ratio of a to b is 4:7. If a + b = 55, what is b - a?",
        "options": ["15", "20", "25", "30"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let a=4x, b=7x. Sum: 4x+7x=55 → 11x=55 → x=5. So a=20, b=35. Difference: b-a = 35-20 = 15."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the value of k that makes the ratios 3:7 and 12:(k+5) equivalent.",
        "options": ["23", "19", "17", "28"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set up proportion: 3/7 = 12/(k+5). Cross multiply: 3(k+5) = 84 → 3k+15=84 → 3k=69 → k=23."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels (2d+10) miles in (d+5) hours. What is its average speed?",
        "options": ["2 mph", "(2d+10)/(d+5) mph", "5 mph", "10 mph"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Speed = distance/time = (2d+10)/(d+5). Factor: 2(d+5)/(d+5) = 2 mph (for d≠-5)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 4:5. If there are 6 more girls than boys, how many students total?",
        "options": ["54", "45", "36", "27"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let boys=4x, girls=5x. Difference: 5x-4x=x=6. So boys=24, girls=30. Total = 24+30=54 students."
