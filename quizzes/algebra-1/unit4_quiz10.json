    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What must be true about the slopes of two parallel lines?",
        "options": [
          "They are equal",
          "They are negative reciprocals",
          "They multiply to $-1$",
          "They have opposite signs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel lines have the same slope. If $m_1 = m_2$, the lines are parallel (or coincident if same intercept too)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which line is parallel to $y = 3x - 2$?",
        "options": [
          "$y = 3x + 5$",
          "$y = -3x + 5$",
          "$y = \\frac{1}{3}x - 2$",
          "$y = -\\frac{1}{3}x + 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel lines have equal slopes. $y = 3x - 2$ has slope $3$. $y = 3x + 5$ also has slope $3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Are the lines $2x + 3y = 6$ and $4x + 6y = 12$ parallel?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, they are parallel (and actually the same line)",
          "Yes, they are parallel but different lines",
          "No, they intersect",
          "No, they are perpendicular"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Convert to slope-intercept: First: $3y = -2x + 6 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2$. Second: $6y = -4x + 12 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2$. Same slope AND intercept = same line."

        "options": ["Graph A", "Graph B", "Graph C", "Graph D"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Graph A shows two lines with the same steepness (slope) that never intersect = parallel."

          "$\\frac{1}{2}$",
          "$-\\frac{1}{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For parallel lines, slopes must be equal. $y = 2x - 1$ has slope $2$, so $k = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Are vertical lines $x = 3$ and $x = -5$ parallel?",

          "Yes",
          "No",
          "Only if they have same x-intercept",
          "Vertical lines cannot be parallel"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All vertical lines have undefined slope. Since they have the same undefined slope, they are parallel."

          "$y = 4$ and $y = x + 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only the first pair has equal slopes ($\\frac{2}{3}$)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is true about parallel lines in the coordinate plane?",
        "options": [
          "They never intersect",
          "They intersect at exactly one point",
          "They intersect at two points",
          "They are always horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, parallel lines in a plane do not intersect (unless they are the same line)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Line A passes through $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 8)$. Line B passes through $(0, 1)$ and $(2, 7)$. Are they parallel?",

          "Yes",
          "No",
          "They are perpendicular",
          "They are the same line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Line A slope: $\\frac{8-2}{3-1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$. Line B slope: $\\frac{7-1}{2-0} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$. Equal slopes = parallel."
      },

          "$y = x$ and $y = -x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal lines have equations $y = constant$. $y = 3$ and $y = -2$ are horizontal lines with slope 0, so they are parallel."
