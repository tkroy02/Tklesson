    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of system has exactly one solution?",
        "options": [
          "Consistent and independent",
          "Inconsistent and independent",
          "Consistent and parallel",
          "Inconsistent and dependent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Consistent = has at least one solution. Independent = exactly one unique solution. So 'consistent and independent' means one solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of system has no solution?",

          "Consistent",
          "Dependent",
          "Independent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inconsistent systems have no solution (parallel lines that never intersect)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of system has infinitely many solutions?",
        "options": [
          "Consistent and dependent",
          "Consistent and independent",
          "Inconsistent and dependent",
          "Parallel"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dependent systems have infinitely many solutions (same line graphed twice). They are still 'consistent' (have solutions)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Classify: $y = 3x - 2$ and $y = 3x + 4$",

          "Inconsistent",
          "Consistent and independent",
          "Consistent and dependent",
          "Perpendicular"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both have slope 3 but different y-intercepts (-2 vs 4), so parallel lines = no solution = inconsistent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Classify: $2x - y = 5$ and $4x - 2y = 10$",

          "Consistent and dependent",
          "Consistent and independent",

          "Parallel"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Second equation is exactly twice the first (same line). Same line = infinite solutions = dependent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Classify: $x + y = 7$ and $2x - y = 5$",

          "Inconsistent and dependent",
          "Consistent and dependent",
          "Parallel"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Different slopes (slopes are -1 and 2), so they intersect at exactly one point = consistent and independent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Classify: $3x + 2y = 6$ and $6x + 4y = 18$",

          "Inconsistent",
          "Consistent and independent",
          "Consistent and dependent",
          "Perpendicular"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Second equation would be $6x+4y=12$ if dependent (2× first). But it's 18, so same slope but different intercepts = parallel = inconsistent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does it mean if two lines are perpendicular?",
        "options": [
          "They intersect at right angles",
          "They never intersect",
          "They are the same line",
          "They intersect at exactly one point but not at right angles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perpendicular lines intersect at 90° angles. Their slopes multiply to -1 (negative reciprocals)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Classify: $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 3$ and $y = 2x - 1$",

          "Inconsistent",
          "Consistent and dependent",
          "Parallel"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slopes are -1/2 and 2. They are negative reciprocals (-1/2 × 2 = -1), so perpendicular = intersect at one point = consistent and independent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Classify: $4x - 2y = 8$ and $-2x + y = -4$",

          "Consistent and independent",
          "Inconsistent",
          "Perpendicular"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply second equation by -2: $4x - 2y = 8$, which is identical to first equation. Same line = dependent."
