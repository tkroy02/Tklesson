        "options": [
          "A line that minimizes the distance from all data points",
          "A line that passes through every data point",
          "A line that connects the first and last data points",
          "A line that is always horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A line of best fit (or trend line) is a straight line that best represents the data on a scatter plot by minimizing the sum of squared distances from points to the line."

          "Approximately 9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From the graph, best-fit line appears to pass near (0,1) and (8,13). Slope ≈ 12/8 = 1.5. Equation: y ≈ 1.5x + 1. When x=5: y ≈ 1.5(5)+1 = 8.5."

          "Number of data points"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The slope represents the average rate of change: how much y changes for each unit increase in x. In context, it shows the relationship strength and direction."

          "Perfect correlation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Points show upward trend: as x increases, y generally increases. This indicates positive correlation."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Graph shows downward trend (negative slope). y-intercept appears around 10, slope negative. $y \\approx -0.8x + 10$ fits this pattern."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a best-fit line has equation y = 2.3x + 1.7, what does the y-intercept 1.7 represent?",

          "Correlation coefficient"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The y-intercept (1.7) represents the predicted value of y when x = 0, based on the trend in the data."

          "It is the same as connecting all dots"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A best-fit line minimizes overall error; it often doesn't pass through any specific data point but represents the overall trend."
