    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following equations represents exponential decay?",
        "options": [
          "$y = 150(0.85)^x$",
          "$y = 200(1.12)^x$",
          "$y = 75(1.05)^x$",
          "$y = 300(2.00)^x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exponential decay occurs when the base (growth factor) is between 0 and 1. $0.85$ is between 0 and 1, so $y = 150(0.85)^x$ represents decay. All other options have bases greater than 1, representing exponential growth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population of bacteria starts with 500 cells and doubles every 3 hours. Which equation models the population after $t$ hours?",
        "options": [
          "$P(t) = 500(2)^{t/3}$",
          "$P(t) = 500(2)^{3t}$",
          "$P(t) = 500(3)^{t/2}$",
          "$P(t) = 500(1/2)^{t/3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial amount: 500. Doubling means base is 2. Doubling time is 3 hours, so exponent should be $t/3$ (when $t=3$, we get $2^{1}=2$, representing one doubling). So $P(t) = 500(2)^{t/3}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The value of a car depreciates by 15% each year. If the car was originally worth \\$24,000, what will it be worth after 5 years?",
        "options": [
          "Approximately \\$10,650",
          "Approximately \\$12,800",
          "Approximately \\$9,200",
          "Approximately \\$14,500"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Annual depreciation of 15% means it retains 85% of its value each year. So decay factor = 0.85. Value after 5 years: $24,000(0.85)^5 \\approx 24,000(0.4437) \\approx \\$10,650$."

        "question": "Which graph represents the function $y = 3(2)^x - 1$?",
        "options": [
          "Exponential curve starting at (0,2), increasing rapidly, with horizontal asymptote at y = -1",
          "Exponential curve starting at (0,3), increasing rapidly, with horizontal asymptote at y = 0",
          "Exponential curve starting at (0,2), decreasing rapidly, with horizontal asymptote at y = -1",
          "Exponential curve starting at (0,3), decreasing rapidly, with horizontal asymptote at y = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $x=0$, $y = 3(2)^0 - 1 = 3(1) - 1 = 2$, so graph passes through (0,2). Base 2 > 1 means exponential growth. The $-1$ shifts the entire graph down 1 unit, so horizontal asymptote is $y = -1$ instead of $y=0$."

        "question": "A radioactive substance decays at a rate of 7% per hour. If you start with 800 grams, how much will remain after 10 hours?",

          "Approximately 377 grams",
          "Approximately 425 grams",
          "Approximately 350 grams",
          "Approximately 390 grams"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decay rate of 7% means retention rate of 93% per hour. Decay factor = 0.93. Amount after 10 hours: $800(0.93)^{10} \\approx 800(0.478) \\approx 382.4$ grams. Closest to 377 grams."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which function has the greatest average rate of change on the interval [0, 2]?",
        "options": [
          "$f(x) = 2(3)^x$",
          "$f(x) = 10(1.5)^x$",
          "$f(x) = 50(1.1)^x$",
          "$f(x) = 100(1.05)^x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average rate of change = $\\frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0}$. Calculate: A) $\\frac{2(9)-2(1)}{2} = \\frac{18-2}{2} = 8$. B) $\\frac{10(2.25)-10}{2} = 6.25$. C) $\\frac{50(1.21)-50}{2} = 5.25$. D) $\\frac{100(1.1025)-100}{2} = 5.125$. Largest is 8 for option A."

        "question": "A bank account earns 4% annual interest compounded annually. If you deposit \\$1,000, how long will it take for the balance to reach \\$2,000?",
        "options": [
          "Approximately 17.7 years",
          "Approximately 15 years",
          "Approximately 20 years",
          "Approximately 25 years"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Formula: $A = P(1+r)^t$. $2000 = 1000(1.04)^t$ → $2 = (1.04)^t$. Take log of both sides: $t \\log(1.04) = \\log(2)$ → $t = \\frac{\\log(2)}{\\log(1.04)} \\approx \\frac{0.3010}{0.0170} \\approx 17.7$ years."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of the function $f(x) = ab^x$ where $a > 0$ and $0 < b < 1$?",
        "options": [
          "The function increases as x increases",
          "The y-intercept is (0, a)",
          "The horizontal asymptote is y = 0",
          "The domain is all real numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $0 < b < 1$, the function represents exponential DECAY, so it DECREASES as x increases, not increases. All other statements are true: y-intercept is (0,a), horizontal asymptote is y=0, and domain is all real numbers."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A culture of bacteria grows from 200 to 800 in 2 hours. Assuming exponential growth, what is the hourly growth factor?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{2}$ or approximately 1.414",
          "2",
          "4",
          "$\\sqrt[3]{2}$ or approximately 1.26"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If growth factor per hour is $r$, then $200r^2 = 800$ → $r^2 = 4$ → $r = 2$. Wait, that gives $r=2$... Actually $200(2)^2 = 200(4) = 800$. So growth factor is 2. But if we check: $200(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 200(2) = 400$, not 800. Let me recalculate: $800 = 200(r)^2$ → $4 = r^2$ → $r = 2$. So the answer should be 2. But since 2 isn't an option, and $\\sqrt{2}$ is approximately 1.414, and $200(1.414)^2 = 200(2) = 400$, not 800. There's an issue here. Actually, if it goes from 200 to 800 in 2 hours, that's quadrupling in 2 hours, so it doubles every hour? 200→400→800, yes doubles every hour, so growth factor is 2."

        "options": [
          "50 mg",
          "100 mg",
          "200 mg",
          "25 mg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Half-life means half remains after each time period. After 6 hours: 200 mg remain. After 12 hours: 100 mg remain. After 18 hours: 50 mg remain. Mathematically: $400(1/2)^{18/6} = 400(1/2)^3 = 400(1/8) = 50$ mg."
