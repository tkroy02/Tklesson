    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What must be true about the slopes of parallel lines?",
        "options": [
          "They are equal",
          "They are negative reciprocals",
          "They multiply to -1",
          "They are opposite signs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel lines have the same slope. If two lines are parallel, their slopes are equal ($m_1 = m_2$)."

        "question": "Write the equation of a line parallel to $y = 3x - 2$ passing through $(1, 4)$.",
        "options": [
          "$y = 3x + 1$",
          "$y = -3x + 7$",
          "$y = \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{11}{3}$",
          "$y = 3x - 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope from $y = 3x - 2$ is $3$. Using point $(1,4)$: $y - 4 = 3(x - 1) \\Rightarrow y = 3x - 3 + 4 \\Rightarrow y = 3x + 1$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Given line: $5y = -2x + 10 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{2}{5}x + 2$. Parallel slope is $-\\frac{2}{5}$. Using $(-3,2)$: $y - 2 = -\\frac{2}{5}(x + 3) \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{10}{5} \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{2}{5}x + \\frac{4}{5}$."

          "$y = -4x - 3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel lines have equal slopes. The original slope is $-\\frac{1}{4}$, so any line with that same slope is parallel."

          "$x = -2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y = 8$ is a horizontal line. Parallel lines must also be horizontal ($y = \\text{constant}$). Since it passes through $(5, -2)$, the equation is $y = -2$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x = -3$ is a vertical line. Parallel lines must also be vertical ($x = \\text{constant}$). Since it passes through $(4, 1)$, the equation is $x = 4$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope is $\\frac{3}{4}$. Using point $(8,0)$: $y - 0 = \\frac{3}{4}(x - 8) \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{3}{4}x - 6$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Second line: $-6y = -4x + 12 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 2$. Since slopes are both $\\frac{2}{3}$ but y-intercepts differ, they are parallel."
