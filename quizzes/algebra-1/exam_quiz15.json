        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$6 - | -3y + 1 | = 8 \\rightarrow -|-3y+1| = 2 \\rightarrow |-3y+1| = -2$. Absolute value cannot equal a negative number, so no solution."

  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The Inverse Property of Multiplication states that a number multiplied by its reciprocal equals one: $a \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} = 1$. Option A shows the Zero Property, option B shows the Identity Property of Multiplication, and option D shows the Inverse Property of Addition."
