      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement BEST defines a function?",
        "options": [
          "Each input has exactly one output",
          "Each output has exactly one input",
          "Inputs and outputs are related",
          "The graph passes the horizontal line test"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A function requires that for every input (x-value), there is exactly one output (y-value)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which set of ordered pairs represents a function?",
        "options": [
          "{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)}",
          "{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only option A has unique x-values. Input 1 appears only once (paired with output 2)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the vertical line test determine?",
        "options": [
          "If a graph represents a function",
          "If a graph is linear",
          "If a graph is continuous",
          "If a graph is symmetric"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vertical line test checks if any vertical line intersects the graph more than once. If it does, it's not a function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which graph would FAIL the vertical line test?",
        "options": [
          "A perfect circle",
          "A diagonal line",
          "A horizontal line",
          "A straight line through the origin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A circle fails because vertical lines through the left and right sides intersect it twice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider this mapping: Student → Phone Number. Is this likely a function?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, each student has one phone number",
          "No, a student could have multiple phone numbers",
          "Yes, each phone number belongs to one student",
          "No, phone numbers aren't mathematical"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is probably NOT a function because one student (input) could have multiple phone numbers (outputs)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is ALWAYS true about functions?",
        "options": [
          "Every input has one output",
          "Every output has one input",
          "The graph is always a straight line",
          "They always use f(x) notation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The defining characteristic of a function is that each input corresponds to exactly one output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which relation is NOT a function?",
        "options": [
          "y = 2x + 3",
          "x = 4",
          "y = x²",
          "f(x) = |x|"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "x = 4 is a vertical line, which fails the vertical line test (infinite y-values for x=4)."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Does this table represent a function?",
  "image": "images/z1.png",
  "options": [
    "Yes",
    "No",
    "Only if we remove the duplicate x-value",
    "Cannot determine from a table"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "No, because the input x=2 has two different outputs (y=6 and y=7). A function requires each input to have exactly one output."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Every function is a relation, but not every relation is a function. Why?",
        "options": [
          "Functions have the one-output-per-input rule",
          "Functions must be written as equations",
          "Relations don't use ordered pairs",
          "Functions are always continuous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All functions are relations (sets of ordered pairs), but only relations that follow the function rule (one output per input) are functions."

          "The colors in a rainbow",
          "Students and their favorite foods",
          "Cities and their time zones"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For each birthday (input), a person has exactly one height (output) at that moment."

        "90": "Excellent understanding! You clearly distinguish functions from relations and understand multiple representations.",

        "50": "Basic understanding. Focus on the core definition: 'Each input has exactly one output.'",
        "0": "Start with the fundamental definition. A function is like a vending machine: one button (input) gives one snack (output)."
