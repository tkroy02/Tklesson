      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car depreciates in value by 15% each year. If you buy a car for \\$25,000, which equation models its value after t years?",
        "options": [
          "$V(t) = 25000(0.85)^t$",
          "$V(t) = 25000(1.15)^t$",
          "$V(t) = 25000 - 0.15t$",
          "$V(t) = 25000(0.15)^t$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "15% depreciation means it retains 85% of its value each year, so decay factor = 0.85. Initial value = \\$25,000. Exponential decay: $V(t) = 25000(0.85)^t$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A radioactive substance has a half-life of 5 years. If you start with 800 grams, how much will remain after 15 years?",
        "options": [
          "100 grams",
          "200 grams",
          "400 grams",
          "50 grams"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Half-life means half remains every 5 years. After 5 years: 400g. After 10 years: 200g. After 15 years: 100g. Formula: $800(1/2)^{15/5} = 800(1/2)^3 = 800(1/8) = 100$ grams."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The population of a town is decreasing at a rate of 3% per year. If the current population is 12,000, what will it be in 10 years?",
        "options": [
          "Approximately 8,840",
          "Approximately 9,560",
          "Approximately 10,240",
          "Approximately 11,640"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "3% decrease means 97% remains each year: decay factor = 0.97. After 10 years: $12000(0.97)^{10} \\approx 12000(0.737) \\approx 8,840$."

        "question": "Medicine in the bloodstream decays exponentially with a half-life of 4 hours. If a patient takes a 300 mg dose, how much remains after 12 hours?",
        "options": [
          "37.5 mg",
          "75 mg",
          "150 mg",
          "225 mg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "12 hours is 3 half-lives (12 ÷ 4 = 3). After 4 hours: 150mg. After 8 hours: 75mg. After 12 hours: 37.5mg. Formula: $300(1/2)^{12/4} = 300(1/2)^3 = 300(1/8) = 37.5$ mg."
      },

        "question": "Which of the following functions represents exponential decay?",
        "options": [
          "$y = 500(0.88)^x$",
          "$y = 200(1.07)^x$",
          "$y = 150(2.5)^x$",
          "$y = 75 + 3x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exponential decay occurs when the base (growth/decay factor) is between 0 and 1. 0.88 is between 0 and 1, so $y = 500(0.88)^x$ represents decay. All others have bases > 1 (growth) or are linear."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A computer loses 20% of its value each year. If it was purchased for \\$1,200, when will it be worth approximately \\$500?",
        "options": [
          "After about 4 years",
          "After about 3 years",
          "After about 5 years",
          "After about 6 years"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "20% loss means 80% remains: decay factor = 0.8. Equation: $500 = 1200(0.8)^t$. Solve: $500/1200 = (0.8)^t → 0.4167 = (0.8)^t$. Testing: $(0.8)^4 = 0.4096$, close to 0.4167. So about 4 years."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lake's pollution level decreases by 12% each month after cleanup begins. If the initial pollution is 500 ppm, what is the decay factor?",
        "options": [
          "0.88",
          "0.12",
          "0.88%",
          "1.12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "12% decrease means 88% remains: 100% - 12% = 88% = 0.88. The decay factor is what remains after each time period, not the percentage decrease."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The temperature of coffee cools from 180°F to 140°F in 10 minutes. If it cools exponentially, which equation could model its temperature after t minutes?",
        "options": [
          "$T(t) = 180(0.97)^t$",
          "$T(t) = 180 - 4t$",
          "$T(t) = 180(1.04)^t$",
          "$T(t) = 140 + 40(0.5)^t$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exponential decay: $T(t) = initial \\times (decay\\ factor)^t$. Test 0.97: After 10 min, $180(0.97)^{10} \\approx 180(0.737) \\approx 133°F$, close to 140°F. This models exponential cooling better than linear or growth models."

        "question": "A forest decreases in area by 5% each decade due to development. If it currently covers 800 km², what area will remain after 30 years?",
        "options": [
          "Approximately 686 km²",
          "Approximately 722 km²",
          "Approximately 760 km²",
          "Approximately 778 km²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "5% decrease per decade means 95% remains: decay factor = 0.95. 30 years = 3 decades. Area after 3 decades: $800(0.95)^3 = 800(0.857) \\approx 686$ km²."

          "Radioactive decay of an element",
          "Depreciation of a car's value",
          "Cooling of a hot object in a room"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A bank account with compound interest typically shows exponential GROWTH, not decay. The other options are classic examples of exponential decay: radioactive materials decay, cars depreciate, and hot objects cool exponentially toward room temperature."
