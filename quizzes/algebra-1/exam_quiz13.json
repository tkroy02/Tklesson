        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$3x + 2 \\leq -x - 2$ → add $x$: $4x + 2 \\leq -2$ → subtract 2: $4x \\leq -4$ → divide by 4: $x \\leq -1$."

  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The Associative Property of Addition states that the way addends are grouped does not affect the sum: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$. The Commutative Property changes order, the Inverse Property involves additive inverses, and the Distributive Property involves multiplication over addition."
