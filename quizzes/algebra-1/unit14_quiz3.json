    "questions": [
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In the box plot provided, which label represents the Interquartile Range (IQR)?",
  "image": "images/z106.png",
  "options": [
    "U",
    "Y",
    "W to X",
    "T to V"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The Interquartile Range (IQR) is the distance between the first quartile (T) and the third quartile (V). The bracket labeled 'Y' measures the width of this box."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a box plot, what does the vertical line inside the box represent?",
        "options": ["The Median", "The Mean", "The Mode", "The Range"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The line inside the box marks the median ($Q2$) of the data set."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which letter in the diagram represents the median of the data set?",
  "image": "images/z106.png",
  "options": [
    "T",
    "U",
    "V",
    "W"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Label U points to the vertical line inside the box, which denotes the median (the second quartile) of the distribution."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What percentage of the data is located within the 'box' part of the plot?",
        "options": ["50%", "25%", "75%", "100%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The box spans from $Q1$ (25th percentile) to $Q3$ (75th percentile), covering exactly 50% of the data."
      },
      {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "In the box plot, which label represents the **Maximum** value of the data set?",

    "options": [
      "W",
      "V",
      "X",
      "Y"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Label X points to the far-right whisker, which indicates the maximum value (excluding outliers) in the data set."
  },
      {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Which label represents the **First Quartile (Q1)**, or the 25th percentile?",
    "image": "images/z106.png",
    "options": [
      "T",
      "U",
      "V",
      "W"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Label T marks the left boundary of the box, which represents the first quartile (Q1)."
  },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A box plot can be used to determine the exact Mean of a data set.",
        "options": ["False", "True", "Only if it is symmetrical", "Only if there are no outliers"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Box plots are based on medians and quartiles. The mean cannot be determined unless the actual data points are provided."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a box plot, the right whisker ends at 100 and the left whisker starts at 40. What is the range of the data?",
        "options": ["60", "140", "100", "40"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Range = Max - Min$. $100 - 40 = 60$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What percentage of data is represented by each whisker?",
        "options": ["25%", "50%", "10%", "5%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A box plot divides data into four equal parts (quartiles), each containing 25% of the data."
      },
      {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Based on the plot, what percentage of the data falls between labels **W and U**?",
    "image": "images/z106.png",
    "options": [
      "25%",
      "50%",
      "75%",
      "100%"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "W is the minimum and U is the median. By definition, the median splits the data into two equal halves, so 50% of the data falls between the minimum and the median."
