    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which five values are required to create a Box and Whisker Plot?",
        "options": ["Min, Q1, Median, Q3, Max", "Mean, Median, Mode, Range, IQR", "Min, Mean, Median, Max, SD", "Q1, Q2, Q3, IQR, Range"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A box plot is built entirely on the Five-Number Summary: Minimum, First Quartile, Median, Third Quartile, and Maximum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a box plot, what does the vertical line inside the box represent?",
        "options": ["The Median", "The Mean", "The Mode", "The Range"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The line inside the box marks the median ($Q2$) of the data set."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the 'whisker' on the left side of a box plot is much longer than the whisker on the right, what does this suggest about the data?",
        "options": ["The lower 25% of the data is more spread out.", "There are more data points on the left.", "The mean is higher than the median.", "The data is perfectly symmetrical."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Longer whiskers indicate a greater spread (variability) in that specific quartile of the data."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What percentage of the data is located within the 'box' part of the plot?",
        "options": ["50%", "25%", "75%", "100%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The box spans from $Q1$ (25th percentile) to $Q3$ (75th percentile), covering exactly 50% of the data."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An outlier is often represented on a box plot as which symbol?",
        "options": ["An asterisk (*) or dot", "A shaded square", "A long dashed line", "A vertical bar"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Outliers that fall far outside the whiskers are typically marked with a separate dot or asterisk to show they are unusual."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a box plot shows $Q1 = 20$ and $Q3 = 30$, what is the Interquartile Range (IQR)?",
        "options": ["10", "50", "25", "5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The length of the box represents the $IQR$. $30 - 20 = 10$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: A box plot can be used to determine the exact Mean of a data set.",
        "options": ["False", "True", "Only if it is symmetrical", "Only if there are no outliers"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Box plots are based on medians and quartiles. The mean cannot be determined unless the actual data points are provided."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a box plot, the right whisker ends at 100 and the left whisker starts at 40. What is the range of the data?",
        "options": ["60", "140", "100", "40"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Range = Max - Min$. $100 - 40 = 60$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What percentage of data is represented by each whisker?",
        "options": ["25%", "50%", "10%", "5%"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A box plot divides data into four equal parts (quartiles), each containing 25% of the data."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the median line is closer to $Q1$ than it is to $Q3$, the data in the middle 50% is:",
        "options": ["More spread out between the Median and Q3", "More spread out between Q1 and the Median", "Perfectly symmetrical", "Mostly outliers"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A larger space between the median and $Q3$ indicates that those values are more scattered compared to the values between $Q1$ and the median."
