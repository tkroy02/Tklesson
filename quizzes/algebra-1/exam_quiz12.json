        "question": "Tobin rows 2 miles per hour faster than her opponent. Tobin finishes a race in 30 minutes, her opponent in 45 minutes. How fast does Tobin row?",
        "options": ["4 mph", "5 mph", "6 mph", "30 mph"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Opponent's speed = $r$. Distance = $0.5(r+2) = 0.75r$. Solve: $0.5r + 1 = 0.75r$ → $1 = 0.25r$ → $r = 4$. Tobin's speed = $r+2 = 6$ mph."

      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "To solve $16 + 28 + 2$, a person regrouped the numbers as $16 + (28 + 2)$. Which property justifies this change?",
  "options": [
    "Commutative Property",
    "Distributive Property",
    "Identity Property",
    "Associative Property"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "The Associative Property of Addition allows us to change the grouping of addends without changing the sum: $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$. The Commutative Property changes order, not grouping; the Distributive Property involves multiplication over addition; and the Identity Property involves adding zero or multiplying by one."

        "options": ["79", "83.5", "85", "94"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sum of first four = $346$. Desired total for 5 tests: $85 \\times 5 = 425$. Needed last score: $425 - 346 = 79$."
