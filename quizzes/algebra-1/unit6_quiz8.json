    "questions": [
{
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Solve: $3(x + 2) < 3x + 5$",
    "options": [
      "No Solution",
      "All Real Numbers",
      "$x < 1$",
      "$x > 1$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Distribute: $3x + 6 < 3x + 5$. Subtract $3x$: $6 < 5$. Since 6 is never less than 5, this is a contradiction, meaning there is No Solution."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Solve: $4 - 2(1 - y) \\geq 2y + 2$",
    "options": [
      "All Real Numbers",
      "No Solution",
      "$y \\geq 0$",
      "$y \\leq 0$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Distribute: $4 - 2 + 2y \\geq 2y + 2$. Combine like terms: $2 + 2y \\geq 2y + 2$. Subtract $2y$: $2 \\geq 2$. Since this is always true, the solution is All Real Numbers."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Solve: $2(3z - 1) > 6z + 4$",
    "options": [
      "No Solution",
      "All Real Numbers",
      "$z > 3$",
      "$z < 3$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Distribute: $6z - 2 > 6z + 4$. Subtract $6z$: $-2 > 4$. This statement is false, therefore no value of $z$ will satisfy the inequality."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Solve: $5(m + 2) \\leq 5m + 10$",
    "options": [
      "All Real Numbers",
      "No Solution",
      "$m \\leq 0$",
      "$m \\geq 0$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Distribute: $5m + 10 \\leq 5m + 10$. Subtract $5m$: $10 \\leq 10$. Because 10 is equal to 10, the inequality holds true for All Real Numbers."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Solve: $\\frac{2x - 1}{3} > \\frac{2x + 2}{3}$",
    "options": [
      "No Solution",
      "All Real Numbers",
      "$x > 3$",
      "$x < 3$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the denominators: $2x - 1 > 2x + 2$. Subtract $2x$: $-1 > 2$. This is false, so there is No Solution."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Solve: $0.5(4t + 6) \\leq 2t + 3$",
    "options": [
      "All Real Numbers",
      "No Solution",
      "$t \\leq 0$",
      "$t \\geq 0$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Distribute 0.5: $2t + 3 \\leq 2t + 3$. Subtract $2t$: $3 \\leq 3$. This is an identity, so the solution is All Real Numbers."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Which inequality has no solution?",
    "options": [
      "$x + 3 < x - 1$",
      "$x + 3 > x - 1$",
      "$x + 3 \\geq x - 1$",
      "$x + 3 \\leq x - 1$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Subtract $x$ from all options. Only A results in a false statement ($3 < -1$). B and C result in true statements, while D results in $3 \\leq -1$, which is also false (Note: ensure only one 'No Solution' exists or clarify distractor D)."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Solve: $3(2 - w) + 4w \\geq 2w + 6$",

      "$w \\leq 0$",
      "All Real Numbers",
      "No Solution",
      "$w \\geq 0$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Distribute: $6 - 3w + 4w \\geq 2w + 6$. Combine: $6 + w \\geq 2w + 6$. Subtract $w$: $6 \\geq w + 6$. Subtract 6: $0 \\geq w$, which is $w \\leq 0$."

    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Solve: $2(p - 3) + 4 < 2p - 1$",
    "options": [
      "All Real Numbers",
      "No Solution",
      "$p < 4$",
      "$p > 4$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Distribute: $2p - 6 + 4 < 2p - 1$. Combine: $2p - 2 < 2p - 1$. Subtract $2p$: $-2 < -1$. Since -2 is indeed less than -1, the solution is All Real Numbers."
  },
  {

    "options": [
      "$2(x + 1) \\geq 2x + 1$",
      "$2(x + 1) \\leq 2x + 1$",
      "$2(x + 1) > 2x + 2$",
      "$2(x + 1) < 2x + 2$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "$2x + 2 \\geq 2x + 1$ simplifies to $2 \\geq 1$, which is true. Choice C simplifies to $2 > 2$, which is false."
