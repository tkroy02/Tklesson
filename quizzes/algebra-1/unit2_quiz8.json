    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The sum of a number and 8 is 15. What is the number?",
        "options": ["7", "23", "8", "120"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let x = the number. Equation: x + 8 = 15. Subtract 8 from both sides: x = 7."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Three times a number decreased by 5 is 19. Find the number.",
        "options": ["8", "14", "24", "42"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let n = the number. Equation: 3n - 5 = 19. Add 5: 3n = 24. Divide by 3: n = 8."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The length of a rectangle is 5 more than its width. The perimeter is 34. What is the width?",
        "options": ["6", "11", "17", "28"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let w = width, then length = w + 5. Perimeter: 2w + 2(w + 5) = 34 → 2w + 2w + 10 = 34 → 4w + 10 = 34 → 4w = 24 → w = 6."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sarah is twice as old as Ben. In 5 years, the sum of their ages will be 55. How old is Ben now?",
        "options": ["15", "20", "30", "25"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let b = Ben's age now. Sarah = 2b. In 5 years: (b + 5) + (2b + 5) = 55 → 3b + 10 = 55 → 3b = 45 → b = 15."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A number divided by 4, plus 3, equals 7. What is the number?",
        "options": ["16", "10", "4", "1"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let x = the number. Equation: (x/4) + 3 = 7. Subtract 3: x/4 = 4. Multiply by 4: x = 16."

        "options": ["$6", "$7", "$8", "$9"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let p = pen's price. Book = 2p + 5. Total: p + (2p + 5) = 23 → 3p + 5 = 23 → 3p = 18 → p = 6."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The sum of three consecutive integers is 48. What is the smallest integer?",
        "options": ["15", "16", "17", "18"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let x = smallest integer. Then: x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 48 → 3x + 3 = 48 → 3x = 45 → x = 15."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A taxi charges $3.50 plus $2.25 per mile. Your fare was $14.75. How many miles did you travel?",
        "options": ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let m = miles. Equation: 3.50 + 2.25m = 14.75. Subtract 3.50: 2.25m = 11.25. Divide by 2.25: m = 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between two numbers is 12. Their sum is 38. What is the larger number?",
        "options": ["25", "13", "26", "24"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let x = larger, y = smaller. Equations: x - y = 12 and x + y = 38. Adding them gives 2x = 50 → x = 25."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell phone plan costs $30 plus $0.10 per text. If your bill is $36, how many texts did you send?",
        "options": ["60", "66", "360", "600"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let t = texts. Equation: 30 + 0.10t = 36. Subtract 30: 0.10t = 6. Divide by 0.10: t = 60."
