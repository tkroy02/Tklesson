    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The length of a rectangle is 5 cm more than twice its width. If the perimeter is 46 cm, what is the width?",
        "options": ["6 cm", "17 cm", "7 cm", "13 cm"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let w = width. Length = 2w + 5. Equation: 2(w) + 2(2w + 5) = 46 → 6w + 10 = 46 → 6w = 36 → w = 6."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Three consecutive even integers have a sum of 72. What is the largest of these integers?",
        "options": ["26", "22", "24", "28"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let the integers be n, n+2, n+4. Equation: 3n + 6 = 72 → 3n = 66 → n = 22. The largest is 22 + 4 = 26."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sarah is 3 times as old as James. In 6 years, Sarah will be twice as old as James will be then. How old is James now?",
        "options": ["6", "12", "18", "3"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let j = James. Sarah = 3j. Future: 3j + 6 = 2(j + 6) → 3j + 6 = 2j + 12 → j = 6."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Plan A costs $25/month plus $0.05/text. Plan B costs $10/month plus $0.20/text. At how many texts are the costs equal?",
        "options": ["100", "150", "75", "50"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "25 + 0.05x = 10 + 0.20x. Subtract 10 and 0.05x: 15 = 0.15x. Divide by 0.15: x = 100."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The sum of two numbers is 45. The larger number is 3 less than 3 times the smaller. Find the larger number.",
        "options": ["33", "12", "36", "30"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let s = smaller. Larger = 3s - 3. Sum: s + (3s - 3) = 45 → 4s = 48 → s = 12. Larger = 3(12) - 3 = 33."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An investment of $4000 is split: part at 3% interest and part at 5%. If the total annual interest is $170, how much was at 5%?",
        "options": ["$2500", "$1500", "$2000", "$3000"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "0.03(4000 - x) + 0.05x = 170 → 120 - 0.03x + 0.05x = 170 → 0.02x = 50 → x = 2500."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many ml of a 40% saline solution must be added to a 10% solution to make 300 ml of a 20% solution?",
        "options": ["100 ml", "200 ml", "150 ml", "50 ml"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "0.40x + 0.10(300 - x) = 0.20(300) → 0.40x + 30 - 0.10x = 60 → 0.30x = 30 → x = 100."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two planes leave an airport in opposite directions. One flies 450 mph, the other 550 mph. In how many hours are they 3000 miles apart?",
        "options": ["3", "2", "4", "6"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Opposite directions: add speeds. 450 + 550 = 1000 mph. 3000 miles / 1000 mph = 3 hours."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Tickets cost $8 for adults and $5 for children. If 120 tickets were sold for $810 total, how many were adult tickets?",
        "options": ["70", "50", "60", "80"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "8a + 5(120 - a) = 810 → 8a + 600 - 5a = 810 → 3a = 210 → a = 70."

        "options": ["21", "14", "24", "15"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "2L + 2(2/3L) = 70 → 2L + 4/3L = 70 → 10/3L = 70 → 10L = 210 → L = 21."
