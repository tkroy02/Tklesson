    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate: $\\sqrt{144}$",
        "options": ["$12$", "$14$", "$72$", "$12$ and $-12$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The principal square root of 144 is 12 because $12^2 = 144$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate: $-\\sqrt{400}$",
        "options": ["$-20$", "$20$", "$-200$", "Not a real number"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The negative sign is outside the radical. $\\sqrt{400} = 20$, so the result is $-20$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Estimate $\\sqrt{50}$ to the nearest tenth.",
        "options": ["$7.1$", "$7.5$", "$6.9$", "$7.9$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\sqrt{49}=7$ and $\\sqrt{64}=8$, $\\sqrt{50}$ is slightly more than 7. $7.1^2 = 50.41$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate: $\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{81}}$",
        "options": ["$\\frac{4}{9}$", "$\\frac{8}{40}$", "$\\frac{2}{3}$", "$\\frac{4}{81}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Take the square root of the numerator and denominator separately: $\\frac{\\sqrt{16}}{\\sqrt{81}} = \\frac{4}{9}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate: $\\sqrt{0.25}$",
        "options": ["$0.5$", "$0.05$", "$5$", "$0.125$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$, the square root is $0.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a perfect square?",
        "options": ["$225$", "$200$", "$125$", "$50$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$15 \\times 15 = 225$, making it a perfect square."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $x^2 = 64$",
        "options": ["$x = \\pm 8$", "$x = 8$", "$x = 32$", "$x = \\pm 32$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When solving an equation $x^2 = k$, we must consider both the positive and negative roots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Between which two consecutive integers does $\\sqrt{18}$ lie?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sqrt{16} = 4$ and $\\sqrt{25} = 5$. Since 18 is between 16 and 25, the root is between 4 and 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate: $\\sqrt{1}$",
        "options": ["$1$", "$0$", "$0.5$", "$-1$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The square root of 1 is always 1 because $1^2 = 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluate: $\\sqrt{-36}$ in the set of real numbers.",
        "options": ["Not a real number", "$6$", "$-6$", "$-18$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the set of real numbers, you cannot take the square root of a negative number because no real number squared equals a negative."
