      {

        "question": "Which sequence is geometric?",
        "options": [
          "3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A geometric sequence has a constant ratio between terms. In 3, 6, 12, 24, 48: 6÷3=2, 12÷6=2, 24÷12=2, 48÷24=2. Constant ratio = 2. The last option also works but is not choice A."

          "15"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Common ratio = any term ÷ previous term. 15 ÷ 5 = 3, 45 ÷ 15 = 3, 135 ÷ 45 = 3. Constant ratio = 3."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Common ratio = 10 ÷ 2 = 5, or 50 ÷ 10 = 5, or 250 ÷ 50 = 5. Next term = 250 × 5 = 1,250."

          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Common ratio = term ÷ previous term. 27 ÷ 81 = 1/3, 9 ÷ 27 = 1/3, 3 ÷ 9 = 1/3. The sequence is decreasing, so ratio is between 0 and 1."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let the missing term be x. In a geometric sequence, ratio is constant: x/7 = 63/x. Cross multiply: $x^2 = 441$, so x = 21 (positive since sequence is increasing). Check: 21÷7=3, 63÷21=3, 189÷63=3."

        "explanation": "Check ratios: 8÷16=0.5, 4÷8=0.5, 2÷4=0.5, 1÷2=0.5. Constant ratio = 0.5. Others don't maintain constant ratio or include 0/negative terms incorrectly."
