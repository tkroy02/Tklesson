    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the mean of the following data set: $4, 8, 12, 16, 20$.",
        "options": ["$12$", "$16$", "$60$", "$10$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mean is the average. Sum $(4+8+12+16+20) = 60$. Divide by the count $(5)$: $60 / 5 = 12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the median of the data set: $15, 7, 22, 13, 10$?",
        "options": ["$13$", "$22$", "$13.4$", "$15$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, order the data: $7, 10, 13, 15, 22$. The middle value is $13$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the mode of the following set: $5, 8, 5, 12, 8, 5, 3$.",
        "options": ["$5$", "$8$", "$6.5$", "$12$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mode is the most frequent number. $5$ appears three times, which is more than any other number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the median calculated if a data set has an even number of values?",
        "options": ["Find the mean of the two middle values", "Pick the larger middle value", "There is no median", "Divide the sum by two"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When there is no single middle number, you take the average (mean) of the two central numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which measure of central tendency is most affected by an outlier (an extreme value)?",
        "options": ["Mean", "Median", "Mode", "Range"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the mean uses the actual value of every data point in its sum, one very large or very small number will pull the average toward it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the median of this data set: $2, 5, 8, 10$.",
        "options": ["$6.5$", "$5$", "$8$", "$6.25$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The two middle numbers are $5$ and $8$. $(5 + 8) / 2 = 6.5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If every number in a data set appears exactly once, what is the mode?",
        "options": ["No mode", "$0$", "The smallest number", "The mean"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A set only has a mode if at least one value repeats more often than others."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A neighborhood has houses worth $\\$200k$ and one mansion worth $\\$5$ million. Which measure best represents the 'typical' home price?",
        "options": ["Median", "Mean", "Range", "Sum"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The median is 'resistant' to outliers, meaning the mansion won't make the typical small house seem more expensive than it is."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the mean of: $1, 1, 1, 1, 10$.",
        "options": ["$2.8$", "$1$", "$14$", "$3$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sum $= 14$. Count $= 5$. $14 / 5 = 2.8$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a data set called if it has exactly two modes?",
        "options": ["Bimodal", "Binary", "Dual-Mean", "Outlier"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Bi-' means two. A bimodal distribution has two 'peaks' or most-frequent values."
