        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Between which points is the rate of change constant?",

          "A to B",
          "B to C",

          "D to E"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From A to B, the graph is a straight line, indicating constant rate of change (constant slope)."

          "The graph crosses the y-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Point P is a peak (maximum) where the graph stops increasing and starts decreasing."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement is true about the entire graph?",
        "image": "images/z19.png",
        "options": [
          "It represents a function",
          "It has no x-intercepts",

          "It is symmetric about the y-axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The graph passes the vertical line test - each x-value has only one y-value, so it's a function."
