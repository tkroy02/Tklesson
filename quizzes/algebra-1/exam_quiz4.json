        "options": ["$\\frac{x}{-3} - \\frac{3}{x}$", "$-1$", "$x+3$", "$x-3$"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since both fractions have the same denominator $(x-3)$, combine numerators: $\\frac{x^2 - 9}{x-3}$. Factor numerator as difference of squares: $x^2 - 9 = (x-3)(x+3)$. So $\\frac{(x-3)(x+3)}{x-3} = x+3$ (for $x \\neq 3$)."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract the first equation from the second: $(2x+2y) - (x+2y) = 13-7$, so $x = 6$. Substitute $x=6$ into $x+2y=7$: $6+2y=7$, $2y=1$, $y=\\frac{1}{2}$."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Least common denominator is $6a^2$. Rewrite: $\\frac{5}{6a} = \\frac{5 \\cdot a}{6a \\cdot a} = \\frac{5a}{6a^2}$. Then $\\frac{5a}{6a^2} - \\frac{2}{3a^2} = \\frac{5a}{6a^2} - \\frac{4}{6a^2} = \\frac{5a-4}{6a^2}$."

        "options": ["$9b^2 - 1$", "$3b - 1$", "$b - 1$", "$9b$"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Factor numerator: $9b^2 - 3b = 3b(3b - 1)$. So $\\frac{3b(3b-1)}{3b} = 3b - 1$ (for $b \\neq 0$)."

        "options": ["$x + 5$", "$3x + 5$", "$4x + 5$", "$9x$"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Three times as many female as male' means $3x$. '5 more than' means add 5. So female supervisors = $3x + 5$."

          "$x^{-4} = \\frac{1}{x^4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A is difference of squares: correct. B factors out $x^2$: correct. C uses power of a power rule: $(x^4)^3 = x^{4\\cdot3} = x^{12} \\neq x^7$. D uses negative exponent rule: correct. So C is not equivalent."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perimeter formula for rectangle: $P = 2l + 2w$. Given $P=140$ and $w=30$, so $2x + 2(30) = 140$, which simplifies to $2x + 60 = 140$ where $x$ is the length."

        "options": ["$6$", "$-2$", "$-2$ and $3$", "$2$ and $-3$"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The expression is undefined when the denominator equals zero. Solve $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$: Factor as $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$. Setting each factor to zero gives $x = -3$ or $x = 2$. Therefore, the expression is undefined at $x = 2$ and $x = -3$."

        "options": ["$(x+5)$", "$(x-5)$", "$(x-1)$", "$(x-3)$"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Factor numerator: $x^2+4x-5 = (x+5)(x-1)$. Factor denominator: $2x^2+3x-5 = (2x+5)(x-1)$. Common factor: $(x-1)$."

        "question": "Joe is lending Frank $500 and Frank has 4 years to pay it back. Joe is charging 6% interest. Frank wants to determine how much interest he'll pay over the 4 years. He sets up the formula: interest $(i)$ = loan amount $(l)$ × rate $(r)$ × time $(t)$. Find $i$.",
        "options": ["\\$12", "\\$120", "\\$125", "\\$1,200"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Use simple interest formula: $i = l × r × t = 500 × 0.06 × 4 = 500 × 0.24 = 120$. So interest = \\$120."

        "options": ["Constant", "Dependent Variable", "Independent Variable", "Exponent"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$V$ is expressed in terms of $m$, so $V$ depends on the value of $m$. Therefore, $V$ is the dependent variable, and $m$ is the independent variable."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$3$ is a fixed number that doesn't change with the variable $w$. It's added to the expression $4w$, so $3$ is a constant term."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "To solve for $d$, divide both sides by $b$ and $t$: $V = bdt$ → $\\frac{V}{b} = dt$ → $\\frac{V}{bt} = d$. So $d = \\frac{V}{bt}$."
