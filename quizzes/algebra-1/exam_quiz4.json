        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since both fractions have the same denominator $(x-3)$, combine numerators: $\\frac{x^2 - 9}{x-3}$. Factor numerator as difference of squares: $x^2 - 9 = (x-3)(x+3)$. So $\\frac{(x-3)(x+3)}{x-3} = x+3$ (for $x \\neq 3$)."

        "options": ["$-59$", "$-75$", "$-43$", "$-67$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First simplify inside parentheses: $12 - 20 = -8$. Then $-15 - 5 - (-8) + 3 - 50 = -15 - 5 + 8 + 3 - 50$. Add left to right: $-15-5=-20$, $-20+8=-12$, $-12+3=-9$, $-9-50=-59$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Commutative Property of Addition states that changing the order of addends does not change the sum: $a+b = b+a$. Option A shows the Associative Property, option B shows the Distributive Property, and option D shows the Identity Property of Addition."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract the first equation from the second: $(2x+2y) - (x+2y) = 13-7$, so $x = 6$. Substitute $x=6$ into $x+2y=7$: $6+2y=7$, $2y=1$, $y=\\frac{1}{2}$."

        "explanation": "Least common denominator is $6a^2$. Rewrite: $\\frac{5}{6a} = \\frac{5 \\cdot a}{6a \\cdot a} = \\frac{5a}{6a^2}$. Then $\\frac{5a}{6a^2} - \\frac{2}{3a^2} = \\frac{5a}{6a^2} - \\frac{4}{6a^2} = \\frac{5a-4}{6a^2}$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Factor numerator: $9b^2 - 3b = 3b(3b - 1)$. So $\\frac{3b(3b-1)}{3b} = 3b - 1$ (for $b \\neq 0$)."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Three times as many female as male' means $3x$. '5 more than' means add 5. So female supervisors = $3x + 5$."

        "explanation": "Perimeter formula for rectangle: $P = 2l + 2w$. Given $P=140$ and $w=30$, so $2x + 2(30) = 140$, which simplifies to $2x + 60 = 140$ where $x$ is the length."

        "options": ["$6$", "$-2$", "$-2$ and $3$", "$2$ and $-3$"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The expression is undefined when the denominator equals zero. Solve $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$: Factor as $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$. Setting each factor to zero gives $x = -3$ or $x = 2$. Therefore, the expression is undefined at $x = 2$ and $x = -3$."
