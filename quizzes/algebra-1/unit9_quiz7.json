      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A population of bacteria starts with 200 cells and doubles every 4 hours. Which equation models the population P after t hours?",
        "options": [
          "$P(t) = 200(2)^{t/4}$",
          "$P(t) = 200(4)^{t/2}$",
          "$P(t) = 200(2)^{4t}$",
          "$P(t) = 200(1/2)^{t/4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial amount = 200. Doubling means base = 2. Doubling time = 4 hours, so exponent should be t/4 (when t=4, we get 2¹ = 2, representing one doubling). $P(t) = 200(2)^{t/4}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car worth \\$24,000 depreciates by 18% each year. Which function models its value V after t years?",
        "options": [
          "$V(t) = 24000(0.82)^t$",
          "$V(t) = 24000(0.18)^t$",
          "$V(t) = 24000(1.18)^t$",
          "$V(t) = 24000 - 0.18t$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial value = \\$24,000. 18% depreciation means 82% remains each year: 100% - 18% = 82% = 0.82. Exponential decay: $V(t) = 24000(0.82)^t$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An investment earns 5% annual interest compounded annually. If you invest \\$1,500, which equation gives the balance after n years?",
        "options": [
          "$B(n) = 1500(1.05)^n$",
          "$B(n) = 1500(0.95)^n$",
          "$B(n) = 1500 + 0.05n$",
          "$B(n) = 1500(1.5)^n$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial investment = \\$1,500. 5% interest means 105% of balance each year: 100% + 5% = 105% = 1.05. Exponential growth: $B(n) = 1500(1.05)^n$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The half-life of a medication is 6 hours. If a patient takes a 300 mg dose, which function models the amount remaining after t hours?",
        "options": [
          "$A(t) = 300(1/2)^{t/6}$",
          "$A(t) = 300(1/2)^{6t}$",
          "$A(t) = 300(6)^{t/2}$",
          "$A(t) = 300 - (t/6)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial amount = 300 mg. Half-life means multiply by 1/2 each half-life period. Half-life = 6 hours, so exponent = t/6. $A(t) = 300(1/2)^{t/6}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A culture of bacteria grows from 500 to 2,000 in 3 hours. Assuming exponential growth, what is the hourly growth factor?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt[3]{4}$ or approximately 1.587",
          "4",
          "$4^{1/3}$ or approximately 1.587",
          "$\\sqrt{4}$ or 2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If r is hourly growth factor: $500r^3 = 2000 → r^3 = 4 → r = \\sqrt[3]{4} ≈ 1.587$. The bacteria quadruple in 3 hours, not double, so growth factor is cube root of 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lake's pollution decreases by 25% each month after cleanup begins. If initial pollution is 800 ppm, what will it be after 5 months?",
        "options": [
          "Approximately 190 ppm",
          "Approximately 237 ppm",
          "Approximately 320 ppm",
          "Approximately 400 ppm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "25% decrease means 75% remains: decay factor = 0.75. After 5 months: $800(0.75)^5 = 800(0.2373) ≈ 190$ ppm. The closest answer is 190 ppm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which situation would be modeled by $y = 1200(0.92)^x$?",
        "options": [
          "A computer depreciating 8% per year from \\$1,200",
          "A population growing 8% per year from 1,200",
          "A savings account earning 8% interest from \\$1,200",
          "A temperature cooling 92% per hour from 1200°F"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Base 0.92 < 1 indicates decay. 0.92 = 92% remains, so decay rate = 8%. Initial value = 1200. This models something losing 8% per period, like depreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rumor spreads exponentially. On day 1, 5 people know it. On day 3, 45 people know it. What is the daily growth factor?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "9",
          "$\\sqrt{9}$ or 3",
          "45/5 or 9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From day 1 to day 3 is 2 days (day 1 to day 2, day 2 to day 3). If r is daily growth factor: $5r^2 = 45 → r^2 = 9 → r = 3$. The rumor triples each day."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A radioactive element decays to 1/8 of its original amount in 9 days. What is its daily decay factor?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt[3]{1/2}$ or approximately 0.794",
          "$\\sqrt[9]{1/8}$ or approximately 0.833",
          "1/8",
          "1/2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "1/8 = (1/2)³, which means it goes through 3 half-lives in 9 days. So half-life = 3 days. Daily decay factor = (1/2)^(1/3) = ∛(1/2) ≈ 0.794."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hot cup of coffee cools from 180°F to 160°F in 5 minutes. If cooling is exponential, which is a reasonable model?",
        "options": [
          "$T(t) = 180(0.98)^t$ where t is in minutes",
          "$T(t) = 180 - 4t$ where t is in minutes",
          "$T(t) = 180(1.02)^t$ where t is in minutes",
          "$T(t) = 160 + 20(0.5)^t$ where t is in minutes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Test 0.98: After 5 min, $180(0.98)^5 ≈ 180(0.904) ≈ 163°F$, close to 160°F. Exponential decay with base around 0.98-0.99 is typical for cooling. Linear (180-4t) gives 160°F exactly at 5 min but doesn't model continued cooling well."
