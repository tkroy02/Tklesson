    "topic": "Discrete and Continuous Data, Function Types",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the key difference between discrete and continuous data?",
        "options": [
          "Discrete has gaps between values; continuous can take any value in a range",
          "Discrete is always whole numbers; continuous is always decimals",
          "Discrete data is qualitative; continuous is quantitative",
          "Discrete data tends to be finite; continuous data tends to be infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Discrete data has distinct, separate values (like counting). Continuous data can take any value within a range (like measuring)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which represents discrete data?",
        "options": [
          "Number of students in a class",
          "Height of students",
          "Temperature throughout the day",
          "Time taken to run a race"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Number of students is countable (you can't have 25.3 students). The others are measurable quantities that can have fractional values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of graph would you use for discrete data?",
        "options": [
          "Scatter plot with disconnected points",
          "Continuous smooth curve",
          "Solid line connecting all points",
          "Shaded area under a curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Discrete data is shown with separate points since values only exist at specific inputs, not in between."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is the relationship between time and distance traveled by a car discrete or continuous?",
        "options": [
          "Continuous",
          "Discrete",
          "Both, depending on how you measure",
          "Neither"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A car can be at any position at any time, so distance changes continuously with time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which function would likely model discrete data?",
        "options": [
          "$C(n) = 2.50n$ where n is number of movie tickets",
          "$d(t) = 60t$ where t is time in hours",
          "$A(r) = \\pi r^2$ where r is radius",
          "$T(h) = 70 - 2h$ where h is altitude in thousands of feet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Number of tickets (n) is discrete - you buy whole tickets. Time, radius, and altitude are continuous measurements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Look at the graph. Is it showing discrete or continuous data?",
        "image": "images/z10.png",
        "options": [
          "Discrete",
          "Continuous",
          "Both",
          "Cannot tell from a graph"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The graph shows individual points not connected by lines, indicating discrete data."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which is an example of continuous data collection?",
        "options": [
          "Tracking temperature every minute",
          "Counting cars that pass each hour",
          "Recording test scores from a class",
          "Surveying favorite colors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature can be measured at infinitely many moments, making it continuous when tracked frequently."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a solid line on a graph typically indicate?",
        "options": [
          "Continuous relationship between variables",
          "Discrete data points",
          "Error in the data",
          "Maximum value"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solid lines suggest the relationship holds for all values in between plotted points, indicating continuity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cost of mailing packages based on weight is:",
        "options": [
          "Both discrete and continuous",
          "Only discrete",
          "Only continuous",
          "Neither discrete nor continuous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weight is continuous (can be any value), but postal rates change at specific weights, creating a stepped (discrete) cost function."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important to distinguish between discrete and continuous?",
        "options": [
          "It affects how we graph and analyze the data",
          "Discrete data is always more accurate",
          "Continuous data is harder to collect",
          "It doesn't matter - they're treated the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Different mathematical tools and representations are appropriate for each type, affecting analysis and interpretation."

        "50": "Developing understanding. Remember: Discrete = countable, separate values. Continuous = measurable, any value in range.",
