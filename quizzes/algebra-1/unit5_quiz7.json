    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "What is the relationship between slopes of perpendicular lines?",
    "options": [
      "They are negative reciprocals",
      "They are equal",
      "They are opposites",
      "They are reciprocals"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Perpendicular lines meet at a 90° angle. Their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning if you multiply them together, the product is always $-1$ ($m_1 \\cdot m_2 = -1$)."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "What is the slope of a line perpendicular to $y = \\frac{2}{3}x + 5$?",
    "options": [
      "$-\\frac{3}{2}$",
      "$\\frac{3}{2}$",
      "$-\\frac{2}{3}$",
      "$\\frac{2}{3}$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To find the perpendicular slope, apply the 'flip and switch' rule: flip the fraction $\\frac{2}{3}$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and switch the sign from positive to negative, giving $-\\frac{3}{2}$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Write the equation of a line perpendicular to $y = -4x + 1$ passing through $(2, 3)$.",
    "options": [
      "$y = \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{5}{2}$",
      "$y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{7}{2}$",
      "$y = 4x - 5$",
      "$y = -4x + 11$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The original slope is $-4$ (or $-4/1$), so the perpendicular slope is $+1/4$. Using point-slope form $y - 3 = \\frac{1}{4}(x - 2)$ and simplifying gives the slope-intercept form $y = \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{5}{2}$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Find the equation perpendicular to $3x + 2y = 6$ through $(-1, 4)$.",
    "options": [
      "$y = \\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{14}{3}$",
      "$y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{10}{3}$",
      "$y = \\frac{3}{2}x + \\frac{11}{2}$",
      "$y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + \\frac{5}{2}$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "First, find the original slope from $3x + 2y = 6$, which is $-3/2$. The perpendicular slope is the negative reciprocal, $+2/3$. Plugging the slope $2/3$ and point $(-1, 4)$ into the linear equation formula results in $y = \\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{14}{3}$."

  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "What is perpendicular to a horizontal line?",
    "options": [
      "Vertical line",
      "Another horizontal line",
      "Line with slope 1",
      "Line with slope -1"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A horizontal line has a slope of 0. Perpendicular lines must form a right angle; on a coordinate plane, only a vertical line (which has an undefined slope) is perfectly perpendicular to a horizontal one."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "What is perpendicular to a vertical line?",
    "options": [
      "Horizontal line",
      "Another vertical line",
      "Line with slope 1",
      "Line with slope -1"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Vertical lines run straight up and down (undefined slope). The only line that can cross a vertical line at a 90° angle is a horizontal line, which runs perfectly left to right (slope 0)."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Find the equation perpendicular to $y = \\frac{5}{2}$ through $(3, -1)$.",
    "options": [
      "$x = 3$",
      "$y = -1$",
      "$y = \\frac{2}{5}x - \\frac{11}{5}$",
      "$y = -\\frac{2}{5}x + \\frac{1}{5}$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "$y = 2.5$ is a horizontal line. Any line perpendicular to it must be a vertical line in the form $x = k$. Since it passes through the point $(3, -1)$, we use the x-coordinate: $x = 3$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Write the equation perpendicular to $x = -4$ through $(2, 5)$.",
    "options": [
      "$y = 5$",
      "$x = 2$",
      "$y = 2x + 1$",
      "$y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 6$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "$x = -4$ is a vertical line. A line perpendicular to it must be horizontal, which always takes the form $y = k$. Since it passes through $(2, 5)$, we use the y-coordinate: $y = 5$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Which line is perpendicular to $y = -\\frac{3}{7}x + 2$?",
    "options": [
      "$y = \\frac{7}{3}x - 1$",
      "$y = -\\frac{7}{3}x + 1$",
      "$y = \\frac{3}{7}x - 1$",
      "$y = -\\frac{3}{7}x - 1$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The original slope is $-3/7$. The perpendicular slope must be the negative reciprocal: flip 3/7 to 7/3 and change the negative to a positive. Only the equation with slope $7/3$ is perpendicular."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Find the equation perpendicular to $4x - 8y = 16$ through the origin.",
    "options": [
      "$y = -2x$",
      "$y = 2x$",
      "$y = -\\frac{1}{2}x$",
      "$y = \\frac{1}{2}x$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The slope of $4x - 8y = 16$ is $1/2$. The perpendicular slope is the negative reciprocal, $-2$. A line with slope $-2$ passing through the origin $(0,0)$ is simply $y = -2x$."
