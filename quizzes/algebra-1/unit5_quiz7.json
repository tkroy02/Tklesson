      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between slopes of perpendicular lines?",
        "options": [
          "They are negative reciprocals",
          "They are equal",
          "They are opposites",
          "They are reciprocals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals: $m_1 \\cdot m_2 = -1$ or $m_2 = -\\frac{1}{m_1}$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Original slope is $-4$. The perpendicular slope is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Using point-slope: $y - 3 = \\frac{1}{4}(x - 2) \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{2} + 3 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{5}{2}$."
