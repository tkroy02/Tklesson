        "question": "Which of the following is a solution set to $x^2 - 12 = 5x + 2$?",
        "options": [
          "$[2, 7]$",
          "$[-7, 2]$",
          "$[-2, 7]$",
          "$[-2, 7, 0]$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rewrite as $x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0$, factor to $(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0$, giving solutions $x = 7$ or $x = -2$. So solution set is $\\{-2, 7\\}$."

    "$\\frac{1}{2}(4a + 8) = 2a + 4$"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The Distributive Property applies to addition and subtraction, not multiplication: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. Option C incorrectly attempts to distribute multiplication over multiplication. Options A, B, and D are all correct applications of the Distributive Property."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Add $3y$ to both sides: $5y + 5 = -10$. Subtract 5: $5y = -15$. Divide by 5: $y = -3$."
