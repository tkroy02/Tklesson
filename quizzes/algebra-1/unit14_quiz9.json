    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the denominator when calculating a 'Conditional Relative Frequency'?",
        "options": [
          "The total of the specific row or column being considered",
          "The Grand Total of the entire table",
          "The number of categories in the table",
          "The average of all joint frequencies"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike joint relative frequency, conditional frequency restricts the sample space to one specific category (a single row or column total)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A table shows 20 boys like pizza and 10 boys like tacos. Given that a student is a boy, what is the conditional relative frequency that he likes pizza?",
        "options": [
          "2/3 (≈ 67%)",
          "1/3 (≈ 33%)",
          "2/5 (40%)",
          "20%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The condition is 'being a boy.' Total boys = $20 + 10 = 30$. Frequency = $20/30 = 2/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which phrase in a word problem typically indicates a conditional frequency is needed?",
        "options": [
          "Given that...",
          "Out of the grand total...",
          "What is the sum of...",
          "What is the mean of..."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Given that' or 'Of the [Category]...' tells you to limit your denominator to that specific group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the conditional relative frequency of 'Liking Math' given 'is a Senior' is 0.85, what does this mean?",
        "options": [
          "85% of Seniors like math.",
          "85% of people who like math are Seniors.",
          "85% of all students are Seniors who like math.",
          "There are 85 Seniors in the school."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The condition is 'Seniors,' so the percentage applies specifically to that group's preferences."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A table has a Grand Total of 100. There are 40 Freshmen. 10 Freshmen play an instrument. What is the Joint Relative Frequency of being a Freshman who plays an instrument?",
        "options": [
          "0.10",
          "0.25",
          "0.40",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Joint Relative Frequency is out of the Grand Total: $10/100 = 0.10$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the data from the previous question (40 Freshmen, 10 play instruments), what is the Conditional Relative Frequency that a student plays an instrument, given they are a Freshman?",
        "options": [
          "0.25",
          "0.10",
          "0.40",
          "4.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The condition is 'Freshman.' Denominator is 40. $10/40 = 0.25$ or $25\\%$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you calculate the conditional relative frequencies for every cell in a single row, what should they add up to?",
        "options": [
          "1 (or 100%)",
          "The Grand Total",
          "The Mean",
          "0.5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since you are dividing by the row total, the sum of the parts must equal $100\\%$ of that row."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Conditional relative frequencies are most useful for determining:",
        "options": [
          "If there is an association between two categories",
          "The exact mean of a data set",
          "The range of the values",
          "The standard deviation of the population"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By comparing percentages across rows (e.g., do $80\\%$ of boys like X while only $20\\%$ of girls like X?), we can see if the categories are related."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 2x2 table, how many different 'conditional' distributions can you calculate?",
        "options": [
          "4 (two for rows, two for columns)",
          "1",
          "2",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You can look at frequencies based on each of the row categories and each of the column categories."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 'Gender' and 'Favorite Sport' have no association, what would you expect the conditional relative frequencies to look like?",
        "options": [
          "The percentages would be roughly the same for both genders.",
          "All percentages would be 0%.",
          "The percentages would be 100% for one gender.",
          "The frequencies would equal the mean."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "No association means the 'condition' (being a boy or girl) doesn't change the outcome (favorite sport)."
