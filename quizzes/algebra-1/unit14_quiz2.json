    "topic": "Statistics",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the range of the following data set: $12, 5, 19, 2, 8, 11$?",
        "options": ["$17$", "$19$", "$2$", "$9.5$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The range is the difference between the maximum ($19$) and the minimum ($2$). $19 - 2 = 17$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR)?",
        "options": ["$Q3 - Q1$", "$Q3 + Q1$", "$Max - Min$", "$\\text{Mean} - \\text{Median}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The IQR is the distance between the third quartile and the first quartile, representing the middle $50\\%$ of the data."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a data set has a Standard Deviation of $0$, what does this mean?",
        "options": ["All data points are the same value.", "The mean is zero.", "There are no data points.", "The data is very spread out."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard deviation measures spread. If there is zero spread, every single number in the set must be identical to the mean."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the median of the lower half of the data (Q1) for: $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14$.",
        "options": ["$4$", "$6$", "$8$", "$2$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The median (Q2) is $8$. The lower half is $2, 4, 6$. The middle of that half is $4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which measure of spread is the most sensitive to outliers?",
        "options": ["Range", "IQR", "Standard Deviation", "Median"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the range only uses the absolute maximum and minimum, a single extreme outlier will change the range drastically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the IQR for a data set where $Q1 = 15$ and $Q3 = 35$.",
        "options": ["$20$", "$50$", "$25$", "$10$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 35 - 15 = 20$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Data Set A has a standard deviation of $2$. Data Set B has a standard deviation of $10$. Which set is more 'consistent'?",
        "options": ["Data Set A", "Data Set B", "They are equally consistent", "Consistency cannot be determined"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, making the data more consistent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What percentage of data is contained within the Interquartile Range (IQR)?",
        "options": ["$50\\%$", "$25\\%$", "$75\\%$", "$100\\%$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The IQR covers the middle half of the data, from the $25^{th}$ percentile to the $75^{th}$ percentile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find the range of the set: $-5, 0, 5, 10, 20$.",
        "options": ["$25$", "$20$", "$15$", "$10$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Max - Min = 20 - (-5) = 25$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a box plot, the 'whiskers' extend to the minimum and maximum. The 'box' itself represents what?",
        "options": ["The IQR", "The Range", "The Standard Deviation", "The Outliers"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The box starts at Q1 and ends at Q3, which is the definition of the Interquartile Range."
