    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Statistics",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a histogram, what does the height of each bar represent?",
        "options": ["Frequency", "The mean of the interval", "The value of the data point", "The range of the bin"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The height of the bar (the y-axis) tells you how many data points fall within that specific interval or bin."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which type of data display is shown in the image below?",
  "image": "images/z102.png",
  "options": [
    "Bar Graph",
    "Histogram",
    "Pie Chart",
    "Pictogram"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "This is a bar graph. Notice that the bars represent distinct categories and have spaces between them, unlike a histogram which represents continuous numerical intervals."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "What does the image below depict?",
  "image": "images/z103.png",
  "options": [
    "Histogram",
    "Bar Graph",
    "Pie Chart",
    "Pictogram"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "This is a histogram. Unlike a bar graph, the bars are touching, representing a continuous range of numerical data rather than separate categories."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A histogram shows bins of 0-9, 10-19, and 20-29. Where would the data point 10 be placed?",
        "options": ["In the 10-19 bin", "In the 0-9 bin", "In both bins", "In a new bin"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bins are defined so that each data point fits into exactly one category. 10 is the starting value for the second bin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a symmetric, bell-shaped histogram, where are the mean and median usually located?",
        "options": ["They are approximately equal and in the center.", "The mean is on the far right.", "The median is on the far left.", "The mean is always much higher than the median."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a perfectly symmetric distribution, the mean, median, and mode all align in the center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you determine the total number of data points from a histogram?",
        "options": ["Add the heights of all the bars.", "Look at the highest bar only.", "Look at the value of the last bin.", "Multiply the number of bins by the highest frequency."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each bar's height represents a count. Adding all heights gives the total sample size ($n$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a histogram is 'skewed left,' what does that usually mean for the mean?",
        "options": ["The mean is less than the median.", "The mean is greater than the median.", "The mean is equal to the median.", "The mean is the highest bar."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In skewed distributions, the mean is pulled toward the tail. A left tail pulls the mean to the left, making it smaller than the median."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a histogram if you make the bin intervals much wider?",
        "options": ["You see less detail about the distribution.", "You see more individual data points.", "The number of bars increases.", "The total frequency increases."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wider bins group more data together, which 'smooths' the graph but hides specific patterns or clusters in the data."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which distribution shape would most likely represent the ages of residents in a retirement community?",
        "options": ["Skewed left", "Skewed right", "Symmetric", "Uniform"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most residents would be older (on the right side of the x-axis), with a 'tail' of fewer younger staff or visitors on the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can you find the exact maximum value of a data set from a standard histogram?",
        "options": ["No, you only know which interval the maximum falls in.", "Yes, it is the end of the last bar.", "Yes, it is the height of the last bar.", "No, histograms only show the mean."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Histograms group data into ranges. You know the highest range, but not the specific value of the individual points within it."

        "70": "Good effort. Remember, the 'skew' is where the tail is, not where the peak is!",
        "50": "Keep practicing. Focus on how frequency (height) tells the story of the data set.",
        "0": "Review the basics: Intervals go on the bottom, and frequency goes on the side."
