    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a stem-and-leaf plot, what does the 'leaf' usually represent?",
        "options": ["The last digit of the number", "The first digit of the number", "The frequency of the number", "The average of the row"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Typically, the stem represents the leading digits (like tens) and the leaf represents the final digit (ones)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main advantage of a dot plot over a histogram?",
        "options": ["It shows every individual data point.", "It can handle much larger data sets.", "It automatically calculates the mean.", "It uses bins instead of specific values."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While histograms group data into intervals (losing individual values), a dot plot places a dot for every single piece of data."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a stem-and-leaf plot, a key states $5|2 = 52$. What value is represented by $7|0$?",
        "options": ["70", "7", "0.7", "7.0"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Following the key, the stem 7 is the tens place and the leaf 0 is the ones place, making the number 70."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do you find the mode on a dot plot?",
        "options": ["Look for the tallest column of dots.", "Find the dot in the exact center.", "Average the values of the first and last dots.", "Count all the dots and divide by two."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mode is the most frequent value. On a dot plot, this is represented by the value with the highest stack of dots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A stem-and-leaf plot has stems 1, 2, and 3. The leaves for stem 2 are: $0, 2, 2, 5, 8$. What is the median of this specific row?",
        "options": ["22", "2", "20", "25"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The values are 20, 22, 22, 25, 28. The middle value of this row is 22."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a dot plot, what does a large gap between clusters of dots usually indicate?",
        "options": ["A range of values with no data points", "A very high frequency", "An error in the data collection", "The location of the mean"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A gap in a dot plot shows an interval where no observations occurred."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True or False: In a stem-and-leaf plot, leaves must be listed in numerical order.",
        "options": ["True", "False", "Only if there are outliers", "Only for even data sets"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To easily find the median and keep the plot organized, leaves should always be arranged from least to greatest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a dot plot is 'skewed right,' where are most of the dots located?",
        "options": ["On the left side of the plot", "On the right side of the plot", "Evenly distributed", "In the exact center"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Skewed right means there is a 'tail' of few dots on the right, meaning the bulk (cluster) of the data is on the left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many data points are in a stem-and-leaf plot that has 12 total leaves?",
        "options": ["12", "24", "Depends on the stems", "6"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Every leaf represents exactly one data point. Therefore, 12 leaves mean 12 data points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the range of a data set if the first entry is $1|2$ and the last entry is $4|9$? (Key: $1|2 = 12$)",
        "options": ["37", "3", "49", "12"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Range = Max - Min$. $49 - 12 = 37$."
