        "options": ["20", "1.8", "6.3", "0.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide both sides by 0.3: x = 6 ÷ 0.3 = 20."

          "Subtract 0.5 first"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply every term by 10 (power of 10 matching most decimal places): 2x + 5 = 13, eliminating decimals."
