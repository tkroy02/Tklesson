        "question": "The mean of $\\{5, 6x-1, 12, -2\\}$ is 8. What is $x$?",
        "options": ["$x = 2$", "$x = 3$", "$x = 4$", "$x = 5$"],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sum = $8 \\times 4 = 32$. Known sum without $6x-1$: $5 + 12 - 2 = 15$. So $6x - 1 = 17$, $6x = 18$, $x = 3$."

  "options": [
    "$9 \\times 1 = 9$",
    "$9 + 0 = 9$",
    "$9 + (-9) = 0$",
    "$9 \\times \\frac{1}{9} = 1$"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The Identity Property of Addition states that adding zero to any number gives the number itself: $a + 0 = a$. Option A shows the Identity Property of Multiplication, option C shows the Inverse Property of Addition, and option D shows the Inverse Property of Multiplication."

        "options": ["$x = 1$", "$x = 3$", "$x = 4.5$", "$x = 6$"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Arrange data with $x$; median is average of 3rd and 4th numbers. Only $x = 6$ gives sorted set $-2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 11$ → median $(3+6)/2 = 4.5$."
