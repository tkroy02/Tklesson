        "options": [
          "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction",
          "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiply, Divide, Add, Subtract (in that order)",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Multiplication before addition: 4 × 2 = 8, then 3 + 8 = 11. Not (3 + 4) × 2 = 14."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parentheses first: (2 + 2) = 4. Then division and multiplication left to right: 8 ÷ 2 = 4, then 4 × 4 = 16."

          "Exponents before parentheses",
          "Parentheses before exponents",
          "They have equal priority",
          "It depends on the numbers"

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Parentheses come first in PEMDAS. Work inside parentheses completely before dealing with exponents outside them."

          "20"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Division and multiplication have equal priority, so work left to right: 20 ÷ 5 = 4, then 4 × 2 = 8."
