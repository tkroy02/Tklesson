        "question": "A boat travels 48 miles downstream in 3 hours. The same 48 miles upstream takes 4 hours. Find the boat's speed in still water and the current speed.",
        "options": [
          "Boat: 14 mph, Current: 2 mph",
          "Boat: 12 mph, Current: 4 mph",
          "Boat: 15 mph, Current: 1 mph",
          "Boat: 16 mph, Current: 0 mph"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let b = boat speed, c = current speed. Downstream: b + c = 48/3 = 16. Upstream: b - c = 48/4 = 12. Solve the system: Add equations → 2b = 28 → b = 14 mph. Then c = 16 - 14 = 2 mph."

        "question": "A plane flies 1200 miles with a tailwind in 3 hours. Flying against the wind, the same distance takes 4 hours. Find the plane's speed in still air and the wind speed.",

          "Plane: 400 mph, Wind: 0 mph"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let p = plane speed, w = wind speed. With wind: p + w = 1200/3 = 400. Against wind: p - w = 1200/4 = 300. Solve: Add equations → 2p = 700 → p = 350 mph. Then w = 400 - 350 = 50 mph."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let d = distance. Time from A to B: d/50 hours. Time from B to A: d/60 hours. Total time: d/50 + d/60 = 11. Common denominator 300: (6d + 5d)/300 = 11 → 11d/300 = 11 → 11d = 3300 → d = 300 miles."

          "75 miles",
          "90 miles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find when cyclists meet: combined speed = 12 + 18 = 30 mph. Time = distance/relative speed = 60/30 = 2 hours. Bird flies entire 2 hours at 30 mph: distance = rate × time = 30 × 2 = 60 miles."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let r = original speed, t = original time. System: rt = 300 and (r+10)(t-1) = 300. From first equation: t = 300/r. Substitute: (r+10)(300/r - 1) = 300. Solve: 300 + 3000/r - r - 10 = 300 → 3000/r - r - 10 = 0 → 3000 - r² - 10r = 0 → r² + 10r - 3000 = 0 → (r+60)(r-50) = 0 → r = 50 mph (positive speed)."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Relative speed = 55 + 65 = 120 mph. Time = distance/relative speed = 400/120 = 10/3 hours = 3.333... hours = 3 hours and 20 minutes."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let r = rowing speed, c = current speed. Upstream: r - c = 15/5 = 3. Downstream: r + c = 15/3 = 5. Solve: Add equations → 2r = 8 → r = 4 mph. Then c = 5 - 4 = 1 mph."

        "explanation": "Eastbound plane: distance = 250 × 2 = 500 miles east. Northbound plane: distance = 300 × 2 = 600 miles north. They form a right triangle. Straight-line distance apart = √(500² + 600²) = √(250,000 + 360,000) = √610,000 ≈ 781 miles."
