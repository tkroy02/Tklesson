        "question": "A boat travels 48 miles downstream in 3 hours. Upstream, same 48 miles takes 4 hours. Find boat speed and current speed.",
        "options": [
          "Boat: 14 mph, Current: 2 mph",
          "Boat: 12 mph, Current: 4 mph",
          "Boat: 15 mph, Current: 1 mph",
          "Boat: 16 mph, Current: 0 mph"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let b = boat speed, c = current. Downstream: b + c = 48/3 = 16. Upstream: b - c = 48/4 = 12. Add: 2b = 28 → b = 14 mph. Then c = 16 - 14 = 2 mph."

          "Plane: 400 mph, Wind: 0 mph"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let p = plane speed, w = wind speed. With wind: p + w = 1200/3 = 400. Against: p - w = 1200/4 = 300. Add: 2p = 700 → p = 350 mph. Then w = 400 - 350 = 50 mph."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let d = distance. Time AB: d/50. Time BA: d/60. Total: d/50 + d/60 = 11. Common denominator 300: 6d/300 + 5d/300 = 11 → 11d/300 = 11 → 11d = 3300 → d = 300 miles."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find when cyclists meet: relative speed = 12 + 18 = 30 mph. Time = 60/30 = 2 hours. Bird flies entire 2 hours at 30 mph: distance = 30 × 2 = 60 miles."
