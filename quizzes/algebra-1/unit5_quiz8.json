    "topic": "Understanding and Manipulating Standard Form Linear Equations",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "What is the standard form of a linear equation?",
    "options": [
      "$Ax + By = C$",
      "$y = mx + b$",
      "$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$",
      "$\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} = 1$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Standard form is defined as $Ax + By = C$. In this format, $x$ and $y$ are on the same side, coefficients $A, B, C$ are integers, and $A$ is typically non-negative."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Convert $y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 5$ to standard form with integer coefficients.",
    "options": [
      "$2x - 3y = 15$",
      "$2x + 3y = -15$",
      "$-2x + 3y = 15$",
      "$2x - 3y = -15$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "First, multiply the entire equation by 3 to clear the fraction: $3y = 2x - 15$. Next, move the variables to the left: $-2x + 3y = -15$. Finally, multiply by -1 to ensure $A$ is positive, resulting in $2x - 3y = 15$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "What are the x- and y-intercepts of $3x + 4y = 12$?",
    "options": [
      "x-intercept: 4, y-intercept: 3",
      "x-intercept: 3, y-intercept: 4",
      "x-intercept: 12, y-intercept: 12",
      "x-intercept: 4, y-intercept: -3"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To find the x-intercept, set $y=0$: $3x = 12 \\Rightarrow x=4$. To find the y-intercept, set $x=0$: $4y = 12 \\Rightarrow y=3$. The intercepts are the points where the line crosses each axis."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Write $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{4}$ in standard form.",
    "options": [
      "$2x + 4y = 3$",
      "$x + 2y = \\frac{3}{2}$",
      "$2x + 4y = -3$",
      "$x + 2y = 3$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Multiply by the least common denominator (4) to remove all fractions: $4y = -2x + 3$. Move the x-term to the left to get $2x + 4y = 3$. This satisfies the rule that $A, B,$ and $C$ must be integers."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Which equation is in proper standard form?",
    "options": [
      "$3x - 2y = 7$",
      "$-3x + 2y = 7$",
      "$y = 3x - 2$",
      "$0x + y = 5$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Proper standard form requires $A, B,$ and $C$ to be integers, no common factors between them, and $A \\geq 0$. $3x - 2y = 7$ is the only option that meets all these formal requirements."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Find the slope from standard form $5x - 2y = 10$.",
    "options": [
      "$\\frac{5}{2}$",
      "$-\\frac{5}{2}$",
      "$\\frac{2}{5}$",
      "$-\\frac{2}{5}$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "You can find the slope by solving for $y$: $-2y = -5x + 10 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{5}{2}x - 5$. Alternatively, use the shortcut formula for standard form: $m = -A/B$, which is $-5/(-2) = 5/2$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Write the equation with x-intercept 3 and y-intercept -2 in standard form.",
    "options": [
      "$2x - 3y = 6$",
      "$2x + 3y = 6$",
      "$3x - 2y = 6$",
      "$-2x + 3y = 6$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Using intercepts $(3,0)$ and $(0,-2)$, the slope $m$ is $\\frac{-2-0}{0-3} = \\frac{2}{3}$. In slope-intercept form, this is $y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 2$. Multiply by 3 and rearrange to get $2x - 3y = 6$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Convert $y + 3 = -4(x - 1)$ to standard form.",
    "options": [
      "$4x + y = 1$",
      "$4x - y = 7$",
      "$-4x + y = -7$",
      "$4x + y = 7$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Distribute the -4 first: $y + 3 = -4x + 4$. Move the $x$ to the left and the constant to the right: $4x + y + 3 = 4 \\Rightarrow 4x + y = 1$. This puts the equation in $Ax + By = C$ form."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Which value makes $Ax + 3y = 9$ have slope $\\frac{2}{3}$?",
    "options": [
      "$A = -2$",
      "$A = 2$",
      "$A = -6$",
      "$A = 6$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In standard form, slope $m = -A/B$. Here, $m = -A/3$. Setting $-A/3 = 2/3$ shows that $-A = 2$, so $A = -2$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Write $\\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{y}{6} = 1$ in standard form $Ax + By = C$.",
    "options": [
      "$3x + 2y = 12$",
      "$6x + 4y = 24$",
      "$x + y = 10$",
      "$2x + 3y = 12$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To clear the denominators, multiply every term by the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is 12. $12(\\frac{x}{4}) + 12(\\frac{y}{6}) = 12(1)$ simplifies to $3x + 2y = 12$."
