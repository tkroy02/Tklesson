        "question": "Write in scientific notation: $(7.5 \\times 10^{-6}) \\div (2.5 \\times 10^{-3})$.",
        "options": [
          "$3.0 \\times 10^{-18}$",

          "$3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Divide coefficients: $7.5 / 2.5 = 3.0$. Subtract exponents: $10^{-6 - (-3)} = 10^{-3}$, so $3.0 \\times 10^{-3}$."

    "Commutative Property of Multiplication",
    "Associative Property of Multiplication",
    "Distributive Property",
    "Identity Property of Multiplication"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The Distributive Property states that multiplying a number by a sum gives the same result as multiplying the number by each addend and then adding the products: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. Option A shows the Commutative Property (order), option B shows the Associative Property (grouping), and option D shows the Identity Property (multiplying by 1)."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Degree of term $-5x^6y^2$ is $6+2 = 8$; term $2x^7$ is $7$; term $3x^2$ is $2$; term $xyz^5$ is $1+1+5=7$. Highest is $8$."
