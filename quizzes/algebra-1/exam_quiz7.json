          "$6x^3 + 11x^2 - 18x - 20$",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distribute: $2x(3x^2 - 2x - 4) + 5(3x^2 - 2x - 4) = 6x^3 - 4x^2 - 8x + 15x^2 - 10x - 20$. Combine like terms: $6x^3 + 11x^2 - 18x - 20$."

  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The Commutative Property of Addition states that order does not change the sum: $a + b = b + a$. Option A shows the Associative Property of Multiplication, option C shows the Distributive Property, and option D shows the Identity Property of Addition."

          "$3x^2 + 10x - 8$"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only $3x^2 - 14x - 8$ has a discriminant of 292, which is not a perfect square, so it cannot be factored over the integers. The others have perfect square discriminants and can be factored into integer-coefficient binomials."
