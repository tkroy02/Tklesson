    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factor completely: $x^2 + 7x + 10$",
        "options": [
          "$(x + 5)(x + 2)$",
          "$(x + 7)(x + 3)$",
          "$(x + 10)(x + 1)$",
          "$(x - 5)(x - 2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Find two numbers that multiply to 10 and add to 7. Those numbers are 5 and 2. Therefore, the factors are $(x + 5)(x + 2)$."

          "$(x - 12)(x + 1)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the middle term is negative and the constant is positive, both factors must be negative. $(-6) \times (-2) = 12$ and $(-6) + (-2) = -8$."

          "$(x + 10)(x - 2.5)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a perfect square trinomial. $(-5) \times (-5) = 25$ and $(-5) + (-5) = -10$. This can also be written as $(x - 5)^2$."
