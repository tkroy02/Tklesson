        "question": "What is the equation of a horizontal line passing through $(3, -2)$?",

          "$y = -2$",
          "$x = 3$",
          "$y = 3$",
          "$x = -2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal lines have constant y-values. Since it passes through $(3, -2)$, all points have $y = -2$, so equation is $y = -2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation represents a vertical line?",

          "$y = -4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical lines have constant x-values. Only $x = 5$ has x constant (all points have x = 5)."

          "$0$",
          "$-4$",
          "$1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical lines have undefined slope because $\\Delta x = 0$, making slope $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{0}$ undefined."

          "$y = -x + 6$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All points have $x = 5$ (constant), so it's a vertical line with equation $x = 5$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the y-intercept of the line $x = 7$?",

          "None (does not cross y-axis)",
          "$(0, 7)$",
          "$(7, 0)$",
          "$(0, 0)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical line $x = 7$ never crosses the y-axis (where $x = 0$), so it has no y-intercept."

          "It passes through the origin",
          "It has a positive slope"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y = -1$ is horizontal (constant y), so slope = 0."

          "Draw a vertical line through $(-2, 0)$",
          "Draw a horizontal line through $(0, -2)$",
          "Plot $(-2, 0)$ and use slope 1",
          "Plot $(0, -2)$ and draw horizontal line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x = -2$ means x is always $-2$. This is a vertical line passing through all points where $x = -2$, such as $(-2, 0)$, $(-2, 1)$, $(-2, -1)$, etc."

        ],
