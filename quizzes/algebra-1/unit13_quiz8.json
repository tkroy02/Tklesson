      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\sqrt{x} = 9$",
        "options": ["$81$", "$3$", "$18$", "$9$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides of the equation: $(\\sqrt{x})^2 = 9^2$, which gives $x = 81$."

        "options": ["$11$", "$1$", "$21$", "$16$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $x + 5 = 16$. Subtract 5 from both sides to get $x = 11$."

        "options": ["$25$", "$5$", "$100$", "$50$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, divide by 2 to isolate the radical: $\\sqrt{x} = 5$. Then square both sides to get $x = 25$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\sqrt{x} + 7 = 3$",
        "options": ["No real solution", "$16$", "$-4$", "$4$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolating the radical gives $\\sqrt{x} = -4$. Since the principal square root of a number cannot be negative, there is no real solution."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $2x - 1 = 25$. Add 1 to get $2x = 26$, then divide by 2 to get $x = 13$."

        "options": ["$9$", "$3$", "$-3$", "$49$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isolate the radical: $-\\sqrt{x} = -3$, so $\\sqrt{x} = 3$. Squaring both sides gives $x = 9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $x^2 + 9 = 25$. Subtract 9: $x^2 = 16$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $x = \\pm 4$."
      },

        "options": ["$4$", "$2$", "$0$", "$1$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square both sides: $x = 2x - 4$. Subtract $x$ from both sides: $0 = x - 4$. Adding 4 gives $x = 4$."

        "type": "mcq",

        "options": ["Subtract 3 from both sides", "Square both sides", "Divide by 3", "Square the 12"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must always isolate the radical term before squaring both sides to avoid complex binomial squaring."
