        "question": "Solve: 3x + 5 = 2x + 9",
        "options": ["4", "7", "-2", "14"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract 2x from both sides: 3x - 2x + 5 = 9 → x + 5 = 9. Then subtract 5: x = 4."
      },

        "options": ["6", "1", "-3", "12"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract 2y: 4y - 2y - 7 = 5 → 2y - 7 = 5. Add 7: 2y = 12. Divide by 2: y = 6."

        "options": ["-5", "5", "2", "-0.4"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract 3x: 5x - 3x + 3 = -7 → 2x + 3 = -7. Subtract 3: 2x = -10. Divide by 2: x = -5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Find m: 2(m + 3) = m - 4",
        "options": ["-10", "2", "-2", "0.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distribute: 2m + 6 = m - 4. Subtract m: 2m - m + 6 = -4 → m + 6 = -4. Subtract 6: m = -10."

        "options": ["-1", "3.8", "5", "-5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Add 2x to both sides: 7 = 5x + 12. Subtract 12: -5 = 5x. Divide by 5: x = -1."

        "options": ["0", "3.2", "-3.2", "16"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Add 2n to both sides: 5n + 8 = 8. Subtract 8: 5n = 0. Divide by 5: n = 0."

        "options": ["14/3", "7/3", "2", "3.5"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract 0.5x: 3 = 1.5x - 4. Add 4: 7 = 1.5x. Divide by 1.5: x = 7/1.5 = 14/3 ≈ 4.67."

          "Subtract 2x from both sides",
          "Add 3 to both sides", 
          "Divide both sides by 5",
          "Multiply both sides by 2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When variables appear on both sides, the first step is to get all variable terms on one side. Subtracting 2x gives: 5x - 2x - 3 = 9 → 3x - 3 = 9."
