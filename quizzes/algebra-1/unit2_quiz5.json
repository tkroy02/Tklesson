        "options": ["15", "8", "2", "5/3"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply both sides by 3: (x/3) × 3 = 5 × 3 → x = 15."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply both sides by 3/2 (reciprocal): k = 8 × (3/2) = 24/2 = 12."

        "options": ["-4", "4", "0", "-2"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cross multiply: 2(3y + 2) = 4(y - 1) → 6y + 4 = 4y - 4. Subtract 4y: 2y + 4 = -4. Subtract 4: 2y = -8. Divide by 2: y = -4."

          "Subtract 5 from both sides",
          "Divide both sides by 2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The least common denominator (LCD) of 2 and 3 is 6. Multiply every term by 6: 6×(x/2) + 6×(x/3) = 6×5 → 3x + 2x = 30."
