    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the square root of 25?",
        "options": [
          "5",
          "-5",
          "5 and -5",
          "12.5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "√25 = 5 and -5 because 5² = 25 and (-5)² = 25. Square roots have both positive and negative solutions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does √16 equal?",
        "options": [

          "8",
          "4 and -4",
          "256"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "√16 = 4 (the principal square root). The radical symbol √ refers to the principal (positive) square root unless specified otherwise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the cube root of 8?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "-2",
          "2 and -2",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "∛8 = 2 because 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. Cube roots of positive numbers are positive, and cube roots of negative numbers are negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which expression is read as 'the cube root of 27'?",

          "√27",
          "∛27",
          "27²",
          "27³"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "∛ is the cube root symbol. √ is the square root symbol. ∛27 means 'the cube root of 27.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is √9?",

          "3 and -3",
          "81"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "√9 = 3 (the principal square root). 3² = 9. The radical symbol gives the positive root."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is ∛(-64)?",

          "-4",
          "4",
          "8",
          "-8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "∛(-64) = -4 because (-4)³ = (-4) × (-4) × (-4) = -64. Cube roots of negative numbers are negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If x² = 36, what is x?",
        "options": [
          "6",
          "-6",
          "6 or -6",
          "18"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "x² = 36 means x = √36 or x = -√36, so x = 6 or x = -6. Both satisfy the equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is √0?",

          "0",
          "1",
          "Undefined",
          "0 and 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "√0 = 0 because 0² = 0. Zero is the only number whose square root is itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A square has an area of 49 square units. What is its side length?",
        "options": [
          "7 units",
          "14 units",
          "24.5 units",
          "√49 units"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area = side², so side = √49 = 7 units. This shows a practical application of square roots."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement is TRUE?",

          "∛(-8) = -2",
          "√25 = -5",
          "∛27 = -3"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "∛(-8) = -2 is correct because (-2)³ = -8. Square roots of negative numbers aren't real numbers, and √25 = 5 (positive)."
