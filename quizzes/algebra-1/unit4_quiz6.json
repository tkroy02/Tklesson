      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which line is steeper: $y = 4x + 1$ or $y = -5x + 2$?",
        "options": [
          "$y = -5x + 2$",
          "$y = 4x + 1$",
          "They have the same steepness",
          "Cannot compare different slopes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steepness = absolute value of slope. $|4| = 4$, $|-5| = 5$, so $y = -5x + 2$ is steeper."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Car A travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours. Car B travels 100 miles in 2 hours. Which has greater speed?",
        "options": [
          "Car B",
          "Car A",

          "Cannot determine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Car A: $60/1.5 = 40$ mph. Car B: $100/2 = 50$ mph. Car B is faster."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which function increases fastest as x increases?",
        "options": [

          "$k(x) = x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Compare positive slopes: 3 (f), 0.5 (g), 1 (k). $f(x)$ has largest positive slope (3), so increases fastest."

          "Job A",
          "Job B",
          "Same hourly rate",

        "options": [
          "Tank 1",
          "Tank 2",
          "Same rate",
          "Not enough information to compare"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tank 1: $30/2 = 15$ gal/hr. Tank 2: $40/3 ≈ 13.33$ gal/hr. Tank 1 drains faster."

        "options": ["Line A", "Line B", "Line C", "Line D"],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Line D has the steepest positive slope (rises fastest as x increases)."

  "question": "Compare the following phone plans. Which plan has a higher rate of cost increase per MB used?\n\nPlan A: \\$0.10 per MB\nPlan B: \\$5.00 fixed fee + \\$0.05 per MB",
  "options": [
    "Plan A",
    "Plan B",
    "They have the same rate of increase",
    "It depends on the total MB used"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The 'rate of increase' is the slope (cost per MB). Plan A's slope is 0.10, while Plan B's slope is 0.05. Therefore, Plan A increases at a faster rate regardless of the initial fee."

        "question": "Company X grows by 200 customers/month. Company Y: $y = 150x + 1000$ (y = customers, x = months). Which grows faster?",
        "options": [
          "Company X",
          "Company Y",
          "Same growth rate",
          "Company Y grows faster initially"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Company X: 200 customers/month. Company Y: slope = 150 customers/month. Company X grows faster."

          "$y = -x + 8$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For decreasing functions (negative slopes), compare absolute values: $|-4| = 4$, $|-2| = 2$, $|-1| = 1$. $y = -4x + 10$ decreases fastest."

  "options": [
    "Town A",
    "Town B",
    "They are growing at the same rate",
    "Town B grows faster because it starts with 5,000 people"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Town A's rate is 250 people/year. Town B's rate (slope) is 180 people/year. Even though Town B starts larger, Town A is adding more people per year."
