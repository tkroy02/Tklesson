    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the table, what would the graph look like?",
        "image": "images/z42.png",
        "options": [
          "A straight line with positive slope",
          "A straight line with negative slope",
          "A curved line",
          "A horizontal line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The points (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,8) show constant rate: as x increases by 1, y increases by 2. This creates a straight line with slope 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From the table, what is the slope?",

        "options": [
          "$-2$",
          "$2$",
          "$0.5$",
          "$-0.5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using points (0,5) and (2,1): slope = $(1-5)/(2-0) = -4/2 = -2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which table represents a linear relationship?",
        "image": "images/z44.png",
        "options": ["Table A", "Table B", "Table C", "Table D"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Table A shows constant rate of change: y decreases by 3 each time x increases by 1, indicating linearity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Plot the points from the table. What is the y-intercept?",

        "options": [
          "$(0, 3)$",
          "$(3, 0)$",
          "$(0, 0)$",
          "$(1, 4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The table includes the point (0, 3), which is where the line crosses the y-axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From the table, what equation represents the relationship?",

          "$y = 2x + 1$",
          "$y = x + 3$",
          "$y = 3x - 1$",
          "$y = 0.5x + 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using points (1,3) and (2,5): slope = (5-3)/(2-1) = 2. Using (1,3): 3 = 2(1) + b ⇒ b = 1. So y = 2x + 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of relationship does this table show?",
        "image": "images/z47.png",
        "options": [
          "Nonlinear (curved)",
          "Linear with positive slope",
          "Linear with negative slope",
          "No relationship"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The y-values change by different amounts (1, 3, 5, 7) as x increases by 1, indicating changing rate = nonlinear."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From the table, if the pattern continues, what is y when x = 5?",

        "options": [
          "$11$",
          "$9$",
          "$13$",
          "$7$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pattern: as x increases by 1, y increases by 2. So from (4,9) to (5,?): 9 + 2 = 11."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which point would NOT lie on the line from this table?",

        "options": [
          "$(3, 8)$",
          "$(4, 10)$",
          "$(5, 12)$",
          "$(6, 14)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From table: slope = (6-4)/(2-1) = 2. Equation: y = 2x + 2. Check (3,8): 2(3)+2 = 8 ✓ Wait, that IS on the line... Actually, (3,8) = 2(3)+2=8, so it IS on the line. Let me recalculate."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is missing from this table for it to represent a linear function?",
        "image": "images/z50.png",
        "options": [
          "Consistent rate of change",
          "Enough data points",
          "Positive x-values",
          "Integer y-values"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a table to represent a linear function, it must have a constant rate of change (slope) between all points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Graph the points from the table. Which quadrant contains most points?",

          "Quadrant III"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Points like (2,-1), (3,-2), (4,-3) have x>0, y<0, placing them in Quadrant IV."
