        "question": "The local theater is hosting a concert with different ticket prices. Adult tickets cost \\$25 each, while children's tickets cost \\$15 each. On opening night, the theater sold 120 tickets total and collected \\$2,200 in revenue. How many adult tickets were sold that evening?",

          "60 adults",
          "80 adults"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let a = adult tickets, c = child tickets. System: \\$25a + \\$15c = \\$2,200 and a + c = 120. Solve: from second, c = 120 - a. Substitute: 25a + 15(120-a) = 2200 → 25a + 1800 - 15a = 2200 → 10a = 400 → a = 40."
