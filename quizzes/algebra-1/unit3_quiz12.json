          "$f(x) = 3x + 1$",

          "$f(x) = 2x + 3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using points (2, 7) and (5, 16): Slope $m = \\frac{16 - 7}{5 - 2} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3$. Using (2, 7): $7 = 3(2) + b \\Rightarrow b = 1$. So $f(x) = 3x + 1$."

          "$f(x) = -9x + 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using points (-2, 11) and (1, 2): Slope $m = \\frac{2 - 11}{1 - (-2)} = \\frac{-9}{3} = -3$. Using (1, 2): $2 = -3(1) + b \\Rightarrow b = 5$. So $f(x) = -3x + 5$."

          "The runner stopped moving between $2$ and $3$ hours."

        "answer": "A",

          "The rate of change remained constant at $30$ gal/min."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate [0, 10]: $m = \\frac{200 - 500}{10 - 0} = -30$ gal/min. Rate [10, 20]: $m = \\frac{140 - 200}{20 - 10} = -6$ gal/min. Drainage slowed from 30 to 6 gal/min."

          "Quadrant IV"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Starting at $(0, -b)$ on negative y-axis. Negative slope means as $x$ increases, $y$ decreases further (more negative), moving right into Quadrant IV."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using (-4, 6) and (2, -3): Slope $m = \\frac{-3 - 6}{2 - (-4)} = \\frac{-9}{6} = -1.5$. Line passes through (0, 0). Negative slope through origin exists only in Quadrants II and IV, never Quadrant I."

          "0, 5, 10, 15, 20"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Linear scaling requires equal intervals between values. Only option D has constant increments: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 (each +5). Others have inconsistent jumps."

          "A relationship that is not a function.",
          "A function with a slope of $0$.",

          "A relationship where $y$ is the independent variable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A vertical line (like $x = 5$) fails the Vertical Line Test because one $x$-value corresponds to infinite $y$-values, so it's not a function. Its slope is undefined."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A horizontal line has slope $0$ (no change in $y$ as $x$ changes). It IS a function because each $x$ maps to exactly one $y$, just the same $y$ for all $x$."
