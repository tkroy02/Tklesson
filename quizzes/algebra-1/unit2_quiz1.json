          "105"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract 7 from both sides: x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7 → x = 8. Check: 8 + 7 = 15."

          "-17"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Add 12 to both sides: y - 12 + 12 = 5 + 12 → y = 17. Check: 17 - 12 = 5."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide both sides by 3: 3x ÷ 3 = 27 ÷ 3 → x = 9. Check: 3 × 9 = 27."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply both sides by 4: (x ÷ 4) × 4 = 6 × 4 → x = 24. Check: 24 ÷ 4 = 6."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Add 9 to both sides: 5 + 9 = k - 9 + 9 → 14 = k or k = 14. Check: 14 - 9 = 5."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply both sides by -3: (n ÷ (-3)) × (-3) = 7 × (-3) → n = -21. Check: -21 ÷ (-3) = 7."

          "Divide both sides by 15"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To isolate x, we need to undo subtraction of 15. The inverse operation is addition: add 15 to both sides."
