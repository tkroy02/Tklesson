      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": ["$-18$", "$-8$", "$18$", "$-12.66$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply both sides by the reciprocal $-\\frac{3}{2}$: $x = 12 \\times (-\\frac{3}{2}) = -\\frac{36}{2} = -18$."
      },
      {

        "options": ["$-15$", "$15$", "$0$", "$-1$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply both sides by $-1$: $x = -15$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $0.4x = 2$",
        "options": ["$5$", "$0.8$", "$0.2$", "$50$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide both sides by $0.4$: $x = \\frac{2}{0.4} = 5$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $x - 142 = -200$",
        "options": ["$-58$", "$-342$", "$58$", "$342$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Add $142$ to both sides: $x = -200 + 142 = -58$."
      },

        "options": ["$-\\frac{1}{4}$", "$\\frac{1}{4}$", "$\\frac{5}{4}$", "$-\\frac{1}{2}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract $\\frac{3}{4}$ from both sides: $x = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}$."
      },

        "options": ["Infinite solutions", "No solution", "$x = 0$", "$x = 1$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is an identity. Any real number multiplied by $0$ equals $0$, so all real numbers are solutions."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $|x| = 5$",
        "options": ["$5$ and $-5$", "Only $5$", "Only $-5$", "No solution"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Absolute value represents distance from zero. Both $5$ and $-5$ are $5$ units from zero, so $x = 5$ or $x = -5$."

        "options": ["$12.5$", "$-12.5$", "$0$", "$1$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Divide both sides by $-1$: $12.5 = x$, so $x = 12.5$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{x}{1.5} = 4$",
        "options": ["$6$", "$2.66$", "$5.5$", "$0.375$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply both sides by $1.5$: $x = 4 \\times 1.5 = 6$."
