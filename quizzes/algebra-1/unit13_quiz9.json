    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an irrational number?",
        "options": ["$\\sqrt{2}$", "$\\sqrt{4}$", "$0.75$", "$\\frac{2}{3}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written as a simple fraction and its decimal expansion is non-repeating and infinite."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Classify the number $\\sqrt{100}$.",
        "options": ["Rational", "Irrational", "Not a real number", "Non-terminating"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sqrt{100} = 10$. Since it results in an integer, it is a rational number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement is true about the decimal $0.666...$ (repeating)?",
        "options": ["It is rational because it can be written as $\\frac{2}{3}$.", "It is irrational because it never ends.", "It is rational because it terminates.", "It is irrational because it is a decimal."],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Repeating decimals are rational because they can always be expressed as a ratio of two integers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of $(\\text{Rational}) + (\\text{Rational})$?",
        "options": ["Always Rational", "Always Irrational", "Sometimes Rational", "Not a real number"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sum of two rational numbers is always a rational number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the irrational number in this list.",
        "options": ["$3\\pi$", "$\\sqrt{0.25}$", "$-5$", "$\\frac{22}{7}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Any non-zero rational multiplied by $\\pi$ results in an irrational number. Note that $\\frac{22}{7}$ is a rational approximation, not $\\pi$ itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these square roots is a rational number?",
        "options": ["$\\sqrt{49}$", "$\\sqrt{50}$", "$\\sqrt{20}$", "$\\sqrt{8}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "49 is a perfect square ($7^2$), so its square root is the rational number 7."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of number is $5.123123123...$?",
        "options": ["Rational", "Irrational", "Integer", "Whole Number"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pattern '123' repeats infinitely, making it a rational number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The number $\\sqrt{11}$ falls between which two integers?",
        "options": ["3 and 4", "2 and 3", "5 and 6", "10 and 12"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\sqrt{9}=3$ and $\\sqrt{16}=4$. Since 11 is between 9 and 16, its root is between 3 and 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Classify the number $0$.",
        "options": ["Rational", "Irrational", "Not a real number", "Only a whole number"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zero can be written as $\\frac{0}{1}$, making it a rational number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which set of numbers contains only irrational numbers?",
        "options": ["$\\{\\pi, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5}\\}$", "$\\{0, \\pi, \\sqrt{2}\\}$", "$\\{\\sqrt{4}, \\sqrt{9}, \\sqrt{16}\\}$", "$\\{\\frac{1}{2}, 0.5, 50\\%\\}$"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All numbers in this set are non-terminating, non-repeating decimals."
