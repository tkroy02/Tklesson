        "options": ["5", "-5", "19", "1"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract 2x: x + 7 = 12. Subtract 7: x = 5. Regular one-solution equation."

          "No solution"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Distribute: 4x - 8 = 4x - 8. Variables cancel, true statement remains. Identity with infinite solutions."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distribute: 5x - 3 = 2x + 12. Subtract 2x: 3x - 3 = 12. Add 3: 3x = 15. Divide by 3: x = 5."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "2(x+3)-1 = 2x+6-1 = 2x+5. So 2x+5 = 2x+5 → 5=5. Identity. A and C give false statements, D gives x=4."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Right side: 3(1-x)+4 = 3-3x+4 = 7-3x. So 7-3x = 7-3x → 0=0. Identity with infinite solutions."
