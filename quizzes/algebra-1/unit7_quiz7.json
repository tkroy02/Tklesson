      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method is MOST efficient for: $y = 3x - 2$ and $2x + y = 8$?",
        "options": [
          "Substitution",
          "Elimination",
          "Graphing",
          "All equally efficient"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitution is most efficient because one variable is already isolated ($y = 3x - 2$). Just substitute into the second equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method is MOST efficient for: $3x + 2y = 12$ and $3x - 4y = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "Elimination",
          "Substitution",
          "Graphing",
          "All equally efficient"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elimination is most efficient because both equations have $3x$ term. Subtract equations to immediately eliminate x."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Solve: $2x - (3x - 5) - 6y = 0$ and $4x + (\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x}{6}) + 3y = 0$",
  "options": [
    "$(-\\frac{15}{23}, \\frac{65}{69})$",

    "$(\\frac{5}{13}, -\\frac{65}{117})$",
    "$(-\\frac{5}{13}, \\frac{65}{117})$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "First simplify: Eq1: $2x - 3x + 5 - 6y = 0$ → $-x - 6y = -5$ → $x + 6y = 5$. Eq2: $4x + \\frac{x}{3} + 3y = 0$ → $\\frac{13x}{3} + 3y = 0$ → $13x + 9y = 0$. Solve system: $x = 5 - 6y$, substitute: $13(5-6y) + 9y = 0$ → $65 - 78y + 9y = 0$ → $69y = 65$ → $y = \\frac{65}{69}$, then $x = 5 - 6(\\frac{65}{69}) = -\\frac{15}{23}$."

          "All equally inefficient"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitution requires isolating x or y first, which involves fractions. Elimination is quickest: add equations to eliminate y immediately."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method is BEST for: $\\frac{1}{2}x + y = 5$ and $x - \\frac{1}{3}y = 4$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Clear fractions first by multiplying: $x + 2y = 10$ and $3x - y = 12$. Then elimination works well as coefficients align nicely."

    "When needing visual representation", 
    "When needing approximate solution",
    "When needing exact decimal solutions",
    "When working with systems with 3 variables",
    "When in need of fastest algebraic solution"
  ],
  "answer": ["A", "B"],
  "explanation": "Graphing is best for visual understanding (A) or approximate solutions (B). It's NOT good for exact decimal solutions (needs precise measurement), NOT for 3 variables (can't graph in 2D easily), and NOT fastest for algebraic solutions (substitution/elimination are faster for exact answers)."

  "options": [
    "Elimination by subtraction",
    "Elimination by addition",
    "Substitution",
    "Graphing"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Elimination by subtraction is most efficient because both equations have $6x$ term. Subtract second from first: $(6x+3y)-(6x+y)=48-26$ → $2y=22$ → $y=11$, then solve for x."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitution is most efficient because x is already isolated in first equation. Substitute $x = 4y - 1$ directly into second equation."

          "When slopes are fractions",
          "When system has 2 equations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Graphing gives approximate solutions due to scale and reading accuracy. For exact solutions, use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination)."
