        "question": "What is the $y$-intercept of the line represented by the equation $0.10x + 0.02y = 0.50$?",
        "options": [
          "$(0, 25)$",

          "$(5, 0)$",
          "$(0, 10)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $x = 0$: $0.02y = 0.50$. Divide by $0.02$: $y = 0.50 \\div 0.02 = 25$. So $y$-intercept is $(0, 25)$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $y = 0$: $0.05x = 1.50$. Divide by $0.05$: $x = 1.50 \\div 0.05 = 30$. So $x$-intercept is $(30, 0)$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $y = mx + b$: $2 = 4(3) + b \\Rightarrow 2 = 12 + b \\Rightarrow b = -10$. So $y$-intercept is $(0, -10)$."
