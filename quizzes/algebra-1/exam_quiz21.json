          "$(4, -1)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From first equation: $y = -4x$. Substitute into second: $-2x + 5(-4x) = 22$ → $-22x = 22$ → $x = -1$, then $y = 4$."

    "$-13$",
    "$13$",
    "$-3$",
    "$-9$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "First simplify using order of operations: $7 \\times 2 = 14$, then $3 + 14 - 4 = 17 - 4 = 13$. The additive inverse of $13$ is $-13$, because $13 + (-13) = 0$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply second equation by 4: $4y = 5x + 16$ → $4y - 5x = 16$, which is identical to the first equation, so the system has infinitely many solutions → consistent and dependent."
