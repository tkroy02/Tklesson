        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From first equation: $y = -4x$. Substitute into second: $-2x + 5(-4x) = 22$ → $-22x = 22$ → $x = -1$, then $y = 4$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Multiply second equation by 4: $4y = 5x + 16$ → $4y - 5x = 16$, which is identical to the first equation, so the system has infinitely many solutions → consistent and dependent."
