    "title": "Line of Best Fit",
    "subtitle": "Unit 14 Quiz 7: Linear Regression and Predictions",
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "topic": "Statistics",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary use of a 'Line of Best Fit' in statistics?",
        "options": [
          "To make predictions based on data trends",
          "To connect every single dot in a scatter plot",
          "To find the exact mean of the y-coordinates",
          "To show the outliers in a data set"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A line of best fit models the trend of the data, allowing us to estimate values for x or y that aren't specifically in the data set."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a scatter plot has a strong negative correlation, which equation could represent its line of best fit?",
        "options": [
          "$y = -2x + 10$",
          "$y = 2x + 10$",
          "$y = 10$",
          "$x = 5$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative correlation requires a negative slope ($m$). The equation $y = -2x + 10$ has a slope of $-2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which value of the correlation coefficient ($r$) indicates the strongest relationship between two variables?",
        "options": [
          "$-0.95$",
          "$0.10$",
          "$0.50$",
          "$0.00$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The strength of a correlation is determined by how close the number is to $1$ or $-1$. $-0.95$ is very close to $-1$, indicating a very strong negative relationship."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Extrapolation'?",
        "options": [
          "Predicting a value outside the range of known data",
          "Finding the median of a scatter plot",
          "Predicting a value inside the range of known data",
          "Calculating the slope of the trend line"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Extrapolation is using the trend line to guess values beyond the measured data points, which can be risky if the trend changes later."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the equation of the line of best fit is $y = 3x + 5$, what is the predicted value of $y$ when $x = 10$?",
        "options": [
          "$35$",
          "$13$",
          "$30$",
          "$15$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitute 10 for $x$: $y = 3(10) + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A correlation coefficient of $r = 0.02$ suggests what about the data?",
        "options": [
          "There is almost no linear relationship.",
          "The data follows a strong positive trend.",
          "The data follows a strong negative trend.",
          "All data points lie exactly on the line."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An $r$-value near $0$ indicates very little to no linear correlation between the variables."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How should a line of best fit be drawn on a scatter plot manually?",
        "options": [
          "So that roughly half the points are above and half are below the line",
          "By connecting the first point and the last point",
          "By always passing through the origin (0,0)",
          "By connecting all the outliers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The line should follow the central path of the 'cloud' of dots, balancing the points on either side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the slope of the line of best fit is 0, what does this indicate about the correlation?",
        "options": [
          "No correlation",
          "Perfect positive correlation",
          "Perfect negative correlation",
          "The x-variable is causing the y-variable to stay same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A slope of 0 means that as $x$ increases, $y$ doesn't predictably increase or decrease, indicating no linear correlation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is the most likely $r$-value for a scatter plot where the dots are clustered tightly around a line sloping upward?",
        "options": [
          "$0.92$",
          "$-0.92$",
          "$0.45$",
          "$-0.01$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A tight, upward-sloping cluster indicates a strong positive correlation, which corresponds to an $r$-value close to $1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of a line of best fit, what is a 'residual'?",
        "options": [
          "The vertical distance between a data point and the line",
          "The y-intercept of the line",
          "The total number of points in the set",
          "The average of all x-values"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A residual is the error between the actual data point and the predicted point on the line ($y_{actual} - y_{predicted}$)."
