      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on the graph shown, which equation represents the line?",
        "image": "images/z58.png",
        "options": [
          "$y = 2x - 2$",
          "$y = -2x + 2$",
          "$y = 2x + 2$",
          "$y = -2x - 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From the graph: line passes through (0, -2) and (2, 2). Slope = (2 - (-2))/(2 - 0) = 4/2 = 2. y-intercept = -2. So $y = 2x - 2$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equation of the horizontal line shown in the graph?",

        "options": [
          "$y = 3$",

          "$y = 0$",
          "$x = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Horizontal lines have equation $y = \\text{constant}$. The line crosses the y-axis at 3, so $y = 3$."

          "$y = -2x + 2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From graph points (1, 4) and (3, 0): Slope = (0 - 4)/(3 - 1) = -4/2 = -2. Using point-slope: $y - 4 = -2(x - 1) \\Rightarrow y = -2x + 6$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vertical lines have equation $x = \\text{constant}$. The line crosses the x-axis at -4, so $x = -4$."

        "explanation": "Line passes through (0, -1) and (2, 0). Slope = (0 - (-1))/(2 - 0) = 1/2. y-intercept = -1. So $y = \\frac{1}{2}x - 1$."
