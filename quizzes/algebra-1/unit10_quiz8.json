        "question": "A rectangular garden has length $(2x+5)$ feet and width $(x+3)$ feet. What is the area?",
        "options": [
          "$2x^2 + 11x + 15$ square feet",

          "$2x^2 + 15x + 15$ square feet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area = length × width = $(2x+5)(x+3)$. FOIL: $2x^2 + 6x + 5x + 15 = 2x^2 + 11x + 15$ square feet."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you invest $P$ dollars at $r$ annual interest compounded annually for $t$ years, the value is $P(1+r)^t$. For $P=1000$, $r=0.05$, $t=3$, what polynomial represents the value?",

          "$1000 + 150 = 1150$",
          "$1000 × 1.15 = 1150$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P(1+r)^t = 1000(1+0.05)^3 = 1000(1.05)^3 = 1000(1.157625) = 1157.63$. This shows exponential growth, not linear."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n^2 + 2n + 1) - n^2 = 2n + 1$. This is always an odd number."

        "explanation": "If numbers are $x$ and $y$, then $x+y=10$ and $xy=21$. From first: $y=10-x$. Substitute: $x(10-x)=21$, so $10x - x^2 = 21$, or $x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0$."
