  "options": ["$a + b = b + a$", "$a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$", "$a(b + c) = ab + ac$", "$a + 0 = a$"],
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The Associative Property of Addition states that the grouping of addends does not affect the sum: $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$. Option A shows the Commutative Property, option C shows the Distributive Property, and option D shows the Identity Property of Addition."
