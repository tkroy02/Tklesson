      {
  "type": "multiple_response",
  "question": "Identify the true statements about the polynomial: $5x - 2x^3 + 8$. SELECT ALL THAT APPLY",
  "options": [
    "The leading coefficient is 5",
    "The leading coefficient is -2",
    "The degree is 3",
    "The constant term is 8",
    "The polynomial is in standard form"
  ],
  "answer": ["B", "C", "D"],
  "explanation": "To identify properties, first write it in standard form: $-2x^3 + 5x + 8$. The leading coefficient is -2, the highest exponent (degree) is 3, and the constant is 8. It was not originally in standard form."
