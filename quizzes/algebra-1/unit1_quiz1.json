      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is NOT a real number?",
        "options": [
          "√4",
          "-3.5",
          "√-1",
          "π"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "√-1 is an imaginary number (represented as i). All other options are real numbers: √4 = 2, -3.5 is rational, π is irrational but real."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The number -7 belongs to which sets of numbers?",
        "options": [
          "Integers only",
          "Integers and rational numbers",
          "Whole numbers only",
          "Natural numbers only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "-7 is an integer (no fractional part) and also a rational number (can be written as -7/1). It is NOT a whole number or natural number (those start at 0 or 1)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which set of numbers includes all fractions and integers?",
        "options": [
          "Whole numbers",
          "Natural numbers",
          "Rational numbers",
          "Irrational numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rational numbers include all numbers that can be written as fractions a/b where b≠0. This includes integers (like 3 = 3/1) and fractions (like ½)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "π (pi) is classified as:",
        "options": [
          "A rational number",
          "An integer",
          "An irrational number",
          "A whole number"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "π is an irrational number because it cannot be written as a simple fraction. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which number is both a whole number and an integer?",
        "options": [
          "-2",
          "0.5",
          "0",
          "√2"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "0 is a whole number (starts at 0) and also an integer (no fractional part). -2 is integer but not whole; 0.5 is neither; √2 is irrational."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The set {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} represents:",
        "options": [
          "Whole numbers",
          "Integers",
          "Natural numbers",
          "Rational numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Natural numbers are the counting numbers starting from 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}. Whole numbers include 0: {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}."

          "All integers are whole numbers",
          "All rational numbers are integers",
          "All whole numbers are natural numbers",
          "All integers are rational numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Every integer can be written as a fraction (e.g., 5 = 5/1), so all integers are rational numbers. The reverse is not true (½ is rational but not integer)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "√25 is classified as:",
        "options": [
          "Irrational only",
          "Rational and integer",
          "Integer only",
          "Whole number only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "√25 = 5, which is both a rational number (5/1) and an integer. It's also a whole number and natural number, but 'rational and integer' is most complete."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which number belongs to the MOST subsets of real numbers?",
        "options": [
          "-3",
          "0",
          "2.5",
          "√9"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "√9 = 3 belongs to: natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, and rational numbers. -3 misses natural/whole; 0 misses natural; 2.5 is only rational."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Venn diagram of real numbers shows that:",
        "options": [
          "Natural numbers are outside whole numbers",
          "Integers contain all rational numbers",
          "Irrational numbers overlap with rational numbers",
          "Whole numbers are inside integers"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Whole numbers {0, 1, 2, ...} are a subset of integers {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}. So whole numbers are 'inside' the integer set in a Venn diagram."
