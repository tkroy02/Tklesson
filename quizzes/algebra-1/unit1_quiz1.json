    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes algebra?",
        "options": [
          "A branch of math dealing only with numerical calculation",
          "A system used specifically for solving geometric shapes",
          "A method using symbols to represent numbers and relations",
          "A process for calculating basic percentages and fractions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Algebra uses variables (letters/symbols) to represent unknown quantities and express mathematical relationships, allowing us to solve problems in a general way."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expression 3x + 5, what does the letter 'x' represent?",
        "options": [
          "A specific value that remains fixed and constant",
          "A mathematical operation such as multiplication",
          "A variable that can represent different numbers",
          "A fixed value that is always equivalent to ten"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In algebra, letters like x, y, or z are called variables. They can represent different values depending on the situation, unlike constants which have fixed values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main difference between '3' and 'x' in algebraic expressions?",
        "options": [
          "3 is a variable, while x is a constant value",
          "3 is a constant, while x is a variable value",
          "Both are variables that are written differently",
          "Both are constants that hold different values"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "3 is a constant (its value never changes), while x is a variable (its value can change or be unknown). This is the fundamental building block of algebraic thinking."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is an example of an algebraic expression?",
        "options": [
          "5 + 2 = 7",
          "3x - 8",
          "10 ÷ 2 = 5",
          "π = 3.14"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "3x - 8 is an algebraic expression because it contains a variable (x). The other options are equations or numerical statements without variables."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do mathematicians use variables in algebra?",
        "options": [
          "To make equations look more difficult to solve",
          "To represent unknown values or changing amounts",
          "Because they need more symbols than numbers offer",
          "To write out long equations without much thought"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Variables allow us to work with unknown quantities, create formulas that work for many situations, and express patterns and relationships in a general way."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expression 2y + 7, the number 7 is called a:",
        "options": [
          "Variable",
          "Coefficient",
          "Constant",
          "Exponent"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "7 is a constant because its value doesn't change. A constant is a fixed number in an expression, unlike a variable which can represent different values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a store sells shirts for $15 each, which expression represents the total cost for x shirts?",
        "options": [
          "15 + x",
          "x ÷ 15",
          "15x",
          "15 - x"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "15x means 15 multiplied by x, where x represents the number of shirts. This shows algebra's power: one expression works for any number of shirts!"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which situation would be best represented using algebra?",
        "options": [
          "Counting a specific group of 25 students",
          "Finding the cost for any number of $3 items",
          "Measuring a specific distance of 100 meters",
          "Calculating 50% of a known price of $40"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Algebra is most useful when dealing with unknown or changing quantities. If we don't know how many items we're buying, we can use a variable like x and write 3x for the total cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the expression 2n + 10 represent if n is your age in years?",
        "options": [
          "Twice your age, then subtract 10",
          "Your current age multiplied by 12",
          "Twice your age, then add 10",
          "Your age divided by 2 plus 10"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "2n means '2 times n' or 'twice your age,' and +10 means 'add 10.' So 2n + 10 means 'twice your age plus ten.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is algebraic thinking different from arithmetic thinking?",
        "options": [
          "Algebra uses only letters, while arithmetic uses only numbers",
          "Algebra uses specific math, while arithmetic uses patterns",
          "Algebra uses general relations, while arithmetic uses numbers",
          "Algebra and arithmetic are identical except for the names"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Arithmetic asks: 'What is 5 + 7?' (specific). Algebra asks: 'If I add something to 5, I get 12. What did I add?' (general). Algebra is about patterns and relationships, not just calculations."
