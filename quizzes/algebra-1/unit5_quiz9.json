      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A taxi charges $3.50 base fare plus $2.25 per mile. Which equation represents total cost C for m miles?",
        "options": [
          "$C = 2.25m + 3.50$",
          "$C = 3.50m + 2.25$",
          "$C = 2.25m - 3.50$",
          "$C = 5.75m$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'base fare' is a one-time cost paid at 0 miles, making it the y-intercept ($b = 3.50$). The 'per mile' charge is the rate of change or slope ($m = 2.25$). Putting it into $y = mx + b$ gives $C = 2.25m + 3.50$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A swimming pool has 500 gallons. It drains at 20 gallons per minute. Write an equation for gallons G after t minutes.",
        "options": [
          "$G = -20t + 500$",
          "$G = 20t + 500$",
          "$G = 500t - 20$",
          "$G = -20t - 500$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You start with 500 gallons ($b = 500$). Because the pool 'drains,' the amount of water is decreasing, which means the slope must be negative ($m = -20$). This gives the equation $G = -20t + 500$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plant is 8 inches tall and grows 1.5 inches per week. Write an equation for height H after w weeks.",
        "options": [
          "$H = 1.5w + 8$",
          "$H = 8w + 1.5$",
          "$H = 1.5w - 8$",
          "$H = 9.5w$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The initial height of 8 inches is your starting value (y-intercept). Since 'growth' indicates an increase, the rate is a positive slope ($m = 1.5$). Therefore, $H = 1.5w + 8$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You have $120 and spend $15 each day. Write an equation for money M after d days.",
        "options": [
          "$M = -15d + 120$",
          "$M = 15d + 120$",
          "$M = 120d - 15$",
          "$M = -15d - 120$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $120 is your starting balance (y-intercept). Since you 'spend' the money, your balance goes down by $15 every day, making the slope $-15$. The resulting equation is $M = -15d + 120$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Temperature is 72°F at 8 AM and rises 4°F per hour. Write an equation for temperature T at h hours after 8 AM.",
        "options": [
          "$T = 4h + 72$",
          "$T = 72h + 4$",
          "$T = 4h - 72$",
          "$T = 76h$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The temperature at 8 AM (the start) is 72°F ($b = 72$). The phrase 'rises 4°F per hour' describes a positive rate of change or slope ($m = 4$), leading to $T = 4h + 72$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car rental costs $40 plus $0.25 per mile. Write an equation for cost C for m miles.",
        "options": [
          "$C = 0.25m + 40$",
          "$C = 40m + 0.25$",
          "$C = 0.25m - 40$",
          "$C = 40.25m$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $40 is a 'fixed' cost paid regardless of distance (y-intercept). The 'variable' cost of $0.25 per mile is the slope ($m$). The total cost is represented by $C = 0.25m + 40$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A candle is 12 inches long and burns 0.4 inches per hour. Write an equation for length L after h hours.",
        "options": [
          "$L = -0.4h + 12$",
          "$L = 0.4h + 12$",
          "$L = 12h - 0.4$",
          "$L = 11.6h$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The candle begins at 12 inches ($b = 12$). As it 'burns,' its length decreases, which requires a negative rate of change ($m = -0.4$). The equation for the remaining length is $L = -0.4h + 12$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A phone plan has $30 monthly fee plus $0.10 per text. Write an equation for monthly cost C for t texts.",
        "options": [
          "$C = 0.10t + 30$",
          "$C = 30t + 0.10$",
          "$C = 0.10t - 30$",
          "$C = 30.10t$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The monthly fee of $30 is your constant starting cost (y-intercept). The cost per text ($0.10) is the rate of change that depends on the number of texts ($t$). So, $C = 0.10t + 30$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Water tank has 300 gallons. Water is added at 8 gallons per minute. Write an equation for gallons G after m minutes.",
        "options": [
          "$G = 8m + 300$",
          "$G = 300m + 8$",
          "$G = 8m - 300$",
          "$G = 308m$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The tank starts with 300 gallons ($b = 300$). Adding water increases the volume, so the rate of 8 gallons per minute is a positive slope. The equation is $G = 8m + 300$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You buy a $500 laptop and make $50 monthly payments. Write an equation for balance B after m months.",
        "options": [
          "$B = -50m + 500$",

          "$B = 500m - 50$",
          "$B = 450m$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The original cost of $500 is the starting balance ($b$). Making payments reduces the amount you owe, so the rate of change is $-50$ per month. This gives the balance equation $B = -50m + 500$."
