        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope = rate per MB = $\\$0.10$ per MB. The $\\$20$ is the y-intercept (fixed monthly fee)."

        "options": [
          "$C = 2.25m + 3.50$",
          "$C = 3.50m + 2.25$",
          "$C = 5.75m$",
          "$C = 2.25m - 3.50$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope = rate per mile = $\\$2.25$, y-intercept = initial fee = $\\$3.50$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a steeper slope indicate in a savings account balance vs. time graph?",

          "Higher monthly deposit rate",
          "Lower interest rate",
          "Larger initial deposit",
          "Account has fees"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steeper slope = balance increases faster per month = higher deposit or contribution rate."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A graph shows coffee cooling. What would a curve (not straight line) indicate?",

          "Cooling rate changes over time",
          "Cooling rate is constant over time",
          "Coffee was reheated",
          "Measurement error"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Curve = changing slope = cooling rate isn't constant (cools faster when hotter, slower when closer to room temp)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a revenue vs. advertising spend graph, what does a positive slope of 3 mean?",
        "options": [
          "Each $\\$1$ on ads generates $\\$3$ revenue",
          "Revenue is always $\\$3$",

          "Break-even at $\\$3$ ad spend"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope = $\\frac{\\Delta \\text{revenue}}{\\Delta \\text{ad spend}}$ = 3 means $\\$1$ ad spend → $\\$3$ revenue increase."
