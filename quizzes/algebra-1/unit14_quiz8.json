    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of a two-way frequency table?",
        "options": [
          "To show the relationship between two categorical variables",
          "To calculate the standard deviation of a numerical set",
          "To find the line of best fit for a scatter plot",
          "To list individual data points in numerical order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two-way tables help us see how two different categories (like 'Grade Level' and 'Preferred Lunch') interact with each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a two-way table, where are the 'Marginal Frequencies' located?",
        "options": [
          "In the 'Total' row and 'Total' column",
          "In the four center cells only",
          "Only in the top-left cell",
          "Outside of the table in the legend"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Marginal frequencies are the sums of the rows and columns, located in the margins (edges) of the table."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'Joint Frequency'?",
        "options": [
          "A value in the intersection of a specific row and column",
          "The grand total of all people surveyed",
          "The average of two different categories",
          "The difference between the max and min values"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A joint frequency represents a single count that belongs to both categories (e.g., 10th graders who like pizza)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you add up all the Marginal Frequencies in the 'Total' column, what value should you get?",
        "options": [
          "The Grand Total",
          "The Mean",
          "Zero",
          "The number of categories"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sum of the totals for each row must equal the grand total of the entire survey."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A table shows 20 boys like soccer and 30 girls like soccer. What is the marginal frequency for 'Likes Soccer'?",
        "options": [
          "50",
          "10",
          "20",
          "30"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The marginal frequency is the total for that category: $20 + 30 = 50$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a table has 2 rows and 2 columns of data (excluding totals), how many 'Joint Frequencies' are there?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "2",
          "8",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 2x2 table has four inner cells representing the intersection of the categories."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a survey of 100 people, if 40 are adults and the rest are children, what is the marginal frequency for 'Children'?",
        "options": [
          "60",
          "40",
          "100",
          "0.6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract the known category from the grand total: $100 - 40 = 60$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two-way frequency tables deal with what type of data?",
        "options": [
          "Qualitative (Categorical)",
          "Quantitative (Numerical)",
          "Bivariate Linear",
          "Continuous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These tables are used for non-numerical categories like eye color, gender, or yes/no preferences."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the joint frequency of 'Left-handed' and 'Male' is 5, and the total number of 'Males' is 50, how many 'Right-handed' males are there?",
        "options": [
          "45",
          "55",
          "10",
          "25"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Subtract the joint frequency from the marginal total: $50 - 5 = 45$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a marginal frequency?",
        "options": [
          "The number of 'Yes' responses for a single question",
          "The total number of participants",
          "The number of 'Females' who said 'No'",
          "The sum of the first row"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "'Females who said No' is a joint frequency because it describes two categories at once."
