        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "$y = -4x - 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope $m=4$, y-intercept $b=-1$ (since it passes through $(0, -1)$), so $y = 4x - 1$."

          "$(0, -3)$ and go down 1, right 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Start at y-intercept $(0, 1)$. Slope $-3 = \\frac{-3}{1}$, so down 3, right 1."

        "answer": "A",

          "$y = 4x + 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope $m = \\frac{9-5}{3-1} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$. Using point $(1,5)$: $5 = 2(1) + b \\Rightarrow b = 3$, so $y = 2x + 3$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steepness is the absolute value of slope. $|5| = 5$ vs $|-4| = 4$, so $y = 5x - 2$ is steeper."
