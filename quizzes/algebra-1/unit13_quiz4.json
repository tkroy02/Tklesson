        "question": "A 20-foot ladder leans against a building. If the base of the ladder is 12 feet from the building, how high up the wall does the ladder reach?",
        "options": ["16 feet", "8 feet", "32 feet", "15.5 feet"],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ladder is the hypotenuse. $20^2 - 12^2 = 400 - 144 = 256$. $\\sqrt{256} = 16$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$100^2 + 60^2 = 10000 + 3600 = 13600$. $\\sqrt{13600} \\approx 116.6$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$9^2 + 12^2 = 81 + 144 = 225$. $\\sqrt{225} = 15$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The diagonal is the hypotenuse. $20^2 - 16^2 = 400 - 256 = 144$. $\\sqrt{144} = 12$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distance from Home to Second is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the base paths."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$50^2 + 120^2 = 2500 + 14400 = 16900$. $\\sqrt{16900} = 130$."
