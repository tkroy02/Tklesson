{
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Sam needs at least $120 for a new video game. He has $45 saved and earns $15 per hour tutoring. Which inequality finds hours h he must tutor?",
    "options": [
      "$45 + 15h \\geq 120$",
      "$45 + 15h \\leq 120$",
      "$45 + 15h > 120$",
      "$15h \\geq 120$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "'At least' means $\\geq$. Starting money ($45) + hourly earnings ($15h$) must be greater than or equal to the goal of $120."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "An elevator can hold at most 2,000 pounds. It has 5 people averaging 160 lbs each. Which inequality finds additional weight w it can hold?",
    "options": [
      "$5(160) + w \\leq 2000$",
      "$5(160) + w \\geq 2000$",
      "$5(160) + w < 2000$",
      "$w \\leq 2000$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "'At most' means $\\leq$. The current weight of the people ($5 \\times 160$) plus the extra weight ($w$) cannot exceed 2,000 lbs."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "To get an A, Maria needs an average > 90 on 5 tests. Her first 4 scores: 88, 92, 85, 94. Which inequality finds score x needed on test 5?",
    "options": [
      "$\\frac{88+92+85+94+x}{5} > 90$",
      "$\\frac{88+92+85+94}{4} + x > 90$",
      "$88+92+85+94+x > 90$",
      "$\\frac{x}{5} > 90$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Average is the sum of all scores divided by the number of tests. To find the average of 5 tests, we sum the first four and the unknown fifth ($x$), then divide by 5."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "A phone plan gives 500 minutes free, then $0.25/min. The budget is $75 max. Which inequality finds extra minutes m you can use?",
    "options": [
      "$0.25m \\leq 75$",
      "$0.25m \\geq 75$",
      "$500 + 0.25m \\leq 75$",
      "$0.25(m + 500) \\leq 75$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Since the first 500 minutes are free, the cost only applies to the additional minutes $m$. The cost ($0.25m$) must be less than or equal to the maximum budget of $75."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "A rectangle's length is 3 times its width. The perimeter must be less than 80 cm. Which inequality finds possible widths w?",
    "options": [
      "$2(w + 3w) < 80$",
      "$w + 3w < 80$",
      "$2w + 3w < 80$",
      "$w \\times 3w < 80$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Perimeter formula is $2(\\text{length} + \\text{width})$. If width is $w$ and length is $3w$, the inequality is $2(w + 3w) < 80$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "You can spend at most $50. Sandwiches cost $6.50 each. Which inequality finds the number s of sandwiches you can buy?",
    "options": [
      "$6.50s \\leq 50$",
      "$6.50s \\geq 50$",
      "$6.50 + s \\leq 50$",
      "$s \\leq 50$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The total cost (price $\\times$ quantity) must be 'at most' ($ \\leq $) the total budget of $50."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Temperature must stay between 68°F and 74°F. Current temp is 70°F, changing at 1.5°F/hour. Which inequality finds hours t before leaving range?",
    "options": [
      "$68 < 70 + 1.5t < 74$",
      "$68 \\leq 70 + 1.5t \\leq 74$",
      "$70 + 1.5t > 74$ OR $70 + 1.5t < 68$",
      "$1.5t < 4$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The expression $70 + 1.5t$ represents the temperature over time. To stay 'between' two values (exclusive), it must be greater than the lower bound and less than the upper bound."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "Car rental: $40/day + $0.25/mile. Budget: $100/day max. Which inequality finds miles m you can drive?",
    "options": [
      "$40 + 0.25m \\leq 100$",
      "$40 + 0.25m \\geq 100$",
      "$0.25m \\leq 100$",
      "$40m + 0.25 \\leq 100$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The total cost is the flat fee ($40) plus the variable mileage cost ($0.25m$). This total must be 'max' ($ \\leq $) $100."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "A test has 50 questions. You need at least 70% to pass. Which inequality finds questions q you must answer correctly?",
    "options": [
      "$\\frac{q}{50} \\geq 0.70$",
      "$\\frac{q}{50} \\leq 0.70$",
      "$q \\geq 35$",
      "$q \\leq 35$"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The ratio of correct questions ($q$) to total questions (50) represents the score. 'At least 70%' translates to $\\geq 0.70$."
  },
  {
    "type": "mcq",
    "question": "A plant grows at least 2 cm/week and at most 5 cm/week. After 8 weeks, it's 25 cm tall. Which inequality finds starting height h?",
    "options": [
      "$h + 16 \\leq 25 \\leq h + 40$",
      "$h + 2(8) \\leq 25 \\leq h + 5(8)$",
      "$25 - 40 \\leq h \\leq 25 - 16$",
      "All of the above"
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "After 8 weeks, the growth is between 16 and 40 cm. All options provide mathematically equivalent ways to represent that the final height of 25 is the starting height plus that range of growth."
