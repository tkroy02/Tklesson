    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
     {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of the terms $24x^4y^2$ and $16x^3y^5$?",
        "options": [
          "$8x^3y^2$",
          "$4x^3y^2$",
          "$8x^4y^5$",
          "$16x^3y^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The GCF of 24 and 16 is 8. For the variables, we take the lowest exponent present for each: $x^3$ and $y^2$. Result: $8x^3y^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factor completely: $6x^2 + 9x$",
        "options": [
          "$3x(2x + 3)$",
          "$3(2x^2 + 3x)$",
          "$x(6x + 9)$",
          "$3x(2x + 9)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While 3 and $x$ are both factors, the GCF is $3x$. Factoring out anything less leaves the polynomial 'partially factored' rather than completely factored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factor completely: $12y^3 - 8y^2$",
        "options": [
          "$4y^2(3y - 2)$",
          "$4y(3y^2 - 2y)$",
          "$2y^2(6y - 4)$",
          "$4y^2(3y - 8)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The numerical GCF is 4 and the variable GCF is $y^2$. Options B and C are partially factored but still contain common factors inside the parentheses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factor completely: $15a^4 - 10a^3 + 5a^2$",
        "options": [
          "$5a^2(3a^2 - 2a + 1)$",
          "$5a^2(3a^2 - 2a)$",
          "$5a^2(10a^2 - 5a + 0)$",
          "$15a^2(a^2 - a + 1)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the GCF ($5a^2$) is identical to one of the terms, you must leave a 1 in that position after division ($5a^2 \\div 5a^2 = 1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factor completely: $4x^3y^2 - 8x^2y^3 + 12xy^4$",
        "options": [
          "$4xy^2(x^2 - 2xy + 3y^2)$",
          "$4x^2y^2(x - 2y + 3y^2)$",

          "$8xy^2(x^2 - x + y^2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The GCF is $4xy^2$. Option B is incorrect because $x^2$ is not common to the last term ($12xy^4$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factor completely: $7m^2 - 14m + 21$",
        "options": [
          "$7(m^2 - 2m + 3)$",
          "$7m(m - 2 + 3)$",
          "$7(m^2 - 7m + 14)$",
          "$21(m^2 - m + 1)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The GCF is 7. There is no variable GCF because the constant term (21) does not have an $m$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the GCF of $18x^5y^3$ and $24x^3y^4$?",
        "options": [
          "$6x^3y^3$",
          "$12x^3y^3$",
          "$6x^5y^4$",
          "$2x^3y^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "6 is the largest number that divides 18 and 24. We use $x^3$ and $y^3$ because they represent the lowest powers of each variable found in both terms."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factor completely: $9p^4q - 27p^3q^2 + 18p^2q^3$",
        "options": [
          "$9p^2q(p^2 - 3pq + 2q^2)$",
          "$9p^2q^2(p^2 - 3p + 2q)$",

          "$9p^4q(1 - 3q + 2q^2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GCF = $9p^2q$. Option B is incorrect because the first term only has $q^1$, so $q^2$ cannot be part of the GCF."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Factor completely: $5x^2 + 10x - 15$",
        "options": [
          "$5(x^2 + 2x - 3)$",
          "$5x(x + 2 - 3)$",
          "$5(x^2 + 5x - 10)$",
          "$5(x + 3)(x - 1)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The GCF is 5. While the polynomial *can* be factored further into $(x+3)(x-1)$, the specific step of 'Factoring out the GCF' results in $5(x^2 + 2x - 3)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rectangle has an area of $12x^3y + 18x^2y^2$. If the width is the GCF of these two terms, what is the length?",
        "options": [
          "$2x + 3y$",
          "$6x^2y$",
          "$2x^2 + 3y^2$",
          "$12x + 18y$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The GCF (width) is $6x^2y$. Dividing the area by this width gives $(12x^3y / 6x^2y) + (18x^2y^2 / 6x^2y)$, which simplifies to $2x + 3y$."
