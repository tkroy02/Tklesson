      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the best example of a 'Random Sample' of a high school student body?",
        "options": [
          "Surveying every 5th student who enters the building in the morning",
          "Surveying all the members of the varsity football team",
          "Surveying students sitting at the 'Honors' table in the library",
          "Asking for volunteers to fill out an online survey"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A random sample avoids bias by giving everyone a fair chance to be picked. Surveying specific groups (like athletes or honors students) or relying on volunteers creates selection bias."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A researcher wants to know if a new fertilizer helps plants grow. They give fertilizer to 50 plants and only water to another 50 plants. What type of study is this?",
        "options": [
          "Controlled Experiment",
          "Observational Study",
          "Sample Survey",
          "Case Study"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because a 'treatment' (fertilizer) is actively applied to one group to compare it against a control group, it is an experiment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Population' in a statistical study?",
        "options": [
          "The entire group of individuals about which information is desired",
          "The small group of people who actually answered the survey",
          "The average of all the collected data points",
          "The number of people who refused to participate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The population is the big picture (e.g., all teenagers in the US), while the sample is the group you actually talk to."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A news station asks viewers to call in and vote on a topic. Why might the results be biased?",
        "options": [
          "It is a voluntary response sample, which usually attracts people with strong opinions.",
          "The sample size is too large to be accurate.",
          "It is a random sample, which always has errors.",
          "It doesn't use a mean or median calculation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Voluntary response samples are biased because they don't represent the 'quiet majority'—only those motivated enough to call in."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a sample of 100 students shows that 20% prefer pizza, how many students in a school of 1,000 would you infer prefer pizza?",
        "options": [
          "200",
          "20",
          "100",
          "500"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To make an inference, apply the sample percentage to the whole population: $0.20 \\cdot 1,000 = 200$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would lead to the most 'Generalizable' results?",
        "options": [
          "A large, randomly selected sample",
          "A small sample of experts",
          "A large sample of volunteers",
          "A small, randomly selected sample"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Generalizability increases with sample size and the use of randomness to eliminate bias."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Bias' in statistics?",
        "options": [
          "A systematic error that results in an unrepresentative sample",
          "When the mean and median are the same",
          "When a researcher uses too many decimal places",
          "The distance between the maximum and minimum values"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bias occurs when the method used to collect data consistently over-represents or under-represents certain parts of the population."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ice cream shop surveys only customers buying vanilla ice cream about their favorite flavor. This is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "Sampling Bias",
          "A Random Sample",
          "An Experiment",
          "A Census"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By only asking vanilla customers, the shop is excluding people who prefer other flavors, leading to a biased result."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To determine the effect of music on study habits, a teacher observes students in the library without interfering. This is a(n):",
        "options": [
          "Observational Study",
          "Controlled Experiment",
          "Sample Survey",
          "Theoretical Probability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the teacher is just watching and not assigning specific music or 'treatments,' it is an observational study."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is most important for showing that one thing 'Causes' another?",
        "options": [
          "A randomized, controlled experiment",
          "A strong positive correlation on a scatter plot",
          "A very large sample survey",
          "A high frequency in a two-way table"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Correlation does not equal causation. Only a controlled experiment can help establish a cause-and-effect relationship."
