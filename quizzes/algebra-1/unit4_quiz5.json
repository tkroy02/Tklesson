      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard form of a linear equation?",
        "options": [
          "$Ax + By = C$",
          "$y = mx + b$",
          "$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$",
          "$\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} = 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard form is $Ax + By = C$, where A, B, and C are integers, and A should be non-negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To graph $2x + 3y = 12$ using intercepts, what is the x-intercept?",

          "$(0, 6)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For x-intercept, set $y = 0$: $2x + 3(0) = 12 \\Rightarrow 2x = 12 \\Rightarrow x = 6$, so $(6, 0)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$(0, 2)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For y-intercept, set $x = 0$: $5(0) - 2y = 10 \\Rightarrow -2y = 10 \\Rightarrow y = -5$, so $(0, -5)$."
      },

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 4 \\Rightarrow 3y = 2x - 12 \\Rightarrow -2x + 3y = -12 \\Rightarrow 2x - 3y = 12$ (multiply by -1)."

          "$4y = 12 - 2x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard form should have A ≥ 0. $-3x + 4y = 8$ has negative A. It should be written as $3x - 4y = -8$."

          "$(0, 0)$ and $(3, 4)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "x-intercept: $3x + 4(0) = 12 \\Rightarrow x = 4$, so $(4, 0)$. y-intercept: $3(0) + 4y = 12 \\Rightarrow y = 3$, so $(0, 3)$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a disadvantage of graphing from standard form compared to slope-intercept form?",
        "options": [
          "You need to calculate both intercepts",
          "You can't find the slope easily",
          "It only works for vertical lines",
          "The graph will be less accurate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In standard form, you typically find both intercepts to graph, whereas slope-intercept gives starting point and direction immediately."

        "question": "Convert to slope-intercept form: $4x - 2y = 8$",

          "$y = 4x - 8$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$4x - 2y = 8 \\Rightarrow -2y = -4x + 8 \\Rightarrow y = 2x - 4$."

    "$2x - 3y = 6$",
    "$y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 6$",
    "$y = \\frac{2}{3}x - 4$"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Parallel lines must have the same slope. The slope of $2x + 3y = 6$ is $-2/3$. Option A has the same slope. Option C is the reciprocal error, and Option D has the wrong sign."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set $y = 0$: $-x + 2(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow -x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$. So x-intercept is $(0, 0)$ (origin)."
