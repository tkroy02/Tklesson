    "duration": 20,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are 'like terms' in an algebraic expression?",
        "options": [
          "Terms with the same coefficient",
          "Terms with identical variable parts",
          "Terms that are next to each other",
          "Terms with the same sign"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Like terms have exactly the same variables raised to exactly the same exponents. The coefficients can be different."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify: 5x + 3x",
        "options": [
          "8x",
          "8x²",
          "15x",
          "Cannot simplify"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "5x and 3x are like terms (same variable x). Add coefficients: 5 + 3 = 8, keep the variable: 8x."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 4y - 9y?",
        "options": [
          "5y",
          "-5y",
          "13y",
          "-13y"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "4y and -9y are like terms. Subtract coefficients: 4 - 9 = -5, keep the variable: -5y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify: 2a + 3b - a + 5b",

          "a + 8b",
          "3a + 8b",
          "a + 2b",
          "2ab"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combine like terms: a terms: 2a - a = a; b terms: 3b + 5b = 8b. Different variables stay separate: a + 8b."
      },

          "10x"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constants: 7 - 3 = 4. x terms: 2x + x = 3x. Combine results: 4 + 3x. Remember: x means 1x."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "2m² + 2m",
          "2m⁴ + 6m²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "m² terms: 3m² - m² = 2m². m terms: 2m + 4m = 6m. m² and m are NOT like terms (different exponents)."
      },

          "-5x + 1",
          "-x + 1",
          "-5x + 9",
          "-x + 9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "x terms: -3x - 2x = -5x. Constants: 5 - 4 = 1. Combine: -5x + 1."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "3y² and 4y²",
          "7 and -3",
          "4x and 4y"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "4x and 4y have different variables (x vs y), so they are not like terms. All other pairs have identical variable parts."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First distribute: 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6. Then combine like terms: 2x + 6 + 3x = 5x + 6."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combine like terms: x terms: 2x + x + 3x = 6x. Constants: 3 + 4 - 1 = 6. So: 6x + 6."
