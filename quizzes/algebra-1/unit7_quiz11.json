      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The sum of two numbers is 60. One number is 4 times the other. Which system of equations represents this situation?",
        "options": [
          "$x + y = 60$, $x = 4y$",
          "$x + y = 60$, $y = 4x$",
          "$x - y = 60$, $x = 4y$",
          "$x + y = 60$, $x + y = 4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sum means addition: $x + y = 60$. '4 times the other' means: $x = 4y$ (if x is the larger number)."

        "type": "mcq",

          "$c = 50 - w$, $c + 2w = 140$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heads: each animal has 1 head → $c + w = 50$. Legs: chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs → $2c + 4w = 140$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With wind: distance = rate × time → $900 = (p + w) × 2$ → $p + w = 450$. Against wind: $900 = (p - w) × 3$ → $p - w = 300$."
