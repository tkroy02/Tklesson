    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which expression represents '5 more than a number x'?",
        "options": [
          "5x",
          "x - 5",
          "x + 5",
          "5 - x"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "'More than' means addition. '5 more than x' means we start with x and add 5: x + 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would you write 'the product of 7 and a number n'?",
        "options": [
          "7 + n",
          "7 - n",
          "7n",
          "n ÷ 7"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "'Product' means multiplication. The product of 7 and n is written as 7 × n or simply 7n."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which expression means '12 decreased by a number y'?",
        "options": [
          "y - 12",
          "12 - y",
          "12y",
          "y ÷ 12"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Decreased by' indicates subtraction. Start with 12 and subtract y: 12 - y. Order matters!"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the algebraic expression for 'three times a number, increased by 8'?",
        "options": [
          "3x + 8",
          "3(x + 8)",
          "8x + 3",
          "3x - 8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Three times a number' is 3x. 'Increased by 8' means add 8. So: 3x + 8."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which phrase matches the expression 2(x - 4)?",
        "options": [
          "Two times a number, minus 4",
          "Two times the difference of a number and 4",
          "Two minus four times a number",
          "The difference of two times a number and 4"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The parentheses show we first subtract 4 from x, then multiply by 2. This is 'twice the difference of a number and 4.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would you write 'the quotient of a number and 5'?",
        "options": [
          "5x",
          "x + 5",
          "x ÷ 5",
          "5 ÷ x"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "'Quotient' means division. 'The quotient of a number and 5' means x divided by 5: x ÷ 5 or x/5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which expression represents 'seven less than twice a number'?",
        "options": [
          "7 - 2x",
          "2x - 7",
          "2(x - 7)",
          "7x - 2"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Twice a number' is 2x. 'Seven less than' means subtract 7 from that: 2x - 7. The subtraction comes after the multiplication."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the expression 3x² represent in words?",
        "options": [
          "Three times a number",
          "Three plus a number squared",
          "Three times the square of a number",
          "The square of three times a number"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "3x² means 3 times (x squared). First square x, then multiply by 3: 'three times the square of a number.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Translate: 'The sum of twice a number and five is equal to 15'",
        "options": [
          "2x + 5 = 15",
          "2(x + 5) = 15",
          "2x = 5 + 15",
          "x + 2 + 5 = 15"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Twice a number' = 2x, 'sum of' means add, 'and five' = +5, 'is equal to' = =. So: 2x + 5 = 15."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rectangle's length is 3 more than twice its width. If width = w, what is the length?",
        "options": [
          "2w",
          "2w + 3",
          "3w + 2",
          "w + 3"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Twice its width' = 2w. '3 more than' means add 3: 2w + 3. This is a common real-world translation."
