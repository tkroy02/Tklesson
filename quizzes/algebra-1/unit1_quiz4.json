      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which expression represents '7 more than a number n'?",
        "options": [
          "7n",
          "n - 7", 
          "n + 7",
          "7 - n"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "'More than' means addition. Start with the number n, then add 7: n + 7."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would you write 'the product of 8 and a number x'?",
        "options": [
          "8 + x",
          "8 - x",
          "8x",
          "x ÷ 8"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "'Product' means multiplication. The product of 8 and x is 8 × x, written as 8x."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which expression means '15 decreased by a number y'?",
        "options": [
          "y - 15",
          "15 - y",
          "15y",
          "y ÷ 15"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Decreased by' indicates subtraction. Start with 15, then subtract y: 15 - y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the algebraic expression for 'twice a number, increased by 5'?",
        "options": [
          "2x + 5",
          "2(x + 5)",
          "x² + 5",
          "x + 10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Twice a number' is 2x. 'Increased by 5' means add 5. So: 2x + 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which phrase matches the expression 3(x - 4)?",
        "options": [
          "Three times a number, minus 4",
          "Three times the difference of a number and 4",
          "Three minus four times a number",
          "The difference of three times a number and 4"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The parentheses show we subtract 4 from x first, then multiply by 3. This is 'three times the difference of a number and 4.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would you write 'the quotient of a number and 6'?",
        "options": [
          "6x",
          "x + 6",
          "x / 6",
          "6 / x"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "'Quotient' means division. 'The quotient of a number and 6' means x divided by 6: x ÷ 6 or x/6."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which expression represents 'five less than twice a number'?",
        "options": [
          "5 - 2x",
          "2x - 5",
          "2(x - 5)",
          "5x - 2"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Twice a number' is 2x. 'Five less than' means subtract 5 from that: 2x - 5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the expression x² + 3 represent in words?",
        "options": [
          "Three times a number",
          "A number squared, plus three",
          "Three plus a number, then squared",
          "The square of three times a number"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "x² means 'x squared' or 'a number squared.' Adding 3 gives 'a number squared, plus three.'"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Translate: 'The sum of three times a number and 8 is 20'",

          "3x + 8 = 20",
          "3(x + 8) = 20",

          "x + 3 + 8 = 20"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Three times a number' = 3x, 'sum of' means add, 'and 8' = +8, 'is' = =. So: 3x + 8 = 20."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rectangle's width is 5 less than its length. If length = L, what is the width?",

          "5 - L"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'5 less than its length' means start with length L, then subtract 5: L - 5."
