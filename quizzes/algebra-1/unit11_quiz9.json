      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The area of a rectangle is $60$ square units. The length is $4$ units longer than the width ($w$). Which equation can be used to find the width?",
        "options": [
          "$w(w + 4) = 60$",
          "$w + (w + 4) = 60$",
          "$2w + 2(w + 4) = 60$",
          "$w^2 + 4 = 60$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area is length times width. Since length is $w + 4$, the equation is $w(w + 4) = 60$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The height of a projectile is given by $h = -16t^2 + 64t$. At what times ($t$) is the object on the ground ($h = 0$)?",

          "$0$ and $4$ seconds",
          "$0$ and $16$ seconds",

          "$2$ seconds only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor the equation: $-16t(t - 4) = 0$. This gives $t = 0$ and $t = 4$."
      },

          "$-12$ and $-11$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x(x + 1) = 132 \\rightarrow x^2 + x - 132 = 0$. Factors are $(x + 12)(x - 11) = 0$. Since they must be positive, $x = 11$."

          "$5$ cm",
          "$8$ cm",
          "$4$ cm",
          "$10$ cm"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area = $\\frac{1}{2}bh \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}(h+3)h = 20 \\rightarrow h^2 + 3h - 40 = 0$. Factors are $(h+8)(h-5)$. Height must be $5$."

          "$0.5$ inches",
          "$4$ inches"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "New dimensions are $(5+2x)$ and $(7+2x)$. $(5+2x)(7+2x) = 63$. Solving for $x$ gives $1$."
      },

          "$2$ and $24$",
          "$8$ and $10$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$x(x + 2) = 48 \\rightarrow x^2 + 2x - 48 = 0 \\rightarrow (x + 8)(x - 6) = 0$. The positive integer is $6$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$-5(t^2 - 4t - 5) = 0 \\rightarrow -5(t - 5)(t + 1) = 0$. Time must be positive, so $t = 5$."

          "$x + 15$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Factor the area: $(x + 3)(x + 6)$. Since one factor is the width $(x + 3)$, the other must be the length."
