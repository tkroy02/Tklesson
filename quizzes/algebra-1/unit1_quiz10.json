    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the FIRST step in solving any word problem?",
        "options": [
          "Write an equation",
          "Look for keywords",
          "Understand the problem",
          "Do calculations"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Always start by understanding what the problem is asking. Read carefully, identify what's given and what's needed."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a problem says 'three times a number increased by 5 is 17', what should you do first?",
        "options": [
          "Multiply 3 by 5",
          "Write 3x + 5 = 17",
          "Subtract 5 from 17",
          "Divide 17 by 3"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Translate the words to algebra: 'three times a number' = 3x, 'increased by 5' = +5, 'is 17' = = 17. So: 3x + 5 = 17."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You're checking if your answer to 2(x + 3) = 14 is correct. What should x = 4 give you?",
        "options": [
          "2(4 + 3) = 2(7) = 14 ✓",
          "2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ✗",
          "2 × 4 + 3 = 11 ✗",
          "4 + 3 = 7 ✗"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitute x = 4 back: 2(4 + 3) = 2(7) = 14. This verifies the solution. Always check your work!"
      },

        "question": "A rectangle's length is 5 more than its width. Perimeter is 30. Which equation represents this?",
        "options": [
          "2w + 2(w + 5) = 30",
          "w + (w + 5) = 30",
          "w(w + 5) = 30",
          "2w + (w + 5) = 30"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Width = w, Length = w + 5. Perimeter = 2w + 2l = 2w + 2(w + 5) = 30."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You solved 3x - 7 = 8 and got x = 5. How do you verify?",
        "options": [
          "3(5) - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8 ✓",
          "3(8) - 7 = 24 - 7 = 17 ✗",
          "5 - 7 = -2 ✗",
          "3 × 5 = 15, 15 - 8 = 7 ✗"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitute x = 5: 3(5) - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8. Since this equals the right side (8), the solution is correct."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which strategy helps when you're stuck on a problem?",
        "options": [
          "Try a simpler example with numbers",
          "Guess randomly",
          "Skip it entirely",
          "Use a calculator for everything"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Try specific numbers to understand the pattern. If confused by variables, use actual numbers to see what's happening."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The sum of two consecutive integers is 25. What are they? First step:",
        "options": [
          "Let x = first integer, x + 1 = second",
          "Divide 25 by 2",
          "Try 10 and 15",
          "Subtract 1 from 25"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Define variables: Let x = first integer, then next consecutive integer = x + 1. Equation: x + (x + 1) = 25."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "You have $20. Burgers cost $3 each. How many can you buy? What operation?",
        "options": [
          "20 ÷ 3 ≈ 6 (can't buy ⅔ burger, so 6)",
          "20 × 3 = 60",
          "20 - 3 = 17",
          "20 + 3 = 23"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Division finds how many times $3 fits into $20. 20 ÷ 3 = 6.67, but you can only buy whole burgers, so 6."

          "Do everything in your head",
          "Rush through to finish fast",
          "Only check if the answer looks right"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Writing steps helps track your thinking, find errors, and shows your work. This is essential for learning and checking."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After solving, you should always:",
        "options": [
          "Check if the answer makes sense in context",
          "Forget about it and move on",
          "Assume it's correct",
          "Ask someone else for the answer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Check context: If finding people, answer should be whole number. If finding money, reasonable amount. If distance, positive. Always ask: 'Does this make sense?'"
