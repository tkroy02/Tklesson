        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the Associative Property allow you to do?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Distributive Property multiplies a number by a sum: a(b + c) = ab + ac. This connects multiplication and addition."

          "Additive Identity Property"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Multiplicative Identity Property states that any number multiplied by 1 equals itself. 1 is the multiplicative identity."

          "Identity Property"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This shows the Associative Property of Addition - changing the grouping of addends doesn't change the sum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a + b = b + a, this represents the:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is the Commutative Property of Addition in algebraic form. It works for multiplication too: a × b = b × a."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the Distributive Property: 3(x + 4) = 3x + 3×4 = 3x + 12."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which number is the additive identity?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "-1",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "0 is the additive identity because adding 0 to any number doesn't change it: a + 0 = a."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What property allows you to write 25 × 4 × 3 as 25 × (4 × 3)?",

        "question": "A real-world example of the Commutative Property is:",
        "options": [
          "Putting on socks then shoes vs shoes then socks",
          "Adding eggs to flour or flour to eggs when baking",
          "Packing books in boxes then stacking vs stacking then packing",
          "Counting money from largest to smallest bills vs smallest to largest"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In baking, adding eggs to flour gives the same mixture as adding flour to eggs. The order doesn't change the final result, similar to 3 + 2 = 2 + 3."
