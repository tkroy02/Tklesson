    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expression 4x² + 3x - 7, how many terms are present?",
        "options": [
          "1 term",
          "2 terms", 
          "3 terms",
          "4 terms"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Terms are separated by + or - signs. This expression has three terms: 4x², 3x, and -7."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq", 
        "question": "In the term -5y³, what is the coefficient?",
        "options": [
          "-5",
          "5",
          "y³",
          "3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficient is the numerical factor of a term, including its sign. For -5y³, the coefficient is -5."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these terms are 'like terms'?",
        "options": [
          "3x and 3y",
          "2x² and 2x",
          "5y and -3y", 
          "4 and 4x"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Like terms have identical variable parts (same variables with same exponents). 5y and -3y both have variable 'y' with exponent 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the coefficient in the term 'x'?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "x",
          "There is no coefficient"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a term appears as just 'x', it actually means 1x. The coefficient 1 is understood and not written."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which expression has exactly two terms?",
        "options": [
          "3x",
          "x + y - z",
          "2a + 5b",
          "4m² - 3m + 7"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "2a + 5b has two terms: 2a and 5b. Remember: terms are separated by + or - signs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the expression 2x + 3y - x + 4, which terms can be combined?",
        "options": [
          "2x and 3y",
          "3y and 4",
          "2x and -x",
          "All terms can be combined"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Only like terms can be combined. 2x and -x are like terms (same variable x). The others have different variables or are constants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What makes two terms 'like terms'?",
        "options": [
          "They have the same coefficient",
          "They have identical variable parts",
          "They are next to each other in an expression",
          "They both contain variables"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Like terms must have exactly the same variables raised to exactly the same exponents. The coefficients can be different."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the term 7ab, what is the coefficient?",
        "options": [
          "7",
          "a",
          "b",
          "ab"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficient is the numerical factor. In 7ab, the coefficient is 7, and 'ab' is the variable part."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair shows terms that are NOT like terms?",
        "options": [
          "3x² and 5x²",
          "2y and -4y",
          "8 and 12",
          "4m and 4n"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "4m and 4n are not like terms because they have different variables (m vs n). Constants (like 8 and 12) are like terms with each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Simplify: 3x + 2y - x + 5",
        "options": [
          "2x + 2y + 5",
          "4x + 2y + 5",
          "3x + 2y - x + 5 (cannot simplify)",
          "5xy + 5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combine like terms: 3x - x = 2x. 2y and 5 have no like terms, so the simplified expression is 2x + 2y + 5."
