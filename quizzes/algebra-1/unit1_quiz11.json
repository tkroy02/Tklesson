      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "John has 3 times as many marbles as Sarah. Together they have 48 marbles. How many does Sarah have?",
        "options": [
          "12",
          "16",
          "24",
          "36"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let x = Sarah's marbles. John has 3x. Equation: x + 3x = 48 → 4x = 48 → x = 12. Sarah has 12, John has 36."
