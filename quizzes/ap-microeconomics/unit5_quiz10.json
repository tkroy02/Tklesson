        "question": "In long-run equilibrium, a perfectly competitive industry:",
        "options": [
          "Losses are tolerable because of high fixed costs.",
          "In order to stay in the industry, each firm is making an economic profit.",
          "Each firm is producing at the minimum point on its LRAC curve.",
          "Individual firms will have no incentive for technological improvement.",
          "Must exhibit economies of scale."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, P = min LRAC, so firms produce at minimum efficient scale. Firms earn zero economic profit, not positive profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a perfectly competitive firm is at its profit-maximizing level of output, we can say that it:",
        "options": [
          "Is producing where MC = AC.",
          "Is producing where price exceeds marginal cost.",
          "Is doing as well as it can and is making a profit.",
          "May be making a profit or incurring a loss.",
          "Is producing where P = AVC."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "At profit-maximizing output (P = MC), the firm may be making profit (if P > ATC) or loss (if P < ATC) in the short run. It is doing as well as possible given cost and price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand curve facing a perfectly competitive firm depends on:",
        "options": [
          "The marginal cost of the firm.",
          "Market supply alone.",
          "Market demand and the market supply curve.",
          "Market demand and the firm’s supply curve.",
          "Market demand alone."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The firm’s demand curve is perfectly elastic at the market price, which is determined solely by market demand and market supply together. However, the firm itself is a price taker, so its demand depends on the market price set by market demand and supply, but the elasticity (horizontal) is independent of its own costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the output level required to achieve the minimum long-run average cost is so great that it will take up an appreciable share of the market, then:",
        "options": [
          "The firm is guaranteed to earn economic profits.",
          "Its supply curve will slope upward to the right because of increasing returns to scale.",
          "The firm will no longer be a price taker.",
          "The market demand curve will be horizontal.",
          "The firm will remain competitive because it will still be a quantity adjuster."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If minimum efficient scale is large relative to the market, the industry will naturally have few firms, moving toward oligopoly or monopoly. The firm will have market power and will not be a price taker."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comparing the short-run and long-run profit-maximizing positions of a perfectly competitive firm, which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "The firm may have unexploited economies of scale in both the short run and the long run.",
          "Price will equal marginal cost in the short run, but not necessarily in the long run.",
          "Price should equal average cost in the long run, but not necessarily in the short run.",
          "The firm will produce at minimum average cost in both the short and long run.",
          "Economic profit may exist in the short run and in the long run."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium, P = min ATC. In the short run, P may be above or below ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following terms would best describe the elasticity facing a competitive firm?",
        "options": [
          "Unit",
          "Inelastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A perfectly competitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price, which is perfectly elastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a perfectly competitive firm in the short run is producing where P = ATC = MC, we can say that this firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Earning economic profits.",
          "At its profit-maximizing output level.",
          "Obliged to shut down.",
          "On the downward-sloping portion of the demand curve.",
          "Incurring losses."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "P = MC ensures profit maximization. P = ATC means zero economic profit (break-even)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the demand curve that the firm faces is downward sloping, we can reasonably believe that the:",
        "options": [
          "Firm has no control over the price of the product it sells but can vary the output.",
          "Firm can influence the price of the product it sells.",
          "Firm’s contributions to total output of the product is insignificant.",
          "Firm will have no effect on the price of the product it sells.",
          "Firm must lower prices if it hopes to increase its profits."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A downward-sloping demand curve implies market power; the firm can influence price by changing its output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If firms in a competitive industry are suffering losses, then one would expect that in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "Each firm would raise its price until it was breaking even.",
          "The demand curve for the product will shift to the left, causing equilibrium output and price to decline.",
          "The supply curve for the product will shift to the left as firms leave the industry, causing industry output to fall and price to rise.",
          "There would be no change in the number of firms in the industry as long as firms are covering their average variable costs.",
          "The supply curve for the product will shift to the right as individual firms lower their prices to increase their sales."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Losses cause exit, shifting supply left, raising market price until remaining firms break even."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A long-run competitive equilibrium is impossible if:",
        "options": [
          "The industry’s long-run supply curve slopes downward continuously.",
          "The industry supply curve slopes upward.",
          "All firms have downward-sloping LRAC curves at all levels of output.",
          "All firms have U-shaped LRAC curves.",
          "All firms are producing where P = ATC."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If LRAC slopes downward indefinitely (economies of scale at all outputs), one firm could supply the entire market at lower cost, leading to monopoly, not perfect competition."
