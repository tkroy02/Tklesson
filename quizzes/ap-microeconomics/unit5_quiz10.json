    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run equilibrium in perfect competition, firms produce where:",
        "options": [
          "Price equals average variable cost.",
          "Price equals marginal cost and equals average total cost.",
          "Marginal cost is minimized.",
          "Economic profits are positive."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Long-run equilibrium requires P = MC (profit max) and P = ATC (zero economic profit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a perfectly competitive firm maximizes profit in the short run, it:",
        "options": [
          "Always earns positive economic profit.",
          "May earn profit, break even, or incur loss.",
          "Must shut down if price is below ATC.",
          "Produces where price is greater than marginal cost."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Short-run profit maximization (P = MC) can result in profit, loss, or breaking even depending on the relationship between price and ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand curve faced by an individual perfectly competitive firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Downward sloping.",
          "The same as the market demand curve.",
          "Horizontal at the market price.",
          "Upward sloping."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Because the firm is a price taker, it can sell any quantity at the market price, so its demand curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm’s minimum efficient scale is very large relative to market demand, the market structure is most likely to become:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition.",
          "Monopolistic competition.",
          "Oligopoly or monopoly.",
          "Unchanged; still perfectly competitive."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Large minimum efficient scale means only a few firms can operate efficiently, leading to oligopoly or natural monopoly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a perfectly competitive firm will shut down if:",
        "options": [
          "Price is less than average total cost.",
          "Price is less than average variable cost.",
          "It is incurring any economic loss.",
          "Marginal cost is greater than price."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shutdown occurs if P < AVC; the firm cannot cover variable costs and minimizes loss by producing zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The price elasticity of demand for a perfectly competitive firm’s product is:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic.",
          "Unitary elastic.",
          "Perfectly inelastic.",
          "Elastic but not perfectly so."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The firm faces a horizontal demand curve, meaning it can sell any quantity at the market price — perfectly elastic demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a perfectly competitive firm is producing where P = MC and P = ATC, we know the firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Earning normal profit only.",
          "Earning economic profit.",
          "Incurring an economic loss.",
          "About to shut down."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "P = MC means profit maximization; P = ATC means zero economic profit (normal profit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If firms in a perfectly competitive industry are earning economic losses, in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "Firms will raise prices.",
          "Some firms will exit, reducing supply and raising price.",
          "Demand will increase to restore profit.",
          "Government will subsidize the firms."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Losses cause exit, which reduces market supply, raises market price, and restores zero economic profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for a perfectly competitive firm in both short-run and long-run equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "P = ATC",
          "P = MC",
          "P = MR",
          "MC = ATC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "P = MC holds in both short-run and long-run profit maximization. P = ATC only in long-run equilibrium; P = MR always true; MC = ATC only at min ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive market achieves allocative efficiency because:",
        "options": [
          "Firms produce at minimum ATC.",
          "Price equals marginal cost.",
          "Firms earn zero economic profit.",
          "There are many buyers and sellers."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency occurs where P = MC, meaning the last unit produced provides a marginal benefit equal to marginal cost."
