        "question": "Game Theory is most commonly used for analyzing the pricing behavior of firms in which market structure?",

          "Perfect Competition",
          "Monopolistic Competition",

          "Oligopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Game theory is used to analyze strategic interaction and interdependence between firms, which is the defining feature of oligopoly markets."

        "question": "GloboMart is the only seller of household cleaning supplies in a certain state and is currently earning economic profits. In order to increase those profits, GloboMart is investigating a policy of price discrimination. In order to implement this policy, GloboMart must be",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "facing a perfectly elastic demand curve",
          "able to separate consumers into different groups based on demand elasticities",
          "experiencing economies of scale in the relevant range of production",
          "experiencing constant returns to scale in the relevant range of production",
          "producing in the inelastic portion of its demand curve to raise its price and increase total revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Successful price discrimination requires the ability to segment consumers by elasticity of demand, prevent resale between groups, and have market power—all of which GloboMart possesses as a monopoly."

          "zero economic profit."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Due to free entry and exit, monopolistically competitive firms earn zero economic profit in the long run, similar to perfect competition, but produce where P > MC and have excess capacity."

        "options": [
          "Firms can easily enter the industry when profits are high.",

          "They always collude to increase profits.",
          "They use strategic decision making."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Oligopoly is defined by strategic interdependence—firms make decisions based on expected reactions of rivals. Entry is difficult (A false), there are fewer firms than in monopolistic competition (B false), firms are interdependent (C false), and collusion is not automatic (D false)."

          "P = MC"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total revenue is maximized when marginal revenue equals zero. Beyond that point, selling additional units reduces total revenue (MR becomes negative). MR = MC is the profit‑maximizing condition, not revenue‑maximizing."

          "There is no Nash Equilibrium."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Brewer’s has a dominant strategy to concentrate on fries. Given Brewer’s chooses fries, Royal’s best response is to choose burgers (120 > 85). This yields the Nash equilibrium: (Fries, Burgers) = (150, 120)."

          "When both firms bid low",
          "When both firms bid high"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Nature View has a dominant strategy to bid low (always yields higher profit). Given Nature View bids low, Evergreen’s best response is to bid high ($520 > $500). Nash equilibrium: (Evergreen High, Nature View Low)."

        "options": [
          "Neither E Soda nor R Soda has a dominant strategy",
          "E Soda has a dominant strategy but R Soda does not",
          "R Soda has a dominant strategy but E Soda does not",
          "Both firms will choose the high price strategy",
          "Both firms will choose the low price strategy"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Both firms have a dominant strategy to choose Low Price. No matter what the other does, each earns more with Low Price. Thus the Nash equilibrium is (Low Price, Low Price) with profits ($25, $25)."

          "TUV",
          "UVW"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the triangle between the demand curve and marginal cost curve from the monopoly output to the socially efficient output. In this graph, that triangle is R–T–V: between monopoly quantity Q₁ (point R vertically on demand, V on MC) and efficient quantity Q₃ (point T where P = MC)."
