      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the prisoner's dilemma game, the dominant strategy leads to an outcome that is:",
        "options": [
          "Pareto efficient",
          "Socially optimal",
          "Individually rational but collectively suboptimal",
          "Both individually and collectively optimal"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Each prisoner confesses because it’s the best move regardless of the other’s choice, but both would be better off if both remained silent—hence individually rational but collectively worse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the payoff matrix below. What is Firm A’s best response if Firm B chooses 'Advertise'?\n\nFirm B: Advertise  Not Advertise\nFirm A: Advertise   (4, 4)      (8, 1)\n          Not Adv.    (2, 8)      (6, 6)",
        "options": [
          "Advertise",
          "Not Advertise",
          "Indifferent between both",
          "Depends on additional information"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If B advertises: A gets 4 if it advertises vs. 2 if it does not → best response is Advertise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the same matrix, the Nash equilibrium is:",
        "options": [
          "(Advertise, Advertise)",
          "(Advertise, Not Advertise)",
          "(Not Advertise, Advertise)",
          "(Not Advertise, Not Advertise)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Check each: (Advertise, Advertise) is stable because neither firm wants to unilaterally deviate (4 > 2 for A; 4 > 1 for B)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cartel is most stable when:",
        "options": [
          "Members have different cost structures",
          "The product is homogeneous and entry is blocked",
          "Demand is highly volatile",
          "There are many members"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Homogeneous products make agreements easier to monitor; blocked entry prevents new firms from undermining the cartel; these conditions enhance stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If oligopolists successfully collude, they will jointly produce where:",
        "options": [
          "Each firm’s MR = MC",
          "Market MR = Market MC",
          "P = ATC for each firm",
          "P = MC for the market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A colluding cartel acts like a multi-plant monopoly, maximizing total profit where industry MR = industry MC, then allocates output among members."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price leadership in an oligopoly is a form of:",
        "options": [
          "Explicit collusion",
          "Tacit collusion",
          "Price discrimination",
          "Predatory pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price leadership involves no formal agreement—one firm sets price, others follow—which avoids legal issues of explicit collusion while coordinating prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Clayton Act of 1914 primarily targeted:",
        "options": [
          "Monopolization attempts",
          "Price fixing agreements",
          "Anti-competitive mergers and interlocking directorates",
          "International trade restrictions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Clayton Act strengthened antitrust law by prohibiting mergers that reduce competition, interlocking directorates, and certain exclusive dealings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the kinked demand curve model, the gap in the MR curve results from:",
        "options": [
          "Different elasticities above and below the current price",
          "Government price controls",
          "Technological change",
          "Entry of new firms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rivals match price cuts (demand inelastic below kink) but not price increases (demand elastic above kink), creating a discontinuity in MR."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A strategy of limit pricing is used to:",
        "options": [
          "Maximize short-run profit",
          "Signal high quality",
          "Deter potential entrants",
          "Comply with price ceilings"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Limit pricing means setting price below the short-run profit-maximizing level to make the market less attractive to new competitors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key difference between monopolistic competition and oligopoly?",
        "options": [
          "Product differentiation",
          "Downward-sloping demand",
          "Interdependence among firms",
          "Free entry and exit"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In oligopoly, firms are interdependent—each firm’s decisions affect rivals. In monopolistic competition, each firm is small enough that its actions don’t significantly impact others."
