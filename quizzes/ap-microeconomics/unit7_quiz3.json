      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a payoff matrix for two firms deciding whether to set a high or low price, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both set low prices. This outcome is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "Successful collusion",
          "A dominant strategy equilibrium",
          "Price leadership",
          "Product differentiation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If both firms have a dominant strategy to 'low price,' the Nash equilibrium will be (Low, Low), even if (High, High) would yield higher joint profits—this is the prisoner's dilemma."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a cartel agreement breaks down, it is usually because:",
        "options": [
          "Members have an incentive to cheat to increase individual profit.",
          "Demand for the product becomes more elastic.",
          "The government imposes price floors.",
          "Members want to increase market transparency."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each member can increase its own profit by secretly lowering price or increasing output beyond its quota, undermining the cartel—a classic cheating incentive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm in an oligopoly that follows the pricing behavior of a dominant firm in the industry is engaging in:",
        "options": [
          "Predatory pricing",
          "Price discrimination",
          "Price leadership",
          "Limit pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Price leadership is a form of tacit collusion where one firm (the leader) sets prices and others (followers) match, avoiding explicit agreements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the payoff matrix below. The dominant strategy for Firm B is:\n\nFirm B\n      High Price   Low Price\nFirm A High  (10, 10)   (2, 12)\n       Low   (12, 2)    (5, 5)",
        "options": [
          "High price",
          "Low price",
          "No dominant strategy",
          "Dependent on Firm A's choice"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For Firm B: If A chooses High, B gets 10 with High vs. 12 with Low → choose Low. If A chooses Low, B gets 2 with High vs. 5 with Low → choose Low. Low price is dominant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the same matrix, the Nash equilibrium is:",
        "options": [
          "(High, High)",
          "(High, Low)",
          "(Low, High)",
          "(Low, Low)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Both firms have a dominant strategy of Low price. Thus (Low, Low) is the Nash equilibrium—neither firm can improve by unilaterally changing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Antitrust laws are designed to:",
        "options": [
          "Promote collusion among firms.",
          "Encourage mergers to reduce costs.",
          "Prevent monopolization and promote competition.",
          "Allow price fixing if it benefits consumers."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Antitrust laws (like the Sherman Act) aim to prevent anti-competitive behavior: monopolization, collusion, mergers that reduce competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common feature of monopolistic competition but NOT of oligopoly?",
        "options": [
          "Interdependence among firms",
          "Many firms in the industry",
          "Significant barriers to entry",
          "Kinked demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolistic competition has many small firms; oligopoly has few large interdependent firms. Interdependence and kinked demand are oligopoly traits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If oligopolistic firms engage in limit pricing, they are attempting to:",
        "options": [
          "Maximize short-run profit",
          "Deter entry of new firms",
          "Signal willingness to collude",
          "Comply with antitrust regulation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Limit pricing means setting price low enough to make entry unattractive for potential rivals, preserving market power in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long-run equilibrium of monopolistic competition, price equals:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost",
          "Minimum average total cost",
          "Average total cost",
          "Marginal revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Due to free entry/exit, firms earn zero economic profit in the long run, so P = ATC (but P > MC and ATC is not minimized)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market structure is most likely to use non-price competition such as advertising and product differentiation?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "Oligopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolistically competitive firms rely heavily on advertising and product variation to differentiate their goods, since they cannot compete solely on price."
