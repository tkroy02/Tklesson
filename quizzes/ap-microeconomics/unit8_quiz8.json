    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a monopsonistic firm determine the wage rate for its workers?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Where MFC equals MRP",
          "Where supply equals demand",
          "Where MRP equals supply",
          "Where MFC equals supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monopsonist hires where MFC = MRP to maximize profit, then pays the wage indicated by the labor supply curve at that quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a profit‑maximizing firm, which condition must hold when determining the optimal use of labor?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor equals the marginal factor cost (MFC).",
          "The firm’s operating costs are minimized when the marginal product equals the average product.",
          "The total revenue is maximized irrespective of labor costs.",
          "The marginal product of labor is at its highest point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Profit is maximized when MRP = MFC, whether in competitive or monopsony labor markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, the demand curve for labor is?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Downward‑sloping",
          "Vertical",
          "Upward‑sloping",
          "Horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Labor demand is the MRP curve, which slopes downward due to diminishing marginal product of labor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens in the factor market for high‑skilled workers when technology advances and increases these workers’ productivity?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Demand for high‑skilled workers decreases due to substitution with technology‑enhanced processes.",
          "Demand for high‑skilled workers increases, leading potentially higher wages if supply remains constant.",
          "There is no change; technological advancements have minimal impact on skilled worker markets due to their specialized skills set being irreplaceable by technology alone.",
          "Supply for high‑skilled workers decreases because fewer individuals want these now more demanding jobs."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Technology often complements high‑skilled labor, raising MPL and shifting labor demand right, increasing wages if supply is unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm's marginal revenue product of labor (MRPₗ) is given by MRPₗ = 100 − 2L and the wage rate is $40, what is the profit‑maximizing level of labor employed?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "50 workers",
          "20 workers",
          "30 workers",
          "40 workers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Set MRP = wage: 100 − 2L = 40 → 2L = 60 → L = 30."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A technological innovation increases the marginal product of labor in a perfectly competitive industry. If all other factors remain constant, what will happen to the labor demand curve and the equilibrium wage rate?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Labor demand shifts left; wage rate decreases",
          "Labor demand shifts right; wage rate increases",
          "Labor demand shifts right; wage rate remains constant",
          "Labor demand is unchanged; wage rate increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher MPL raises MRP, shifting labor demand right. With upward‑sloping labor supply, equilibrium wage rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm is currently employing labor with MPL = 15 at a wage of $5 and capital with MPK = 24 at a rental rate of $12. What is the opportunity cost of maintaining this input allocation rather than optimizing?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "$1 per unit of output",
          "$0.50 per unit of output",
          "$3 per unit of output",
          "No opportunity cost exists"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MP per dollar: labor = 15/5 = 3, capital = 24/12 = 2. Since MP/$ is higher for labor, reallocating $1 from capital to labor increases output by 1 unit. The opportunity cost of not optimizing is 1 unit of output per misallocated dollar."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most likely result of the government imposing a minimum wage above the market equilibrium?",

        "options": [
          "The equilibrium wage will decrease.",
          "There will be a surplus of labor (unemployment).",
          "The quantity of labor demanded will increase.",
          "The supply curve will shift to the left."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage creates a surplus of labor: quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, resulting in unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government introduces a new payroll tax to be paid by employers, how will it affect the labor market equilibrium?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The demand for labor will shift to the left.",
          "The supply of labor will shift to the right.",
          "The equilibrium quantity of labor will increase.",
          "The net wage received by workers will increase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A payroll tax on employers raises the cost of hiring, shifting labor demand left, lowering equilibrium quantity and potentially reducing wages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors is most likely to cause a rightward shift in the labor supply curve?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A decline in the demand for the manufactured product.",
          "A higher price of complementary resources used in production.",
          "A decrease in the productivity of the resource.",
          "An increase in the number of qualified workers entering the market."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "More workers entering the market increase labor supply at every wage, shifting the supply curve right. Other options affect labor demand, not supply."
