      {

        "question": "If the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is maximizing profits, the correct price/output combination will be:",

        "options": [
          "Price = 6, Quantity = 6",
          "Price = 3, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 10, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 7, Quantity = 8",
          "Price = 8, Quantity = 7"

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Profit maximization occurs where MR = MC (Q = 5). Price is found by moving up from Q = 5 to the demand curve, giving P = 10."
