      {

        "question": "If the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is maximizing profits, the correct price/output combination will be:",
        "image": "images/mono4.png",
        "options": [
          "Price = 6, Quantity = 6",
          "Price = 3, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 10, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 7, Quantity = 8",
          "Price = 8, Quantity = 7"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Profit maximization occurs where MR = MC (Q = 5). Price is found by moving up from Q = 5 to the demand curve, giving P = 10."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is maximizing profits, the actual profit earned will be:",

        "options": [
          "20",
          "15",
          "35",
          "10",
          "40"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At Q = 5, P = 10, ATC = 7. Profit = (P − ATC) × Q = (10 − 7) × 5 = 15."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Remembering that the firm depicted in Figure 1 is a profit-maximizing monopolist, in long-run equilibrium price and output will be:",
        "image": "images/mono4.png",
        "options": [
          "Price = 6, Quantity = 6",
          "Price = 3, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 10, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 7, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 8, Quantity = 7"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In monopoly, barriers to entry prevent new competition, so long-run equilibrium remains at the profit-maximizing point: MR = MC at Q = 5, price from demand = 10."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is able to practice 1st degree (perfect) price discrimination. If it could do this successfully, the total number of units sold and the price of the last unit sold will be:",
        "image": "images/mono4.png",
        "options": [
          "price of last unit = 6, total quantity sold = 6",
          "price of last unit = 3, total quantity sold = 5",
          "price of last unit = 10, total quantity sold = 5",
          "price of last unit = 7, total quantity sold = 8",
          "price of last unit = 8, total quantity sold = 7"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Under perfect price discrimination, the monopolist sells where D = MC. In this graph, D and MC intersect at Q = 7, and the price on the demand curve at that quantity is P = 8."

          "80"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Under perfect price discrimination, TR = area under demand curve up to where D = MC (Q = 7). Demand intercept = 18, price at Q=7 = 8. Trapezoid area = ((18+8)/2)×7 = 91."
