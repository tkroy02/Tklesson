    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist's marginal revenue will always be less than market price. This is because:",
        "options": [
          "There are substantial startup costs and other barriers to entry.",
          "The firm is able to practice perfect price discrimination.",
          "Demand and marginal revenue have an inverse relationship.",
          "Because monopolist always have higher production costs than other types of firms or industries.",
          "The monopolist must reduce the price of all units of output, not just an additional unit, in order to increase sales."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "To sell an additional unit, a monopolist must lower price on all units sold, reducing revenue from previous units, so MR < P."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When you go to the movies, the theater is a monopoly vendor of popcorn while you're there. Suppose that the cost to the theater of fake butter flavoring and yellow food coloring rise significantly, what will happen to the price and quantity of popcorn sold by the theater.",
        "options": [
          "The price of popcorn will rise and the quantity sold will increase.",
          "The price of popcorn will rise and the quantity sold will fall.",
          "The price of popcorn will remain unchanged and the quantity sold will remain unchanged.",
          "The price of popcorn will fall and the quantity sold will fall.",
          "The price of popcorn will fall and the quantity sold will increase."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher variable costs increase MC. The monopolist will produce less (where MR = new higher MC) and charge a higher price (due to downward-sloping demand)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Due to the increase in the cost of fake butter flavoring and yellow food coloring the theater will experience:",
        "options": [
          "an increase in profits from popcorn sales because the demand for popcorn shifted out.",
          "an increase in profits from popcorn sales because the demand for popcorn shifted back.",
          "a reduction in profits from popcorn sales because fixed costs rose.",
          "a reduction in profits from popcorn sales because variable costs rose.",
          "a reduction in profits from popcorn sales because the demand for popcorn shifted back."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Rising variable costs reduce profit because they increase MC, lowering output and raising price, but the higher cost per unit and lower quantity reduce overall profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider the demand curves shown in Figure 2. If D is the demand curve for a monopolist, which demand curve represents the one that it will face if a second firm enters the industry.",
        "image": "images/mono5.png",
        "options": [
          "D1",
          "D2",
          "D3",
          "D4",
          "D5"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When a second firm enters, the original firm’s demand becomes more elastic and shifts left (lower quantity at each price) because it loses market share. D4 is slightly flatter and shifted inward relative to D, reflecting this change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Again using the demand curves shown in Figure 2, if D is the demand curve for one of two firms in an industry, which demand curve represents the one that it will face if it is able to force the other firm to leave the industry by winning a patent infringement suit against the other firm.",
        "image": "images/mono5.png",
        "options": [
          "D1",
          "D2",
          "D3",
          "D4",
          "D5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If one of two firms becomes the sole producer (monopoly), its demand curve becomes steeper and shifts rightward (higher quantity at each price) because it captures the rival’s market share. D3 reflects this—steeper and to the right of D."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The data in Table 1 above are for Lane, the only vendor of brick oven baked goat cheese and avocado pizzas at a sporting event. Q is the number of pizzas sold each hour, P is the price in dollars and TR is the total revenue (just P × Q). If the vendor determines that her profit maximizing price per pizza is $15 then her marginal cost for each pizza must be:",

          "over $14 but no more than $15"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At P = $15, Q = 6. MR between Q=5 and Q=6 is $10, between Q=6 and Q=7 is $8. At Q=6, MR ≈ $9. Profit max requires MC = MR, so MC is over $8 but no more than $10."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose at the next sporting event, a few weeks later, we observe Lane (still with the same monopoly on brick oven baked goat cheese and avocado pizzas) selling her pizzas for $17 each. If nothing has changed about the demand data we know then that her new marginal cost for each pizza must be:",
        "image": "images/mono6.png",

          "over $6 but no more than $8",
          "over $8 but no more than $10",

          "over $14 but no more than $16"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "At P = $17, Q = 4. MR between Q=3 and Q=4 is $14, between Q=4 and Q=5 is $12. At Q=4, MR ≈ $13. Profit max requires MC = MR, so MC is over $12 but no more than $14."

        "question": "The marginal revenue facing a monopolist",
        "options": [
          "is the same as the demand facing the monopolist.",
          "shows the change in the profits level of the firm.",
          "lies below the average revenue.",
          "at first falls to a minimum and then rises as output is increased.",
          "is the same as the average revenue facing the monopolist."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a monopolist, average revenue (AR) equals price and is the demand curve. Because MR < P for all units beyond the first (price must be lowered on previous units to sell more), the MR curve lies below the AR (demand) curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve because",
        "options": [
          "its average revenue equals its marginal revenue.",
          "its supply curve is upward sloping.",
          "it sells typically to only one consumer.",
          "its demand curve is the market demand curve.",
          "demand is perfectly inelastic."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A monopolist is the only seller in the market, so its demand curve is the market demand curve, which slopes downward due to the law of demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopolist marginal revenue falls faster than price because",
        "options": [
          "the cost of producing extra units of output increases as production is increased.",
          "to sell additional units the price must be lowered on all units sold.",
          "marginal revenue is larger than price.",
          "profits are maximized when marginal cost equals marginal revenue.",
          "the firm has no supply curve."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because a monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve, selling more requires lowering the price not just on the extra unit, but on all previous units as well, causing MR to fall faster than price."
