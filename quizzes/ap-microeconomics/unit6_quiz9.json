        "question": "If the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is maximizing profits, the correct price/output combination will be:",

        "options": [
          "Price = 6, Quantity = 6",
          "Price = 3, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 10, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 7, Quantity = 8",
          "Price = 8, Quantity = 7"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Profit maximization occurs where MR = MC (Q = 5). Price is found by moving up from Q = 5 to the demand curve, giving P = 10."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At Q = 5, P = 10, ATC = 7. Profit = (P − ATC) × Q = (10 − 7) × 5 = 15."

          "Price = 6, Quantity = 6",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In monopoly, barriers to entry prevent new competition, so long-run equilibrium remains at the profit-maximizing point: MR = MC at Q = 5, price from demand = 10."
