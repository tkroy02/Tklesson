      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is maximizing profits, the correct price/output combination will be:",
        "image": "images/mono4.png",
        "options": [
          "Price = 6, Quantity = 6",
          "Price = 3, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 10, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 7, Quantity = 8",
          "Price = 8, Quantity = 7"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Profit maximization occurs where MR = MC (Q = 5). Price is found by moving up from Q = 5 to the demand curve, giving P = 10."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is maximizing profits, the actual profit earned will be:",
        "image": "images/mono4.png",
        "options": [
          "20",
          "15",
          "35",
          "10",
          "40"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At Q = 5, P = 10, ATC = 7. Profit = (P − ATC) × Q = (10 − 7) × 5 = 15."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Remembering that the firm depicted in Figure 1 is a profit-maximizing monopolist, in long-run equilibrium price and output will be:",
        "image": "images/mono4.png",
        "options": [
          "Price = 6, Quantity = 6",
          "Price = 3, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 10, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 7, Quantity = 5",
          "Price = 8, Quantity = 7"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In monopoly, barriers to entry prevent new competition, so long-run equilibrium remains at the profit-maximizing point: MR = MC at Q = 5, price from demand = 10."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is able to practice 1st degree (perfect) price discrimination. If it could do this successfully, the total number of units sold and the price of the last unit sold will be:",
        "image": "images/mono4.png",
        "options": [
          "price of last unit = 6, total quantity sold = 6",
          "price of last unit = 3, total quantity sold = 5",
          "price of last unit = 10, total quantity sold = 5",
          "price of last unit = 7, total quantity sold = 8",
          "price of last unit = 8, total quantity sold = 7"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Under perfect price discrimination, the monopolist sells where D = MC. In this graph, D and MC intersect at Q = 7, and the price on the demand curve at that quantity is P = 8."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the monopolist depicted in Figure 1 is able to practice 1st degree (perfect) price discrimination its total revenue will be:",

          "144",
          "80"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Under perfect price discrimination, TR = area under demand curve up to where D = MC (Q = 7). Demand intercept = 18, price at Q=7 = 8. Trapezoid area = ((18+8)/2)×7 = 91."

        "question": "Suppose a small town in Northern California has only one restaurant. Suppose the annual earthquake insurance premiums for that restaurant increase. Which of the following would we expect in the short-run:",
        "options": [
          "An increase in prices and no change in the number of meals sold.",
          "An increase in prices and a decrease in the number of meals sold.",
          "No change in prices and no change in the number of meals sold.",
          "A decrease in prices and no change in the number of meals sold.",
          "A decrease in prices and an increase in the number of meals sold."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Insurance premiums are fixed costs. Fixed costs do not affect MC or MR, so the monopolist’s profit-maximizing price and quantity remain unchanged in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Again considering the restaurant whose earthquake insurance premiums rose, which of the following would we expect in the long-run when compared with the period just before the insurance premiums rose (if nothing else changes):",
        "options": [
          "An increase in prices and no change in the number of meals sold.",
          "An increase in prices and a decrease in the number of meals sold.",
          "No change in prices and no change in the number of meals sold.",
          "A decrease in prices and no change in the number of meals sold.",
          "A decrease in prices and an increase in the number of meals sold."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In monopoly, barriers to entry prevent exit. Higher fixed costs lower profit but do not shift MC or demand. Thus, price and quantity remain unchanged in the long run as well."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the diamond industry is a monopoly and suppose that there is an increase in the productivity of diamond miners. Which of the following would you predict will happen in the market for diamonds in the short run.",
        "options": [
          "An increase in the price of diamonds and no change in the number of diamonds sold.",
          "An increase in the price of diamonds and a decrease in the number of diamonds sold.",
          "No change in the price of diamonds and no change in the number of diamonds sold.",
          "A decrease in the price of diamonds and no change in the number of diamonds sold.",
          "A decrease in the price of diamonds and an increase in the number of diamonds sold."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity lowers MC. The monopolist will produce where MR = new lower MC, resulting in higher output and lower price (due to downward-sloping demand)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Again considering the effect of an increase in the productivity of diamond miners. Which of the following best describes the resulting profit experience of the diamond industry.",
        "options": [
          "an increase in profits from diamond sales because variable costs fell.",
          "an increase in profits from diamond sales because the demand for diamond shifted out.",
          "an increase in profits from diamond sales because fixed costs fell.",
          "a reduction in profits from diamond sales because variable costs rose.",
          "a reduction in profits from diamond sales because the demand for diamond shifted back."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity reduces variable costs (including MC), allowing the monopolist to increase output, lower price, and raise total profit, assuming demand is unchanged."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Publishing companies typically charge libraries higher subscription rates than individuals for technical journals. The best explanation for the ability of the firms to do this is that:",
        "options": [
          "libraries have more inelastic demands for technical journals than individuals so the publishers are able to engage in price discrimination.",
          "individuals need the journals more so the publishers gives them a break.",
          "libraries have more elastic demands for technical journals than individuals so the publishers are able to engage in price discrimination.",
          "individuals have more inelastic demands for technical journals so the publishers are able to engage in price discrimination.",
          "since libraries have unlimited budgets publishers simply take advantage of them."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is third-degree price discrimination. Libraries have inelastic demand (few substitutes, essential for collections), so they are charged a higher price. Individuals have more elastic demand (can forgo subscriptions), so they pay less."
