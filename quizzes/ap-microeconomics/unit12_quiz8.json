        "question": "Suppose consumer tastes shift toward the consumption of apples. Which of the following statements is an accurate description of the impact of this event on the market for apples?",
        "options": [
          "There is an increase in the quantity demanded of apples along the demand curve and in the supply for apples.",
          "There is an increase in the demand and supply of apples.",
          "There is an increase in the demand for apples and a decrease in the supply of apples.",
          "There is a decrease in the quantity demanded of apples along the demand curve and an increase in the supply for apples.",
          "There is an increase in the demand for apples and an increase in the quantity supplied of apples along the supply curve."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Increased taste for apples shifts demand right. Higher demand raises price, which increases quantity supplied (movement along supply curve). Supply does not shift unless a supply determinant changes."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose both buyers and sellers of wheat expect the price of wheat to rise in the near future. What would we expect to happen to the equilibrium price and quantity in the market for wheat today?",
        "options": [
          "The impact on both price and quantity is ambiguous.",
          "Price will decrease; quantity is ambiguous.",
          "Price will increase; quantity will decrease.",
          "Price will increase; quantity is ambiguous.",
          "Price will increase; quantity will increase."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Buyers expect higher future prices → demand increases today (shift right). Sellers expect higher future prices → supply decreases today (shift left). Both shifts increase price today. Quantity depends on relative shift magnitudes, so quantity change is ambiguous."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An inferior good is one for which an increase in income causes a(n)",
        "options": [
          "decrease in supply.",
          "increase in demand.",
          "increase in supply.",
          "decrease in demand."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Inferior good: demand decreases when income rises (negative income elasticity). Supply is not directly affected by changes in consumer income."

        "question": "Floor-Mart is one of many firms hiring workers in a perfectly competitive labor market. If Floor-Mart's demand for labor increases, how will this impact the number of workers hired by Floor-Mart and the equilibrium wage in this labor market.",
        "options": [
          "The firm will hire fewer workers and the equilibrium wage will increase.",
          "The firm will hire the same number of workers and the equilibrium wage will increase.",
          "The firm will hire the same number of workers and the equilibrium wage will decrease.",
          "The firm will hire more workers and the equilibrium wage will increase.",
          "The firm will hire more workers and the equilibrium wage will remain the same."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, a single firm’s demand increase does not affect market wage. The firm is a wage taker, so wage unchanged; firm hires more workers at that wage along its MRP curve."

          "A lump-sum tax for Iocane Powder",
          "Perfect price discrimination"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "MSC > MSB → overproduction relative to social optimum. A per-unit tax raises private cost, reducing quantity toward socially optimal level."

          "It would not affect the wage difference between men and women"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Progressive tax takes a larger percentage from higher incomes, reducing after-tax income inequality."

          "Marginal social cost is equal to marginal external benefit."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Positive externality: MSB = MPB + external benefit → MSB > MPB at market equilibrium (where MPB = MPC)."

          "Price No change, Quantity Decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fewer bees reduce honey supply (left shift) → price increases, quantity decreases."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inelastic demand: price increase → small drop in quantity → total revenue rises."
