    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A city enacts a rent control ordinance that fixes apartment prices below the market equilibrium. In the long run, the resulting shortage is likely to be exacerbated because:",
        "options": [
          "The supply of housing becomes more elastic as landlords convert units to non-rental uses.",
          "The demand for housing becomes perfectly inelastic as consumers view housing as a necessity.",
          "The price ceiling eliminates the deadweight loss typically associated with competitive markets.",
          "The income effect of the lower price causes a contraction in the quantity of housing demanded."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Supply is more elastic in the long run. Landlords respond to suppressed returns by failing to maintain units or converting them to condos or commercial use, shrinking the available rental stock further."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government imposes a tax on a market where the demand curve is perfectly inelastic, the economic burden of the tax will:",
        "options": [
          "Fall entirely on consumers while creating zero deadweight loss in the market.",
          "Fall entirely on producers as they cannot pass costs to price-sensitive buyers.",
          "Be shared equally between buyers and sellers to maintain market equilibrium.",
          "Lead to a significant contraction in quantity, maximizing the deadweight loss."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers purchase the same quantity regardless of price. Producers pass the entire tax on, and because quantity does not change, no deadweight loss is created."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A binding minimum wage in a competitive labor market is expected to create unemployment primarily because:",
        "options": [
          "The quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity of labor demanded at that wage.",
          "The substitution effect causes firms to hire more labor instead of utilizing capital.",
          "The demand for labor becomes perfectly elastic at wages above the equilibrium level.",
          "Workers respond to higher wages by significantly reducing their total hours of work."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A price floor above equilibrium creates a surplus. In the labor market, a surplus of labor is defined as unemployment, where more people want to work than firms are willing to hire."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the total amount consumers are willing to pay and the amount they actually pay. A price ceiling usually:",
        "options": [
          "Increases surplus for remaining consumers but creates deadweight loss through reduced transactions.",
          "Eliminates consumer surplus entirely by forcing the market price to a sub-optimal level.",
          "Shifts the entire producer surplus to the government in the form of tax revenue.",
          "Maximizes total economic surplus by making the good more affordable to the general public."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While some consumers benefit from lower prices (gaining surplus from producers), the quantity supplied drops. The loss of these transactions creates deadweight loss, reducing total social welfare."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a tax is placed on a good with highly elastic supply and relatively inelastic demand, the price received by sellers:",
        "options": [
          "Decreases only slightly, as the majority of the tax burden is shifted to consumers.",
          "Decreases significantly, as producers must absorb the tax to maintain their sales volume.",
          "Remains constant, provided the tax is legally levied on the buyers rather than sellers.",
          "Increases in proportion to the tax rate to ensure the firm's profit margin remains stable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tax incidence depends on relative elasticity. The more inelastic party (in this case, the consumer) bears more of the burden. Sellers, being more elastic, can easily shift resources away, forcing the price for consumers up."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a situation of 'Government Failure' rather than 'Market Failure'?",
        "options": [
          "Incentives for bureaucrats to maximize department budgets rather than minimize social costs.",
          "The presence of a dominant firm that restricts output to increase the market price.",
          "The inability of private firms to provide goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous.",
          "Incomplete information that prevents buyers from assessing the quality of a used product."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Government failure occurs when political or bureaucratic incentives lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, distinct from market-driven inefficiencies like monopolies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Black Market' is a frequent unintended consequence of a binding price ceiling because:",
        "options": [
          "Consumers are willing to pay more than the legal limit to secure scarce goods.",
          "Producers seek to eliminate the surplus by selling excess inventory at a discount.",
          "The government uses secondary markets to redistribute goods to lower-income households.",
          "Demand becomes perfectly elastic when prices are artificially suppressed by the state."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At a price ceiling, there is a shortage. Because the marginal benefit to consumers exceeds the legal price, they have an incentive to pay 'under the table' to obtain the product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss of a tax is generally greater when:",
        "options": [
          "Both supply and demand are relatively elastic, causing a large change in quantity.",
          "The tax is levied on a luxury good that has a perfectly inelastic supply curve.",
          "The government uses the tax revenue to provide a direct subsidy to the producers.",
          "Both supply and demand are relatively inelastic, keeping the market quantity stable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss measures the value of lost transactions. If buyers and sellers are price-sensitive (elastic), a tax will cause a large drop in the quantity traded, increasing the deadweight loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Laffer Curve' suggests that if a government increases the tax rate on a specific activity:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue may fall if the higher rate causes a significant contraction in the tax base.",
          "Total revenue will always increase as long as the tax is applied to high-income earners.",
          "Deadweight loss will be eliminated if the tax rate is set at the peak of the curve.",
          "The economic burden of the tax will shift entirely from the consumer to the producer."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Laffer Curve illustrates that there is an optimal tax rate. Beyond that point, higher rates discourage the activity being taxed so much that total tax revenue actually declines."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of market efficiency, 'Total Surplus' is maximized when:",
        "options": [
          "The marginal benefit to the last consumer equals the marginal cost to the last producer.",
          "The government imposes a price floor to ensure that all producers remain profitable.",
          "Consumer surplus is exactly equal to producer surplus, ensuring a fair market outcome.",
          "The market price is set at a level that eliminates all economic profit for firms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency occurs at equilibrium ($MB = MC$). At this point, all gains from trade are realized, and any further increase or decrease in production would reduce the sum of consumer and producer surplus."
