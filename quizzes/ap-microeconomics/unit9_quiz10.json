        "question": "Governments continue to impose price controls. Which of the following is NOT true about price controls?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Price controls help low-income consumers afford necessities.",
          "Price controls do not always lead to desirable consequences.",
          "Price controls are very common in the pure capitalist system.",
          "Price controls ensure producers receive a 'fair' income."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Price controls are a form of government intervention that overrides market prices. Pure capitalism is characterized by minimal government intervention and reliance on market forces to determine prices, so price controls are not a common feature. Options A and D are common political justifications for controls, and B is an accurate economic statement about their unintended consequences."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, which of the following will occur?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "An increase in the quantity supplied and increase in the quantity demanded.",
          "A decrease in the quantity supplied and decrease in the quantity demanded.",
          "A decrease in the quantity supplied amd increase in the quantity demanded.",
          "An increase in the quantity supplied and decrease in the quantity demanded."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A binding price ceiling creates a shortage by disrupting the market mechanism. At the lower price, producers are willing to supply less (movement down the supply curve), while consumers demand more (movement down the demand curve). Both effects contribute to the shortage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A minimum wage that is set above the equilibrium wage for unskilled labor will result in:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "An increase in employment in that labor market.",
          "A decrease in the quantity of labor demanded.",
          "A rightward shift in the labor demand curve.",
          "A leftward shift in the labor supply curve."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage acts as a price floor. Employers respond to the higher wage by moving up along their downward-sloping labor demand curve, reducing the quantity of labor they demand. This creates unemployment (a surplus of labor)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Long lines and waiting lists for rental apartments are often a sign of:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A perfectly competitive housing market.",
          "A price floor on rents.",
          "A price ceiling on rents.",
          "A subsidy to renters."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When a price ceiling creates a shortage, non-price rationing mechanisms emerge. Long lines and waiting lists represent consumers' willingness to pay with their time instead of money, which is a direct consequence of a binding rent ceiling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a price floor, a production quota that achieves the same reduction in quantity from the free market equilibrium will:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Result in a lower market price because the quota restricts supply but doesn't mandate a minimum price, allowing market competition to determine the final price.",
          "Create a larger deadweight loss because it imposes a hard quantity limit rather than allowing price to adjust to clear the market.",
          "Generate government revenue if the quota rights are sold, unlike the price floor which distributes surplus to producers.",
          "Increase producer surplus more because it creates artificial scarcity without government purchase requirements."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both a price floor and a quota reduce quantity and create similar deadweight loss when achieving the same quantity reduction. The key difference is distribution: a price floor gives the resulting higher price benefit to producers who can sell at that price, while a quota's scarcity value can be captured as government revenue if the quota rights are auctioned."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss from a binding price control represents:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A transfer from consumers to producers.",
          "The cost of government administration.",
          "The value of mutually beneficial trades that do not occur.",
          "The profit earned by black market sellers."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is a loss of total surplus, not a transfer. Price controls prevent the market from reaching the efficient equilibrium quantity. The trades between the controlled quantity and the equilibrium quantity would have benefited both buyers (MB > price) and sellers (price > MC), so their absence is a net loss to society."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand for a product is perfectly inelastic, a binding price ceiling will primarily lead to:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A large reduction in quantity supplied.",
          "No change in quantity demanded.",
          "A black market price equal to the ceiling price.",
          "A surplus of the product."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic demand means quantity demanded does not respond to price changes. The quantity demanded remains constant. However, the price ceiling will still reduce the quantity supplied (producers respond to lower prices), creating a shortage despite the fixed quantity demanded."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An effective price floor in the milk market is likely to be accompanied by government purchases of surplus milk because:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Otherwise, the surplus would cause the market price to fall below the floor as producers compete to sell their excess inventory, undermining the policy's goal of supporting farm incomes.",
          "The government wants to provide free milk to schools as part of a nutritional assistance program, using the purchased surplus for public distribution rather than letting it go to waste.",
          "Producers demand compensation for lost sales resulting from decreased consumer demand at the higher price, and government purchases effectively subsidize their revenue to maintain production levels.",
          "It is required by international trade agreements that mandate domestic price stabilization measures to prevent dumping on global markets and protect foreign competitors."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A price floor creates a surplus (Qs > Qd). If the government did not intervene, competitive pressures would push sellers to lower prices to clear the market, breaking the floor. Government purchases remove the excess supply from the market, maintaining the floor price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From an efficiency standpoint, which policy to help low-income renters would likely create the smallest deadweight loss?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A rent ceiling set 30% below market rates.",
          "A housing voucher (subsidy) given directly to qualified renters.",
          "A price floor on rents to encourage new construction.",
          "A tax on landlords to fund public housing."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A housing voucher shifts renters' demand rightward, increasing the equilibrium rent and quantity of housing supplied. It helps targeted renters without creating a shortage or distorting the price mechanism. A rent ceiling (A) creates a shortage and reduces housing quality/quantity; a price floor (C) creates a surplus; a tax (D) reduces supply."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental difference between a tax and a price control in terms of their effect on the market price paid by buyers?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A tax always raises the price buyers pay; a price control always lowers it.",
          "A tax creates a wedge between buyer and seller prices; a price control sets a legal maximum or minimum.",
          "A tax affects quantity supplied; a price control affects quantity demanded.",
          "Only a tax generates government revenue."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This gets to the core modeling difference. A tax creates two prices: what buyers pay and what sellers receive, with the difference being tax revenue. A price control sets one legal price (a ceiling or floor). While a tax usually raises buyer price and a ceiling lowers it, this isn't always true (incidence matters). The structural difference is the price wedge vs. the price limit."
