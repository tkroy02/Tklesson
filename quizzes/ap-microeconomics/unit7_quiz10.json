    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are some rules for monopolistically competitive graphs in the long run?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "price exceeds ATC, and ATC intersects marginal revenue at its peak",
          "price is below ATC, and ATC intersects average revenue at its highest point",
          "price equals marginal cost, and ATC intersects average revenue at its lowest point",
          "price = ATC, and ATC intersects marginal cost at its lowest point"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium for monopolistic competition, P = ATC (zero economic profit) and the firm produces where MR = MC. ATC intersects MC at the minimum ATC point, though the firm produces less than that output (excess capacity)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "This sets a product's price based on the product's value to the customer, or on competitive strategy, rather than on the cost of production.",

          "variable ticket pricing",
          "market pricing",
          "price discrimination",
          "strategic pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Strategic pricing focuses on perceived value, competitive positioning, or market objectives rather than solely on production costs."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What conditions are required to make price discrimination work?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "must have monopoly power, be able to segregate the market, and consumers can't resell the product",
          "must have government approval, uniform pricing, and consumers can exchange the product",
          "must have limited market power, identical market, and consumers can return the product",
          "there isn't one"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price discrimination requires: (1) market power, (2) ability to identify and separate consumers by elasticity, and (3) prevention of resale (no arbitrage)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two ways in which an oligopolistic firm can react to their competitor's pricing?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "ignore quantity (inelastic demand) or raise costs (elastic demand)",
          "reduce quantity (inelastic demand) or enhance features (elastic demand)",
          "increase price (elastic demand) or lower quality (inelastic demand)",
          "match price (inelastic demand) or ignore change (elastic demand)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the kinked demand curve model, rivals match price cuts (inelastic below kink) but do not match price increases (elastic above kink)."

        "options": [
          "price rises and demand exceeds ATC",
          "price remains constant and demand falls below ATC",
          "price/quantity falls and demand = ATC = price",
          "quantity increases and supply equals price"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "New entry shifts each firm's demand curve left, making it more elastic. In long-run equilibrium, price and quantity per firm fall until P = ATC and economic profit is zero."
