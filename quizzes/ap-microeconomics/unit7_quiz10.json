      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are some rules for monopolistically competitive graphs in the long run?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "price exceeds ATC, and ATC intersects marginal revenue at its peak",
          "price is below ATC, and ATC intersects average revenue at its highest point",
          "price equals marginal cost, and ATC intersects average revenue at its lowest point",
          "price = ATC, and ATC intersects marginal cost at its lowest point"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium for monopolistic competition, P = ATC (zero economic profit) and the firm produces where MR = MC. ATC intersects MC at the minimum ATC point, though the firm produces less than that output (excess capacity)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "This sets a product's price based on the product's value to the customer, or on competitive strategy, rather than on the cost of production.",

        "options": [
          "variable ticket pricing",
          "market pricing",
          "price discrimination",
          "strategic pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Strategic pricing focuses on perceived value, competitive positioning, or market objectives rather than solely on production costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What conditions are required to make price discrimination work?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "must have monopoly power, be able to segregate the market, and consumers can't resell the product",
          "must have government approval, uniform pricing, and consumers can exchange the product",
          "must have limited market power, identical market, and consumers can return the product",
          "there isn't one"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price discrimination requires: (1) market power, (2) ability to identify and separate consumers by elasticity, and (3) prevention of resale (no arbitrage)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two ways in which an oligopolistic firm can react to their competitor's pricing?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "ignore quantity (inelastic demand) or raise costs (elastic demand)",
          "reduce quantity (inelastic demand) or enhance features (elastic demand)",
          "increase price (elastic demand) or lower quality (inelastic demand)",
          "match price (inelastic demand) or ignore change (elastic demand)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the kinked demand curve model, rivals match price cuts (inelastic below kink) but do not match price increases (elastic above kink)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens in monopolistic competition when new firms enter the market?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "price rises and demand exceeds ATC",
          "price remains constant and demand falls below ATC",
          "price/quantity falls and demand = ATC = price",
          "quantity increases and supply equals price"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "New entry shifts each firm's demand curve left, making it more elastic. In long-run equilibrium, price and quantity per firm fall until P = ATC and economic profit is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A situation in which economic actors interacting with one another each choose their best strategy given the strategies that all the others have chosen (self interest/confess)",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "there isn't one",
          "the Nash equilibrium",
          "an Entry barrier",
          "the kinked demand curve (oligopoly non-colluding)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This defines a Nash equilibrium in game theory: each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies chosen by others, with no incentive to deviate unilaterally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government were to set a price ceiling to get the socially optimal quantity in a natural monopoly, what would they have to do?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "give the firm a subsidy",
          "remove all regulations",
          "impose a tax on the firm",
          "increase the firm's production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A natural monopoly has decreasing ATC. Setting P = MC (socially optimal) yields P < ATC, causing losses. The government must subsidize the firm to keep it in operation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given current resources, the firm can produce at the lowest costs (minimum ATC) but they decide not to.",

          "excess capacity",
          "excess demand",
          "productive efficiency",
          "there isn't one"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Excess capacity occurs when a firm produces less than the output where ATC is minimized. Common in monopolistic competition due to downward-sloping demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the graph below. What happens to marginal revenue at the kink of the kinked demand curve of an oligopoly?",
        "image": "images/bababo.png",
        "options": [
          "there isn't one",
          "vertical gap",
          "shrinkage gap",
          "contraction gap"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the kink, the demand curve's elasticity changes abruptly, causing the marginal revenue (MR) curve to have a vertical gap (discontinuity) directly below the kink. This creates price rigidity as long as MC passes through the gap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the graph below. What market is this a graph of?",

          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopoly",
          "Perfect competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The graph shows a downward-sloping demand curve with MR below it, profit maximized where MR = MC, and price set above MC—all characteristics of a monopoly market structure."
