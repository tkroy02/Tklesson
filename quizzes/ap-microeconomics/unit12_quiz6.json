    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a good is above the equilibrium price,",
        "options": [
          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will rise.",
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will fall.",
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will rise.",
          "the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied and the price remains unchanged.",
          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will fall."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Above equilibrium, Qs > Qd (surplus). Sellers compete to sell, driving price downward toward equilibrium."

        "question": "All of the following shift the supply of watches to the right except",
        "options": [
          "an advance in the technology used to manufacture watches.",
          "an increase in the price of watches.",
          "All of these answers cause an increase in the supply of watches.",
          "a decrease in the wage of workers employed to manufacture watches.",
          "manufacturers' expectation of lower watch prices in the future."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An increase in the price of watches is a movement along the supply curve, not a shift. Technology advances, lower wages, and expectations of lower future prices (encouraging selling now) shift supply right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following shifts the demand for watches to the right?",
        "options": [
          "an increase in the price of watches",
          "none of these answers",
          "a decrease in the price of watch batteries if watch batteries and watches are complements",
          "a decrease in consumer incomes if watches are a normal good",
          "a decrease in the price of watches"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Complement goods: lower price of batteries increases demand for watches (rightward shift). Price changes of the good itself cause movement along the demand curve, not shifts. Decrease in income reduces demand for normal goods."
