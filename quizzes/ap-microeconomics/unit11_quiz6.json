        "question": "A country has a comparative advantage in a good if it has:",
        "options": [
          "A higher absolute advantage than its trading partner.",
          "A lower opportunity cost of production than its trading partner.",
          "The ability to produce the good using fewer total resources.",
          "A domestic price that is higher than the world price.",
          "A perfectly elastic domestic supply curve."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage is determined by opportunity cost, not absolute productivity. A country should specialize in goods where it has the lowest opportunity cost (what it gives up least to produce)."

        "question": "If the world price of coffee is \\$2.00 per pound and the domestic equilibrium price in a small country is \\$4.00 per pound, opening to trade will lead to:",
        "options": [
          "An export of coffee.",
          "A decrease in domestic consumer surplus.",
          "An increase in domestic producer surplus.",
          "An import of coffee and a decrease in domestic producer surplus.",
          "A domestic surplus of coffee that producers must sell at a loss."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When world price ($2) < domestic price ($4), the country imports. Domestic price falls to $2: consumers gain (lower price), producers lose (lower price, less production). Producer surplus decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a small country transitions from autarky to importing a good, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "Total surplus decreases because domestic producers are harmed.",
          "The gain in consumer surplus exceeds the loss in producer surplus.",
          "The loss in producer surplus exceeds the gain in consumer surplus.",
          "Deadweight loss is created by the influx of foreign goods.",
          "The domestic price remains higher than the world price due to shipping costs."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Importing lowers domestic price: consumer surplus increases, producer surplus decreases. The consumer gain exceeds producer loss, increasing total surplus (gains from trade)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A per-unit tariff on an imported good is intended to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase the total quantity of the good consumed domestically.",
          "Lower the price domestic consumers pay for the good.",
          "Protect domestic producers by raising the domestic price above the world price.",
          "Eliminate the deadweight loss caused by international competition.",
          "Shift the domestic demand curve to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Tariffs raise domestic price above world price, making imported goods more expensive. This protects domestic producers who can now compete at the higher price, though it reduces consumer surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a domestic market with an import tariff, the 'Production Inefficiency' (part of Deadweight Loss) occurs because:",
        "options": [
          "Consumers are forced to buy more of the good than they want.",
          "Domestic resources are used to produce goods that could be bought cheaper abroad.",
          "The government fails to collect enough tax revenue to cover its costs.",
          "Foreign producers are forced to lower their prices below the cost of production.",
          "The tariff revenue is stolen by corrupt officials."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Production DWL: tariff raises price, encouraging domestic production that uses higher-cost resources than world price. These resources could be used more efficiently elsewhere."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following areas on a trade graph represents the revenue collected by the government from a tariff?",
        "options": [
          "The triangle below the demand curve and above the tariff price.",
          "The triangle representing the decrease in imports.",
          "The rectangle formed by the tariff amount and the quantity of imports.",
          "The area between the domestic supply and demand curves at the world price.",
          "The entire loss in consumer surplus."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Tariff revenue = tariff per unit × quantity imported after tariff. Graphically: rectangle with height = tariff and width = post-tariff imports."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an import quota and a tariff result in the same domestic price, the primary difference is that:",
        "options": [
          "The tariff creates more deadweight loss than the quota.",
          "The quota benefits consumers more than the tariff does.",
          "The tariff generates government revenue, while the quota creates rent for license holders.",
          "The quota shifts the demand curve, while the tariff shifts the supply curve.",
          "Domestic producers prefer a tariff over a quota."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both raise domestic price and reduce imports. Tariff revenue goes to government. Quota rent (price difference × quota quantity) goes to whoever holds import licenses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country is currently exporting a good, we can conclude that:",
        "options": [
          "The world price is lower than the domestic equilibrium price.",
          "The domestic equilibrium price is lower than the world price.",
          "The country has an absolute advantage but not a comparative advantage.",
          "Domestic consumers are better off than they were under autarky.",
          "The government is likely imposing a high import tariff."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Exporting occurs when world price > domestic price. Domestic price rises to world price: producers gain (higher price), consumers lose (higher price), but total surplus increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'prohibitive tariff' is one that is so high that:",
        "options": [
          "It generates the maximum possible revenue for the government.",
          "It forces the world price to drop to zero.",
          "It eliminates all imports and returns the market to the autarky equilibrium.",
          "It causes the domestic supply curve to become perfectly elastic.",
          "It is banned by international trade agreements."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Prohibitive tariff raises domestic price so high that imports drop to zero. Market returns to autarky equilibrium (no trade). Any tariff revenue disappears since no imports occur."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following justifies a tariff based on the 'Anti-Dumping' argument?",
        "options": [
          "The industry is vital for national defense during wartime.",
          "The industry is new and needs time to achieve economies of scale.",
          "Foreign firms are selling goods below their cost of production to drive out domestic rivals.",
          "Foreign firms are using child labor to keep their costs low.",
          "The tariff is needed to offset a domestic recession."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Anti-dumping: prevents foreign firms from selling below cost (predatory pricing) to eliminate domestic competition before raising prices. Legitimate price discrimination can resemble dumping, making enforcement controversial."
