    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopsony in the labor market exists when",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "there is only one seller of labor",
          "there is only one buyer of labor",
          "there are many buyers and sellers of labor",
          "the government sets the wage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A monopsony is a single buyer of labor (one firm hiring in a labor market), giving it market power to influence the wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monopsony, the marginal resource cost (MRC) of labor is",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "equal to the wage rate",
          "greater than the wage rate",
          "less than the wage rate",
          "equal to the MRP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because a monopsonist must raise the wage to attract more workers, the cost of hiring an additional worker (MRC) exceeds the wage paid to that worker."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit‑maximizing monopsonist will hire labor up to the point where",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "MRC = MRP",
          "wage = MRP",
          "wage = MRC",
          "MRP = demand for labor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like any firm, a monopsonist hires where marginal resource cost (MRC) equals marginal revenue product (MRP) to maximize profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a competitive labor market, a monopsony results in",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "lower wages and lower employment",
          "higher wages and higher employment",
          "lower wages and higher employment",
          "higher wages and lower employment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monopsonist restricts employment to keep the wage low, resulting in both fewer workers hired and a lower wage than under competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a source of wage differentials?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Differences in human capital",
          "Compensating differentials",
          "Labor market discrimination",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Wage differences arise from skill/education (human capital), job conditions (compensating differentials), discrimination, unionization, and geographic mobility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compensating differentials refer to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "wage differences due to discrimination",
          "higher pay for more productive workers",
          "higher pay for jobs with undesirable conditions",
          "wage differences caused by labor unions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Compensating differentials are wage premiums paid to attract workers to jobs that are risky, stressful, or otherwise less desirable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopsonist faces a minimum wage set above the monopsony wage but below the competitive wage, employment will likely",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "increase",
          "decrease",
          "remain unchanged",
          "become zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A moderate minimum wage can raise the wage toward the competitive level while increasing employment under monopsony by making MRC equal to the wage up to that point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the labor supply curve facing a monopsonist?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "Upward sloping",
          "Downward sloping"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The monopsonist faces the market labor supply curve, which is upward sloping—to hire more workers, it must offer a higher wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Human capital refers to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the financial assets of workers",
          "the skills and education that increase worker productivity",
          "the machinery used by workers",
          "the total number of workers in an economy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Human capital is the stock of knowledge, skills, and experience that makes workers more productive, often gained through education and training."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a bilateral monopoly (one union facing one monopsonist), the wage outcome is",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "determined solely by the monopsonist",
          "determined solely by the union",
          "indeterminate and depends on bargaining power",
          "always the competitive wage"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Bilateral monopoly involves a single seller of labor (union) and a single buyer (monopsonist). The final wage is negotiated and depends on relative bargaining strength."
