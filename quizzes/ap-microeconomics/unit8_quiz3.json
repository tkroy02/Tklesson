    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopsony in the labor market exists when",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "there is only one seller of labor",
          "there is only one buyer of labor",
          "there are many buyers and sellers of labor",
          "the government sets the wage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A monopsony is a single buyer of labor (one firm hiring in a labor market), giving it market power to influence the wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monopsony, the marginal resource cost (MRC) of labor is",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "equal to the wage rate",
          "greater than the wage rate",
          "less than the wage rate",
          "equal to the MRP"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because a monopsonist must raise the wage to attract more workers, the cost of hiring an additional worker (MRC) exceeds the wage paid to that worker."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit‑maximizing monopsonist will hire labor up to the point where",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "MRC = MRP",
          "wage = MRP",
          "wage = MRC",
          "MRP = demand for labor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like any firm, a monopsonist hires where marginal resource cost (MRC) equals marginal revenue product (MRP) to maximize profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a competitive labor market, a monopsony results in",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "lower wages and lower employment",
          "higher wages and higher employment",
          "lower wages and higher employment",
          "higher wages and lower employment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monopsonist restricts employment to keep the wage low, resulting in both fewer workers hired and a lower wage than under competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a source of wage differentials?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Differences in human capital",
          "Compensating differentials",
          "Labor market discrimination",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Wage differences arise from skill/education (human capital), job conditions (compensating differentials), discrimination, unionization, and geographic mobility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compensating differentials refer to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "wage differences due to discrimination",
          "higher pay for more productive workers",
          "higher pay for jobs with undesirable conditions",
          "wage differences caused by labor unions"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Compensating differentials are wage premiums paid to attract workers to jobs that are risky, stressful, or otherwise less desirable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopsonist faces a minimum wage set above the monopsony wage but below the competitive wage, employment will likely",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "increase",
          "decrease",
          "remain unchanged",
          "become zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A moderate minimum wage can raise the wage toward the competitive level while increasing employment under monopsony by making MRC equal to the wage up to that point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the labor supply curve facing a monopsonist?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "Upward sloping",
          "Downward sloping"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The monopsonist faces the market labor supply curve, which is upward sloping—to hire more workers, it must offer a higher wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Human capital refers to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the financial assets of workers",
          "the skills and education that increase worker productivity",
          "the machinery used by workers",
          "the total number of workers in an economy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Human capital is the stock of knowledge, skills, and experience that makes workers more productive, often gained through education and training."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a bilateral monopoly (one union facing one monopsonist), the wage outcome is",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "determined solely by the monopsonist",
          "determined solely by the union",
          "indeterminate and depends on bargaining power",
          "always the competitive wage"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Bilateral monopoly involves a single seller of labor (union) and a single buyer (monopsonist). The final wage is negotiated and depends on relative bargaining strength."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm's marginal product of labor decreases due to diminishing marginal returns, what is the most likely effect on its marginal revenue product (MRP)?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The MRP will decline, as it is the product of the marginal product and the output price.",
          "The MRP will first decline and then increase in a non‑linear manner.",
          "The MRP will increase because the decrease in output leads to higher prices.",
          "The MRP remains unchanged because it is independent of the marginal product."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MRP = MPL × P (or MR). If MPL falls, MRP falls, assuming product price (or marginal revenue) is constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens in factor markets when the opportunity costs of hiring additional workers become too high?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Firms may decide not to hire more workers due to increased costs.",
          "Firms will automatically lay off existing workers to reduce expenses.",
          "The firm will necessarily increase wages to attract workers.",
          "Firms will continue hiring regardless of opportunity costs."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is what the firm gives up by using resources in one way rather than another. If the opportunity cost of hiring more labor (e.g., forgone investment in capital) is too high, the firm will stop hiring labor and allocate resources elsewhere."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following are true about the productivity of the resource except",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It affects the marginal revenue product",
          "Higher productivity always leads to lower wages",
          "It can lead to changes in hiring decisions",
          "It is a determinant of labor demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity raises MRP, which typically increases labor demand and wages, not lowers them. Thus, statement B is false."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What impact would an increase in immigration have on a factor supply curve for unskilled labor in a small open economy?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The supply curve shifts rightward causing wages to potentially fall while increasing quantity employed.",
          "The curve becomes more elastic without shifting left or right which stabilizes wages while changing quantity employed less significantly than with shifts of supply curve position itself.",
          "The supply curve shifts leftward resulting in higher wages and lower quantity employed.",
          "There’s no significant shift since immigrants have different skill sets than existing workers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More immigrants increase the number of workers willing to supply unskilled labor, shifting the labor supply curve right. This typically lowers the equilibrium wage and increases the quantity of labor employed, assuming demand remains unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a monopsony labor market where there is only one buyer of labor, what effect does an imposition of a minimum wage above the current equilibrium wage have on employment?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Employment may either increase or remain unchanged depending on how far above equilibrium wage rate the minimum wage is set.",
          "Employment will definitely decrease because employers will hire less due to increased costs.",
          "Employment will definitely increase because workers are paid more.",
          "Employment will stay constant because there’s only one employer making decisions about hiring."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In monopsony, a minimum wage set above the monopsony wage but not too high can increase employment by making the MRC equal to the wage up to that point. However, if the minimum wage is set too high (above the competitive equilibrium), employment will fall. Therefore, the effect depends on where the minimum wage is set relative to the monopsony and competitive wages."
