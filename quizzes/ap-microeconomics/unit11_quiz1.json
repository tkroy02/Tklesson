      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country A can produce 10 computers or 20 tons of wheat with one unit of labor. Country B can produce 8 computers or 16 tons of wheat with one unit of labor. Which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "Country A has absolute advantage in both goods",
          "Country B has comparative advantage in computers",
          "No trade will occur because opportunity costs are equal",
          "Country A has comparative advantage in wheat",
          "Both countries benefit from specializing in computers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Country A's opportunity cost: 1 computer = 2 wheat, 1 wheat = 0.5 computer. Country B's opportunity cost: 1 computer = 2 wheat, 1 wheat = 0.5 computer. Since opportunity costs are identical, neither has comparative advantage and no mutually beneficial trade exists."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a small country imposes a tariff on imports of a good, what happens to domestic consumer surplus?",
        "options": [
          "Increases because consumers pay lower prices",
          "Decreases because consumers pay higher prices and buy less",
          "Remains unchanged because world price doesn't change",
          "Decreases only for imported goods but increases for domestic substitutes",
          "Increases because government revenue is redistributed to consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tariffs increase the domestic price above the world price. Consumers face higher prices and reduce quantity demanded, leading to a decrease in consumer surplus (area under demand curve above price)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the world price of steel is \\$500 per ton and Country X has a domestic equilibrium price of \\$600 without trade, what will happen when Country X opens to international trade?",
        "options": [
          "Country X will export steel and domestic price will rise to \\$600",
          "Country X will import steel and domestic price will fall to \\$500",
          "Country X will export steel and domestic price will fall to \\$500",
          "Country X will import steel and domestic price will rise to \\$600",
          "No trade will occur because prices are different"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When world price ($500) is below domestic price ($600), Country X has a comparative disadvantage in steel. It will import steel, causing domestic price to fall to the world price of $500."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An import quota differs from a tariff in that a quota:",
        "options": [
          "Generates government revenue automatically",
          "Directly increases the price paid by consumers",
          "Limits the quantity of imports regardless of price",
          "Is always more efficient than a tariff",
          "Does not create deadweight loss"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A quota sets a physical limit on imports. While both tariffs and quotas raise domestic prices and reduce imports, tariffs generate government revenue while quota rents may go to foreign producers or domestic import license holders."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country M can produce either 100 cars or 50 trucks. Country N can produce either 80 cars or 40 trucks. The terms of trade that would be acceptable to both countries for 1 truck would be:",
        "options": [
          "Between 1.5 and 2 cars",
          "Between 2 and 2.5 cars",
          "Exactly 2 cars",
          "Between 0.5 and 1 car",
          "No mutually beneficial terms exist"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Country M's opportunity cost: 1 truck = 2 cars (100/50). Country N's opportunity cost: 1 truck = 2 cars (80/40). Since opportunity costs are equal (both 2 cars per truck), no mutually beneficial trade exists at any terms other than exactly 2 cars, but there's no gain from trade at that rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a large country imposes an optimal tariff, it can improve its national welfare because:",
        "options": [
          "Domestic producers gain more than consumers lose",
          "The tariff revenue exceeds the deadweight loss",
          "The country can lower world prices by reducing demand",
          "It increases employment in all sectors",
          "Foreign producers absorb part of the tariff"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A large country's imports are significant enough to affect world prices. By restricting imports with a tariff, it reduces world demand, lowering the world price. The improvement in terms of trade (paying less for imports) can offset efficiency losses from the tariff."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a valid argument against free trade from the perspective of a developing country?",
        "options": [
          "Free trade always decreases consumer surplus",
          "Infant industry protection allows domestic firms to achieve economies of scale",
          "Tariffs increase government efficiency in revenue collection",
          "Comparative advantage theory doesn't apply to manufactured goods",
          "Free trade prevents specialization according to comparative advantage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The infant industry argument suggests that new industries in developing countries need temporary protection from international competition to grow, achieve economies of scale, and become internationally competitive."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country A exports wine and imports cheese, an improvement in Country A's terms of trade means:",
        "options": [
          "It receives more cheese per unit of wine exported",
          "It receives less cheese per unit of wine exported",
          "Domestic cheese production becomes more efficient",
          "The world demand for wine has decreased",
          "The opportunity cost of wine production has increased"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Terms of trade = (Price of exports)/(Price of imports). Improvement means export prices rise relative to import prices. For Country A, this means each unit of wine exports buys more units of cheese imports."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A voluntary export restraint (VER) differs from an import quota in that:",
        "options": [
          "A VER is imposed by the importing country",
          "A VER generates revenue for the importing country's government",
          "A VER is imposed by the exporting country",
          "A VER doesn't affect the quantity of imports",
          "A VER is always less restrictive than a quota"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A VER is a quota on exports imposed by the exporting country, often under pressure from the importing country. Unlike an import quota imposed by the importing country, the quota rents from a VER typically accrue to foreign exporters."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the standard trade model with two goods (X and Y) and two countries (A and B), if Country A has a comparative advantage in good X, then opening trade will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production of X and decrease production of Y in Country A",
          "Increase production of both X and Y in Country A",
          "Decrease production of X and increase production of Y in Country A",
          "Not affect production patterns in Country A",
          "Cause Country A to stop producing Y entirely"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to comparative advantage theory, countries specialize in producing goods where they have lower opportunity costs. Country A will shift resources toward producing more of good X (its comparative advantage) and less of good Y, trading X for Y with Country B."
