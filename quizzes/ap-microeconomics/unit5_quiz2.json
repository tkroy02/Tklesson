    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal cost curve that lies:",
        "options": [
          "Below average variable cost.",
          "Above average total cost.",
          "Above average variable cost.",
          "Below average total cost."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The firm supplies output where P ≥ AVC; thus, the supply curve is the MC curve above the AVC minimum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If market demand increases in a perfectly competitive industry, in the short run firms will:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease output and earn negative economic profit.",
          "Increase output and earn positive economic profit.",
          "Maintain output but raise prices above marginal cost.",
          "Exit the market."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increased demand raises market price. Firms increase output where P = MC and earn economic profit in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, a firm’s economic profit is zero because:",
        "options": [
          "Price equals minimum average total cost.",
          "Price equals marginal cost.",
          "Marginal cost equals average variable cost.",
          "Total revenue equals total fixed cost."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zero economic profit occurs when P = min ATC. Entry/exit drives price to this level in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in variable costs (e.g., wages) for all firms in a perfectly competitive market will shift the individual firm’s:",
        "options": [
          "MC and AVC curves upward, but not the market supply curve.",
          "MC and AVC curves upward, shifting the market supply curve leftward.",
          "ATC curve downward, increasing market output.",
          "Demand curve leftward, lowering price."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher variable costs shift MC and AVC up for each firm, reducing supply at each price — market supply shifts left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If firms in a perfectly competitive market are earning economic losses, in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "Market supply will increase, raising price.",
          "Firms will exit, reducing supply and raising price until losses are eliminated.",
          "Firms will lower prices to attract more buyers.",
          "The government will intervene to subsidize firms."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Exit reduces market supply, raising market price until remaining firms earn zero economic profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Productive efficiency in perfect competition occurs because firms produce at:",
        "options": [
          "The output where P = MC.",
          "The minimum point of the ATC curve.",
          "The output where MR = AVC.",
          "The point where ATC = AVC."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Productive efficiency means producing at the lowest possible cost per unit — the minimum of ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive market is allocatively efficient because:",
        "options": [
          "Firms earn zero economic profit.",
          "Price equals marginal cost.",
          "Firms produce at minimum ATC.",
          "There are no externalities."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency requires P = MC, ensuring resources are allocated to where marginal benefit equals marginal cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a technological improvement lowers production costs for all firms in a perfectly competitive industry, in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "Firms will earn permanent economic profit.",
          "Market price will fall, and consumers will benefit.",
          "Market output will decrease.",
          "Firms will exit due to lower prices."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower costs shift supply right, lowering market price. In the long run, price falls to the new minimum ATC, benefiting consumers; economic profit returns to zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a perfectly competitive firm’s decision to produce or shut down depends on:",
        "options": [
          "Whether total revenue covers total fixed cost.",
          "Whether price is above average total cost.",
          "Whether price is above average variable cost.",
          "Whether marginal revenue is above marginal cost."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Shutdown rule: produce if P ≥ AVC; shut down if P < AVC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If market demand decreases permanently in a perfectly competitive industry, the long-run adjustment will involve:",
        "options": [
          "Firm entry and lower prices.",
          "Firm exit, higher prices, and a return to zero economic profit.",
          "Firms reducing output but price remaining unchanged.",
          "Government price floors to support firms."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower demand reduces price, causing economic losses. Exit shifts supply left, raising price back to min ATC, restoring zero economic profit at a lower market quantity."
