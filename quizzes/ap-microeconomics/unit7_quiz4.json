    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to perfect competition, monopolistic competition results in:",
        "options": [
          "Lower prices and higher output",
          "Higher prices and lower output",
          "The same price and output",
          "Higher prices and higher output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolistically competitive firms have market power, so they produce where P > MC and charge higher prices than perfectly competitive firms, with lower output and excess capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A contestable market is one where:",
        "options": [
          "There are significant barriers to entry",
          "Firms can enter and exit with minimal sunk costs",
          "Only one firm exists but it behaves competitively",
          "Government regulates prices strictly"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In contestable markets, low barriers to entry and exit (especially low sunk costs) force even a single incumbent to act like a competitive firm to deter entry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market structure achieves productive efficiency in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "Monopoly",
          "Oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "Perfect competition"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Only perfect competition ensures firms produce at minimum ATC in the long run (productive efficiency). Monopolistic competition has excess capacity; monopoly/oligopoly do not necessarily minimize costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 primarily targets:",
        "options": [
          "Price discrimination",
          "Mergers that create economies of scale",
          "Monopolization and collusion",
          "Government-owned enterprises"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Sherman Act prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade (collusion) and monopolization attempts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, advertising is often used to:",
        "options": [
          "Lower production costs",
          "Make demand more elastic",
          "Make demand more inelastic",
          "Signal low quality"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Successful advertising differentiates the product, reduces substitutability, and makes demand less elastic (steeper), allowing firms to raise price with less quantity loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an oligopolist is operating at the kink in its demand curve, a small increase in marginal cost will likely result in:",
        "options": [
          "Higher price and lower quantity",
          "No change in price or quantity",
          "Lower price and higher quantity",
          "Exit from the market"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the kink, MR is discontinuous. A small MC shift within the gap does not change profit-maximizing output or price—leading to price rigidity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of BOTH monopolistic competition and oligopoly?",
        "options": [
          "Many sellers",
          "Homogeneous products",
          "Downward-sloping demand curves",
          "Perfect information"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both have market power, so they face downward-sloping demand. Monopolistic competition has many sellers; oligopoly has few. Products can be differentiated in both."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm in monopolistic competition maximizes profit where:",
        "options": [
          "P = MC",
          "MR = MC and P = ATC",
          "MR = MC",
          "P = minimum ATC"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Like any profit-maximizing firm, it sets MR = MC, then charges the price from the demand curve at that quantity. In the long run, entry forces P = ATC, but still MR = MC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Predatory pricing occurs when a firm:",
        "options": [
          "Sets price equal to average cost",
          "Temporarily sets price below cost to drive out rivals",
          "Charges different prices to different consumers",
          "Matches competitors' prices in a kinked demand model"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Predatory pricing involves selling at a loss to eliminate competitors, then raising prices afterward—often illegal under antitrust laws."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which market structure is there a strong incentive for innovation through research and development?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition only",
          "Monopoly only",
          "Both monopoly and oligopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition only"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolies and oligopolies often have significant profits to fund R&D, and innovation can help maintain market power. Perfectly competitive firms have no such surplus, and monopolistic competitors have limited funds."
