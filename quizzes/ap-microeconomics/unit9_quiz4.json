      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A binding price ceiling set below the equilibrium price will result in",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "a surplus of the good",
          "a shortage of the good",
          "no effect on quantity sold",
          "increased producer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling below equilibrium prevents the price from rising to clear the market, leading to quantity demanded exceeding quantity supplied—a shortage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A binding price floor set above the equilibrium price will result in",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "a surplus of the good",
          "a shortage of the good",
          "no effect on quantity sold",
          "increased consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A price floor above equilibrium prevents the price from falling to clear the market, leading to quantity supplied exceeding quantity demanded—a surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss from a tax is caused by",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the transfer of surplus from consumers to producers",
          "the reduction in mutually beneficial transactions that no longer occur",
          "the increase in government revenue",
          "the shift in the supply curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the loss of total surplus because the tax discourages some trades that would have been efficient (where marginal benefit > marginal cost)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The incidence of a tax (who bears the burden) depends primarily on",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "who writes the check to the government",
          "the price elasticities of supply and demand",
          "the size of the tax",
          "whether the market is competitive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tax incidence is determined by relative elasticity: the more inelastic side bears more of the burden because they cannot adjust quantity as easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is perfectly inelastic and a per‑unit tax is imposed, the burden of the tax falls",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "entirely on producers",
          "entirely on consumers",
          "equally on consumers and producers",
          "mostly on the government"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers cannot reduce quantity purchased in response to a price increase, so they bear the full tax burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A subsidy granted to producers will shift the",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "demand curve rightward",
          "demand curve leftward",
          "supply curve rightward (downward)",
          "supply curve leftward (upward)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A subsidy lowers producers' costs, increasing supply at each price—a rightward (or downward) shift of the supply curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a likely consequence of a binding price ceiling on rental housing?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Increased investment in new rental housing",
          "A black market with higher prices for some renters",
          "Excess supply of rental units",
          "Higher quality of rental housing due to competition"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Binding rent controls create a shortage, leading to non‑price rationing (waiting lists, favoritism) and often illegal side payments or “key money” (black markets)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A per‑unit tax on a good with relatively elastic demand and inelastic supply will result in",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "producers bearing most of the tax burden",
          "consumers bearing most of the tax burden",
          "no change in market quantity",
          "an increase in consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When supply is more inelastic than demand, producers cannot easily reduce quantity supplied, so they bear a larger share of the tax burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The area of deadweight loss from a tax is a triangle between the",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "new and old supply curves",
          "new and old demand curves",
          "supply and demand curves from the new quantity to the old equilibrium quantity",
          "price paid by buyers and price received by sellers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the area between supply and demand curves from the post‑tax quantity to the pre‑tax equilibrium quantity, representing lost gains from trade."
      },

          "quota"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A minimum wage sets a legal minimum price for labor (wage), making it a price floor. If set above equilibrium, it causes a surplus of labor (unemployment)."
