      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a market is in equilibrium and then demand increases, what happens to total surplus?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Total surplus definitely increases.",
          "Total surplus definitely decreases.",
          "Total surplus remains unchanged.",
          "The change in total surplus is indeterminate without more information."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An increase in demand raises both the equilibrium price and quantity. While the distribution of surplus between consumers and producers changes, the new equilibrium captures more mutually beneficial trades (a larger quantity where MB > MC), so total surplus increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A per-unit subsidy granted to producers will have which of the following effects?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Increase consumer surplus, decrease producer surplus, and create a deadweight loss.",
          "Increase both consumer and producer surplus, increase quantity, and create a deadweight loss.",
          "Increase both consumer and producer surplus, increase quantity, but may still create a deadweight loss.",
          "Increase producer surplus only, as consumers do not benefit from producer subsidies."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A subsidy lowers costs for producers, shifting supply right. This increases equilibrium quantity and lowers the price consumers pay (increasing CS). The price producers receive (price plus subsidy) rises (increasing PS). However, if the subsidy pushes quantity beyond the original market equilibrium where MB=MC, it can encourage trades where the cost to society exceeds the benefit, creating a deadweight loss from overproduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market with a binding price floor, the deadweight loss exists because:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Some willing buyers cannot find sellers at the controlled price.",
          "Some transactions that would have benefited both buyers and sellers (at the equilibrium price) do not occur.",
          "The government must spend money to enforce the price floor.",
          "Producers earn less revenue than they would at equilibrium."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation:",
        "explanation": "A binding price floor reduces the quantity demanded below the efficient market equilibrium quantity. The deadweight loss is the loss of total surplus from the forgone transactions between the new quantity and the equilibrium quantity. These transactions would have occurred because buyers' willingness to pay (MB) exceeded sellers' cost (MC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider a market with perfectly inelastic supply. If an excise tax is imposed on buyers in this market, what is the effect on the price sellers receive and the quantity sold?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Price sellers receive falls by the full tax; quantity sold is unchanged.",
          "Price sellers receive is unchanged; quantity sold falls.",
          "Price sellers received falls by less than the tax; quantity sold falls.",
          "Price sellers receive rises; quantity sold is unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With perfectly inelastic supply, the quantity supplied is fixed regardless of price. A tax on buyers shifts the demand curve down by the tax amount. The new equilibrium occurs at the same fixed quantity. Buyers pay a higher price (original price + tax), but because quantity can't change, sellers must absorb the entire tax, receiving a price that is lower by the full tax amount."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements about the relationship between elasticity and tax revenue is TRUE?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "For a given tax rate, tax revenue is maximized when both supply and demand are unit elastic.",
          "Tax revenue is higher when demand is elastic because quantity doesn't change much.",
          "If demand is perfectly inelastic, tax revenue increases as the tax rate increases, with no limit.",
          "Tax revenue is always higher when the side of the market that is more elastic is taxed."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When demand is perfectly inelastic, quantity demanded does not respond to price. Therefore, increasing the tax rate will not reduce the quantity sold. Tax revenue = tax per unit * quantity. Since quantity is constant, revenue increases linearly with the tax rate (theoretically without limit, though politically there are constraints)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluating a quota (a legal limit on quantity) compared to a tax that achieves the same reduction in quantity, we find that:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Both create the same size deadweight loss and distribute surplus in the same way.",
          "The quota creates a larger deadweight loss.",
          "The tax creates government revenue, while the quota creates surplus for the owners of the quota rights.",
          "The tax is always more efficient because it raises revenue."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A tax and a quota that result in the same quantity create an identical deadweight loss. The key difference is distribution. The tax generates government revenue. The quota creates a scarcity, raising the market price. The extra profit (the difference between the higher market price and the cost of production) becomes surplus for those who hold the legal right to sell the limited quantity (quota rights)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cost-benefit analysis of a new safety regulation for cars would need to include:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The increased cost of production and the value of lives saved.",
          "Only the monetary costs to manufacturers.",
          "Only the benefits to consumers who buy the safer cars.",
          "The change in stock prices for automobile companies."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A proper social cost-benefit analysis must value all significant consequences. The costs include the higher resource costs of production (passed on as higher car prices). The benefits include the reduced risk of injury and death, which must be assigned a monetary value (e.g., via statistical value of a life) to compare with costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government removes a long-standing, binding price ceiling, what is the immediate and long-run sequence of effects?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Price rises to equilibrium, shortage disappears, then supply increases over time.",
          "Price falls, surplus appears, then demand decreases over time.",
          "Price is unchanged because markets are stable, and quantity adjusts slowly.",
          "A black market develops to replace the official market."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Immediate Effect: Removing the ceiling allows the price to rise to the equilibrium point, eliminating the shortage as quantity demanded falls and quantity supplied rises along the existing curves. Long-Run Effect: The higher, market-clearing price provides an incentive for suppliers to invest in maintaining and expanding capacity, shifting the supply curve rightward over time, which can moderate the price increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Laffer Curve illustrates the concept that:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Increasing tax rates will always increase tax revenue.",
          "There is a tax rate that maximizes government revenue; beyond this point, higher rates reduce revenue by discouraging economic activity.",
          "Taxes should be as low as possible to minimize deadweight loss.",
          "The burden of a tax is independent of the tax rate."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Laffer Curve is a theoretical relationship between tax rates and tax revenue. It posits that at a 0% tax rate, revenue is zero. As rates rise, revenue increases. However, after a certain point, very high tax rates severely reduce the quantity of the taxed activity (working, investing, producing), shrinking the tax base so much that total revenue begins to fall. The revenue-maximizing rate is at the peak of this curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From a pure efficiency perspective (ignoring equity), the most desirable outcome of a government auction of pollution permits (cap-and-trade) is that:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The permits are given free to existing firms to minimize their costs.",
          "The permits are sold to the highest bidder, and the revenue is used to reduce other taxes.",
          "The price of the permits is set by the government at a 'fair' level.",
          "The permits are distributed equally among all citizens."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Auctioning permits is efficient for two key reasons: 1) It ensures permits go to firms that value them most (i.e., have the highest cost of reducing pollution), minimizing the total cost of achieving the pollution cap. 2) The revenue generated can be used to reduce other, distortionary taxes (like income taxes), providing a 'double dividend' by reducing the deadweight loss from the tax system. Giving permits away for free achieves the environmental goal but forgoes this revenue benefit."
