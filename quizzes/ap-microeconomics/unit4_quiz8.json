        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm has total fixed costs of £100 and currently produces 50 units of output, so its average fixed cost (AFC) is £2 per unit. If it doubles output to 100 units and total fixed costs stay the same, what will its new average fixed cost be?",
        "options": [
          "£2 per unit.",
          "£1 per unit.",
          "£0.50 per unit.",
          "£4 per unit."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AFC = TFC / Q. At Q = 100, AFC = £100 / 100 = £1 per unit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm sells its product at a price of £20 per unit. At its current output, average total cost is £15 and it sells 400 units. What is the firm's profit at this output?",
        "options": [
          "£400.",
          "£6 000.",
          "£8 000.",
          "£2 000."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Profit per unit = Price − ATC = £20 − £15 = £5. Total profit = £5 × 400 = £2,000."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes an example of external economies of scale for a firm in an industry?",
        "options": [
          "The firm introduces better management techniques, lowering its own long-run average cost.",
          "The firm buys new machinery that reduces its long-run average cost.",
          "New specialist suppliers enter the industry, reducing input costs for all firms and lowering their long-run average costs.",
          "The firm negotiates lower wages with its own workforce, reducing its variable costs."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "External economies of scale occur when industry-wide changes lower costs for all firms, such as new supplier networks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm's long-run average cost (LRAC) curve is U-shaped. As the firm expands output beyond the minimum point of LRAC, it experiences diseconomies of scale. Which is the most likely explanation for this upward-sloping section of the LRAC curve?",
        "options": [
          "Improved purchasing power allows the firm to buy raw materials more cheaply.",
          "Increasing layers of management and communication problems raise average costs.",
          "Greater specialisation of labour reduces unit costs.",
          "Better use of highly indivisible capital equipment reduces unit costs."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diseconomies of scale often arise from managerial inefficiencies, coordination problems, and communication breakdowns in large firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what number of workers does the firm first experience diminishing marginal returns to labour?",
        "image": "images/tabulata4.png",
        "options": [
          "1 worker.",
          "2 workers.",
          "3 workers.",
          "6 workers."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Marginal product: 1st worker = 10, 2nd = 12, 3rd = 11. Diminishing returns start when MP falls, which occurs between workers 2 and 3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what output does the firm first reach its minimum efficient scale (MES)?",
        "image": "images/tabulata5.png",
        "options": [
          "1 thousand units.",
          "3 thousand units.",
          "5 thousand units.",
          "The firm never reaches minimum efficient scale because LRAC is always falling."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MES is the lowest output where LRAC is minimized. Here, LRAC is lowest at 3,000 units ($11), then rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A government increase in business rates raises a firm's fixed costs, but variable costs remain unchanged. In the short run, the firm continues to operate. Which statement best explains the likely impact on its cost curves and profit?",
        "options": [
          "Average variable cost and marginal cost both rise, so the firm shuts down immediately as price falls below average variable cost.",
          "Average fixed cost and average total cost both shift downwards, increasing the firm's profit at every output level.",
          "Average total cost shifts upwards but marginal cost is unchanged, so the firm's profit falls at each level of output even if it continues to produce.",
          "Marginal cost shifts upwards but average total cost is unchanged, so the firm produces more to cover its higher fixed costs."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fixed cost increases raise AFC and ATC but not MC or AVC. Profit falls because ATC rises at each output, but shutdown is not required if P ≥ AVC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When marginal cost is rising and above average total cost, average total cost must be:",

          "Falling.",
          "Constant.",
          "Rising.",
          "At its minimum."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If MC > ATC, each additional unit costs more than the average, pulling ATC upward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm's price is below average variable cost at all output levels, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase production to lower AVC.",
          "Shut down in the short run.",
          "Continue operating to cover fixed costs.",
          "Raise its price immediately."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If P < AVC at all outputs, the firm cannot cover variable costs and should shut down to minimize losses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, a perfectly competitive firm earns:",
        "options": [
          "Economic profit.",
          "Normal profit.",
          "Accounting profit only.",
          "Supernormal profit."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium under perfect competition, firms earn zero economic profit (normal profit) due to free entry and exit."
