    "subtitle": "Supply Curves, Normal vs. Inferior Goods, Complements & Substitutes",
    "subject": "AP Microeconomics",
    "topic": "Cost Curves, Income Elasticity, Cross-Price Elasticity",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "That the supply curve of ice cream cones is upward sloping indicates that",
        "options": [
          "the marginal cost of providing ice cream cones increases as more cones are produced.",
          "as the price of ice cream cones increases, the production technology is upgraded.",
          "as the price increases, the opportunity cost of making ice cream cones decreases.",
          "all of the above.",
          "none of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An upward-sloping supply curve reflects increasing marginal cost—producing additional units becomes more costly, so firms require a higher price to supply more."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an increase in consumer incomes leads to a decrease in the demand for camping equipment, then camping equipment is",
        "options": [
          "a normal good.",
          "none of these answers.",
          "an inferior good.",
          "a substitute good.",
          "a complementary good."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inferior goods: demand decreases when income rises. Normal goods: demand increases with income. Substitute/complement relates to other goods' prices, not income."

          "substitutes."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Substitutes: price increase in one increases demand for the other. Complements would show decreased demand when the other's price rises."
