        "question": "That the supply curve of ice cream cones is upward sloping indicates that",
        "options": [
          "the marginal cost of providing ice cream cones increases as more cones are produced.",
          "as the price of ice cream cones increases, the production technology is upgraded.",
          "as the price increases, the opportunity cost of making ice cream cones decreases.",
          "all of the above.",
          "none of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An upward-sloping supply curve reflects increasing marginal cost—producing additional units becomes more costly, so firms require a higher price to supply more."

        "question": "If an increase in consumer incomes leads to a decrease in the demand for camping equipment, then camping equipment is",

          "a normal good.",
          "none of these answers.",
          "an inferior good.",
          "a substitute good.",
          "a complementary good."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inferior goods: demand decreases when income rises. Normal goods: demand increases with income. Substitute/complement relates to other goods' prices, not income."

        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Substitutes: price increase in one increases demand for the other. Complements would show decreased demand when the other's price rises."

        "question": "Which of the following indicates that a firm is experiencing economies of scale?",
        "options": [
          "The firm’s long-run supply curve is horizontal.",

          "Firms can easily enter or exit the market."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfectly competitive firms are price takers; monopolistically competitive firms have some price-setting power due to product differentiation."

          "Price exceeds marginal cost, and the firm earns positive economic profits."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Long-run equilibrium: P = ATC (zero economic profit), but P > MC because demand slopes downward (MR < P) and MR = MC."

        "question": "Assume that labor and capital are the only two inputs a perfectly competitive firm uses to produce wheat. The firm hires its inputs in perfectly competitive input markets. The unit price of labor is $8 and of capital is $20. When the firm employs the profit-maximizing combination of these two inputs, the marginal product of labor is 2 tons of wheat and of capital is 5 tons of wheat. The price of wheat per ton must be",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cost minimization: MP_L / w = MP_K / r → 2/8 = 5/20 → both equal 0.25. Profit maximization requires MRP_L = w, and MRP_L = MP_L × P → 2 × P = $8 → P = $4."

          "additional utility that households obtain when the prices of substitutes fall",
          "increase in the availability of goods when income rises"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Consumer surplus arises because some consumers are willing to pay more than the market price; they gain surplus from paying less than their maximum willingness to pay."

          "Marginal utility is always increasing.",
          "As more inputs are used, consumers get less and less additional output."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Consumer choice theory assumes utility maximization subject to budget constraint. Diminishing marginal utility is typical, but not always increasing; income effects vary by good type."
