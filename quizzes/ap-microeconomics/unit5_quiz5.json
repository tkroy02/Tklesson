      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the government imposes a binding price ceiling below the equilibrium price in a perfectly competitive market. What will happen in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "Shortage persists, market adjusts to new equilibrium.",
          "Firms exit until supply decreases and price rises to the ceiling.",
          "Surplus develops, price falls further.",
          "Market becomes allocatively efficient."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Binding price ceiling creates shortage. In long run, firms exit due to losses, supply decreases, and at the ceiling price, quantity supplied falls further, worsening shortage — no new equilibrium at ceiling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a small open economy, the world price for wheat is lower than the domestic equilibrium price. If the country opens to trade, what happens to domestic production and consumer surplus?",
        "options": [
          "Production increases; consumer surplus decreases.",
          "Production decreases; consumer surplus increases.",
          "Production increases; consumer surplus increases.",
          "Production decreases; consumer surplus decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lower world price means imports enter. Domestic production falls (firms can’t compete), but consumers buy more at lower price, increasing consumer surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a perfectly competitive market is producing where P > MC, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "There is allocative efficiency.",
          "Society would benefit from more output.",
          "Society would benefit from less output.",
          "The market is productively efficient."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "P > MC means marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost; society gains from additional production (underallocation of resources)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive industry is in long-run equilibrium. A new environmental regulation increases fixed costs for all firms. What happens in the short run and long run?",
        "options": [
          "Short run: price rises; long run: price returns to original, fewer firms.",
          "Short run: firms incur losses, some exit; long run: price higher, fewer firms.",
          "Short run: no change; long run: price lower, more firms.",
          "Short run: output increases; long run: price unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Higher fixed costs shift ATC up but not MC. In short run, price unchanged, firms incur losses. In long run, exit reduces supply, raising price until zero profit at higher ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario describes a constant-cost perfectly competitive industry?",
        "options": [
          "Expansion causes wages for specialized labor to rise.",
          "Expansion leads to better infrastructure, lowering costs for all firms.",
          "Input prices remain unchanged as industry output changes.",
          "Firms experience internal economies of scale."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Constant-cost industry: input prices do not change with industry output; long-run supply is horizontal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a per-unit subsidy is given to consumers in a perfectly competitive market, what happens to market price and quantity?",
        "options": [
          "Price increases, quantity increases.",
          "Price decreases, quantity increases.",
          "Price unchanged, quantity increases.",
          "Price increases, quantity unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Subsidy to consumers increases demand, raising price paid by consumers? Wait — subsidy effectively lowers price consumers pay, increases quantity demanded. But market price (to producers) may rise due to increased demand. In PC, subsidy shifts demand right, increasing equilibrium price and quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, if all firms have identical cost structures and there are no externalities, deadweight loss is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive because firms earn zero profit.",
          "Zero because P = MC.",
          "Positive because P > ATC.",
          "Zero because consumer surplus is maximized."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "No externalities + P = MC → allocative efficiency, no deadweight loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a real-world example closest to perfect competition?",
        "options": [
          "Commercial airlines.",
          "Wheat farming.",
          "Smartphone manufacturing.",
          "Electric utilities."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Wheat farming: many producers, homogeneous product, price takers, low barriers to entry — closest to perfect competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If market demand becomes more elastic in a perfectly competitive industry, what happens to the individual firm’s demand curve?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes more elastic.",
          "It becomes less elastic.",
          "It becomes vertical.",
          "It is unaffected."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Individual firm’s demand is always perfectly elastic (horizontal) at market price in perfect competition, regardless of market demand elasticity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hurricane destroys half the orange crop in Florida. In the short run, what happens to the price and output of individual orange growers who were not affected?",
        "options": [
          "Price rises; each unaffected grower increases output.",
          "Price rises; each unaffected grower’s output unchanged.",
          "Price unchanged; each unaffected grower increases output.",
          "Price falls; each unaffected grower decreases output."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reduced supply raises market price. Unaffected growers face higher P, so they increase output where P = MC."
