    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a binding minimum wage above equilibrium wage typically impact employment levels according to neoclassical economic theory?",
        "options": [
          "Employment levels remain unchanged because employers find ways around minimum wage laws through non-wage compensation adjustments.",
          "Employment levels fluctuate unpredictably as both demand and supply curves shift due to complex interactions with other markets and factors beyond simple wage determination mechanisms.",
          "Employment levels decrease due to excess supply of labor (unemployment) created by wage rates higher than the market-clearing level.",
          "Employment levels increase as higher wages attract more workers into being active participants in the labor force expanding labor supplied."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage acts as a price floor in the labor market. Above equilibrium, quantity supplied of labor exceeds quantity demanded → unemployment (excess supply)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What similarity exists between the concepts of deadweight loss and consumer surplus?",
        "options": [
          "Both are related to market efficiency",
          "Both are unaffected by taxes and subsidies",
          "Both are maximized at equilibrium",
          "Both increase with price floors"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss measures efficiency loss from market distortion; consumer surplus measures benefit to consumers. Both are concepts used in **welfare economics** to evaluate market efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During an economic downturn, a consumer opts for off-brand cereal rather than a premium brand. Which economic term best describes off-brand cereal in this context?",
        "options": [
          "Inferior good, since demand for it tends to increase when incomes fall.",
          "Normal good, which typically sees decreased demand when consumer incomes drop.",
          "Giffen good, a rare and counterintuitive case where higher prices lead to increased demand, not applicable here.",
          "Luxury good, which is characterized by higher income elasticity and would decrease in demand during a downturn."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inferior goods see **increased demand when income falls**. Off-brand cereal is a classic example of an inferior good during a downturn."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A supply curve that can be represented by the equation Qs = 5P - 10 demonstrates:",
        "options": [
          "A direct relationship between price and quantity supplied",
          "Unit elastic supply at all price points",
          "Perfectly inelastic supply at all price points",
          "An inverse relationship between price and quantity supplied"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation Qs = 5P – 10 shows that as price (P) increases, quantity supplied (Qs) increases → **direct relationship**, consistent with the law of supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A market consists of three consumer types with the following individual demand functions: Q1 = 100 - 2P, Q2 = 80 - P, and Q3 = 60 - 0.5P. If there are 5 consumers of type 1, 10 of type 2, and 15 of type 3, what is the slope of the market demand curve?",
        "options": [
          "-10",
          "-3.5",
          "-17.5",
          "-27.5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Market Qd = 5*(100 - 2P) + 10*(80 - P) + 15*(60 - 0.5P) = 500 - 10P + 800 - 10P + 900 - 7.5P = 2200 - 27.5P. Slope = coefficient of P = **-27.5**. Wait — slope in Qd = a - bP is -b. Here b = 27.5, slope = -27.5. That matches option D. But I must check math: 5*(-2P) = -10P; 10*(-P) = -10P; 15*(-0.5P) = -7.5P; sum = -27.5P. Yes, slope = -27.5 → **D**."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which situation describes a shortage in a market?",
        "options": [
          "Supply equals demand",
          "No demand or supply",
          "Demand exceeds supply",
          "Supply exceeds demand"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Shortage occurs when **quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied** at the current price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the likely impact on demand if a complementary good’s price decreases?",
        "options": [
          "Demand increases",
          "Demand becomes zero",
          "Demand remains unchanged",
          "Demand decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lower price of a complement increases the demand for the related good (shift right). Example: cheaper peanut butter increases demand for jelly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market with the demand function P = 20 – 2Q and the supply function P = 4 + Q, what happens to producer surplus if a price floor of \\$15 is implemented?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases for all producers in the market",
          "It remains unchanged from the equilibrium level",
          "It increases for producers who sell, but total PS rises overall",
          "It increases for all producers in the market"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find equilibrium: 20 – 2Q = 4 + Q → 16 = 3Q → Q* = 5.33, P* ≈ 9.33. Price floor \\$15 > P* → binding. At P=15, Qd from demand: 15 = 20 – 2Q → Qd = 2.5. Only 2.5 units sold (not all producers can sell). Producer surplus likely decreases because fewer units are sold, even at higher price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the supply function Qs = 2 + 3P, what is the relationship between a \\$1 increase in price and the change in quantity supplied?",
        "options": [
          "The quantity supplied increases by 3 units for every \\$1 increase in price.",
          "The quantity supplied decreases by 3 units for every \\$1 increase in price.",
          "There is no change in the quantity supplied with a change in price.",
          "The quantity supplied increases by 2 units for every \\$1 increase in price."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The slope with respect to price is 3. ΔQs / ΔP = 3 → each \\$1 increase in price increases quantity supplied by **3 units**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price floor is set \\$2 above the equilibrium price causing a surplus of 200 units. What was the original equilibrium quantity if the surplus increased the quantity supplied to 600 units?",
        "options": [
          "800 units",
          "200 units",
          "1000 units",
          "400 units"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Surplus = Qs – Qd = 200. Qs at floor = 600 → Qd at floor = 600 – 200 = 400. Since the floor is \\$2 above equilibrium, Qd at floor equals **original equilibrium quantity** (because demand curve is downward sloping). So original Q* = **400**."
