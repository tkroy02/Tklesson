    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, firms have some market power primarily because of:",
        "options": [
          "Economies of scale",
          "Barriers to entry",
          "Product differentiation",
          "Government regulation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolistic competitors gain market power through product differentiation—making their product seem unique through branding, features, location, or quality—allowing them to face a downward-sloping demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, a monopolistically competitive firm will earn:",
        "options": [
          "Positive economic profit",
          "Zero economic profit",
          "Negative economic profit",
          "Profit equal to that of a monopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Due to low barriers to entry, if firms earn positive economic profit, new firms enter, shifting demand curves left until firms earn zero economic profit (P = ATC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for both monopolistic competition and perfect competition in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "P = MR",
          "P = MC",
          "P = minimum ATC",
          "Economic profit = zero"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Both market structures have zero economic profit in the long run due to entry/exit, but monopolistic competition has P > MC and does not produce at minimum ATC (excess capacity)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand curve faced by a monopolistically competitive firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic",
          "Perfectly inelastic",
          "Downward sloping but highly elastic",
          "Vertical"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Because products are differentiated, each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve, but it is relatively elastic due to many close substitutes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolistically competitive firm in the short run produces where:",
        "options": [
          "P = MC",
          "MR = MC",
          "P = ATC",
          "P = MR"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Like all profit-maximizing firms, a monopolistically competitive firm produces where MR = MC, then charges the price from the demand curve at that quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, excess capacity refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The firm producing at minimum ATC",
          "The firm producing less than the output at minimum ATC",
          "The firm operating beyond the efficient scale",
          "The firm shutting down temporarily"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the long run, monopolistically competitive firms produce at a quantity where ATC is still declining (not at minimum ATC). This gap between actual output and the output at minimum ATC is called excess capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An oligopoly is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "Many firms selling identical products",
          "A single firm dominating the market",
          "A few interdependent firms",
          "Free entry and exit"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Oligopoly markets have a few large firms whose decisions are interdependent—each firm’s actions affect the others, leading to strategic behavior."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which market structure is non-price competition most common?",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition",
          "Monopoly",
          "Monopolistic competition",
          "Oligopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolistically competitive firms often use advertising, branding, and product variation to differentiate their goods, since price competition is limited by product differences."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolistically competitive firm is making losses in the short run, what will happen in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "Firms will enter the market",
          "Firms will exit the market",
          "Demand for the firm's product will increase",
          "The firm will raise its price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Losses lead some firms to exit, reducing competition and shifting the demand curves of remaining firms to the right until losses are eliminated (zero economic profit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The kinked demand curve model is used to explain:",
        "options": [
          "Price stability in oligopoly markets",
          "Product differentiation in monopolistic competition",
          "Efficiency in perfect competition",
          "Profit maximization in monopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The kinked demand curve model suggests that in an oligopoly, rivals match price cuts but not price increases, leading to sticky prices and stable non-collusive outcomes."
