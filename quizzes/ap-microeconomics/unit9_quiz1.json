          "a third party bears a cost from a market transaction they are not involved in",
          "a producer receives a benefit they did not pay for",

          "the government intervenes to correct a market failure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative externality occurs when a transaction imposes an uncompensated cost on a third party (e.g., pollution)."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With a negative externality, the private market produces too much because firms do not account for external costs. Market quantity > socially optimal quantity."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With a positive externality, the private market produces too little because consumers/firms do not account for external benefits. Market quantity < socially optimal quantity."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MSC > MPC means external costs exist, indicating a negative externality in production."

          "average social cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A Pigovian tax set equal to the marginal external cost (MEC) internalizes the externality, shifting the supply curve up to reflect MSC and leading to the socially optimal quantity."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a negative externality, deadweight loss is the area between the MSC and MPC (or MSB, if demand reflects MPB) from the social optimum to the market quantity, representing the welfare loss from overproduction."
