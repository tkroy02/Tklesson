    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A common justification for price controls is to achieve social equity. Which statement best describes an economic critique of this approach?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Price controls are administered by the government, rather than by producers, causing inefficiency.",
          "They often create unintended consequences like shortages or surpluses.",
          "They require complex legislation that takes years to pass.",
          "They are only effective in markets for luxury goods."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While price controls aim to improve equity, economic analysis shows they distort price signals, leading to shortages (ceilings) or surpluses (floors). These outcomes often reduce quality, create black markets, and waste resources, ultimately hurting consumers or producers in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a binding price ceiling is imposed on a market, which outcome is most predictable?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A decline in consumer demand for the product.",
          "Development of non-price rationing mechanisms.",
          "A long-term increase in product quality.",
          "A rightward shift in the supply curve."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding price ceiling creates a shortage where quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied. Since price cannot rise to allocate the good, other rationing methods emerge, such as waiting lines, favoritism, or side payments, which are inefficient."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the equilibrium rent for apartments is $1,200 and a rent ceiling of $900 is established, what is the most likely immediate result?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A surplus of available apartments.",
          "A decrease in the quantity of apartments demanded.",
          "An increase in apartment construction.",
          "Some renters being unable to find apartments."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A binding rent ceiling ($900) below equilibrium ($1,200) reduces the quantity supplied (landlords may convert or not rent units) while increasing quantity demanded. This mismatch creates a shortage, meaning some renters who want an apartment at $900 will not find one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market with a binding price floor, producers might respond by:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Lowering the quality of the good to reduce costs.",
          "Increasing output while engaging in non-price competition.",
          "Exiting the market entirely if they are small firms.",
          "Both B and C are plausible responses."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A price floor creates a surplus. Producers may try to attract buyers by competing on quality or service (non-price competition), which can be inefficient. Alternatively, if they cannot sell their output at the floor price, some may be forced to exit. Lowering quality (A) is more common under price ceilings, not floors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do consumers typically adjust their behavior in response to a persistent shortage caused by a price ceiling?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "They increase their savings rate.",
          "They substitute toward more expensive alternative goods.",
          "They invest time searching or waiting to obtain the good.",
          "They collectively petition to have the ceiling removed."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When a legal shortage exists, consumers incur 'search costs' (time spent looking for sellers) or 'wait costs' (time in lines). These are real resource costs that represent a form of deadweight loss, as the time could have been used productively elsewhere."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A minimum wage law is an example of a price floor. What direct effect would a binding minimum wage have on the labor market?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It increases the quantity of labor demanded.",
          "It creates a surplus of labor (unemployment).",
          "It causes a leftward shift in the labor demand curve.",
          "It guarantees all willing workers a job."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage sets a wage above the market equilibrium. At this higher wage, the quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, resulting in a surplus of labor, which is unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Over a long period, a binding price ceiling on a good like gasoline is likely to cause the supply curve to:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Shift rightward as firms innovate to cut costs.",
          "Shift leftward as producers reduce capacity and maintenance.",
          "Become perfectly elastic.",
          "Remain unchanged since technology is fixed."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Low, capped prices reduce producer revenue and profit. This discourages investment in maintenance, exploration, and new production capacity. Over time, the quantity supplied at any given price decreases, represented by a leftward shift of the supply curve, worsening the shortage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the government imposes a price floor on an agricultural product and purchases the resulting surplus, the deadweight loss includes:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Only the storage costs of the surplus.",
          "The cost of producing units that consumers value less than their production cost.",
          "The administrative salary of the government buyers.",
          "The loss of consumer surplus from higher prices."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The most fundamental deadweight loss is from overproduction: resources are used to produce units beyond the efficient quantity. For these extra units, the marginal cost of production exceeds the marginal benefit to consumers (as shown by the demand curve), representing a waste of society's resources."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario would reduce the shortage caused by a binding price ceiling?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A decrease in consumer income (assuming the good is normal).",
          "A technological improvement that lowers production costs.",
          "An increase in the costs of key inputs for producers.",
          "The government setting the ceiling even lower."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A shortage is Qd > Qs at the ceiling price. A decrease in income for a normal good reduces demand (shifts demand left), decreasing Qd and thus reducing the gap between Qd and Qs. A technological improvement (B) would increase Qs, but a price ceiling removes the incentive for producers to increase supply, so the shift may not occur or may be muted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary economic objection to price controls is that they:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Are usually proposed by the wrong political party.",
          "Prevent markets from reaching an equilibrium that maximizes total surplus.",
          "Are too simple a solution for complex economic problems.",
          "Always benefit producers at the expense of consumers."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The core economic argument is about efficiency. In a competitive market without externalities, the equilibrium price and quantity maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus (total surplus). Price ceilings and floors prevent this equilibrium, creating deadweight loss and reducing overall welfare."

        "50": "Fair. Focus on the direct link: price ceiling -> shortage; price floor -> surplus. Then consider secondary effects on behavior.",
        "0": "Basics: A maximum price (ceiling) below equilibrium causes a shortage. A minimum price (floor) above equilibrium causes a surplus. Both reduce quantity traded."
