        "question": "A factory uses a specific input combination: for every machine (capital), it requires 2 workers (labor) to operate efficiently. This reflects that in the short run:",
        "options": [
          "The factors of production are perfectly substitutable, resulting in a linear PPF.",
          "The factors are complementary, contributing to the law of increasing opportunity cost and a bowed-out PPF.",
          "The production function exhibits constant returns to scale, shifting the PPF parallelly.",
          "There is no trade-off between capital and labor, so the PPF is a right angle."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because resources are not perfectly adaptable, producing more of one good requires using resources less suited for it. This drives the law of increasing opportunity cost, represented by a bowed-out (concave) PPF."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The data below shows the trade-offs for an economy producing drones (D) and robots (R). The opportunity cost of producing each additional drone increases. What is the approximate opportunity cost of producing the third drone?",
        "image": "images/ecoeco2.png",
        "options": [
          "1 robot",
          "2 robots",
          "3 robots",
          "4 robots"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is measured by what you give up. Moving from 2 drones to 3 drones causes robot production to fall from 7 to 4. Therefore, the cost of the third drone is 3 robots (7 - 4 = 3)."

        "question": "An attorney types 120 words per minute and earns $300 per hour. They consider hiring a secretary who types 80 words per minute and earns $25 per hour. From an economic efficiency perspective, which statement is correct?",
        "options": [
          "The attorney should do their own typing because they are more productive.",
          "The attorney has absolute advantage in typing but should hire the secretary based on opportunity cost.",
          "The secretary should not be hired because the attorney types faster.",
          "Both should type their own documents to maintain quality control."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The attorney has absolute advantage in speed, but their opportunity cost is $300/hour. The secretary's time is much cheaper. Hiring the secretary allows the attorney to maximize time in legal work, where they have a comparative advantage."

        "question": "A bakery must decide whether to bake one more cake. Ingredients cost $8, labor costs $12, and depreciation is $3. Alternatively, those resources could bake cookies generating $10 in profit. The cake sells for $30. What is the economic profit from baking the cake?",
        "options": [
          "$7",
          "$17",
          "-$3",
          "$20"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economic Profit = Revenue ($30) - Explicit Costs ($23) - Implicit Costs ($10). Total costs are $33, resulting in an economic loss of $3."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two countries have identical PPFs, but Country B's central planners produce at the midpoint (50X, 100Y) despite consumers preferring (70X, 60Y). This illustrates:",
        "options": [
          "Productive inefficiency because resources are unemployed.",
          "Allocative inefficiency because production doesn't match preferences.",
          "Technical efficiency because the midpoint is on the PPF.",
          "Dynamic efficiency because planners consider long-term stability."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Production on the PPF is productively efficient. However, failing to match the specific mix of goods to consumer desire is a hallmark of allocative inefficiency."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy experiences: (1) new oil reserves, (2) a pandemic reducing labor by 10%, and (3) a technological breakthrough. Which BEST describes the likely effect on the PPF?",
        "options": [
          "Definite outward shift because new resources and technology outweigh labor loss.",
          "Definite inward shift because labor force reduction dominates.",
          "Ambiguous shift depending on relative magnitudes.",
          "No shift because the three effects cancel each other out."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Resources and technology shift the PPF out, while labor loss shifts it in. The net effect is ambiguous without knowing the specific magnitude of each change."

        "question": "A firm's marginal cost for the 100th unit is $50, and the marginal benefit to consumers is $65. Production creates pollution costing society $20. What is the socially optimal decision?",
        "options": [
          "Produce because private marginal benefit exceeds private marginal cost.",
          "Do not produce because social marginal cost exceeds marginal benefit.",
          "Produce only if the firm pays a $20 tax to internalize the externality.",
          "Produce because the firm's profit incentive ensures efficiency."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Social Marginal Cost ($50 + $20 = $70) is greater than the Marginal Benefit ($65). Producing this unit creates a net social loss of $5."

        "options": [
          "Both countries benefit because the terms fall between their opportunity costs.",
          "Only Country A benefits because it has absolute advantage in food.",
          "Only Country B benefits because it receives more than its opportunity cost for clothing.",
          "Neither benefits because the terms don't reflect comparative advantage."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Trade is mutually beneficial when the terms of trade (1.2) fall between the opportunity costs of the two parties (0.67 and 1.33)."

        "question": "An entrepreneur quits an $80,000 job, earns $200,000 revenue with $140,000 explicit costs, and gives up an 8% return on $50,000 savings. What is the economic profit?",

          "-$24,000",
          "$56,000"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Implicit Costs = $80,000 salary + $4,000 investment return = $84,000. Economic Profit = $200,000 - $140,000 - $84,000 = -$24,000."

        "question": "An economy's PPF shifts outward by 20%, but it operates at 85% of new capacity. Compared to the original 100% capacity, actual output has:",
        "options": [
          "Increased by 20%",

          "Decreased by 15%",
          "Increased by 17%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "New capacity is 120 (100 * 1.2). Actual output is 85% of 120, which is 102. Compared to the original 100, output has increased by 2%."
