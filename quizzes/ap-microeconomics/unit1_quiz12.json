      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A factory uses a specific input combination: for every machine (capital), it requires 2 workers (labor) to operate efficiently. This reflects that in the short run:",
        "options": [
          "The factors of production are perfectly substitutable, resulting in a linear PPF.",
          "The factors are complementary, contributing to the law of increasing opportunity cost and a bowed-out PPF.",
          "The production function exhibits constant returns to scale, shifting the PPF parallelly.",
          "There is no trade-off between capital and labor, so the PPF is a right angle."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The description indicates resources are **not perfectly adaptable** (machines and workers are used in fixed proportions for efficiency). This **resource specificity** is the fundamental reason for the **law of increasing opportunity cost**. As you produce more of one good, you must use resources less and less suited for it, raising the opportunity cost. This is graphically represented by a PPF that is **bowed outward (concave to the origin)**."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The data below shows the trade-offs for an economy producing drones (D) and robots (R). The opportunity cost of producing each additional drone increases. What is the approximate opportunity cost of producing the third drone?",
        "image": "images/ecoeco2.png",
        "options": [
          "1 robot",
          "2 robots",
          "3 robots",
          "4 robots"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The opportunity cost of a good is measured by what you **give up** to get more of it. Look at the change from producing 2 drones to 3 drones. When moving from 2 to 3 drones, robot production falls from 7 to 4. The opportunity cost of the **third drone** is therefore **7 - 4 = 3 robots**. The data demonstrates increasing opportunity cost: the 1st drone cost 1 robot, the 2nd cost 2 robots, the 3rd costs 3 robots."

        "question": "An attorney who can type 120 words per minute and earns $300 per hour considers hiring a secretary who types 80 words per minute and earns $25 per hour. From an economic efficiency perspective, which statement is correct?",
        "options": [
          "The attorney should do their own typing because they are more productive",
          "The attorney has absolute advantage in typing but should hire the secretary based on opportunity cost",
          "The secretary should not be hired because the attorney types faster",
          "Both should type their own documents to maintain quality control"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The attorney has **absolute advantage** in typing (120 vs. 80 wpm) but that's irrelevant. The key is **opportunity cost**. Each hour the attorney spends typing costs $300 in forgone legal work. The secretary's time costs $25/hour. Even though the secretary is slower, the **cost per word** is lower for the secretary: Attorney: $300/7200 words = $0.0417 per word. Secretary: $25/4800 words = $0.0052 per word. The attorney has **comparative advantage in legal work**, not typing. Hiring the secretary maximizes total economic efficiency."

        "question": "A bakery must decide whether to bake one more cake. The ingredients cost $8, the baker's time costs $12, and the oven's depreciation for that cake is $3. The bakery could alternatively use those resources to bake 3 dozen cookies that would generate $10 in profit. The cake sells for $30. What is the economic profit from baking the cake?",
        "options": [
          "$7",
          "$17",
          "-$3",
          "$20"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "**Economic Profit = Revenue - Explicit Costs - Implicit Costs.** Revenue = $30. Explicit Costs = $8 + $12 + $3 = $23. **Implicit Cost = Opportunity Cost** = $10 (forgone profit from cookies). Total Cost = $23 + $10 = $33. Economic Profit = $30 - $33 = **-$3**. The bakery incurs an economic loss by choosing the cake, despite a $7 accounting profit. The rational choice is to bake cookies."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two countries have identical PPFs (both can produce 100X or 200Y). However, Country A has a mixed economy while Country B has a command economy. Country B's central planners consistently produce at the midpoint (50X, 100Y) despite consumer surveys showing preferences for (70X, 60Y). Which economic concept does this best illustrate?",
        "options": [
          "Productive inefficiency because resources are unemployed",
          "Allocative inefficiency because production doesn't match preferences",
          "Technical efficiency because the midpoint is on the PPF",
          "Dynamic efficiency because planners consider long-term stability"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both (50X,100Y) and (70X,60Y) are **on the PPF**, so there is **productive/technical efficiency**—no wasted resources. The problem is **allocative inefficiency**: the economy is producing the **wrong mix of goods** relative to what consumers want. This is a classic failure of command economies that lack price signals to align production with consumer preferences."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy experiences simultaneous: (1) discovery of new oil reserves, (2) a pandemic that reduces the labor force by 10%, and (3) a technological breakthrough in manufacturing. Which of the following BEST describes the likely effect on the PPF?",
        "options": [
          "Definite outward shift because new resources and technology outweigh labor loss",
          "Definite inward shift because labor force reduction dominates",
          "Ambiguous shift depending on relative magnitudes; possible rotation if effects differ by sector",
          "No shift because the three effects cancel each other out"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "(1) New oil → outward shift (more resources). (2) Labor reduction → inward shift (fewer resources). (3) Technology → outward shift (higher productivity). The **net effect is ambiguous** without knowing magnitudes. Additionally, if effects are **sector-specific** (oil helps energy, tech helps manufacturing, labor affects all), the PPF may **rotate** (change shape) rather than shift uniformly. Economic analysis requires acknowledging this uncertainty."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm's marginal cost of producing the 100th unit is $50, and the marginal benefit to consumers (measured by willingness to pay) is $65. However, production creates pollution that imposes $20 in costs on society. Using cost-benefit analysis, what is the socially optimal decision?",
        "options": [
          "Produce the unit because private marginal benefit exceeds private marginal cost",
          "Do not produce because social marginal cost exceeds marginal benefit",
          "Produce only if the firm pays a $20 tax to internalize the externality",
          "Produce because the firm's profit incentive ensures efficiency"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Social Marginal Cost (SMC)** = Private MC ($50) + External Cost ($20) = **$70**. **Social Marginal Benefit (SMB)** = $65. Since SMC ($70) > SMB ($65), producing this unit creates a **net social loss of $5**. The socially optimal decision is **not to produce**. A $20 Pigouvian tax (Option C) would align private MC with social MC, leading the firm to not produce, which is consistent—but the question asks for the optimal decision itself, which is 'do not produce.'"

        "question": "Country A can produce 1 unit of food with 2 hours of labor or 1 unit of clothing with 3 hours. Country B can produce 1 unit of food with 4 hours or 1 unit of clothing with 3 hours. If both countries have 60 hours of labor, and after specialization they agree on terms of trade of 1 food for 1.2 clothing, which statement is TRUE?",
        "options": [
          "Both countries benefit because the terms fall between their opportunity costs",
          "Only Country A benefits because it has absolute advantage in food",
          "Only Country B benefits because it receives more than its opportunity cost for clothing",
          "Neither benefits because the terms don't reflect comparative advantage"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "**Calculate OCs.** Country A: 1 Food = 2/3 Clothing; 1 Clothing = 1.5 Food. Country B: 1 Food = 4/3 Clothing; 1 Clothing = 0.75 Food. A has comparative advantage in **Food** (2/3 < 4/3). B has CA in **Clothing** (0.75 < 1.5). **Terms:** 1 Food = 1.2 Clothing (or 1 Clothing = 0.833 Food). Check: For A (exports Food): Gets 1.2 Clothing > domestic 0.667 → **benefits**. For B (exports Clothing): Gets 0.833 Food > domestic 0.75 → **benefits**. Terms (1.2) lie between 0.667 and 1.333, so **both gain**."

        "question": "An entrepreneur quits a job paying $80,000 annually to start a business. The business generates $200,000 in revenue and has explicit costs of $140,000. The entrepreneur could have earned 8% annual return by investing their $50,000 savings in the stock market instead of the business. What is the economic profit?",

          "$60,000",
          "-$20,000",
          "-$24,000",
          "$56,000"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "**Economic Profit = Revenue - Explicit Costs - Implicit Costs.** Revenue = $200,000. Explicit Costs = $140,000. **Implicit Costs:** 1) Forgone salary = $80,000. 2) Forgone investment return = $50,000 × 0.08 = $4,000. Total Implicit = $84,000. Economic Profit = $200,000 - $140,000 - $84,000 = **-$24,000**. The venture has a **$60,000 accounting profit** but a **$24,000 economic loss** when considering all opportunity costs."

        "question": "An economy's PPF shifts outward uniformly by 20%, but simultaneous policy changes cause the economy to operate at 85% of its new capacity. Compared to the original equilibrium at 100% capacity, what has happened to actual output?",
        "options": [
          "Increased by 20%",
          "Increased by 2%",
          "Decreased by 15%",
          "Increased by 17%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Let original capacity = 100 units (100% utilization). New capacity = 120 units (20% increase). New actual output = 85% of 120 = 102 units. Change = 102 - 100 = **+2 units**, or a **2% increase**. The 20% potential gain is largely offset by the 15 percentage point drop in utilization rate (from 100% to 85%). This highlights that **productive inefficiency** (operating inside the PPF) can severely diminish the benefits of economic growth."
