    "topic": "Consumer/Producer Surplus with Elasticity, Utility Maximization Algebra, Cross‑Price/Income Elasticity Applications, Price Discrimination, Tax Efficiency",
    "duration": 50,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is elastic, which area increases when price decreases?",
        "options": [
          "Producer surplus",
          "Consumer surplus",
          "Deadweight loss",
          "Tax revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When demand is elastic, a price decrease leads to a proportionally larger increase in quantity demanded, significantly increasing **consumer surplus**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer has \\$100 to spend on goods X and Y. Px = \\$10, Py = \\$5. If MUx = 50 and MUy = 20, how should the consumer adjust spending to maximize utility?",
        "options": [
          "Buy more X and less Y",
          "Buy more Y and less X",
          "Buy equal amounts of X and Y",
          "Spend all on X"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Compare MU/P: MUx/Px = 50/10 = 5. MUy/Py = 20/5 = 4. MUx/Px > MUy/Py → consumer gets more “bang for the buck” from X, so should **buy more X, less Y**. Wait — that contradicts the options. Actually: MUx/Px > MUy/Py means marginal utility per dollar is higher for X → increase X, decrease Y → that’s **option A**. But let’s check: If MUx/Px is higher, you want more X. So answer is A."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for a product is given by Qd = 200 – 5P. What is the price elasticity of demand at P = 20?",
        "options": [
          "–1",
          "–0.5",
          "–2",
          "–0.25"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At P=20, Qd = 200 – 5(20) = 100. Elasticity = (dQ/dP) × (P/Q) = –5 × (20/100) = –5 × 0.2 = **–1** (unit elastic)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price discrimination is more profitable when:",
        "options": [
          "Demand is perfectly elastic",
          "Markets cannot be separated",
          "Demand elasticities differ across groups",
          "Marginal cost is increasing"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Price discrimination relies on **different price elasticities of demand** across consumer groups, allowing firms to charge higher prices to less elastic groups and lower prices to more elastic groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a good has an income elasticity of –0.3 and consumer income rises by 10%, quantity demanded will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase by 3%",
          "Decrease by 3%",
          "Increase by 0.3%",
          "Decrease by 0.3%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity = %∆Qd / %∆Income → –0.3 = %∆Qd / 10% → %∆Qd = –0.3 × 10% = **–3%** (inferior good)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A tax on a good with relatively elastic demand and inelastic supply will result in:",
        "options": [
          "Producers bearing most of the tax burden",
          "Consumers bearing most of the tax burden",
          "Equal burden sharing",
          "No change in equilibrium quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tax burden falls more heavily on the side that is **less elastic** (less able to avoid the tax). Here, supply is inelastic → **producers bear most of the burden**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If MRS > Px/Py, the consumer can increase utility by:",
        "options": [
          "Buying more X and less Y",
          "Buying more Y and less X",
          "Buying equal amounts of both",
          "Spending less on both"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MRS > Px/Py means the consumer values X more relative to Y than the market does → should **consume more X, less Y** to move toward MRS = Px/Py."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the price of smartphones falls, the demand for smartphone apps increases. The cross‑price elasticity between smartphones and apps is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive",
          "Negative",
          "Zero",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Smartphones and apps are **complements**. Lower smartphone price increases demand for apps → negative cross‑price elasticity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer's budget line shifts outward in a parallel manner. This could be caused by:",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the price of one good",
          "An increase in income",
          "A change in preferences",
          "An increase in the price of both goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A **parallel outward shift** of the budget line occurs when **income increases** and prices remain unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price elasticity of supply is 2.0 and price rises by 5%, quantity supplied will rise by:",

          "2.5%",
          "5%",
          "10%",
          "20%"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Es = %∆Qs / %∆P → 2.0 = %∆Qs / 5% → %∆Qs = 2.0 × 5% = **10%**."
