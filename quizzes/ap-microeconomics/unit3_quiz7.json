      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an economy where healthcare has a highly inelastic demand, how would the imposition of tighter caps on medical services prices likely affect the market?",
        "options": [
          "The inflow of new patients and expansion of facilities would accelerate significantly due to the demand’s sensitivity to price reductions.",
          "With tighter price caps, total healthcare spending could decrease, but patient volumes may remain largely unchanged.",
          "The market would experience an oversupply of healthcare services as the price would be too low to cover costs.",
          "Healthcare providers would necessarily increase the quality of services, still their revenue is affected less than quantity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inelastic demand → quantity demanded changes little when price changes. Tighter price caps lower price, but patient volume (quantity) stays roughly the same → **total spending (P×Q) decreases**. Shortage may occur if supply is reduced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a negative income elasticity of demand for used textbooks indicate about consumer behavior when income levels change?",
        "options": [
          "The demand for used textbooks is perfectly inelastic with respect to income changes.",
          "Used textbooks are a luxury good, with demand increasing more than proportionally to income increases.",
          "Used textbooks exhibit Giffen good characteristics, violating the law of demand.",
          "Used textbooks are an inferior good, with demand decreasing as income rises."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Negative income elasticity → **inferior good**. Demand falls as income rises (students buy new books instead)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a drought reduces the available farmland for growing corn, which of the following would most likely characterize the price elasticity of supply for corn in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Es > 1, as farmers can quickly shift to alternative crops",
          "Es < 1, as farmers have limited ability to adjust production",
          "Es = 0, as supply becomes perfectly inelastic",
          "Es = 1, as the percentage changes in price and quantity are equal"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Short‑run, with fixed farmland, supply cannot increase even if price rises → **perfectly inelastic supply (Es = 0)**."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the price of coffee increases by 10%, the quantity of sugar demanded decreases by 5%. If the price of sugar remains constant, what economic relationship does this demonstrate?",
        "options": [
          "Income elasticity of -0.5; inferior good",
          "Cross-price elasticity of 0.5; substitute goods",
          "Price elasticity of demand of -0.5; inelastic demand",
          "Cross-price elasticity of -0.5; complementary goods"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity = %∆Qd sugar / %∆P coffee = –5% / 10% = –0.5 → **complements** (coffee and sugar used together)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an increase in price results in a proportionally smaller increase in quantity supplied, how is the good’s elasticity described?",
        "options": [
          "Unitary elastic supply",
          "Elastic supply",
          "Inelastic supply",
          "Perfectly elastic supply"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Supply elasticity Es = %∆Qs / %∆P. If %∆Qs < %∆P → Es < 1 → **inelastic supply**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might a government‑imposed maximum price ceiling above equilibrium price impact consumer surplus in a market with perfectly elastic supply?",
        "options": [
          "Consumer surplus would increase due to larger quantities being purchased at lower prices than equilibrium.",
          "There would be no effect on consumer surplus as quantity supplied remains unchanged at equilibrium levels.",
          "It leads to decreased producer surplus but does not change consumer surplus as only producers bear losses.",
          "Consumer surplus would decrease since some consumers will buy more while others will be excluded completely."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price ceiling **above equilibrium** is non‑binding. Market stays at equilibrium. With perfectly elastic supply (horizontal), equilibrium is determined by supply price → **no change in price or quantity, so consumer surplus unchanged**."

        "question": "The market for cigarettes has the following characteristics: initial equilibrium price = \\$5, quantity = 100 million packs, price elasticity of demand = –0.4, price elasticity of supply = 0.5. If the government imposes a \\$2 per pack tax, what will be the new equilibrium quantity?",
        "options": [
          "77.8 million packs",
          "82.2 million packs",
          "60 million packs",
          "90 million packs"
        ],
        "explanation": "Tax burden formula: ∆Q/Q* = (Es × Ed)/(Es – Ed) × (T/P*). Es=0.5, Ed=|–0.4|=0.4, T=2, P*=5. ∆Q/100 = (0.5×0.4)/(0.5–0.4) × (2/5) = (0.2)/(0.1) × 0.4 = 2 × 0.4 = 0.8. ∆Q = 80 million? That’s increase? Wait, tax reduces Q. Let’s use ∆Q = – (Es×Ed)/(Es+|Ed|) × (T/P*) × Q*. Better: ∆Q = – (0.5×0.4)/(0.5+0.4) × (2/5) × 100 = – (0.2)/(0.9) × 0.4 × 100 ≈ –0.222 × 40 ≈ –8.88 million. New Q ≈ 100 – 8.88 ≈ 91.12 million → closest is **90 million** (D).",

          "1.25"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity = %∆Qd / %∆Income. %∆Qd = (220–200)/200 = 10%. Income change = –5%. Ey = 10% / –5% = **–2.00**. Negative → inferior good."

        "options": [
          "Consumer expenditure will increase.",
          "Consumer expenditure will remain unchanged.",
          "The quantity demanded for cheese will increase sharply.",
          "Consumer expenditure will decrease substantially."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price floor raises price. With highly inelastic demand, quantity demanded falls only slightly → **consumer expenditure (P×Q) increases**."

          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Indeterminate"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic demand → vertical demand curve. Quantity demanded fixed. Supply increase lowers price, but quantity sold unchanged → total revenue (P×Q) **decreases** because price falls. Wait, total revenue = P×Q, Q fixed, P falls → revenue falls. But they ask for consumer expenditure (same as total revenue from buyers). It **decreases**. Let’s check options: increases, decreases, stays same, indeterminate. Since Q unchanged and P falls → expenditure falls. So answer: **Decreases** (B)."
