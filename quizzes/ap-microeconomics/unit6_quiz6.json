    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a monopoly graph, the area representing deadweight loss is bounded by:",
        "options": [
          "Demand, MC, and the monopoly quantity",
          "Demand, MC, and the competitive quantity",
          "MR, MC, and the monopoly quantity",
          "P, ATC, and the monopoly quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the triangle between the demand curve (MB), MC curve, and the difference between competitive (where P=MC) and monopoly output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopoly faces demand P = 50 – Q and has MC = 10. What is the profit-maximizing price?",
        "options": [
          "$20",
          "$30",
          "$40",
          "$50"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MR = 50 – 2Q. Set MR = MC: 50 – 2Q = 10 → Q = 20. P = 50 – 20 = $30."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist practices perfect price discrimination, consumer surplus becomes:",
        "options": [
          "Maximized",
          "Half of the competitive level",
          "Zero",
          "Equal to producer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfect price discrimination allows the monopolist to capture all consumer surplus, leaving consumers with none."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist’s profit is maximized where:",
        "options": [
          "The slope of the total revenue curve equals the slope of the total cost curve",
          "Total revenue is maximized",
          "Average total cost is minimized",
          "Price equals marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Profit is maximized where MR = MC, which corresponds to equal slopes of TR and TC curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand for a monopoly’s product becomes more elastic, the profit-maximizing price will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Stay the same",
          "Become unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More elastic demand means consumers are more price-sensitive; the monopolist will lower price to maximize profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural monopoly with ATC declining over the relevant range will have:",
        "options": [
          "MC > ATC",
          "MC = ATC",
          "MC < ATC",
          "MC horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If ATC is falling, marginal cost must be below average total cost (MC < ATC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government imposes a price ceiling at the competitive level on a monopolist, the monopolist will produce where:",
        "options": [
          "MR = MC",
          "P = MC",
          "P = ATC",
          "MR = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding price ceiling at the competitive price forces P = MC, leading the monopolist to produce the socially optimal output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopoly, the Lerner Index ( (P – MC)/P ) is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "1 / |Ed|",
          "|Ed|",
          "MR",
          "ATC – MC"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Lerner Index measures market power and equals the inverse of the absolute value of price elasticity of demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist in long-run equilibrium may not produce at minimum ATC because:",
        "options": [
          "It is required by law",
          "Demand is too low",
          "Barriers to entry allow inefficiency",
          "MC is always above ATC"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Without competitive pressure, a monopolist may not minimize costs or produce at minimum ATC, leading to X-inefficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopoly’s fixed costs increase, the profit-maximizing price and output will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase price, decrease output",
          "Decrease price, increase output",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Become unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fixed costs affect ATC but not MC or MR, so the profit-maximizing output and price remain the same; only profit changes."
