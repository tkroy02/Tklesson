    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "First-degree price discrimination occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "Different prices are charged based on buyer characteristics",
          "Each unit is sold at the consumer’s maximum willingness to pay",
          "Different prices are charged for different quantities",
          "Prices vary by time of purchase"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First-degree (perfect) price discrimination means charging each consumer the maximum they are willing to pay for each unit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A regulated natural monopoly that is required to set price equal to marginal cost will:",
        "options": [
          "Earn economic profit",
          "Break even",
          "Incur a loss",
          "Produce less than the competitive output"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In natural monopoly, MC < ATC. If P = MC, then P < ATC, resulting in a loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of price discrimination is commonly used by movie theaters (student vs. adult tickets)?",
        "options": [
          "First-degree",
          "Second-degree",
          "Third-degree",
          "Perfect"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Third-degree price discrimination charges different prices to different groups based on elasticity of demand (e.g., students vs. adults)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Antitrust laws aim to:",
        "options": [
          "Protect monopolies",
          "Promote competition and prevent monopolization",
          "Guarantee profits for large firms",
          "Set prices for all industries"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Antitrust laws are designed to promote competition, prevent monopolistic practices, and protect consumers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under average-cost pricing regulation, a natural monopoly will:",
        "options": [
          "Earn economic profit",
          "Break even (zero economic profit)",
          "Incur a loss",
          "Produce where P = MC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Average-cost pricing sets P = ATC, allowing the firm to cover all costs including normal profit, but no economic profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a potential benefit of monopoly?",
        "options": [
          "Lower prices",
          "Higher output",
          "Innovation from R&D",
          "Greater consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolies may invest more in research and development due to sustained profits and lack of competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For price discrimination to be successful, a firm must:",
        "options": [
          "Have identical customers",
          "Prevent resale between groups",
          "Operate in perfect competition",
          "Have constant marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Price discrimination requires market segmentation and the ability to prevent arbitrage (resale) between different consumer groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a single-price monopolist, a perfectly price-discriminating monopolist produces:",
        "options": [
          "Less output",
          "The same output",
          "More output",
          "Where P < MC"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfect price discrimination results in output where P = MC (socially efficient level), which is greater than the single-price monopoly output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural monopoly is most likely to emerge in industries with:",
        "options": [
          "Low fixed costs",
          "High variable costs",
          "Large economies of scale",
          "Many small firms"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Natural monopolies arise when large economies of scale mean one firm can supply the entire market at lower cost than multiple firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 primarily targets:",
        "options": [
          "Price floors",
          "Monopolization and restraint of trade",
          "International tariffs",
          "Environmental regulations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Sherman Act prohibits monopolization, attempts to monopolize, and conspiracies in restraint of trade."
