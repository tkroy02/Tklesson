      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a country opens to trade and becomes an importer of a good, which group unambiguously benefits in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Domestic producers of the good",
          "Domestic consumers of the good",
          "Workers in the import-competing industry",
          "Government tax collectors",
          "Exporters of unrelated goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a country imports, domestic price falls to world price. Consumers benefit from lower prices and increased quantity consumed, resulting in increased consumer surplus. Domestic producers lose, workers in that industry may lose jobs, and government doesn't necessarily gain revenue unless tariffs are imposed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country X produces widgets at a constant cost of \\$8 each. The world price is \\$5. If Country X imposes a \\$2 per unit tariff, what is the deadweight loss per unit of the resulting reduced trade?",
        "options": [
          "\\$0",
          "\\$1",
          "\\$2",
          "\\$3",
          "\\$4"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Without tariff: imports occur at \\$5. With \\$2 tariff: price rises to \\$7. Domestic production increases from where MC = \\$5 to where MC = \\$7. The extra production cost (triangle area) = 0.5 × (\\$7 - \\$5) × ΔQ. Consumption decreases from where MB = \\$5 to where MB = \\$7. Lost consumer surplus (triangle) = 0.5 × (\\$7 - \\$5) × ΔQ. Combined DWL per unit of reduced trade = \\$1 (average of the two marginal losses)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the US dollar appreciates against the Japanese yen, what is the likely effect on US imports from Japan?",
        "options": [
          "US imports increase because Japanese goods become cheaper in dollar terms",
          "US imports decrease because Japanese goods become more expensive in dollar terms",
          "US imports remain unchanged because trade contracts are in dollars",
          "US imports decrease because US goods become cheaper for Japanese consumers",
          "US imports increase because US consumers have more purchasing power"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dollar appreciation means each dollar buys more yen. Japanese goods priced in yen become cheaper when converted to dollars, making them more attractive to US consumers, increasing US imports from Japan."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary economic effect of an import quota that restricts imports to 1,000 units (when free trade imports would be 2,000 units) is to:",
        "options": [
          "Transfer surplus from consumers to domestic producers",
          "Create government revenue equal to the quota rent",
          "Increase total surplus by protecting domestic jobs",
          "Eliminate all deadweight loss from international trade",
          "Make the country better off by reducing dependence on foreign goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A quota raises domestic price above world price, reducing consumer surplus. Part of this lost consumer surplus becomes increased producer surplus for domestic firms, and part becomes quota rent (captured by whoever holds import licenses). There is also deadweight loss from reduced consumption and inefficient domestic production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A customs union differs from a free trade area in that a customs union:",
        "options": [
          "Has no internal tariffs but allows independent external trade policies",
          "Has common external tariffs against non-members",
          "Requires complete economic integration including common currency",
          "Only covers agricultural goods, not manufactured goods",
          "Is always welfare-improving for all member countries"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both free trade areas and customs unions eliminate tariffs among members. However, a customs union also establishes a common external tariff against non-members, while free trade areas allow each member to set its own external tariffs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Country A has a comparative advantage in producing cloth and Country B has a comparative advantage in producing wine, trade will allow both countries to:",
        "options": [
          "Produce outside their production possibilities frontiers",
          "Consume outside their production possibilities frontiers",
          "Eliminate all opportunity costs from production",
          "Achieve absolute advantage in both goods",
          "Reduce their need for capital investment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Specialization according to comparative advantage allows countries to produce more efficiently. Through trade, countries can consume combinations of goods that would be unattainable if they were limited to only what they produce domestically—consumption possibilities expand beyond the production possibilities frontier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'anti-dumping' argument for protectionism is based on:",
        "options": [
          "Foreign firms selling below cost to drive out domestic competition",
          "Foreign goods being subsidized by their governments",
          "Domestic industries needing time to become competitive",
          "National security concerns about foreign dependence",
          "Environmental standards being lower in other countries"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dumping occurs when foreign firms sell products below their cost of production or below their home market price. Anti-dumping duties are justified as preventing predatory pricing intended to eliminate domestic competition before raising prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country C's currency depreciates by 20%. Assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, what happens to Country C's trade balance?",
        "options": [
          "Immediately improves because exports become cheaper",
          "Immediately worsens because imports become more expensive",
          "May worsen initially but improve over time as quantities adjust",
          "Will not change because prices adjust proportionally",
          "Depends solely on the inflation rate in Country C"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The J-curve effect: currency depreciation makes imports immediately more expensive (worsening trade balance in short run) but makes exports cheaper. Over time, as export quantities increase and import quantities decrease (if Marshall-Lerner condition holds—sum of export and import price elasticities > 1), trade balance improves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A small country imports shoes at a world price of \\$50. The government imposes a \\$10 tariff. The domestic price becomes \\$60. What portion of the tariff is borne by domestic consumers?",
        "options": [
          "0% - foreign producers pay the entire tariff",
          "25% - consumers pay \\$2.50",
          "50% - consumers pay \\$5",
          "75% - consumers pay \\$7.50",
          "100% - consumers pay the entire \\$10"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "For a small country (price taker in world markets), the world supply is perfectly elastic at \\$50. A tariff shifts the supply curve upward by exactly \\$10. Since world supply is perfectly elastic, foreign producers continue to receive \\$50, and domestic consumers pay the full \\$10 increase (\\$60)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents a potential gain from trade liberalization?",
        "options": [
          "Increased market power for domestic monopolies",
          "Greater variety of goods available to consumers",
          "Higher prices for consumer goods",
          "Reduced competition leading to higher quality",
          "Decreased incentive for technological innovation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Trade liberalization allows consumers access to imported goods, increasing product variety. Other gains include: lower prices (in importing sectors), increased competition leading to efficiency gains, economies of scale for exporters, and technology transfer."
