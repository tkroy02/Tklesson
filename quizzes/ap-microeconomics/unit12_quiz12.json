    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a monopoly firm is operating in a range of output where total revenue is rising as output rises, then marginal revenue:",
        "options": [
          "Is also rising.",
          "Is constant.",
          "Is falling but is greater than zero.",
          "Is falling but is less than zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If TR is increasing, MR > 0. For a downward-sloping demand curve, MR is positive but decreasing until it becomes negative when TR starts falling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An indication of the technological inefficiency of the monopolist, when compared to the perfect competitor, is that:",
        "options": [
          "The monopolist's price is set above the marginal cost of the good.",
          "The demand curve facing the monopolist is downward sloping.",
          "In the long-run, a monopolist is not forced to produce at the minimum point of the average total cost curve.",
          "A monopolist earns more economic profit in the long-run than does the competitive firm.",
          "The monopolist has no competition to force him to produce where MC = MR."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfect competitors produce at min ATC in LR; monopolists do not necessarily do so, leading to excess capacity or higher ATC → technological inefficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price discrimination:",
        "options": [
          "Tends to decrease the allocative inefficiency of a monopolist.",
          "Will provide more total revenue to the firm than the profit-maximizing price the monopolist would set in the absence of such discrimination.",
          "Generally results in greater output than under a single price monopoly.",
          "When it is perfect, causes the monopolist to produce where marginal social cost is just equal to marginal social benefit.",
          "All of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Price discrimination can increase output, reduce deadweight loss, raise revenue, and under perfect (first-degree) discrimination, output expands to P = MC, achieving allocative efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Although a monopolistically competitive firm in long-run equilibrium is producing output at an average total cost higher than the minimum, economists are not greatly concerned about this inefficiency because:",
        "options": [
          "Additional firms may enter the industry and force price down.",
          "Consumers gain satisfaction from having a wide variety of products available.",
          "Consumers would unquestionably benefit from having fewer products produced more cheaply.",
          "Advertising may allow a firm to expand output.",
          "Firms are making zero economic profit."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The higher ATC reflects product differentiation and variety, which consumers value. The trade-off between variety and productive efficiency is often considered acceptable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand curve that confronts a monopolistically competitive firms is:",
        "options": [
          "Less elastic than the demand curve that confronts the industry.",
          "Perfectly inelastic because of numerous substitutes for the firm's product.",
          "Less elastic than the demand curve facing a perfectly competitive firm.",
          "Horizontal, showing that MR = P.",
          "Perfectly elastic in the long-run, driving economic profits to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopolistically competitive firms face downward-sloping demand curves, which are less elastic (steeper) than the perfectly elastic demand of perfect competitors, but more elastic than a monopolist's demand."
