      {

        "question": "When Country A has a comparative advantage in producing wheat and Country B has a comparative advantage in producing textiles, both countries can benefit from trade by:",
        "options": [
          "Country A specializing in wheat and Country B specializing in textiles, then trading",
          "Country A producing both goods but exporting wheat at a higher price",
          "Country B imposing tariffs on wheat to protect its domestic producers",
          "Both countries producing both goods but trading the surpluses"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage leads to gains from trade when countries specialize in producing goods where they have lower opportunity costs and trade for other goods."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the balance of payments, the current account includes:",
        "options": [
          "Trade in goods and services, investment income, and unilateral transfers",
          "Foreign direct investment and portfolio investment flows",
          "Changes in official reserve assets held by the central bank",
          "Government borrowing and lending from international organizations"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The current account records trade in goods/services (balance of trade), investment income (interest, dividends), and unilateral transfers (foreign aid, remittances)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under a fixed exchange rate system, if a country faces persistent balance of payments deficits, the central bank must:",
        "options": [
          "Sell foreign currency reserves to support its currency's value",
          "Allow its currency to depreciate to equilibrium level",
          "Increase domestic interest rates to attract capital inflows",
          "Both A and C are necessary actions"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Under fixed rates, central banks intervene to maintain parity. For deficits: sell foreign reserves (to buy domestic currency) and/or raise interest rates (to attract capital inflows and support currency)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country with a trade surplus (exports > imports) will typically experience:",
        "options": [
          "Net capital outflow as it accumulates foreign assets",
          "Net capital inflow as foreigners invest in the country",
          "Appreciation of its currency under flexible exchange rates",
          "Both A and C are likely outcomes"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Trade surplus means net exports > 0. This creates net capital outflow (surplus invested abroad) and under flexible rates, increased demand for currency causes appreciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The most-favored-nation (MFN) principle in international trade requires that:",
        "options": [
          "Any trade concession granted to one WTO member must be extended to all members",
          "Countries must eliminate all tariffs on agricultural products",
          "Developing countries receive preferential treatment in trade agreements",
          "Trade disputes are resolved through binding arbitration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MFN is a core WTO principle preventing discrimination among trading partners. Trade advantages given to one member must be given to all WTO members."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the U.S. dollar appreciates against the euro, U.S. imports from the Eurozone will likely:",
        "options": [
          "Increase because European goods become cheaper in dollar terms",
          "Decrease because European goods become more expensive in dollar terms",
          "Remain unchanged because prices are fixed in contracts",
          "Decrease only if demand for European goods is price elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dollar appreciation means each dollar buys more euros. Euro-priced goods become cheaper when converted to dollars, making them more attractive to U.S. consumers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents a non-tariff barrier to trade?",
        "options": [
          "A 10% ad valorem tariff on imported automobiles",
          "Import quotas limiting textile imports to 1 million units annually",
          "Technical standards requiring specific safety features on electronics",
          "Both B and C are non-tariff barriers"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Non-tariff barriers include quotas (quantitative restrictions) and technical standards/regulations that disproportionately affect imports. Tariffs are price-based barriers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under a flexible exchange rate system, a country with higher inflation than its trading partners will experience:",
        "options": [
          "Currency depreciation to maintain purchasing power parity",
          "Currency appreciation as interest rates rise to combat inflation",
          "Increased exports as domestic goods become relatively cheaper",
          "No automatic exchange rate adjustment"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher inflation reduces purchasing power domestically. Under flexible rates, the currency depreciates to restore purchasing power parity (PPP) with trading partners."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'J-curve effect' describes the phenomenon where:",
        "options": [
          "Currency depreciation initially worsens the trade balance before improving it",
          "Trade liberalization initially increases imports before boosting exports",
          "Economic growth initially increases trade deficits before creating surpluses",
          "Tariff reductions initially harm domestic producers before benefiting consumers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The J-curve: currency depreciation makes imports immediately more expensive (worsening trade balance in short run) but over time, as export quantities rise and import quantities fall (if Marshall-Lerner holds), trade balance improves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country with a current account deficit must have:",
        "options": [
          "A financial/capital account surplus of equal magnitude",
          "Decreasing foreign exchange reserves",
          "A trade surplus in goods and services",
          "Net capital outflow to finance the deficit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Balance of payments must balance: Current Account + Financial Account = 0. Therefore, a current account deficit (negative) must be matched by a financial account surplus (positive) of equal size."
