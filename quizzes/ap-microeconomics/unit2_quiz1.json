    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario will cause a movement along the demand curve for bicycles?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in consumer income",
          "A decrease in the price of bicycles",
          "A rise in the price of electric scooters (a substitute)",
          "A government campaign promoting cycling"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Only a change in the **price of the good itself** causes a **movement along** the demand curve. All other options change **non-price determinants** (income, prices of related goods, tastes), which **shift** the demand curve."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of leather rises, what happens in the market for leather boots?",
        "options": [
          "Demand increases",
          "Supply increases",
          "Demand decreases",
          "Supply decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Leather is an **input** in boot production. Higher input costs reduce profitability, causing producers to supply less at each price — a **decrease in supply** (leftward shift)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Coffee and tea are substitutes. If a new study shows tea has significant health risks, what happens in the coffee market?",
        "options": [
          "Demand for coffee increases, price and quantity rise",
          "Supply of coffee increases, price falls, quantity rises",
          "Demand for coffee decreases, price and quantity fall",
          "Supply of coffee decreases, price rises, quantity falls"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Negative news about tea reduces demand for tea. Since coffee is a substitute, some consumers switch to coffee → **demand for coffee increases** (shifts right). Equilibrium price and quantity of coffee both rise."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given: Qd = 200 - 5P and Qs = 50 + 3P. What is equilibrium price and quantity?",
        "options": [
          "P = 15, Q = 125",
          "P = 20, Q = 100",
          "P = 18.75, Q = 106.25",
          "P = 25, Q = 75"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Set Qd = Qs: 200 - 5P = 50 + 3P → 150 = 8P → P = 18.75. Q = 200 - 5(18.75) = 106.25 (or Q = 50 + 3(18.75) = 106.25)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose smartphones become more fashionable (demand increases), while at the same time production technology improves (supply increases). What is the effect on equilibrium price and quantity?",
        "options": [
          "Price increases, quantity indeterminate",
          "Quantity increases, price indeterminate",
          "Price decreases, quantity increases",
          "Price increases, quantity increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Demand increase → upward pressure on price and quantity. Supply increase → downward pressure on price, upward pressure on quantity. **Quantity will definitely rise**. Price effect is **indeterminate** — depends on relative shift magnitudes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A binding price floor set above equilibrium will result in:",
        "options": [
          "Shortage and black markets",
          "Surplus and government purchases or storage",
          "No change in market outcome",
          "Increased consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A **price floor above equilibrium** creates a **surplus** (Qs > Qd). To maintain the floor, the government may buy excess supply or impose production quotas. Examples: agricultural price supports, minimum wage (in labor market)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government imposes an effective price ceiling on rental housing, which is a likely long‑run outcome?",
        "options": [
          "Increased construction of new rental housing",
          "Decreased quality and maintenance of rental units",
          "Higher investment in rental property improvements",
          "A surplus of available rental units"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A **binding price ceiling** creates a shortage. Landlords receive less revenue, reducing incentive to maintain or improve properties. **Quality often deteriorates**. New construction is discouraged, worsening shortage long‑term."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following will increase the demand for normal good X?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the price of good X",
          "A decrease in consumer income",
          "An increase in the price of a substitute good",
          "A decrease in the price of a complementary good"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Demand for X increases if: 1) **Income rises** (normal good), 2) **Price of a substitute rises**, 3) **Price of a complement falls**, 4) **Tastes shift toward X**, 5) **Expectations of future price increase**. Here, only option C fits."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A new tax is placed on producers of gasoline. In a competitive market, this will shift:",
        "options": [
          "Demand curve leftward",
          "Supply curve leftward",
          "Both demand and supply leftward",
          "Supply curve rightward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A tax on producers increases their cost of production at each quantity, reducing willingness to supply — a **leftward shift in supply**. The tax burden is shared between buyers and sellers depending on elasticity (covered in Unit 3)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the market for concert tickets is initially in equilibrium and then both demand and supply decrease, what happens to equilibrium price?",
        "options": [
          "Price increases",
          "Price decreases",
          "Price is indeterminate",
          "Price remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Decrease in demand → downward pressure on price and quantity. Decrease in supply → upward pressure on price, downward pressure on quantity. **Quantity will definitely fall**. **Price effect is indeterminate** — depends on which shift is larger."
