      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors is least likely to affect a firm’s labor demand curve?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Changes in workers’ personal values.",
          "Fluctuations in the demand for the firm’s final product.",
          "Variations in the productivity of the resource.",
          "Changes in the price of alternative resources for production."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Labor demand is derived from product demand and depends on productivity and input prices. Workers’ personal values affect labor supply, not labor demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines derived demand in the context of factor markets?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The demand for goods that are derived solely from consumers’ preferences for quality products.",
          "A demand that is directly determined by the availability of factors, independent of final product demand.",
          "A direct observable demand for labor that is unaffected by changes in consumer markets.",
          "The demand for a factor of production that arises from the demand for the final goods or services that require that factor."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Derived demand means the demand for a factor (like labor) comes from the demand for the final good or service it helps produce."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a scenario where a firm’s marginal factor cost (MFC) is greater than the wage rate due to facing an upward‑sloping labor supply curve?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "An industry where numerous firms compete for labor results in a fixed wage rate and a horizontal labor supply curve.",
          "A monopsonistic employer must increase wages for all existing workers to attract an additional worker, causing the marginal factor cost to exceed the wage rate.",
          "A government‑regulated wage system sets a constant wage across sectors with no impact on the marginal cost of hiring additional workers.",
          "A competitive market employer pays a uniform wage, where the marginal factor cost is equal to the wage rate regardless of additional hires."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In monopsony, to hire more workers, the firm must raise the wage for all workers, making MFC > wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the marginal product of labor function MPL = 10 − 0.2L and a product price of $20, what is the marginal revenue product (MRP) when 15 workers are employed?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "140, because when L = 15, MPL = 10 − 0.2×15 = 7, so MRP = 7 × 20 = 140.",
          "150, based on an incorrect application of the formula.",
          "130, due to subtracting the product price from MPL.",
          "160, as a result of miscalculating the decrease in MPL."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MRP = MPL × P. At L = 15, MPL = 10 − 3 = 7. MRP = 7 × 20 = 140."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm is choosing to employ more capital than labor. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The price of other resources has increased",
          "The productivity of labor has decreased",
          "The marginal product of capital is higher relative to its price than labor’s",
          "The number of qualified workers has increased"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Firms choose inputs to minimize cost: they use more of the input whose MP per dollar is higher. If MPK / PK > MPL / PL, capital is favored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a perfectly competitive firm is producing at a quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, what is likely to occur if the market price increases?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The firm will decrease its production.",
          "The firm will increase its production.",
          "The firm will shut down in the short run.",
          "The firm will maintain its current level of production."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, MR = P. A higher price raises MR above MC at the current output, so the firm expands production until MC rises to the new, higher MR."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a perfectly competitive firm is maximizing profits and the market wage rate is $60, what must be true about the last worker hired?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The worker’s MPL × P = $60",
          "The worker’s MPL × P > $60",
          "The worker’s MPL = $60",
          "The worker’s MPL × P < $60"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Profit‑maximizing hiring occurs where MRP = wage. In perfect competition, MRP = MPL × P. Thus, MPL × P = $60."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What will happen if, in a given year, the price of capital increases relative to the price of labor according to the least cost rule?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Firms will substitute labor for capital, increasing their use of labor to minimize production costs.",
          "Firms will reduce overall production since labor cannot fully replace capital.",
          "Firms will face an upward shift in the labor supply curve and higher wages.",
          "Firms will continue using the same input mix because the marginal products remain constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The least‑cost rule states firms adjust input mix so that MP per dollar is equal across inputs. A rise in PK lowers MPK / PK, making labor relatively cheaper per unit of marginal product, leading to substitution toward labor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm operates in a perfectly competitive labor market but is a monopoly in the output market, how is its MRP for labor calculated?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "MPL × Price of output",
          "MPL × Marginal revenue",
          "MPL × Average revenue",
          "MPL × Total revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a monopoly in the output market, MR < P, so MRP = MPL × MR."
      },
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "Which of the following would cause the labor demand curve for factory workers to shift left?",
  "image": null,
  "options": [
    "An increase in demand for the factory's product",
    "A rise in worker productivity due to training",
    "A rise in robot technology",
    "A decrease in the wage rate"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Improved robot technology acts as a substitute for labor, reducing demand for factory workers (leftward shift). Wage changes cause movement along the curve, not a shift."
