    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The slope of an indifference curve represents:",
        "options": [
          "The price ratio of the two goods",
          "The marginal rate of substitution (MRS)",
          "The total utility from consuming the bundle",
          "The budget constraint"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The slope of an indifference curve is the **marginal rate of substitution (MRS)** — the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another while maintaining the same level of utility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a normal good falls, the substitution effect and income effect:",
        "options": [
          "Both work to increase quantity demanded",
          "Work in opposite directions",
          "Both work to decrease quantity demanded",
          "Only the substitution effect matters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a **normal good**: price ↓ → substitution effect (good is relatively cheaper) ↑ quantity demanded; income effect (real income rises) ↑ quantity demanded. **Both effects increase quantity demanded**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If supply is perfectly elastic, a tax imposed on sellers will:",
        "options": [
          "Be fully borne by buyers",
          "Be fully borne by sellers",
          "Be shared equally",
          "Cause no change in market quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfectly elastic supply → horizontal supply curve. Sellers cannot raise price without losing all sales, so they absorb the entire tax → **sellers bear full burden**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true at the utility‑maximizing bundle?",
        "options": [
          "MRS = Px/Py",
          "MUx = MUy",
          "Total utility is maximized for good X only",
          "The budget constraint is irrelevant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the optimum, the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line → **MRS = Px/Py**. Also, MRS = MUx/MUy, so MUx/Px = MUy/Py."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A good is considered a luxury if its income elasticity is:",
        "options": [
          "Greater than 1",
          "Between 0 and 1",
          "Less than 0",
          "Equal to 1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Luxury goods have **income elasticity > 1** (demand grows faster than income). Necessities have income elasticity between 0 and 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the price of good X rises, the substitution effect alone will cause the consumer to:",
        "options": [
          "Buy more of X and less of Y",
          "Buy less of X and more of Y",
          "Buy the same amount of both goods",
          "Stop buying X altogether"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Substitution effect (holding utility constant): when price of X rises, X becomes relatively more expensive → consumer substitutes toward good Y → **buys less X, more Y**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes is –0.4, and the government wants to reduce smoking by 20% through a tax, by what percentage should price increase?",
        "options": [
          "8%",
          "20%",
          "50%",
          "80%"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ed = %∆Qd / %∆P → –0.4 = –20% / %∆P → %∆P = (–20%) / (–0.4) = **50% price increase needed**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An indifference curve that is L‑shaped (right angle) represents goods that are:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect substitutes",
          "Perfect complements",
          "Unrelated",
          "Inferior goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Perfect complements** are consumed in fixed proportions (e.g., left and right shoes). Indifference curves are L‑shaped; MRS is undefined at the corner."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the supply of apartments is perfectly inelastic in the short run. A rent control (price ceiling) below equilibrium will result in:",
        "options": [
          "A large shortage",
          "No shortage because supply cannot adjust",
          "A surplus",
          "Increased quantity supplied"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even with perfectly inelastic supply, a price ceiling below equilibrium reduces quantity supplied? Wait — perfectly inelastic supply means Qs is fixed. If price ceiling is below equilibrium, quantity supplied remains same but quantity demanded increases → **shortage** emerges because Qd > fixed Qs."

          "Straight lines with constant slope",
          "L‑shaped",
          "Curved and convex to origin",
          "Vertical lines"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "**Perfect substitutes** have constant MRS → indifference curves are **straight, downward‑sloping lines**."
