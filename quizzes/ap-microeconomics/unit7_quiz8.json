    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopoly is producing at the profit maximizing quantity, which of the following must be true?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Marginal Revenue > Marginal Cost = Price",
          "Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost = Price",
          "Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost < Price",
          "Marginal Revenue < Marginal Cost = Price",
          "Marginal Revenue > Marginal Cost < Price"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A monopoly maximizes profit where MR = MC. Because the demand curve is downward sloping, price (P) is greater than marginal revenue (MR). Therefore, at the profit‑maximizing quantity: MR = MC < P."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true about imperfectly competitive firms (monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition) that profit maximize?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "They price at marginal cost",
          "They must lower price to sell more units of output",
          "They charge the price determined by the market",
          "They maximize economic surplus",
          "They minimize deadweight loss"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Imperfectly competitive firms face downward‑sloping demand curves, meaning they must lower price to increase quantity sold. They do not price at MC (a), are not price‑takers (c), do not maximize total surplus (d), and create rather than minimize deadweight loss (e)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for both a perfectly competitive firm AND monopolistically competitive firm in the long run?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Price equals marginal cost",
          "Price is greater than marginal cost",
          "Price is equal to average revenue",
          "Price is equal to marginal revenue",
          "Marginal revenue is equal to average total cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Price equals average revenue for all firms by definition (AR = TR/Q = price). Perfect competition has P = MC and P = MR, but monopolistic competition has P > MC and P > MR. Only (c) holds true for both market structures in the long run."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for a monopolistically competitive firm but NOT true for a perfectly competitive firm?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Profit maximizing quantity is where marginal cost equals marginal revenue",
          "Marginal revenue is less than demand",
          "Allocatively efficient quantity is where marginal cost equals price",
          "Productive efficient quantity is where marginal cost equals average total cost",
          "Economic profits will be zero in the long run"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolistically competitive firms face a downward‑sloping demand curve, so MR < P (demand). Perfectly competitive firms face a horizontal demand curve where MR = P (demand). All other options are either true for both or false for monopolistic competition."
