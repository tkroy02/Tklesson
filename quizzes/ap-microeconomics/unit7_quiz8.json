    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopoly is producing at the profit maximizing quantity, which of the following must be true?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Marginal Revenue > Marginal Cost = Price",
          "Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost = Price",
          "Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost < Price",
          "Marginal Revenue < Marginal Cost = Price",
          "Marginal Revenue > Marginal Cost < Price"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A monopoly maximizes profit where MR = MC. Because the demand curve is downward sloping, price (P) is greater than marginal revenue (MR). Therefore, at the profit‑maximizing quantity: MR = MC < P."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true about imperfectly competitive firms (monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition) that profit maximize?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "They price at marginal cost",
          "They must lower price to sell more units of output",
          "They charge the price determined by the market",
          "They maximize economic surplus",
          "They minimize deadweight loss"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Imperfectly competitive firms face downward‑sloping demand curves, meaning they must lower price to increase quantity sold. They do not price at MC (a), are not price‑takers (c), do not maximize total surplus (d), and create rather than minimize deadweight loss (e)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for both a perfectly competitive firm AND monopolistically competitive firm in the long run?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Price equals marginal cost",
          "Price is greater than marginal cost",
          "Price is equal to average revenue",
          "Price is equal to marginal revenue",
          "Marginal revenue is equal to average total cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Price equals average revenue for all firms by definition (AR = TR/Q = price). Perfect competition has P = MC and P = MR, but monopolistic competition has P > MC and P > MR. Only (c) holds true for both market structures in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for a monopolistically competitive firm but NOT true for a perfectly competitive firm?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Profit maximizing quantity is where marginal cost equals marginal revenue",
          "Marginal revenue is less than demand",
          "Allocatively efficient quantity is where marginal cost equals price",
          "Productive efficient quantity is where marginal cost equals average total cost",
          "Economic profits will be zero in the long run"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolistically competitive firms face a downward‑sloping demand curve, so MR < P (demand). Perfectly competitive firms face a horizontal demand curve where MR = P (demand). All other options are either true for both or false for monopolistic competition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Game Theory is used to explain:",

        "options": [
          "Why firms price discriminate",
          "How monopolies evolve into oligopolies",
          "Strategic behavior of firms in oligopoly",
          "Profit maximization in monopoly",
          "Price leadership of monopolistic competition"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Game theory is the primary tool for analyzing strategic interaction and interdependence among firms in an oligopoly, such as in pricing, output decisions, and reactions to competitors' moves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume a profit maximizing monopoly was subject to a lump sum tax. Which of the following will occur?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Price and quantity will stay the same",
          "Price will increase and quantity will decrease",
          "Price will increase but quantity will stay the same",
          "The consumer surplus would get smaller",
          "The monopoly would produce the socially optimal quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A lump‑sum tax is a fixed cost that does not affect marginal cost or marginal revenue. Therefore, the profit‑maximizing output and price (determined by demand at that output) remain unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume that Prescott Pharmaceuticals, which holds patents on Vaxadrin, Vaxadrine, and Vaxadrone is an unregulated monopolist. Its profit‑maximizing quantity will always be somewhere...",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "where marginal revenue equals price",
          "where price equals marginal cost",

          "in the region of the demand curve where marginal revenue is negative",
          "in the region of the demand curve where marginal revenue is positive"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "A monopolist maximizes profit where MR = MC. Since MC is positive, MR must be positive at equilibrium. This occurs in the elastic portion of the demand curve, where MR > 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Price (Demand) exceeds marginal revenue for the pure monopolist because:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the law of diminishing returns doesn’t apply",
          "the demand curve lies below the marginal revenue curve",
          "the monopolist produces a smaller output than would a purely competitive firm",
          "the demand curve is inelastic",
          "to sell more the monopolist must lower its price"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Because a monopolist faces a downward‑sloping demand curve, selling an additional unit requires lowering the price on all units sold, which makes marginal revenue less than price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "One difference between oligopolies and monopolistically competitive markets is that",

        "options": [
          "There is no deadweight loss in monopolistically competitive markets, but there is in oligopolies",
          "The products sold in monopolistically competitive markets are identical",
          "Oligopolies have fewer barriers to entry",
          "Firms maximize profits in monopolistically competitive markets but not in oligopolies",
          "There are fewer firms in oligopolistic markets than in monopolistically competitive ones"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Oligopolies consist of a few large firms with significant market power and interdependence, while monopolistically competitive markets have many small firms with differentiated products and free entry/exit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Pure monopolists may obtain economic profits in the long run because:",

        "options": [
          "they advertise extensively",
          "marginal revenue is constant as sales increase",

          "diseconomies of scale keep costs low",
          "the demand for their products are inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Long‑run economic profits for a pure monopolist are sustained by barriers to entry (e.g., patents, control of resources, legal protections) that prevent new firms from entering and competing away those profits."
