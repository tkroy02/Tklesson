    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer maximizes utility when:",
        "options": [
          "Total utility is maximized regardless of prices",
          "Marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for all goods",
          "The marginal utility of each good is zero",
          "The budget constraint is maximally stretched"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Utility is maximized when **MUx/Px = MUy/Py** — the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods, given the budget constraint."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The substitution effect of a price increase for a normal good leads the consumer to:",
        "options": [
          "Buy more of the good",
          "Buy less of the good",
          "Buy the same amount",
          "Stop buying the good entirely"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Substitution effect (holding utility constant): when price rises, the good becomes relatively more expensive → consumer substitutes away from it → **buys less**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Giffen good is characterized by:",
        "options": [
          "Positive income elasticity",
          "Upward‑sloping demand curve",
          "Perfectly inelastic demand",
          "Being a luxury good"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A **Giffen good** is an inferior good for which the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, resulting in an **upward‑sloping demand curve** (quantity demanded rises when price rises)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a good falls, the income effect for an inferior good will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase quantity demanded",
          "Decrease quantity demanded",
          "Have no effect",
          "Make demand perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For an inferior good, a price fall increases real income, which **reduces** quantity demanded (income effect works opposite to substitution effect)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Indifference curves cannot intersect because:",
        "options": [
          "It would violate the assumption of transitivity",
          "Consumers always prefer more to less",
          "Budget constraints would be irrelevant",
          "Marginal utility would be negative"
        ],
        "explanation": "Intersecting indifference curves would imply inconsistent preferences (same bundle yielding different utility levels), violating the **axiom of transitivity** in consumer theory.",
        "answer": "A"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Veblen good violates the law of demand because:",
        "options": [
          "It is an inferior good with a strong income effect",
          "Its demand increases as price rises due to perceived status",
          "It has perfectly inelastic supply",
          "It is a necessity with no substitutes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Veblen goods** (luxury status goods) have upward‑sloping demand because higher price increases prestige/desirability, overriding the normal substitution effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Diminishing marginal utility implies that:",
        "options": [
          "Total utility decreases with consumption",
          "Each additional unit consumed adds less to total utility",
          "Consumers should only buy one unit of a good",
          "Marginal utility becomes negative after the first unit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Diminishing marginal utility**: as more of a good is consumed, the additional satisfaction from each extra unit declines."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a consumer is at a bundle where MRS > Px/Py, they can increase utility by:",
        "options": [
          "Buying more X and less Y",
          "Buying more Y and less X",
          "Spending more on both",
          "Staying at the current bundle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MRS > Px/Py means the consumer values X more relative to Y than the market price ratio suggests → should **consume more X, less Y** until MRS = Px/Py."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Behavioral economics suggests consumers sometimes violate the assumption of rationality by:",
        "options": [
          "Always maximizing marginal utility per dollar",
          "Exhibiting bounded rationality and present bias",
          "Having perfectly consistent time preferences",
          "Never making systematic errors"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Behavioral economics introduces **bounded rationality, present bias, loss aversion, and framing effects** — systematic departures from perfect rationality assumed in traditional models."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the price of a normal good rises, the total effect on quantity demanded is:",
        "options": [
          "A decrease due to both substitution and income effects",
          "An increase due to the income effect",
          "Unchanged because effects cancel",
          "An increase due to the substitution effect"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a normal good, price rise → substitution effect (buy less) and income effect (real income falls, buy less) **both reduce quantity demanded**."
