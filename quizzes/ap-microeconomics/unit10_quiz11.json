    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the economic classification of goods, which of the following is considered excludable?",
        "options": [
          "A city bus that requires a valid fare for boarding.",
          "A non-congested bridge that does not charge a toll.",
          "The protection provided by a nation's military forces.",
          "The open atmosphere used for the disposal of carbon emissions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Excludability refers to the property of a good whereby a person can be prevented from using it if they do not pay. A bus is excludable because the provider can deny service to anyone without a ticket. In contrast, national defense (C) and the atmosphere (D) are non-excludable, as it is impossible or prohibitively expensive to prevent non-payers from benefiting."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the economic classification of goods, which of the following is considered non-excludable?",
        "options": [
          "The open atmosphere used for the dispersal of industrial emissions.",
          "A taxi service that operates within a strictly regulated urban zone.",
          "An art museum that requires a timed-entry ticket for admission.",
          "A congested toll bridge that utilizes an electronic sensor system."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non-excludability occurs when it is impossible or prohibitively expensive to prevent non-payers from consuming the good. While a taxi, museum, and toll bridge all have mechanisms to exclude those who do not pay (fares, tickets, or sensors), the atmosphere is accessible to all, making it a common resource or public good depending on rivalry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In microeconomics, a common resource is specifically characterized as being:",
        "options": [
          "Rival in its consumption and non-excludable in its provision.",
          "Non-rival in its consumption and excludable in its provision.",
          "Non-rival in its consumption and non-excludable in its provision.",
          "Rival in its consumption and excludable in its provision."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Common resources are rival because one person's use reduces the amount available for others, but they are non-excludable because it is costly or impossible to prevent access to them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cable television and air-traffic control systems are economically similar because both services are:",
        "options": [
          "Non-rival in consumption, as one user's use does not reduce availability for others.",
          "Non-excludable in provision, as it is impossible to prevent non-payers from access.",
          "Excludable in provision, as access is strictly controlled by a central provider.",
          "Rival in consumption, as the marginal cost of serving an additional user is high."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both goods are non-rival: the marginal cost of providing the service to an additional consumer is zero. However, they differ in excludability; cable is a club good (excludable), while air-traffic control is typically a public good (non-excludable)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a good is a public good,",
        "options": [
          "anyone can be excluded from enjoying its benefits.",
          "consumers pay a low price.",
          "no one can be excluded from enjoying its benefits.",
          "economies of scale exist over the entire range of output for which there is a demand.",
          "consumers must pay a high price to enjoy its benefits."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Public goods are defined by two characteristics: non-excludability (no one can be prevented from using them) and non-rivalry (one person's use doesn't diminish another's)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a city street is congested, it is",
        "options": [
          "a public good.",
          "a private good.",
          "nonrival and excludable.",
          "nonrival and nonexcludable.",
          "a common resource."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "A congested street is rival (one additional car reduces space/quality for others) and non-excludable (typically open to all), making it a common resource (also called a common-pool resource)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of the economic classification of goods, a natural monopoly is typically characterized as being:",
        "options": [
          "Non-rival in its consumption and excludable in its provision.",
          "Rival in its consumption and non-excludable in its provision.",
          "Non-rival in its consumption and non-excludable in its provision.",
          "Rival in its consumption and excludable in its provision."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural monopolies, such as local utility grids, are non-rival because the marginal cost of serving an additional consumer is zero or near-zero. However, they are excludable because the provider can prevent access to the service for those who do not pay their bills."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A good that is rival and nonexcludable is a",
        "options": [
          "common resource.",
          "private good.",
          "regulated good.",
          "public good.",
          "government good."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Common resources are rival (one person's use reduces availability for others) and non-excludable (difficult to prevent access). Examples include fisheries, clean air, and congested roads."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which one of the following goods exhibits nonexcludability?",
        "options": [
          "cable TV",
          "air-traffic control",
          "rides on the U.S. Space Shuttle",
          "the Internet",
          "a cheeseburger"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Air-traffic control is non-excludable because once provided for one plane, all planes in the area benefit from the safety system. Cable TV, Space Shuttle rides, and Internet access are typically excludable (require payment), and a cheeseburger is a private good."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Median Voter Theorem, competition between two political parties in a majority-rule system will likely cause those parties to propose policies that are:",
        "options": [
          "Quite similar as both parties compete for the preferences of the median voter.",
          "Quite different as parties attempt to appeal to the ideological extremes of their bases.",
          "Inefficient because they prioritize the well-being of the wealthy over the middle class.",
          "Socially optimal by successfully equating the total social costs and total social benefits."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Median Voter Theorem predicts that in a two-party race, candidates will move toward the center of the distribution of voter preferences to secure a majority. This results in both parties proposing policies that closely mirror the position of the median voter."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Public goods are provided by government because",
        "options": [
          "private firms do not take into account the impact of external costs.",
          "governments are more efficient than private firms at producing public goods.",
          "people value national defence very highly.",
          "private firms will make an economic profit.",
          "free-rider problems result in underproduction by private markets."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The free-rider problem (non-excludability) means private firms cannot charge users effectively, leading to underprovision. Government provision funded by taxation solves this market failure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to public choice theory government failure occurs because",
        "options": [
          "voters are fully informed about the effects of policies.",
          "government officials do not listen to the pleading of special interest groups.",
          "lobbyists write legislation.",
          "government cannot calculate the levels of externalities because there is no market for them.",
          "government officials act in their own self-interest."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Public choice theory applies economic analysis to political behavior, arguing that government officials (like all individuals) act in their own self-interest (re-election, budgets, power), which can lead to inefficient outcomes (government failure)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An important defence of oligopoly as a market structure is that",
        "options": [
          "it results in lower prices than perfect competition.",
          "it is more productively efficient than monopoly.",
          "it involves less allocative inefficiency than monopoly.",
          "it is the most efficient available alternative when the minimum efficient scale is large.",
          "it generates less unused capacity than monopolistic competition."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When minimum efficient scale (MES) is large relative to market demand, having multiple small firms would be inefficient due to high average costs. Oligopoly (with a few large firms) may be the most efficient feasible structure, allowing firms to achieve economies of scale."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the absence of externalities, what can be said about the invisible hand of the marketplace",
        "options": [
          "It leads to a market outcome that maximizes total benefit to the society",
          "It is unable to resolve inherent inefficiencies in the market",
          "It induces people to act in a manner inconsistent with their self-interest",
          "It increases transaction costs of contracting between parties in an exchange"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' suggests that in competitive markets without externalities, individuals pursuing self-interest through voluntary exchange lead to socially optimal outcomes (allocative efficiency where MSB = MSC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The social marginal cost of the production of snowmobiles",
        "options": [
          "includes the noise pollution imposed on those living near snowmobile trails.",
          "is less than the marginal external cost of production.",
          "does not include the increased risk of accidents caused by the operation of snowmobiles.",
          "is greater than the sum of the private marginal cost and external cost.",
          "does not include the carbon emissions from snowmobiles."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Social marginal cost (MSC) = private marginal cost (MPC) + marginal external cost (MEC). Noise pollution is an external cost imposed on bystanders, so it is included in MEC and thus in MSC."
