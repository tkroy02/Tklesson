      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm decides to hire more workers despite an increase in wage. What is the most likely cause for this?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A reduction in the number of qualified workers",
          "A decrease in the price of other resources",
          "An increase in product demand",
          "A decrease in government intervention"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher product demand raises MRP, which can outweigh a wage increase, leading the firm to hire more workers even at a higher wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would a significant increase in the productivity of workers due to technological advancements likely affect the equilibrium wage and employment in a labor market?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Decrease equilibrium wage but increase employment",
          "Increase equilibrium wage but decrease employment",
          "Decrease both equilibrium wage and employment",
          "Increase both equilibrium wage and employment"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity raises MRP, shifting labor demand right. With upward‑sloping labor supply, both equilibrium wage and employment increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does marginal revenue product (MRP) differ from marginal factor cost (MFC) in the context of hiring decisions?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Both MRP and MFC represent the same concept but are used in different terminologies by different economists.",
          "MRP is the additional revenue generated by employing one more unit of input, whereas MFC is the additional cost incurred from hiring that extra unit.",
          "MRP is a concept used only in monopsonistic markets, while MFC applies exclusively to perfectly competitive markets.",
          "MRP measures the extra cost of production while MFC shows the extra revenue coming in from hiring more labor."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MRP = extra revenue from hiring one more worker; MFC = extra cost of hiring one more worker. Firms hire until MRP = MFC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if the market wage rises above the marginal revenue product of labor in a perfectly competitive labor market?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Firm increases product price",
          "Firm maintains current labor",
          "Firm reduces labor hired",
          "Firm increases labor hired"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If wage > MRP, the cost of an additional worker exceeds the revenue they bring, so the firm will cut back on labor to maximize profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the presence of a single buyer in a monopsony market affect the supply curve for labor that the firm faces?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The supply curve shifts rightward as more suppliers enter the market attracted by stable demand.",
          "The supply curve remains constant as wage rates do not change with the number of employees hired.",
          "The supply curve becomes upward sloping because the firm must pay higher wages to hire additional workers.",
          "The supply curve becomes perfectly inelastic since workers cannot sell their labor elsewhere."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In monopsony, the firm faces the market labor supply curve, which is upward sloping—to hire more workers, it must pay a higher wage to all workers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would an improvement in technology that automates many tasks within an industry affect the demand curve for low-skilled labor?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The demand curve would remain stable since technological change doesn’t impact work quality.",
          "The demand curve would shift rightward as automation creates more jobs than it replaces.",
          "The demand curve would shift leftward due to decreased need for low-skilled labor.",
          "The demand curve would shift rightward because production becomes easier with technology."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Automation substitutes for low-skilled labor, reducing demand and shifting the labor demand curve left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sudden increase in the number of qualified workers in the healthcare sector is observed. What is likely to cause this?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Decrease in product demand",
          "Increase in labor supply (SL)",
          "Decrease in the price of other resources",
          "Increase in labor demand (DL)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More qualified workers increases labor supply, not demand. The cause could be more graduates, immigration, or training programs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the quantity of labor demanded when the wage rate increases, assuming other factors remain constant?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It fluctuates unpredictably",
          "It increases",
          "It decreases",
          "It remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Movement along a downward‑sloping labor demand curve: higher wage reduces quantity demanded (law of demand)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What similarity exists between the Least Cost Rule and equilibrium wage determination?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Both decrease with output",
          "Both are unrelated to costs",
          "Both are set externally",
          "Both involve optimization"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Both involve optimization: Least Cost Rule optimizes input mix for given output; equilibrium wage is where supply and demand optimize market allocation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which characteristic best defines a monopsonistic market?",

          "Single buyer dominates",
          "Product differentiation",
          "Multiple sellers compete",
          "High barriers to entry"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monopsony is a market with a single buyer (employer) of a factor of production (like labor)."
