    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to quantity supplied when there is a price increase due to a shortage?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes zero",
          "It decreases",
          "It increases",
          "It remains constant"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A shortage occurs when price is below equilibrium. The rising price (due to excess demand) incentivizes producers to increase **quantity supplied** (movement along the supply curve)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which elasticity concept is used to analyze the effect of a tax on a good?",
        "options": [
          "Price elasticity of supply",
          "Tax elasticity of demand",
          "Cross-price elasticity",
          "Income elasticity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tax incidence depends on **price elasticity of supply and price elasticity of demand**. The more inelastic side bears more of the tax burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the price of hamburgers increases from \\$2 to \\$3, the quantity demanded for buns decreases from 150 to 100 units. Assuming no other factors have changed, what is the cross‑price elasticity of demand between hamburgers and buns?",
        "options": [
          "1.50",
          "–1.50",
          "0.67",
          "–0.67"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity = %∆Qd buns / %∆P hamburgers. %∆Qd buns = (100–150)/150 = –33.33%. %∆P hamburgers = (3–2)/2 = 50%. Exy = –33.33% / 50% = **–0.67**. Negative → complements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a product has an elastic demand, what would likely happen to total revenue if the price of the product decreases?",
        "options": [
          "The change in total revenue cannot be determined without information on supply elasticity.",
          "Total revenue would increase.",
          "Total revenue would decrease.",
          "Total revenue would remain unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Elastic demand (|Ed| > 1) → %∆Qd > %∆P. Price decrease leads to a proportionally larger increase in quantity sold → **total revenue increases**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the cross‑price elasticity of demand between two goods is –2, how would an increase in the price of one good affect the demand for the other?",
        "options": [
          "There would be no change in quantity demanded for the other good.",
          "The quantity demanded for the other good would decrease as they are complements.",
          "The quantity demanded for the other good would increase as they are substitutes.",
          "The effect on the quantity demanded for the other good cannot be determined without additional information."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity = –2 → **complements**. Price of one good ↑ → demand for the other ↓."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume the price elasticity of supply for a product is perfectly inelastic. If the price of the product increases by 10%, what will happen to the quantity supplied?",
        "options": [
          "The quantity supplied will increase or decrease depending on market conditions.",
          "The quantity supplied will decrease by 10%.",
          "The quantity supplied will remain unchanged.",
          "The quantity supplied will increase by 10%."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic supply → vertical supply curve. Quantity supplied does not respond to price changes → **unchanged**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a cross‑price elasticity of demand of 0 indicate?",
        "options": [
          "Substitute goods",
          "Unrelated goods",
          "Complementary goods",
          "Inferior goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity = 0 → changes in price of one good have **no effect** on demand for the other → **unrelated goods**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumer incomes decline while the product is considered an inferior good, what will be the effect on the demand curve and the corresponding equilibrium market outcome?",
        "options": [
          "The demand curve shifts to the right, resulting in a higher equilibrium price and quantity.",
          "The demand curve shifts to the left, leading to lower equilibrium price and quantity.",
          "There is no change in the demand curve; only consumer surplus declines.",
          "The supply curve shifts to the right, decreasing equilibrium price."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inferior good: demand ↑ when income ↓. Income decline → demand shifts **right** → higher equilibrium price and quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of price elasticity of supply describes a situation where the quantity supplied becomes infinite as the price increases?",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly Elastic Supply",
          "Relatively Inelastic Supply",
          "Perfectly Inelastic Supply",
          "Unit Elastic Supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfectly elastic supply → horizontal supply curve. At a given price, sellers will supply **any quantity** (effectively infinite if price is above that level)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the cross‑price elasticity of demand between hot dogs and hamburgers help determine their economic relationship as goods?",
        "options": [
          "A positive cross‑price elasticity indicates they are substitutes, while a negative value suggests they are complements.",
          "The magnitude of the cross‑price elasticity determines whether they are normal or inferior goods.",
          "The sign of the cross‑price elasticity indicates whether they are Giffen or Veblen goods.",
          "A zero cross‑price elasticity implies they are perfect complements in consumption."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity: **Positive → substitutes** (price of one ↑ → demand for other ↑). **Negative → complements** (price of one ↑ → demand for other ↓)."
