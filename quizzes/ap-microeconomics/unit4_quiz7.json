        "question": "A small bakery produces fresh bread every morning. Which one of the following is most likely to be a fixed cost for the bakery in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "The monthly rent paid for the bakery premises.",
          "The flour used to bake loaves each day.",
          "The electricity used to power the ovens for each batch.",
          "The fuel used in the bakery van for deliveries."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fixed costs do not vary with output in the short run. Rent is fixed; flour, electricity, and fuel are variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a firm increases its level of output in the short run, what happens to its average fixed cost (AFC)?",
        "options": [
          "Average fixed cost rises because of diminishing marginal returns.",
          "Average fixed cost stays constant at all levels of output.",
          "Average fixed cost falls and then rises again.",
          "Average fixed cost falls continuously as output increases."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "AFC = TFC / Q. TFC is constant, so AFC falls as Q increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which one of the following best describes economies of scale?",
        "options": [
          "A fall in marginal cost when output falls in the short run.",
          "An increase in total fixed cost as the firm expands its capacity.",
          "A reduction in long-run average cost as output increases.",
          "A short-run rise in variable cost when more labour is hired."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economies of scale refer to falling long-run average total cost as output increases."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In microeconomics, how is the long run usually defined?",
        "options": [
          "A period of time lasting more than one calendar year.",
          "A period over which all sunk costs have been recovered.",
          "A period over which all factors of production can be varied.",
          "A period during which the firm makes supernormal profits."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The long run is defined as the period where all inputs are variable; no fixed factors exist."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which cost curve cuts both the average variable cost (AVC) and average total cost (ATC) curves at their minimum points?",
        "options": [
          "Average fixed cost (AFC).",
          "Average revenue (AR).",
          "Marginal revenue (MR).",
          "Marginal cost (MC)."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The marginal cost curve intersects the AVC and ATC curves at their respective minimum points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, which condition will cause a profit-maximising firm to shut down production immediately?",
        "options": [
          "Price is less than average total cost at the profit-maximising output.",
          "Price is less than average variable cost at all possible outputs.",
          "Price is equal to average total cost at the profit-maximising output.",
          "Price is equal to marginal cost at the profit-maximising output."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A firm shuts down if P < AVC at all output levels, because it cannot cover variable costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes normal profit for a firm?",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue is less than total cost, excluding opportunity costs.",
          "Total revenue is greater than total cost, excluding opportunity costs.",
          "Total revenue is greater than total cost, including opportunity costs.",
          "Total revenue is just equal to total cost, including the opportunity cost of capital and the entrepreneur's time."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Normal profit occurs when TR = TC including all implicit (opportunity) costs; economic profit is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If marginal cost is below average total cost, what happens to average total cost as output increases?",
        "options": [
          "Average total cost must be rising.",
          "Average total cost stays constant.",
          "Average total cost is falling.",
          "Average total cost falls then rises at every level of output."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When MC < ATC, each additional unit costs less than the average, pulling ATC down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement best describes the relationship between a firm's short-run average cost (SRAC) curves and its long-run average cost (LRAC) curve?",
        "options": [
          "The long-run average cost curve is always horizontal while short-run average cost curves are U-shaped.",
          "The long-run average cost curve is the locus of the lowest points of different short-run average cost curves associated with different plant sizes.",
          "Short-run average cost curves are always below the long-run average cost curve.",
          "The long-run average cost curve only applies to fixed costs and never to variable costs."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The LRAC curve is the envelope of the lowest points of all possible SRAC curves for different plant sizes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm experiences a rise in the wage rate it must pay its production workers, with no change in its fixed costs. Assuming labour is a variable factor, which statement best describes the likely impact on its short-run cost curves?",
        "options": [
          "Its marginal cost and average variable cost curves shift upwards, while average fixed cost is unchanged.",
          "Only its average fixed cost curve shifts upwards, because wages are a fixed cost in the short run.",
          "Only its long-run average cost curve shifts upwards, because all costs are variable in the long run.",
          "Its marginal cost curve shifts downwards, reducing average total cost at all output levels."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wages are a variable cost. An increase in wages raises MC and AVC but leaves AFC unchanged."
