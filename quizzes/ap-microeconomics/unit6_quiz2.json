    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopolist, marginal revenue (MR) is less than price because:",
        "options": [
          "The firm is a price taker.",
          "To sell more, price must be lowered on all units.",
          "Demand is perfectly elastic.",
          "Marginal cost is increasing."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve. Lowering price to sell an extra unit reduces revenue on all previous units, so MR < P."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist will maximize profit where:",
        "options": [
          "P = MC",
          "MR = MC",
          "P = ATC",
          "TR is maximized"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit is maximized where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, regardless of market structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist is producing where MR > MC, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase output",
          "Decrease output",
          "Raise price",
          "Shut down"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If MR > MC, each additional unit adds more to revenue than to cost, so increasing output increases profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist's demand curve is:",
        "options": [
          "The same as its marginal revenue curve",
          "The same as the market demand curve",
          "Horizontal",
          "Below the marginal revenue curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since the monopolist is the only seller, its demand curve is the market demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, a monopolist can earn economic profit because:",
        "options": [
          "It is a price taker",
          "Barriers to entry prevent competition",
          "It produces where P = MC",
          "Demand is perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Barriers to entry protect monopolists from new competitors, allowing long-run economic profits."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist will never produce where demand is:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic",
          "Inelastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the inelastic portion of demand, MR is negative, so producing there would reduce revenue and profit. Profit max occurs where |Ed| > 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist’s MC = 0, it maximizes profit by producing where:",
        "options": [
          "MR = 0",
          "P = 0",
          "ATC is minimized",
          "Demand is inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With MC = 0, profit max occurs where MR = 0, which is also where total revenue is maximized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to perfect competition, monopoly results in:",
        "options": [
          "Higher output and lower price",
          "Lower output and higher price",
          "Same output and price",
          "Higher output and higher price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolists restrict output to raise price above competitive levels, reducing consumer surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The monopolist’s supply curve is:",
        "options": [
          "The upward-sloping portion of MC",
          "The portion of MC above AVC",
          "The same as its demand curve",
          "Non-existent"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A monopolist does not have a supply curve because it sets both price and quantity; no unique relationship exists between price and quantity supplied independent of demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Deadweight loss in monopoly occurs because:",
        "options": [
          "Price equals marginal cost",
          "Price is less than marginal cost",
          "Output is lower than the socially optimal level",
          "The monopolist earns zero profit"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Monopoly produces where P > MC, meaning output is less than the allocatively efficient level, creating deadweight loss."
