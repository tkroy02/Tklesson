    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true of an economy which can produce just wheat and barley and has this production possibilities curve?",
        "image": "images/1122.png",
        "options": [
          "There are increasing opportunity costs as the production of wheat increases.",
          "The production possibilities curve will shift inward if there is an increase in the labor force.",
          "The resources used to produce wheat are easily adapted to the production of barley.",
          "If consumers demand more barley and wheat, the production possibilities curve will shift outward.",
          "There are no opportunity costs for producing more barley."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The image shows a straight-line Production Possibilities Curve (PPC), which represents constant opportunity costs. This occurs only when factors of production are homogeneous or perfectly suited for both tasks. Because resources used for wheat can be shifted to barley without efficiency loss, the opportunity cost does not increase."

        "question": "Gabriella chooses to go to the school dance with her friends and pay $15 for the ticket on a night she could have been paid $20 to give her cousin a Piano lesson or been paid $40 to fix a family friend's car radiator. What is Gabriella's opportunity cost?",
        "options": [
          "$15",
          "$35", 
          "$55",
          "$60",
          "$75"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost includes both explicit costs (out-of-pocket expenses) and implicit costs (value of the best alternative forgone). Here: $15 (ticket cost) + $40 (best alternative earnings from fixing radiator) = $55. The piano lesson ($20) is not the best alternative, so it's not included in the opportunity cost calculation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A high school student quits her job at a fast food restaurant earning $200 a week to start a business selling hand crafted bracelets. She spends $20 a week on a stand at a local craft fair, $100 a week on supplies to make the bracelets and earns $400 in revenue each week. What is her weekly accounting profit?",
        "options": [
          "$80",
          "$100", 
          "$180",
          "$280",
          "$300"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Accounting profit considers only explicit costs (actual money spent). Revenue = $400. Explicit costs = $20 (stand) + $100 (supplies) = $120. Accounting profit = $400 - $120 = $280. The forgone $200 fast food salary is an implicit cost (opportunity cost) that would be considered in economic profit, not accounting profit."
