        "question": "Which of the following is true of an economy which can produce just wheat and barley and has this production possibilities curve?",
        "image": "images/1122.png",
        "options": [
          "There are increasing opportunity costs as the production of wheat increases.",
          "The production possibilities curve will shift inward if there is an increase in the labor force.",
          "The resources used to produce wheat are easily adapted to the production of barley.",
          "If consumers demand more barley and wheat, the production possibilities curve will shift outward.",
          "There are no opportunity costs for producing more barley."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The image shows a straight-line Production Possibilities Curve (PPC), which represents constant opportunity costs. This occurs only when factors of production are homogeneous or perfectly suited for both tasks. Because resources used for wheat can be shifted to barley without efficiency loss, the opportunity cost does not increase."

        "question": "Gabriella chooses to go to the school dance with her friends and pay $15 for the ticket on a night she could have been paid $20 to give her cousin a Piano lesson or been paid $40 to fix a family friend's car radiator. What is Gabriella's opportunity cost?",
        "options": [
          "$15",
          "$35",
          "$55",
          "$60",
          "$75"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost includes both explicit costs (out-of-pocket expenses) and implicit costs (value of the best alternative forgone). Here: $15 (ticket cost) + $40 (best alternative earnings from fixing radiator) = $55. The piano lesson ($20) is not the best alternative, so it's not included in the opportunity cost calculation."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A high school student quits her job at a fast food restaurant earning $200 a week to start a business selling hand crafted bracelets. She spends $20 a week on a stand at a local craft fair, $100 a week on supplies to make the bracelets and earns $400 in revenue each week. What is her weekly accounting profit?",
        "options": [
          "$80",
          "$100",
          "$180",
          "$280",
          "$300"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Accounting profit considers only explicit costs (actual money spent). Revenue = $400. Explicit costs = $20 (stand) + $100 (supplies) = $120. Accounting profit = $400 - $120 = $280. The forgone $200 fast food salary is an implicit cost (opportunity cost) that would be considered in economic profit, not accounting profit."

        "question": "Which of the following determines how many workers a profit maximizing firm hires?",
        "options": [
          "Where marginal revenue product is equal to the marginal resource cost.",
          "Where diminishing returns sets in.",
          "Where the market wage is at its lowest.",
          "Where the supply of workers is highest.",
          "Where the demand for workers is lowest."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In labor economics, a profit-maximizing firm will continue to hire additional workers as long as the revenue generated by that worker (Marginal Revenue Product) is greater than or equal to the cost of hiring them (Marginal Resource Cost). The hiring rule is expressed as: MRP = MRC."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors of production would best be described as human capital?",
        "options": [
          "Money used to start a business.",
          "Skills and training that help workers to complete their role in producing a finished product.",
          "Effort put forth by human workers.",
          "Currency provided to businesses through subsidies and other government programs.",
          "Tools used to produce a finished product."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Human capital refers to the skills, training, and knowledge that workers possess. It's distinct from labor (effort) and physical capital (tools)."

        "question": "Which of the following would make it possible for a country to consume beyond its individual production possibilities curve?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing the unemployment rate.",
          "Producing only products for which they have an absolute advantage.",
          "Importing products from other countries at a relatively lower opportunity cost.",
          "Imposing a tariff on all imports.",
          "Producing more consumer goods rather than capital goods."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Trade allows countries to consume outside their PPC. By specializing according to comparative advantage (lower opportunity cost) and trading, countries can consume combinations of goods that would be unattainable through domestic production alone."

        "question": "Assume that pizza and stromboli are substitutes. Which of the following best describes the effect on the pizza market if the price of stromboli decreases?",
        "options": [
          "Demand for pizza will shift right.",
          "Demand for pizza will shift left.",
          "Supply for pizza will shift right.",
          "Supply for pizza will shift left.",
          "Both demand and supply for pizza will shift left."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Substitute goods: price decrease in one reduces demand for the other. Lower stromboli price makes stromboli relatively cheaper, so consumers switch from pizza to stromboli, decreasing demand for pizza."

          "A surplus of coal miners.",
          "A shortage of coal miners."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage (above equilibrium) creates a labor surplus: quantity supplied of workers > quantity demanded by employers, resulting in unemployment in that sector."

          "21"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Total Variable Cost (TVC) = Total Cost - Fixed Cost. From the table: At output 0, Total Cost = 12 (Fixed Cost). At output 5, Total Cost = 33. Therefore, TVC at output 5 = 33 - 12 = 21."

        "question": "Energy can be generated using either coal or natural gas as an input. If the supply of coal is interrupted, what are the most likely effects on the price and quantity of natural gas traded on the open market? Assume a perfectly competitive market with no government policy intervention.",
        "options": [
          "Price decreases, Quantity increases.",

          "No change."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Coal and natural gas are substitute inputs for energy production. Reduced coal supply increases demand for natural gas, causing both price and quantity of natural gas to increase."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Marginal Utility (MU) = ΔTotal Utility / ΔQuantity. MU of 2nd unit = TU(2) - TU(1) = 70 - 50 = 20 utils."
