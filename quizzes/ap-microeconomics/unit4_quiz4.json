    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm should shut down in the short run if:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue is less than total cost",
          "Price is less than average total cost",
          "Price is less than average variable cost",
          "Marginal revenue is less than marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Short‑run shutdown rule: **P < AVC**. If price cannot cover variable costs, the firm minimizes losses by shutting down (producing zero)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm uses capital (K) and labor (L). MPL = 10, MPK = 20, wage (w) = \\$5, rental rate of capital (r) = \\$10. Is the firm minimizing cost? If not, how should it adjust?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, cost‑minimizing",
          "No, use more K and less L",
          "No, use more L and less K",
          "Cannot determine without output level"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Compare MPL/w = 10/5 = 2 and MPK/r = 20/10 = 2. They are equal → **cost‑minimizing** (Option A). Wait — check: 2 = 2, so yes, cost‑minimizing. Actually answer is A."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm’s long‑run average total cost decreases as output increases, the firm is experiencing:",
        "options": [
          "Diminishing marginal returns",
          "Diseconomies of scale",
          "Economies of scale",
          "Constant returns to scale"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Decreasing LRATC as output rises → **economies of scale** (increasing returns to scale)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would shift a firm’s short‑run average total cost curve upward?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the wage rate",
          "A technological improvement",
          "An increase in rent",
          "An increase in output"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increase in a **fixed cost** (rent) raises AFC and thus ATC, shifting the ATC curve upward. Variable cost decreases or tech improvements shift cost curves down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm spends \\$5,000 on equipment (sunk cost) and \\$2 per unit in variable costs. If the market price is \\$1.50 per unit, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Produce where MR = MC",
          "Shut down immediately",
          "Continue operating to cover part of the sunk cost",
          "Increase production to lower ATC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "P = \\$1.50, AVC = \\$2 → P < AVC. **Shut down** in the short run. Sunk costs are irrelevant to the shutdown decision."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm’s total cost function is TC = 200 + 4Q + 0.2Q², what is the average variable cost when Q = 10?",
        "options": [
          "\\$6",
          "\\$8",
          "\\$10",
          "\\$12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "TVC = 4Q + 0.2Q². At Q=10, TVC = 40 + 20 = 60. AVC = TVC/Q = 60/10 = **\\$6**."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm’s marginal cost curve above the AVC curve represents its:",
        "options": [
          "Short‑run supply curve",
          "Long‑run supply curve",
          "Demand curve",
          "Average revenue curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, the firm’s short‑run supply curve is the portion of the **MC curve above AVC** (where P ≥ AVC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is producing where its isocost line is steeper than its isoquant, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Use more capital and less labor",
          "Use more labor and less capital",
          "Increase spending on both inputs",
          "Reduce output"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Isocost slope = –w/r, isoquant slope = –MPL/MPK (MRTS). If isocost is steeper, w/r > MPL/MPK → MPL/w > MPK/r → **use more labor, less capital** to minimize cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm’s accounting profit is \\$50,000. If implicit costs are \\$15,000, economic profit is:",
        "options": [
          "\\$65,000",
          "\\$50,000",
          "\\$35,000",
          "\\$15,000"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economic profit = Accounting profit – Implicit costs = 50,000 – 15,000 = **\\$35,000**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When marginal cost is rising, but still below average total cost, average total cost is:",
        "options": [
          "Rising",
          "Falling",
          "Constant",
          "At a minimum"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If MC < ATC, each new unit costs less than the average → pulls ATC down, so **ATC is falling** even if MC is rising (as long as MC remains below ATC)."
