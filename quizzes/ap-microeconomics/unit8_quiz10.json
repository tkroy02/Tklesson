      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these scenarios would most likely cause a leftward shift in both supply and demand curves for beach vacations?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Increased public interest in summer activities combined with tax breaks for resort companies.",
          "An economic recession paired with severe beach pollution incidents.",
          "A decrease in airline ticket prices along with improved weather forecasting technologies.",
          "Enhanced sunscreen products entering market alongside reductions in hotel room rates near beaches."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A recession reduces income (demand shifts left), and beach pollution makes vacations less desirable (demand also shifts left). Supply shifts left if pollution discourages resort operations. Other options increase demand or supply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The derived demand for a resource is directly related to the demand for _______.",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "unrelated products",
          "complementary goods",
          "substitute resources",
          "the product it produces"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Derived demand means demand for a factor of production (like labor) comes from demand for the final good it helps produce."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a determinant of labor supply being personal values?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Workers demanding higher wages for hazardous jobs",
          "Government increasing minimum wage",
          "A company offering higher salaries to attract talent",
          "A decrease in the number of job seekers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Personal values affect willingness to work in certain conditions (e.g., risk, location, ethics). Higher wages for hazard pay reflect compensating differentials influenced by personal values."

          "MRC = 0",
          "MRC > MRP",
          "MRC < MRP"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If marginal resource cost exceeds marginal revenue product, hiring an additional worker reduces profit, so the firm stops hiring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm’s derived demand for labor increases in a perfectly competitive market, what is the likely impact on the market?",

        "options": [
          "Both the equilibrium wage and employment level will increase.",
          "The market will experience an increase in wage, but a decrease in employment.",
          "Both the equilibrium wage and employment level will decrease.",
          "The equilibrium wage will decrease while employment increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased labor demand shifts the demand curve right, raising both equilibrium wage and employment (along an upward‑sloping supply curve)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, what does the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP) represent?",

        "options": [
          "Change in total revenue from one more worker",
          "Average revenue per unit of labor",
          "Total cost of hiring one more worker",
          "Total revenue divided by total labor"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MRP is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker, calculated as MPL × P (or MPL × MR if output market is imperfect)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How would an advancement in technology that automates tasks previously performed by human labor likely impact the demand for unskilled labor?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Supply would decrease since unskilled workers might seek different jobs or training.",
          "Demand would increase as companies expand with new technology investments.",
          "Supply would increase because of higher productivity associated with technology use.",
          "Demand would decrease, shifting the demand curve for unskilled labor leftward."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Automation substitutes for unskilled labor, reducing demand for such workers (leftward shift in labor demand)."
      },

          "An increase in the productivity of labor.",
          "A shift in personal values affecting labor supply.",
          "A decrease in government intervention in labor markets.",
          "A decrease in the number of qualified workers available."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher labor productivity raises MRP, shifting labor demand right. Other options affect labor supply or regulations, not demand."

        "options": [
          "The MRP will decrease, but the derived demand for labor will increase.",
          "Both the MRP and the derived demand for labor will decrease.",
          "The MRP will increase while the derived demand remains unchanged.",
          "Both the MRP and the derived demand for labor will increase."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity raises MPL, increasing MRP at each employment level. This shifts the labor demand (derived demand) curve right."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm notices that when they increase their workforce from 50 to 51 workers, their total output increases from 500 to 510 units. If the selling price of their product is $10 per unit, what is the MRP of the 51st worker?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MPL of 51st worker = 510 − 500 = 10 units. MRP = MPL × P = 10 × $10 = $100."
