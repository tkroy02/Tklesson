      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these scenarios would most likely cause a leftward shift in both supply and demand curves for beach vacations?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Increased public interest in summer activities combined with tax breaks for resort companies.",
          "An economic recession paired with severe beach pollution incidents.",
          "A decrease in airline ticket prices along with improved weather forecasting technologies.",
          "Enhanced sunscreen products entering market alongside reductions in hotel room rates near beaches."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A recession reduces income (demand shifts left), and beach pollution makes vacations less desirable (demand also shifts left). Supply shifts left if pollution discourages resort operations. Other options increase demand or supply."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The derived demand for a resource is directly related to the demand for _______.",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "unrelated products",
          "complementary goods",
          "substitute resources",
          "the product it produces"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Derived demand means demand for a factor of production (like labor) comes from demand for the final good it helps produce."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a determinant of labor supply being personal values?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Workers demanding higher wages for hazardous jobs",
          "Government increasing minimum wage",
          "A company offering higher salaries to attract talent",
          "A decrease in the number of job seekers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Personal values affect willingness to work in certain conditions (e.g., risk, location, ethics). Higher wages for hazard pay reflect compensating differentials influenced by personal values."

          "MRC < MRP"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If marginal resource cost exceeds marginal revenue product, hiring an additional worker reduces profit, so the firm stops hiring."
      },

          "Both the equilibrium wage and employment level will decrease.",
          "The equilibrium wage will decrease while employment increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased labor demand shifts the demand curve right, raising both equilibrium wage and employment (along an upward‑sloping supply curve)."

        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Supply would decrease since unskilled workers might seek different jobs or training.",
          "Demand would increase as companies expand with new technology investments.",
          "Supply would increase because of higher productivity associated with technology use.",
          "Demand would decrease, shifting the demand curve for unskilled labor leftward."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Automation substitutes for unskilled labor, reducing demand for such workers (leftward shift in labor demand)."

          "The MRP will decrease, but the derived demand for labor will increase.",
          "Both the MRP and the derived demand for labor will decrease.",
          "The MRP will increase while the derived demand remains unchanged.",
          "Both the MRP and the derived demand for labor will increase."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity raises MPL, increasing MRP at each employment level. This shifts the labor demand (derived demand) curve right."

          "$120"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MPL of 51st worker = 510 − 500 = 10 units. MRP = MPL × P = 10 × $10 = $100."

          "An increase in telecommuting reducing commuter reliance on personal vehicles.",
          "A significant technological improvement increasing gasoline engine efficiency.",
          "A reduction in public transportation fares making it a less attractive option compared with driving.",
          "Discovery of new oil reserves potentially lowering future gasoline prices."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased telecommuting reduces the need for commuting, decreasing demand for gasoline (leftward shift). Engine efficiency (B) could decrease demand per mile but might increase driving; lower public transit fares (C) would substitute away from driving; new reserves (D) affect supply, not demand directly."

          "The MFC is $8800, which is the new total wage bill.",
          "The MFC is $8000, which represents the original wage bill before hiring."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Marginal Factor Cost (MFC) is the change in total wage cost from hiring one more worker: $8800 – $8000 = $800."

          "Taxing individuals who benefit from the positive externality"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a positive externality, the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal private benefit. A subsidy to consumers (students) can increase consumption toward the socially optimal level, closing the gap and improving welfare."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best explains why a monopsonist hires fewer workers than would be hired in a competitive labor market?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The monopsonist faces an upward-sloping labor supply curve",
          "The monopsonist faces higher fixed costs",
          "The monopsonist’s MRP curve is lower than in competition",
          "Workers are less productive for a monopsonist"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the monopsonist faces an upward‑sloping labor supply curve, its MFC exceeds the wage. To maximize profit, it hires where MFC = MRP, which results in a lower employment level than under perfect competition (where wage = MRP)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How might an economy-wide increase in educational attainment impact capital’s share of income over time considering all other factors held equal?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Capital’s share might decrease as a more educated workforce demands higher wages due to enhanced productivity.",
          "There will be no change in capital’s share since improvements in education do not directly influence distribution between capital and labor income shares.",
          "Capital’s share may initially decrease but eventually stabilize as new technologies complementing human capital become prevalent.",
          "Capital’s share will likely increase because greater educational attainment reduces the relative scarcity and bargaining power of skilled workers."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher educational attainment raises labor productivity and bargaining power, increasing labor's share of income. Assuming output is divided between capital and labor, an increase in labor's share implies a decrease in capital's share, all else equal."
