        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A study shows the cross‑price elasticity between public transportation and gasoline is 0.3. During an economic recession, which scenario is most likely?",
        "options": [
          "Falling gas prices will moderately decrease transit use",
          "Falling gas prices will significantly increase transit use",
          "Transit use will increase proportionally to gas price drops",
          "Transit use will be unaffected by changes in gas prices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity = 0.3 (positive) → substitutes. If gas prices fall, demand for public transit falls. Elasticity 0.3 means a 10% gas price drop leads to a 3% transit use drop → **moderate decrease**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario illustrates perfectly elastic supply?",
        "options": [
          "A supplier is willing to sell any quantity at a specific fixed market price but none below that price point.",
          "A supplier’s quantity supplied responds proportionately to changes in market prices over time.",
          "A supplier decreases quantity supplied whenever there is an increase in market prices due to negative externalities impacting cost structures.",
          "A supplier is unable to produce more units regardless of how high market prices may rise due to resource limitations."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfectly elastic supply → horizontal supply curve at a given price. Seller will supply **any quantity at that price**, but zero below it."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which elasticity measure is most relevant for a government seeking to predict changes in tax revenue resulting from a new income tax, considering how individuals might adjust their willingness to work in response to changes in after‑tax wages?",
        "options": [
          "Price elasticity of supply",
          "Income elasticity of demand",
          "Cross‑price elasticity of demand",
          "Income elasticity of labor supply"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An income tax affects after‑tax wages → changes labor supply. The **income elasticity of labor supply** measures how labor hours respond to changes in wage (income)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A positive cross‑price elasticity between two goods implies that the goods are:",
        "options": [
          "Inferior goods.",
          "Unrelated to each other.",
          "Complements.",
          "Substitutes."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Positive cross‑price elasticity → **substitutes** (price of one ↑ → demand for the other ↑)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does it mean if a good has a perfectly elastic demand?",
        "options": [
          "Quantity demanded changes but by a smaller percentage than the percentage change in price.",
          "Quantity demanded does not change regardless of price changes.",
          "Quantity demanded changes proportionally to price changes.",
          "Quantity demanded changes by an infinitely large amount in response to any price change."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Perfectly elastic demand → horizontal demand curve. At a given price, consumers will buy any quantity; if price rises even slightly, quantity demanded drops to zero → **infinite responsiveness**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does high capital mobility within an industry influence its short‑term versus long‑term overall elasticity of supply?",
        "options": [
          "High capital mobility causes both short‑ and long‑term supplies to be perfectly elastic, reflecting instantaneous market adjustments without any frictions or delays whatsoever.",
          "High capital mobility typically leads to more elastic short‑term and even more elastic long‑term supply since firms can quickly adjust production levels and enter or exit markets with ease over both periods respectively.",
          "High capital mobility results in perfectly inelastic short‑term but highly elastic long‑term supplies due to immediate fixed capacity constraints followed by eventual flexibility among firms.",
          "Capital mobility has no significant effect on either short‑ or long‑term supplies as other factors like labor skills dominate adjustments in quantity provided by suppliers."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "High capital mobility allows resources to move quickly between uses, making supply **more elastic in the short run** and **even more elastic in the long run** as firms can enter/exit more easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market where supply is relatively inelastic, how does an increase in demand affect equilibrium price and quantity?",
        "options": [
          "Equilibrium price decreases and equilibrium quantity increases due to the inelasticity of supply.",
          "Both equilibrium price and quantity will increase dramatically.",
          "The equilibrium price will increase significantly while the equilibrium quantity will increase only modestly.",
          "The equilibrium quantity will increase significantly while the equilibrium price remains largely unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inelastic supply → quantity responds little to price. Increase in demand → **large price increase, small quantity increase**."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose the income elasticity of demand for laptops is 2.5. Which of the following statements is most likely true?",
        "options": [
          "Laptops are inferior goods.",
          "Laptops are sticky goods.",
          "Laptops are luxury goods.",
          "Laptops are normal goods."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity > 1 → **luxury good**. Positive → normal good, but >1 specifically means luxury."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario illustrates an inelastic supply response to price changes in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "A local bakery cannot quickly increase bread production due to limited ovens and bakers.",
          "A car manufacturer rapidly boosts output by adding extra shifts at its factories.",
          "An online retailer easily adjusts inventory levels using flexible warehousing solutions.",
          "Farmers immediately increase milk supply when prices go up by using stored feed for cows."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inelastic supply → quantity supplied changes little when price changes. Fixed inputs (ovens, bakers) prevent quick output increases → **inelastic short‑run supply**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a consumer’s demand for a good is unit elastic, doubling the price will result in:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue doubling",
          "Total revenue halving",
          "Total revenue unchanged",
          "Quantity demanded falling to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Unit elastic demand (|Ed| = 1) → %∆Qd = %∆P in opposite direction. Doubling price (100% increase) reduces quantity demanded by 100%? Wait, that would imply zero quantity. Actually, unit elastic means **total revenue unchanged** when price changes, because %∆Qd = –%∆P exactly in magnitude."
