      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a standard supply and demand diagram, which area represents the total economic surplus (consumer + producer surplus) at the market equilibrium?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The rectangle formed by the equilibrium price and quantity.",
          "The triangle below the demand curve and above the supply curve, up to the equilibrium quantity.",
          "The area below the demand curve and above the horizontal axis.",
          "The area above the supply curve and below the demand curve."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total surplus is the sum of all gains from trade. Consumer surplus is the area below demand and above price. Producer surplus is the area above supply and below price. Combined, this is the area between the supply and demand curves, from the vertical axis out to the equilibrium quantity."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sales tax is imposed on a good. If the goal of the government is to minimize the deadweight loss while raising a required amount of revenue, it should tax goods with:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Highly elastic demand and supply.",
          "Highly inelastic demand and supply.",
          "Elastic demand and inelastic supply.",
          "A high initial equilibrium price."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is smaller when the quantity traded does not change much in response to the tax. This occurs when both supply and demand are inelastic (unresponsive to price changes). Taxing inelastic goods minimizes the distortion to the market quantity for a given revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'deadweight loss' is most accurately described as:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A transfer of surplus from one group to another.",
          "The administrative cost of implementing a government policy.",
          "A reduction in total surplus that benefits no one.",
          "The loss of profits by firms due to taxation."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the net loss of total (consumer + producer) surplus that is not transferred to anyone else (like the government as tax revenue). It represents pure economic inefficiency—beneficial trades that do not happen because of the market distortion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a binding price ceiling is imposed on gasoline, which of the following is a likely secondary consequence?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Gas stations will increase hours of operation to sell more gasoline.",
          "The quality of gasoline sold will improve as stations compete for customers.",
          "Non-price rationing mechanisms, such as long lines, will develop.",
          "Investment in new gasoline refining capacity will increase."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling creates a shortage. When price cannot rise to ration the scarce good, other mechanisms emerge. These include long lines (waiting time as a cost), favoritism, or black markets. Quality typically deteriorates as sellers have no incentive to attract buyers with better service."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a per-unit tax is placed on a good, the new equilibrium quantity is determined by the intersection of:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The original demand and the original supply curve.",
          "The new demand (shifted by the tax) and the original supply curve.",
          "The original demand and the new supply (shifted by the tax).",
          "The new demand and the new supply, both shifted by the tax."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A tax on sellers is modeled as an upward shift of the supply curve by the amount of the tax. The demand curve remains unchanged. The new equilibrium (price buyers pay, quantity traded) is found where the original demand curve intersects this new, higher supply curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a cost-benefit analysis for a new public park, a key challenge is:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Determining who will use the park most frequently.",
          "Assigning a monetary value to intangible benefits like community beauty and recreation.",
          "Calculating the construction costs, which are always fixed.",
          "Ensuring the analysis is completed before the next election."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The major difficulty in cost-benefit analysis is quantifying non-market benefits. For a park, benefits include aesthetic value, health from recreation, and community cohesion. Economists use methods like contingent valuation (surveying willingness to pay) or hedonic pricing (comparing property values) to estimate these values in dollars."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the demand for a product becomes more elastic over time, the deadweight loss from an existing per-unit tax will:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Decrease.",
          "Increase.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Become zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss increases as elasticity increases. If demand becomes more elastic, consumers are more responsive to the tax-induced price increase. They will reduce the quantity demanded by a larger amount, causing a greater reduction in the quantity of mutually beneficial trades, thus increasing the deadweight loss triangle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A government imposes both a binding price floor and a subsidy to producers for the same agricultural good. The most likely goal is to:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Increase consumer surplus by lowering the consumer price.",
          "Increase the price received by producers without creating a surplus.",
          "Decrease government spending on farm programs.",
          "Encourage farmers to switch to different crops."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A price floor alone would create a surplus that the government might have to buy. A subsidy to producers shifts the supply curve right, increasing quantity supplied at every price. If calibrated correctly, the subsidy can shift supply enough so that the new equilibrium quantity at the floor price equals the quantity demanded, eliminating the surplus while ensuring producers receive the high floor price (market price + subsidy)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'incidence' of a tax refers to:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The group that is legally required to send payment to the government.",
          "The distribution of the tax burden between buyers and sellers in the form of lower net prices or higher costs.",
          "The frequency with which the tax is applied to transactions.",
          "The government agency responsible for collecting the tax."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tax incidence is about who bears the economic burden, not who writes the check. It measures how the tax causes the price paid by buyers to rise and the price received by sellers to fall. The burden is shared based on relative elasticities."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Graphically, if a tax is imposed and the demand curve is relatively steep (inelastic) and the supply curve is relatively flat (elastic), the tax burden will fall:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Mostly on producers.",
          "Mostly on consumers.",
          "Equally on consumers and producers.",
          "Entirely on the government."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A steep demand curve indicates inelastic demand. A flat supply curve indicates elastic supply. The side of the market that is more inelastic (less able to adjust quantity) bears the larger share of the tax burden. In this scenario, consumers are more inelastic, so they bear most of the burden."
