    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a monopolistically competitive firm can earn economic profits because:",
        "options": [
          "Barriers to entry are high.",
          "Price can exceed average total cost at the profit-maximizing output.",
          "It produces where price equals marginal cost.",
          "It operates at minimum average total cost."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the short run, with fixed number of firms, P > ATC is possible where MR = MC, leading to positive economic profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run equilibrium, a monopolistically competitive firm produces at an output level where:",
        "options": [
          "P = MC and P = minimum ATC",
          "P > MC and P = ATC",
          "P = MR and P = ATC",
          "P = MC and P > ATC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Free entry drives profit to zero (P = ATC), but due to downward-sloping demand, P > MC. The firm does not produce at minimum ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'excess capacity' in monopolistic competition refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The difference between the output where ATC is minimized and the firm's actual output.",
          "The firm's ability to produce more at lower cost.",
          "Unused capital due to lack of demand.",
          "The gap between price and marginal cost."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Excess capacity means the firm could produce more at lower per-unit cost (minimum ATC), but instead produces less to maintain price above marginal cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, successful advertising will:",
        "options": [
          "Make demand more elastic.",
          "Increase average total cost.",
          "Reduce brand loyalty.",
          "Lower barriers to entry."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Advertising shifts demand rightward (or makes it steeper), but also increases costs, shifting ATC upward. Whether profit rises depends on whether revenue increases more than cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a perfectly competitive firm, a monopolistically competitive firm in long-run equilibrium produces:",
        "options": [
          "More output at a higher price.",
          "Less output at a higher price.",
          "The same output at the same price.",
          "Less output at a lower price."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolistic competition results in higher price and lower output than perfect competition due to market power and product differentiation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for both perfect and monopolistic competition in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "P = MC",
          "P = minimum ATC",
          "Economic profit is zero",
          "Firms produce homogeneous products"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both have free entry/exit driving economic profit to zero. However, only perfect competition has P = MC and P = min ATC; monopolistic competition has differentiated products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolistically competitive firm's demand curve becomes more elastic, its price markup over marginal cost will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Become negative"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More elastic demand means consumers are more sensitive to price. The firm has less market power, so the profit-maximizing price will be closer to MC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which situation will new firms enter a monopolistically competitive market?",
        "options": [
          "When existing firms are incurring losses",
          "When existing firms are earning positive economic profit",
          "When price equals average variable cost",
          "When marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Positive economic profit attracts entry, which shifts each firm's demand curve left until profit returns to zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolistically competitive firm is productively inefficient because in the long run it:",
        "options": [
          "Produces where P = MC",
          "Does not produce at minimum ATC",
          "Earns positive economic profit",
          "Produces a homogeneous product"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Productive efficiency requires producing at minimum ATC. Monopolistically competitive firms produce on the downward-sloping portion of ATC, leaving excess capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a form of non-price competition in monopolistic competition?",
        "options": [
          "Advertising",
          "Product differentiation",
          "Customer service enhancements",
          "Secret price cuts"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Non-price competition includes advertising, quality, features, location, service—anything except changing price. Secret price cuts are price competition, often hidden to avoid retaliation."
