    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the point where marginal cost (MC) intersects average variable cost (AVC), which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "AVC is at its minimum",
          "AVC is decreasing",
          "AVC is increasing",
          "MC is at its minimum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MC intersects AVC at the **minimum point of AVC**. When MC = AVC, AVC is neither rising nor falling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm produces 100 units with total cost of \\$800. Fixed costs are \\$200. If marginal cost is constant over this range, what is the marginal cost per unit?",
        "options": [
          "\\$6",
          "\\$8",
          "\\$10",
          "\\$12"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "TVC = TC – TFC = 800 – 200 = 600. If MC is constant, TVC = MC × Q → MC = TVC / Q = 600 / 100 = **\\$6**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which curve is always U‑shaped in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Average fixed cost (AFC)",
          "Average variable cost (AVC)",
          "Marginal cost (MC)",
          "Total cost (TC)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**AVC** is U‑shaped due to diminishing marginal returns. AFC always falls, MC is usually U‑shaped but not always required; TC is upward‑sloping."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is experiencing diseconomies of scale, its long‑run average total cost curve is:",
        "options": [
          "Downward‑sloping",
          "Upward‑sloping",
          "Horizontal",
          "Vertical"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Diseconomies of scale** → LRATC rises as output increases → **upward‑sloping** segment of the LRATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An isoquant shows:",
        "options": [
          "All combinations of inputs that yield the same total cost",
          "All combinations of outputs that yield the same profit",
          "All combinations of inputs that yield the same output",
          "The maximum output attainable at each cost level"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An **isoquant** shows all combinations of inputs (e.g., labor and capital) that produce the **same level of output**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the marginal product of labor is falling, marginal cost is:",

          "Falling",
          "Rising",
          "Constant",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Falling MP means each additional worker produces less extra output → cost of producing an extra unit (MC) **rises**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm’s total cost is TC = 100 + 10Q + 0.5Q². What is the marginal cost when Q = 20?",
        "options": [
          "\\$10",
          "\\$20",
          "\\$30",
          "\\$40"
        ],
        "explanation": "MC = d(TC)/dQ = 10 + Q. At Q=20, MC = 10 + 20 = **\\$30**.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cost minimization in the long run occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "The isoquant is tangent to the isocost line",
          "The marginal product per dollar is equal for all inputs",
          "Both A and B",
          "Marginal cost equals average total cost"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Long‑run cost minimization occurs where the **isoquant is tangent to the isocost line**, which also implies **MPL / w = MPK / r** (equal marginal product per dollar)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If average total cost is \\$25 at 10 units and \\$20 at 20 units, what is the approximate marginal cost of the 11th through 20th units?",
        "options": [
          "\\$10",
          "\\$15",
          "\\$20",
          "\\$25"
        ],
        "explanation": "TC at 10 units = 25 × 10 = 250. TC at 20 units = 20 × 20 = 400. ΔTC = 150, ΔQ = 10 → MC ≈ **\\$15** per unit.",
        "answer": "B"
