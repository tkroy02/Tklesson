        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit = (Price − ATC) × Quantity. Price is at point K (A), ATC at point J (B), quantity at X₁, forming rectangle ABJK."

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Total Cost = ATC × Q. At output X₁, ATC = B (point J on AC curve). Rectangle 0BJX₁ (listed as BOX₁J) represents total cost."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Socially optimal price occurs where Demand (D) intersects MC. Moving horizontally to the price axis from that intersection gives P₃."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The unregulated monopolist sets MR = MC at point C, then up to demand to set price, which is P₁."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fair-return price occurs where Demand intersects AC (point E), allowing the firm to break even with zero economic profit."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Under perfect competition, market equilibrium is where D = MC (point E), price = C. Consumer surplus = area below demand and above price C, triangle ACE."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After monopoly, price rises to B. Consumer surplus shrinks to the triangle ABG (below demand, above new price B)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When selling e-books, music on iTunes, and downloadable software, the marginal cost of producing and selling one more unit of output is essentially zero: MC = 0. If the monopolist is doing its best to maximize profits, what will marginal revenue equal at a firm like this?",
        "options": [
          "Greater than 0",
          "Less than 0",
          "0",
          "Indeterminate from the given information"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Profit maximization requires MR = MC. If MC = 0, then MR must equal 0."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Rapido, the shoe company, is so popular that it has monopoly power. It’s selling 20 million shoes per year. The marginal cost of making extra shoes is quite low, and it doesn’t change much if they produce more shoes. Rapido’s marketing experts tell the CEO that if it decreased prices by 20%, it would sell so many more shoes that profits would rise. If the expert is correct, which of the following is correct?",
        "options": [
          "MC = MR",
          "MC > MR",

          "MC = AC"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If lowering price raises profit, increasing output must add more to revenue than to cost → MR > MC (MC < MR)."
