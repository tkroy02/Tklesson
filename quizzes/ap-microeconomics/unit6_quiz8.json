          "BEFJ"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit = (Price − ATC) × Quantity. Price is at point K (A), ATC at point J (B), quantity at X₁, forming rectangle ABJK."

        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Total Cost = ATC × Q. At output X₁, ATC = B (point J on AC curve). Rectangle 0BJX₁ (listed as BOX₁J) represents total cost."

        "answer": "A",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The unregulated monopolist sets MR = MC at point C, then up to demand to set price, which is P₁."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fair-return price occurs where Demand intersects AC (point E), allowing the firm to break even with zero economic profit."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Under perfect competition, market equilibrium is where D = MC (point E), price = C. Consumer surplus = area below demand and above price C, triangle ACE."

        "answer": "A",
