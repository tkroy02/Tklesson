    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase (rightward shift) in the demand for a good will tend to cause",
        "options": [
          "an increase in the equilibrium price and quantity.",
          "none of these answers.",
          "an increase in the equilibrium price and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity.",
          "a decrease in the equilibrium price and an increase in the equilibrium quantity.",
          "a decrease in the equilibrium price and quantity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased demand shifts the demand curve rightward, leading to higher equilibrium price and quantity."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a good is equal to the equilibrium price,",
        "options": [
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will fall.",
          "the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied and the price remains unchanged.",
          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will rise.",
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will rise.",
          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will fall."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, Qd = Qs, no shortage or surplus, so price is stable."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a good is below the equilibrium price,",
        "options": [
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will rise.",
          "the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied and the price remains unchanged.",
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will fall.",

          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will fall."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Below equilibrium, Qd > Qs (shortage). Competition among buyers drives price upward toward equilibrium."
