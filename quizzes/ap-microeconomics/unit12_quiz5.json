      {

        "question": "An increase (rightward shift) in the demand for a good will tend to cause",
        "options": [
          "an increase in the equilibrium price and quantity.",
          "none of these answers.",
          "an increase in the equilibrium price and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity.",
          "a decrease in the equilibrium price and an increase in the equilibrium quantity.",
          "a decrease in the equilibrium price and quantity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased demand shifts the demand curve rightward, leading to higher equilibrium price and quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a good is equal to the equilibrium price,",
        "options": [
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will fall.",
          "the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied and the price remains unchanged.",
          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will rise.",
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will rise.",
          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will fall."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, Qd = Qs, no shortage or surplus, so price is stable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of a good is below the equilibrium price,",
        "options": [
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will rise.",
          "the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied and the price remains unchanged.",
          "there is a shortage (i.e. an excess demand) and the price will fall.",
          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will rise.",
          "there is a surplus (i.e. an excess supply) and the price will fall."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Below equilibrium, Qd > Qs (shortage). Competition among buyers drives price upward toward equilibrium."

        "question": "Johnny is currently spending his entire weekly snack budget on 5 bags of candy and 4 juice boxes. At his current level of consumption, Johnny's marginal utility for candy is 5 utils and his marginal utility for juice boxes is 10 utils. In order to maximize his total utility, Johnny should",
        "options": [
          "maintain his current level of consumption of candy and juice boxes regardless of the prices",
          "consume more candy and fewer juice boxes regardless of the prices",
          "consume more juice boxes and fewer candy regardless of the prices",
          "maintain his current level of consumption if the price of candy is $2 and the price of a juice box is $1",
          "maintain his current level of consumption if the price of candy is $1 and the price of a juice box is $2"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Utility maximization requires MUc / Pc = MUj / Pj. With MUc = 5 and MUj = 10, this holds if Pc = $1 and Pj = $2: 5/1 = 10/2 = 5."
      },

          "a long-run supply curve that is horizontal.",
          "a long-run marginal cost curve that decreases as output increases.",

          "a long-run average total cost that decreases as output increases."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Diseconomies of scale: LRATC increases as output expands due to coordination/management problems."

        "question": "Which of the following best describes a perfectly competitive market?",
        "options": [
          "a market structure with a large number of interdependent large firms selling identical products",
          "a market structure with dozens of small firms offering a differentiated product with easy entry into the market",
          "a market that is productively efficient, but not allocatively efficient",
          "a market that has high barriers to entry",
          "a market structure where individual firms have no control over the price that they charge"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, firms are price takers — they have no control over market price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the marginal revenue curve as a single-price monopolist increases its output in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "decreasing at first, then increasing",
          "increasing at first, then decreasing",
          "horizontal and equal to the market price",
          "decreasing and equal to the monopolist's demand curve",
          "decreasing and below the monopolist's demand curve"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "For a downward-sloping demand curve, MR is also downward sloping and lies below demand because to sell more, the monopolist must lower price on all units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is not true of a monopolistically competitive firm in long-run equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "Price equals average total cost and marginal cost",
          "Price equals average total cost but is greater than marginal cost.",
          "Marginal cost equals marginal revenue",
          "The firm uses product differentiation.",
          "The firm earns a normal profit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In monopolistic competition, P = ATC (zero economic profit), but P > MC (since demand slopes down and MR < P). So (A) is false because P does not equal MC."
