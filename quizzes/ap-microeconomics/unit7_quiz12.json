    "subject": "AP Microeconomics",
    "topic": "Natural Monopoly Subsidy, Price Discrimination Types, MR Under Discrimination, Non-Price Competition, Long-Run Monopolistic Competition, Mutual Interdependence, Oligopoly Barriers",
    "duration": 70,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government were to set a price ceiling to get the socially optimal quantity in a natural monopoly, what would they have to do?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "give the firm a subsidy",
          "remove all regulations",
          "impose a tax on the firm",
          "increase the firm's production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A natural monopoly has decreasing ATC. Setting P = MC (socially optimal) yields P < ATC, causing losses. The government must subsidize the firm to keep it in operation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of price discrimination charges each consumer the maximum they are willing to pay?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "first-degree (perfect) price discrimination",
          "second-degree (quantity discounts)",
          "third-degree (segment-based) price discrimination",
          "no price discrimination occurs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First-degree (perfect) price discrimination involves charging each consumer exactly their reservation price, capturing all consumer surplus as producer surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does marginal revenue equal when price discriminating?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "demand",
          "marginal cost",
          "average total cost",
          "zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Under perfect (first-degree) price discrimination, the monopolist charges each consumer their willingness to pay, so the demand curve becomes the marginal revenue curve — MR = Demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an example of non‑price competition?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "advertising",
          "offering quantity discounts",
          "price matching",
          "cost‑plus pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non‑price competition includes advertising, branding, product features, customer service, and location advantages — strategies that compete on factors other than price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the economic profit of monopolistic competition in the long run?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "zero",
          "positive",
          "negative",
          "maximized"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to free entry and exit, monopolistically competitive firms earn zero economic profit in the long run (P = ATC), though they produce where P > MC and have excess capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "This is when firms can't legally work together, but are heavily influenced by other firms.",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "mutual interdependence",
          "explicit collusion",
          "perfect competition",
          "price leadership"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mutual interdependence occurs in oligopoly, where each firm's decisions affect others and are influenced by them, even without formal (illegal) collusion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All the following are typical barriers to entry in an Oligopoly, EXCEPT:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "economies of scale",
          "high start-up costs",
          "ownership of raw materials",
          "high number of human capital"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Typical oligopoly barriers include economies of scale, high capital requirements, and control of resources. A high number of human capital (skilled labor) is not a barrier—it may actually lower entry costs."
