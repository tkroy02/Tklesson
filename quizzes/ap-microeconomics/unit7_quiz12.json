    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government were to set a price ceiling to get the socially optimal quantity in a natural monopoly, what would they have to do?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "give the firm a subsidy",
          "remove all regulations",
          "impose a tax on the firm",
          "increase the firm's production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A natural monopoly has decreasing ATC. Setting P = MC (socially optimal) yields P < ATC, causing losses. The government must subsidize the firm to keep it in operation."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of price discrimination charges each consumer the maximum they are willing to pay?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "first-degree (perfect) price discrimination",
          "second-degree (quantity discounts)",
          "third-degree (segment-based) price discrimination",
          "no price discrimination occurs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First-degree (perfect) price discrimination involves charging each consumer exactly their reservation price, capturing all consumer surplus as producer surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does marginal revenue equal when price discriminating?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "demand",
          "marginal cost",
          "average total cost",
          "zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Under perfect (first-degree) price discrimination, the monopolist charges each consumer their willingness to pay, so the demand curve becomes the marginal revenue curve — MR = Demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an example of non‑price competition?",

          "advertising",
          "offering quantity discounts",
          "price matching",
          "cost‑plus pricing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non‑price competition includes advertising, branding, product features, customer service, and location advantages — strategies that compete on factors other than price."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the economic profit of monopolistic competition in the long run?",

          "positive",
          "negative",
          "maximized"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to free entry and exit, monopolistically competitive firms earn zero economic profit in the long run (P = ATC), though they produce where P > MC and have excess capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "This is when firms can't legally work together, but are heavily influenced by other firms.",

          "explicit collusion",
          "perfect competition",
          "price leadership"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mutual interdependence occurs in oligopoly, where each firm's decisions affect others and are influenced by them, even without formal (illegal) collusion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All the following are typical barriers to entry in an Oligopoly, EXCEPT:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "economies of scale",
          "high start-up costs",
          "ownership of raw materials",
          "high number of human capital"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Typical oligopoly barriers include economies of scale, high capital requirements, and control of resources. A high number of human capital (skilled labor) is not a barrier—it may actually lower entry costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "True statements about the theory of the firm in the short run and long run include which of the following?\nI. All input costs are fixed in the short run.\nII. All input costs are variable in the long run.\nIII. At least one input price is fixed in the short run.",
        "image": null,

          "I and II only",
          "II and III only"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "In the short run, at least one input (e.g., capital) is fixed, but not all costs are fixed—some are variable. In the long run, all inputs can be varied, so all costs are variable. Thus, II and III are true."

          "diminishing marginal returns.",
          "increasing marginal returns."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the short run, with at least one fixed input, adding more of a variable input eventually leads to diminishing marginal returns, causing marginal cost to rise."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency requires P = MC. Price-setting power (market power) allows P > MC, violating allocative efficiency and creating deadweight loss."
