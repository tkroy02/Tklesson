    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer’s utility function is U = X^0.5 Y^0.5. If Px = 4, Py = 1, and income = 40, what is the utility‑maximizing bundle?",
        "options": [
          "X = 5, Y = 20",
          "X = 8, Y = 8",
          "X = 10, Y = 10",
          "X = 6, Y = 16"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cobb‑Douglas U = X^a Y^b → demand functions: X = a/(a+b) × (M/Px), Y = b/(a+b) × (M/Py). Here a=b=0.5, so X = 0.5 × (40/4) = 5, Y = 0.5 × (40/1) = 20."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price elasticity of demand for insulin is –0.2 and the price increases by 25%, what is the approximate percentage change in total consumer expenditure on insulin?",
        "options": [
          "+20%",
          "+5%",
          "–5%",
          "0%"
        ],
        "explanation": "Inelastic demand: |Ed| < 1. %∆Expenditure ≈ %∆P + %∆Qd. %∆Qd = Ed × %∆P = –0.2 × 25% = –5%. %∆Expenditure ≈ 25% – 5% = **+20%**.",
        "answer": "A"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An indifference curve is convex to the origin because of:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing marginal rate of substitution",
          "Diminishing marginal rate of substitution",
          "Constant marginal utility",
          "Perfect substitutability"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Convex indifference curves reflect **diminishing MRS**: as you consume more X, you’re willing to give up less Y to get another X."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The cross‑price elasticity between butter and margarine is +1.8. If the price of butter rises by 10%, what happens to the quantity demanded of margarine?",
        "options": [
          "Increases by 18%",
          "Decreases by 18%",
          "Increases by 1.8%",
          "Decreases by 1.8%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Positive cross‑price elasticity → substitutes. %∆Qd margarine = 1.8 × 10% = **18% increase**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Giffen good must be:",
        "options": [
          "A luxury good",
          "An inferior good with a strong income effect that outweighs the substitution effect",
          "A good with perfectly inelastic demand",
          "A normal good with elastic demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A Giffen good is an **inferior good** where the **income effect** (which increases quantity demanded when price rises) outweighs the substitution effect (which decreases it)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market, Ed = –0.6, Es = 1.2. A tax of \\$3 per unit is imposed. What percentage of the tax is borne by consumers?",
        "options": [
          "33.3%",
          "66.7%",
          "50%",
          "80%"
        ],
        "explanation": "Tax burden share on consumers = Es / (Es + |Ed|) = 1.2 / (1.2 + 0.6) = 1.2 / 1.8 = **2/3 ≈ 66.7%**.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If MUx = 12, MUy = 6, Px = 4, Py = 2, and the consumer spends all income, are they maximizing utility? If not, how should they adjust?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, maximizing utility",
          "No, should buy more X and less Y",
          "No, should buy more Y and less X",
          "Cannot determine without income"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MUx/Px = 12/4 = 3; MUy/Py = 6/2 = 3. MUx/Px = MUy/Py → **maximizing utility**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the price of a normal good falls, the income and substitution effects:",
        "options": [
          "Both increase quantity demanded",
          "Work in opposite directions",
          "Both decrease quantity demanded",
          "Cancel each other out"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a **normal good**, price fall → substitution effect (more X, less Y) and income effect (real income rises, more X) **both increase quantity demanded of X**."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the income elasticity of demand for restaurant meals is +1.8 and incomes rise by 10%, what happens to the share of consumer budgets spent on restaurant meals?",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity > 1 → luxury good. Demand grows faster than income → **budget share increases**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price ceiling is set below equilibrium in a market with perfectly inelastic demand and elastic supply. The result is:",
        "options": [
          "No shortage because quantity demanded does not change",
          "A shortage because quantity supplied falls",
          "A surplus because quantity demanded increases",
          "No effect on market quantity"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic demand → vertical demand curve. Binding price ceiling reduces price → quantity supplied decreases (since supply is elastic) → **shortage** emerges because Qd (fixed) > Qs."
