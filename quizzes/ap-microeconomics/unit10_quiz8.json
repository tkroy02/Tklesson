    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of antitrust action?",
        "options": [
          "Providing tax incentives",
          "Breaking up a large corporation",
          "Imposing tariffs on imports",
          "Setting price floors"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Antitrust actions are government interventions to prevent or reduce monopolistic power, including breaking up monopolies, blocking mergers, or preventing anti-competitive practices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive market, the equilibrium price is \\$10 and the equilibrium quantity is 100 units. If the government imposes a price floor of \\$15, and at this price consumers demand 70 units while producers supply 120 units, what is the deadweight loss?",
        "options": [
          "\\$125",
          "\\$500",
          "\\$250",
          "\\$75"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss = 0.5 × (price floor - equilibrium price) × (equilibrium quantity - quantity demanded at price floor) = 0.5 × (\\$15 - \\$10) × (100 - 70) = 0.5 × \\$5 × 30 = \\$75. This represents the lost consumer and producer surplus from reducing quantity from 100 to 70 units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a socially efficient market outcome?",
        "options": [
          "A monopolistic market where firms set prices above marginal cost to maximize profits at the expense of consumer surplus.",
          "A market where supply equals demand and the marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost.",
          "A market with price ceilings that result in a shortage, preventing consumers from purchasing enough goods.",
          "A market experiencing a free‐rider problem, resulting in underproduction of public goods."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Social efficiency occurs where marginal social benefit (MSB) equals marginal social cost (MSC). In competitive markets with no externalities, this occurs at the market equilibrium (supply = demand)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive industry receives a lump-sum subsidy. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the short-run market supply curve?",
        "options": [
          "The supply curve becomes more elastic",
          "The supply curve shifts leftward",
          "The supply curve shifts rightward",
          "The supply curve position remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A lump-sum subsidy is a fixed payment that doesn't vary with output. It affects fixed costs but not variable costs or marginal costs. Since supply is determined by marginal cost, the supply curve doesn't shift."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lump sum tax on a firm affects:",
        "options": [
          "MC, ATC, AVC",
          "Only ATC",
          "Only MC",
          "Only AVC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A lump-sum tax increases fixed costs, raising average total cost (ATC) but not affecting variable costs, marginal cost (MC), or average variable cost (AVC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a per unit tax differ in its impact on perfect competition versus monopolistic competition?",
        "options": [
          "Doesn't change output level vs. Changes output level",
          "Only affects ATC vs. Affects MC, ATC, AVC",
          "MC, ATC, AVC increases vs. Price increases",
          "Price doesn't change vs. Price decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, a per unit tax affects MC, ATC, and AVC, shifting supply left. In monopolistic competition, it similarly affects all these cost curves. Both market structures see reduced output and higher prices, though the specific impacts differ due to market structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When is the market equilibrium quantity equal to the socially optimal quantity?",
        "options": [
          "When firms maximize profits",
          "When all social costs are internalized",
          "When there is perfect competition",
          "When government sets a price floor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Market equilibrium equals social optimum when there are no externalities (all costs and benefits are internalized by market participants) and perfect competition exists. 'All social costs are internalized' encompasses both conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of a lump-sum subsidy on average total cost (ATC) in a regulated monopoly?",
        "options": [
          "Lump-sum subsidy increases ATC.",
          "Lump-sum subsidy shifts ATC to fixed cost.",
          "Lump-sum subsidy does not affect ATC.",
          "Lump-sum subsidy decreases ATC."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A lump-sum subsidy reduces fixed costs, which lowers average total cost (ATC) since ATC = AFC + AVC and AFC decreases with the subsidy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which policy instrument would most likely lead to an efficient outcome when dealing with common resources like fish stocks?",
        "options": [
          "Privatizing ocean areas where fish stocks are located in order for firms to manage them efficiently on their own terms.",
          "Implementing catch limits that reflect sustainable fishing rates based on scientific assessments.",
          "Providing government-funded incentives for fishermen who voluntarily limit their catches below quotas.",
          "Allowing unlimited access but imposing heavy fines on overfishing after it has occurred."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Common resources suffer from the tragedy of the commons (overuse due to non-excludability and rivalry). Privatization creates property rights, internalizing the externalities and creating incentives for sustainable management—an application of the Coase Theorem."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A public good has a marginal cost of \\$200 to provide and benefits 4 individuals, each with a marginal benefit of \\$60. What is the net social benefit?",
        "options": [
          "\\$240",
          "\\$160",
          "\\$40",
          "\\$200"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total social benefit = sum of individual benefits = 4 × \\$60 = \\$240. Marginal cost = \\$200. Net social benefit = Total benefit - Total cost = \\$240 - \\$200 = \\$40. This positive net benefit indicates the good should be provided."

        "question": "A labor economist observes that the Gini coefficient in a country has increased over the past decade. Which of the following would be the most plausible explanation based on labor market dynamics?",
        "options": [
          "Reduced concentration in employer markets",
          "Declining unionization rates and bargaining power of workers",
          "Expansion of earned income tax credits",
          "Increased minimum wage legislation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A rising Gini coefficient indicates increasing income inequality. Declining unionization reduces workers' collective bargaining power, potentially widening wage disparities between high- and low-income earners."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Clean air",
          "A slice of pizza"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Private goods are both excludable (you must pay for the pizza slice) and rivalrous (if you eat it, no one else can). National defense and public parks are public goods, while clean air is a common resource."
