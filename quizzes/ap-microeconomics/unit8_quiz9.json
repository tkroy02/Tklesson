      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following statements regarding the impact of diminishing marginal returns in factor markets are true except:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "When diminishing marginal returns set in, the marginal product of additional workers declines.",
          "Diminishing marginal returns imply that each additional unit of input will eventually generate a higher marginal product.",
          "Diminishing marginal returns lead to a stage where additional labor becomes less cost‑effective for the firm.",
          "As more workers are employed, the incremental output contributed by each new worker decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns means each additional unit of input eventually yields a lower (not higher) marginal product. Thus B is false."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, what determines the wage rate?",

        "options": [
          "Union negotiations",
          "Government wage controls",

          "Supply and demand for labor"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In a competitive labor market, the intersection of labor supply and labor demand sets the equilibrium wage."

          "No effect on labor supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An aging population means more people retire, reducing the number of people willing/able to work, shifting labor supply left."

        "options": [
          "Both set price ceilings",
          "Both ensure profit maximization",
          "Both are demand factors",
          "Both involve resource allocation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Least Cost Rule guides how firms choose inputs (labor, capital) to minimize cost for a given output—this is a resource‑allocation decision within factor markets."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Firms maximize profit by hiring inputs up to the point where MRP = MRC. This is a principle of profit maximization in factor markets."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the table below. If there is a significant increase in the number of qualified workers, what is the most likely impact on the labor market?",
        "image": "images/tabtai.png",
        "options": [
          "The labor supply curve shifts to the right, leading to lower wages and increased employment.",
          "The labor demand curve shifts to the right, resulting in higher wages and increased employment.",
          "The labor demand curve shifts to the left, leading to lower wages and reduced employment.",
          "The labor supply curve shifts to the left, causing higher wages and lower employment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More qualified workers increase labor supply (rightward shift), lowering equilibrium wage and increasing employment (assuming demand unchanged)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm’s marginal revenue product (MRP) is determined by the equation MRP = MPL × P. If the marginal product of labor (MPL) is 10 units and the output sells for $5 per unit, what is the firm’s MRP?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "MRP = MPL × P = 10 × $5 = $50."

        "options": [
          "Demand is based on personal values, supply on productivity",
          "Demand is constant, supply fluctuates with market",
          "Demand is regulated by government, supply is not",
          "Demand is influenced by productivity, supply by personal values"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Labor demand depends on MRP (productivity and product price). Labor supply depends on personal preferences, population, wages in other jobs, etc."

          "It shifts the labor demand curve to the right.",
          "It shifts the labor supply curve to the right.",

          "It has no impact on the demand for labor."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity raises MPL, increasing MRP and shifting labor demand to the right."

        "options": [
          "It will remain unchanged as government policies do not affect the labor market.",
          "It will become more elastic as workers respond to changes in wages.",
          "It will shift to the left because fewer people can afford college without subsidies.",
          "It will shift to the right because more individuals are likely to acquire a college education."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Education subsidies lower the cost of obtaining a degree, increasing the number of college‑educated workers, shifting labor supply right in degree‑requiring fields."
