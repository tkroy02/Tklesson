      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following statements regarding the impact of diminishing marginal returns in factor markets are true except:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "When diminishing marginal returns set in, the marginal product of additional workers declines.",
          "Diminishing marginal returns imply that each additional unit of input will eventually generate a higher marginal product.",
          "Diminishing marginal returns lead to a stage where additional labor becomes less cost‑effective for the firm.",
          "As more workers are employed, the incremental output contributed by each new worker decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns means each additional unit of input eventually yields a lower (not higher) marginal product. Thus B is false."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, what determines the wage rate?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Union negotiations",
          "Government wage controls",
          "Employer preferences",
          "Supply and demand for labor"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In a competitive labor market, the intersection of labor supply and labor demand sets the equilibrium wage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an aging population affect the labor supply curve?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Shifts left due to retirements",
          "Shifts right due to experience",

          "No effect on labor supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An aging population means more people retire, reducing the number of people willing/able to work, shifting labor supply left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way are factor markets and the Least Cost Rule related?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Both set price ceilings",
          "Both ensure profit maximization",
          "Both are demand factors",
          "Both involve resource allocation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Least Cost Rule guides how firms choose inputs (labor, capital) to minimize cost for a given output—this is a resource‑allocation decision within factor markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Firms maximize profit by hiring inputs up to the point where MRP = MRC. This is a principle of profit maximization in factor markets."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the table below. If there is a significant increase in the number of qualified workers, what is the most likely impact on the labor market?",
        "image": "images/tabtai.png",
        "options": [
          "The labor supply curve shifts to the right, leading to lower wages and increased employment.",
          "The labor demand curve shifts to the right, resulting in higher wages and increased employment.",
          "The labor demand curve shifts to the left, leading to lower wages and reduced employment.",
          "The labor supply curve shifts to the left, causing higher wages and lower employment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More qualified workers increase labor supply (rightward shift), lowering equilibrium wage and increasing employment (assuming demand unchanged)."

        "question": "What differentiates the determinants of labor demand from labor supply?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Demand is based on personal values, supply on productivity",
          "Demand is constant, supply fluctuates with market",
          "Demand is regulated by government, supply is not",
          "Demand is influenced by productivity, supply by personal values"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Labor demand depends on MRP (productivity and product price). Labor supply depends on personal preferences, population, wages in other jobs, etc."

          "It shifts the labor demand curve to the right.",
          "It shifts the labor supply curve to the right.",
          "It shifts the labor demand curve to the left.",
          "It has no impact on the demand for labor."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher productivity raises MPL, increasing MRP and shifting labor demand to the right."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government implements a policy that provides subsidies for college education, how would this most likely affect the supply curve for labor in industries requiring a college degree?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It will remain unchanged as government policies do not affect the labor market.",
          "It will become more elastic as workers respond to changes in wages.",
          "It will shift to the left because fewer people can afford college without subsidies.",
          "It will shift to the right because more individuals are likely to acquire a college education."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Education subsidies lower the cost of obtaining a degree, increasing the number of college‑educated workers, shifting labor supply right in degree‑requiring fields."

        "options": [
          "The marginal cost of labor is higher than the marginal revenue product",
          "The productivity of labor has increased",
          "The number of qualified workers has decreased",
          "Government intervention has increased"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the marginal cost of labor (wage) exceeds the marginal revenue product (MRP), the firm loses money on the last worker and will lay off workers to maximize profit, even if product price rises."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What could potentially happen if a profitable firm under monopolistic competition faces no entry barriers in the long run?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Existing firms would begin to engage in practices that resemble a natural monopoly, leading to increased barriers to entry.",
          "The firms would retain their original economic profits as new firms entering the market would not be able to compete effectively.",
          "Economic profits would remain constant as entry barriers are irrelevant for market structure profitability.",
          "New firms would be encouraged to enter the market, increasing competition and decreasing existing firms’ profitability."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In monopolistic competition, freedom of entry leads new firms to enter when existing firms earn economic profit. This increases competition, reduces demand for each firm’s product, and drives economic profit to zero in the long run."

        "question": "When there is an expectation of future skill shortages in a specific industry, what is most likely to happen to wages and the labor supply curve now?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Wages increase now, and the labor supply curve shifts rightward in anticipation of higher future demand.",
          "Supply remains constant, but wages decline as workers worry about job security.",
          "Wages remain stable, but the demand curve shifts left as companies seek alternatives to filling positions.",
          "Wages decrease now, as firms attempt to discourage entry into an overcrowded industry."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expectation of higher future wages and demand encourages more people to train for/enter the industry now, shifting labor supply right and potentially raising current wages as firms try to secure scarce skills early."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, each firm is a wage taker—it faces a horizontal labor supply curve at the market wage and can hire any quantity at that wage."
