    "topic": "Diminishing Marginal Returns, Wage Determination, Labor Supply Shifts, Least Cost Rule, Determinants of Labor Supply/Demand",

    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following statements regarding the impact of diminishing marginal returns in factor markets are true except:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "When diminishing marginal returns set in, the marginal product of additional workers declines.",
          "Diminishing marginal returns imply that each additional unit of input will eventually generate a higher marginal product.",
          "Diminishing marginal returns lead to a stage where additional labor becomes less cost‑effective for the firm.",
          "As more workers are employed, the incremental output contributed by each new worker decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns means each additional unit of input eventually yields a lower (not higher) marginal product. Thus B is false."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, what determines the wage rate?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Union negotiations",
          "Government wage controls",
          "Employer preferences",
          "Supply and demand for labor"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In a competitive labor market, the intersection of labor supply and labor demand sets the equilibrium wage."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an aging population affect the labor supply curve?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Shifts left due to retirements",
          "Shifts right due to experience",
          "Shifts right due to technology",
          "No effect on labor supply"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An aging population means more people retire, reducing the number of people willing/able to work, shifting labor supply left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way are factor markets and the Least Cost Rule related?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Both set price ceilings",
          "Both ensure profit maximization",
          "Both are demand factors",
          "Both involve resource allocation"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The Least Cost Rule guides how firms choose inputs (labor, capital) to minimize cost for a given output—this is a resource‑allocation decision within factor markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What economic concept explains why an additional unit of input is used until its marginal revenue product equals its marginal resource cost?",

          "Marginal thinking.",
          "Law of diminishing marginal returns.",

          "Profit maximization theory."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Firms maximize profit by hiring inputs up to the point where MRP = MRC. This is a principle of profit maximization in factor markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the table below. If there is a significant increase in the number of qualified workers, what is the most likely impact on the labor market?",
        "image": "images/tabtai.png",
        "options": [
          "The labor supply curve shifts to the right, leading to lower wages and increased employment.",
          "The labor demand curve shifts to the right, resulting in higher wages and increased employment.",
          "The labor demand curve shifts to the left, leading to lower wages and reduced employment.",
          "The labor supply curve shifts to the left, causing higher wages and lower employment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More qualified workers increase labor supply (rightward shift), lowering equilibrium wage and increasing employment (assuming demand unchanged)."
