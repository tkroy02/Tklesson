      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Refer to the graph 'images/sukosuko.png'. What is the profit-maximizing price and quantity for this monopolist?",

          "P1 Q1",

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "A monopolist maximizes profit where MR = MC (intersection at Q1). To find price, go up from Q1 to the demand curve, then left to the price axis: P5."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government were to regulate the monopoly pictured in the graph 'images/sukosuko.png' so that they must produce at the 'socially optimal' amount, what would be the price and quantity?",

        "explanation": "The socially optimal (allocatively efficient) output occurs where P = MC (demand curve intersects MC curve). On this graph, that intersection is at quantity Q2 and price P4."
