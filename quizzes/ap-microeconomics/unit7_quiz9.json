        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "A monopolist maximizes profit where MR = MC (intersection at Q1). To find price, go up from Q1 to the demand curve, then left to the price axis: P5."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government were to regulate the monopoly pictured in the graph shown so that they must produce at the 'socially optimal' amount, what would be the price and quantity?",

          "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The socially optimal (allocatively efficient) output occurs where P = MC (demand curve intersects MC curve). On this graph, that intersection is at quantity Q2 and price P4."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government were to regulate the monopoly pictured in the graph shown so that they must produce at the fair return or break-even point, what would be the price & quantity?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The fair-return (zero economic profit) point occurs where P = ATC. On the graph, the demand curve intersects the ATC curve at price P3 and quantity Q3."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is eliminated when price equals marginal cost (P = MC), which is the socially efficient outcome where the value of the last unit equals the cost of producing it."

          "higher; the same"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A monopoly restricts output below the competitive level to raise price above marginal cost, resulting in lower quantity and higher price compared to perfect competition."

          "Increase their prices in response to an increase in the price charged by a competitor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The kinked demand curve model assumes rivals will match price cuts (making demand inelastic below the kink) but not match price increases (making demand elastic above the kink)."

          "none of the answers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The firm is making a short-run profit because at the profit‑maximizing quantity (where MR = MC), price exceeds average total cost (ATC)."

          "distance between current production and ideal efficiency level"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Excess capacity occurs in monopolistic competition because firms produce at a quantity less than the output where ATC is minimized. The gap is between the profit‑maximizing output (MR = MC) and the minimum‑ATC output."

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When MR = 0, total revenue is maximized. For a downward‑sloping demand curve, MR becomes negative beyond that point, causing total revenue to fall."
