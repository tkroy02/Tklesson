      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The diagram shows a market with an initial equilibrium at (P1, Q1). A tax is imposed, shifting the supply curve upward. The new equilibrium is at (P2, Q2), where P2 is the price buyers pay. The vertical distance between the two supply curves represents the tax per unit. Which area represents the deadweight loss?",
        "image": "images/tax_dwl_graph.png",
        "options": [
          "The triangle between the demand curve, original supply curve, and new quantity",
          "The rectangle between the two supply curves from zero to Q2",
          "The triangle between the demand curve, new supply curve, and original quantity",
          "The rectangle between the two prices from Q2 to Q1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the loss in total surplus due to reduced quantity. It is the **triangle** between the demand (MB) curve, supply (MC) curve, and the new quantity Q2, where MB > MC for units not produced."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume the domestic equilibrium price of sugar is \\$5 per pound. The world price is \\$3. If the government imposes a \\$1 per‑pound tariff on imported sugar, what will the domestic price become?",
        "options": [
          "\\$3",
          "\\$4",
          "\\$5",
          "\\$6"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With free trade, domestic price = world price = \\$3. A \\$1 tariff raises the price of imports to \\$4. Domestic producers cannot charge more than \\$4, or consumers would buy imports. Therefore, domestic price rises to **\\$4**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is linear and downward‑sloping and supply is perfectly elastic, a \\$2 per‑unit tax imposed on buyers will result in:",
        "options": [
          "Buyers paying the full tax, quantity unchanged",
          "Sellers paying the full tax, quantity reduced",
          "Buyers and sellers splitting the tax, quantity reduced",
          "No change in market outcome"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfectly elastic supply → horizontal supply curve. A tax on buyers shifts demand down by \\$2. Price received by sellers stays the same (determined by supply), so buyers’ price rises by the full tax amount. Quantity falls unless demand is perfectly inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A market is initially in equilibrium. Then both demand and supply increase, but demand increases more than supply. What happens to equilibrium price and quantity?",
        "options": [
          "Price rises, quantity rises",
          "Price falls, quantity rises",
          "Price rises, quantity indeterminate",
          "Price indeterminate, quantity rises"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both shifts increase quantity. Since demand increases more than supply, the upward pressure on price from demand outweighs the downward pressure from increased supply → **price rises**. Quantity definitely rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price floor is set above equilibrium, and the government agrees to buy any unsold quantity at the floor price. What happens to producer revenue compared to the free market?",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Indeterminate without elasticity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With a price floor and government purchases, producers sell the same quantity as before (or more) at a higher price → revenue increases. Government purchases the surplus, effectively subsidizing producers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the cross‑price elasticity between Good A and Good B is –0.8, what happens in the market for Good B when the price of Good A rises?",
        "options": [
          "Demand for B increases",
          "Demand for B decreases",
          "Supply of B increases",
          "Supply of B decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Negative cross‑price elasticity means the goods are **complements**. Higher price of A reduces quantity demanded of A, which reduces demand for B → demand for B shifts left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for a good is given by Qd = 300 – 10P, and supply is Qs = 20P – 100. A price ceiling is set at P = 12. Is the ceiling binding, and if so, what is the resulting shortage?",
        "options": [
          "Not binding",
          "Binding, shortage = 40",
          "Binding, shortage = 60",
          "Binding, shortage = 100"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "First find equilibrium: 300 – 10P = 20P – 100 → 400 = 30P → P* = 13.33, Q* = 166.67. Price ceiling at 12 is below equilibrium → binding. At P=12: Qd = 300 – 120 = 180; Qs = 240 – 100 = 140. Shortage = 180 – 140 = **40**. Wait — that’s not in options. Let’s recalc: Qs = 20(12) – 100 = 240 – 100 = 140. Qd = 300 – 10(12) = 180. Shortage = 40. But options: 40 is B? Actually, B says 40. Yes, answer **B**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a binding quota is placed on a good, what happens to consumer surplus and producer surplus compared to the free market?",
        "options": [
          "Both increase",
          "Consumer surplus decreases, producer surplus may increase or decrease",
          "Producer surplus decreases, consumer surplus may increase or decrease",
          "Both decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A quota restricts quantity, raising price. Consumer surplus decreases (higher price, less quantity). Producer surplus may rise (higher price) but could fall if the quota is very restrictive and cost structures change; typically it rises for low‑cost producers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government removes a longstanding subsidy on corn production, what happens in the corn market?",
        "options": [
          "Supply increases, price falls",
          "Supply decreases, price rises",
          "Demand increases, price rises",
          "Demand decreases, price falls"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A subsidy lowers production costs, increasing supply. Removing it raises costs, **decreasing supply** (shift left). Equilibrium price rises, quantity falls."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market with no externalities, a price ceiling set below equilibrium and a production quota set at the equilibrium quantity are both in place. Which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "The price ceiling has no effect",
          "The quota has no effect",
          "Both policies reduce total surplus",
          "The market reaches the same outcome as with neither policy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the quota is set at equilibrium quantity, it does not restrict trade. The price ceiling below equilibrium would normally cause shortage, but the quota prevents producers from supplying more than equilibrium → **price ceiling is ineffective** (non‑binding) because quantity cannot exceed quota anyway."
