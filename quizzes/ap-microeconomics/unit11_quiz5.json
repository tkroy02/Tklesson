        "question": "If a small nation is currently an importer of wheat and the government provides a per-unit subsidy to domestic wheat farmers, what is the most likely effect on the domestic market?",
        "options": [
          "The nation will immediately transition from an importer to an exporter of wheat.",
          "The domestic price of wheat falls below the world price.",
          "Domestic production increases and the quantity of imports decreases.",
          "Consumer surplus increases because the subsidy lowers the cost of production."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A subsidy to domestic producers lowers their effective production costs, shifting the domestic supply curve right. This increases domestic quantity supplied, reduces the gap between domestic supply and demand at world price, and decreases imports. The domestic price remains at world price for a small country."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a country imposes an import quota, the resulting 'quota rent' is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The total loss in consumer surplus resulting from the restriction in quantity.",
          "The increase in producer surplus for domestic firms that compete with imports.",
          "The difference between the domestic price and the world price multiplied by the quantity of imports.",
          "The total tax revenue collected by the government from foreign exporters."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Quota rent = (Domestic price - World price) × Quota quantity. This economic rent accrues to whoever holds the import licenses, which could be domestic importers, foreign exporters, or the government depending on how licenses are allocated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding the deadweight loss (DWL) created by a tariff?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases as the tariff rate increases because government revenue rises.",
          "It represents the value of mutually beneficial trades that no longer occur due to the higher price.",
          "It only affects domestic producers who are unable to export their goods.",
          "It is exactly equal to the amount of revenue the government collects from the tariff."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "DWL from tariffs consists of two triangles: 1) production inefficiency (domestic production expands using higher-cost resources) and 2) consumption inefficiency (consumers reduce purchases even though marginal benefit exceeds world price). Both represent lost gains from trade."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market where a country has a comparative disadvantage, a move from a tariff to a quota that allows the same quantity of imports will:",
        "options": [
          "Maintain the same domestic price but decrease government revenue.",
          "Decrease the domestic quantity supplied as producers lose their protection.",
          "Increase consumer surplus because quotas are less restrictive than tariffs.",
          "Increase total social welfare by eliminating the production inefficiency."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If quota allows same imports as tariff, domestic price remains unchanged. However, tariff revenue goes to government, while quota rent may go to license holders (domestic/foreign). Both create identical DWL. The shift changes who captures the revenue/rent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country's domestic supply of oil is perfectly inelastic and the world price is lower than the domestic price, a tariff on oil will:",
        "options": [
          "Result in no deadweight loss because the government collects all the surplus.",
          "Create production deadweight loss but no consumption deadweight loss.",
          "Create consumption deadweight loss but no production deadweight loss.",
          "Cause domestic producers to increase their total revenue by more than the tariff amount."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic domestic supply means no production response to price changes. Tariff raises domestic price, reducing quantity demanded. DWL comes only from consumption inefficiency (triangle where MB > world price but purchases are reduced). No production inefficiency triangle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country exports computer chips if the world price is higher than its domestic equilibrium price. Opening this market to trade will:",
        "options": [
          "Benefit domestic producers more than it harms domestic consumers, increasing total welfare.",
          "Benefit domestic consumers more than it harms domestic producers.",
          "Result in a net loss of total surplus for the exporting nation.",
          "Cause the domestic quantity supplied to fall as firms focus on quality over quantity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When world price > domestic price, the country exports. Domestic price rises to world price: producers gain (higher prices, more production), consumers lose (higher prices, less consumption). The gain in producer surplus exceeds loss in consumer surplus, increasing total welfare."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The infant industry argument is often criticized by economists because:",
        "options": [
          "It leads to an immediate increase in the nation's total consumer surplus.",
          "It ignores the fact that new industries always have a comparative advantage.",
          "Protected industries may lack the incentive to become efficient and competitive.",
          "It is only valid if the country already has an absolute advantage in all goods."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Criticisms: 1) Protection may become permanent if industries don't become efficient, 2) Governments may pick wrong industries, 3) Subsidies (first-best) are better than tariffs/quotas, 4) Protection reduces incentive for innovation/efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a nation is a 'price taker' in the global market, its demand for imports is determined by:",
        "options": [
          "The total amount of currency reserves held by the nation's central bank.",
          "The gap between domestic quantity demanded and domestic quantity supplied at the world price.",
          "The intersection of the domestic supply curve and the domestic demand curve.",
          "The difference between the absolute advantage and the comparative advantage of the nation."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a small country (price taker), world price is fixed. At this price: Imports = Domestic quantity demanded - Domestic quantity supplied. Import demand curve shows how this gap changes with price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An export subsidy provided by a foreign government to its own producers will have what effect on the importing country's welfare?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the importing country's total surplus by lowering the price for its consumers.",
          "It results in no change in welfare because the world price is unaffected.",
          "It only benefits the producers in the importing country who use the good as an input.",
          "It decreases the importing country's total surplus due to unfair competition."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Foreign export subsidies lower world price (foreign firms can sell cheaper). Importing country benefits: lower prices increase consumer surplus. Domestic producers in importing country may be harmed, but net effect on importing country is positive (terms of trade improvement)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would shift a country's domestic demand for imports to the right?",
        "options": [
          "A successful advertising campaign by domestic producers to 'Buy Local'.",
          "The imposition of a restrictive import quota by the domestic government.",
          "A decrease in the domestic supply of the good.",
          "An increase in the world price of the imported good."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Import demand = Qd - Qs. Decrease in domestic supply (leftward shift) increases the gap between quantity demanded and supplied at each price, shifting import demand right. Advertising 'Buy Local' would decrease import demand. Quotas restrict quantity, not shift curve. Higher world price moves along import demand curve."
