        "question": "In the short run, the total product of labour is best defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The change in output from hiring one more worker.",
          "The total output produced by a given amount of labour, holding capital fixed.",
          "The output per worker averaged across all workers.",
          "The maximum output achievable with unlimited labour."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total product of labour is the total output produced using a certain quantity of labour, with other inputs (like capital) fixed in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, which factor most directly explains why a firm's marginal cost (MC) curve eventually slopes upwards?",
        "options": [
          "Diminishing marginal returns to the variable factor.",
          "Falling fixed costs as output increases.",
          "Long-run economies of scale.",
          "Rising product prices as the firm expands output."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing marginal cost in the short run is due to diminishing marginal returns to the variable input (e.g., labour)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm's fixed costs increase while its variable costs remain unchanged, what happens to its marginal cost (MC) in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost falls at all levels of output.",
          "Marginal cost rises at all levels of output.",
          "Marginal cost is unchanged at all levels of output.",
          "Marginal cost first falls then rises as output increases."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Marginal cost depends only on variable costs. Fixed costs do not affect MC."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the best example of an internal economy of scale for a US automobile manufacturer?",
        "options": [
          "Spreading the high design and R&D costs of a new model over a larger volume of output.",
          "A decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate for all firms in the industry.",
          "A reduction in interest rates set by the Federal Reserve.",
          "An improvement in the highway infrastructure near the firm’s main assembly plant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Internal economies of scale occur when a firm's own expansion lowers its average costs, such as spreading fixed R&D costs over more units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm is making supernormal profit when:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue equals total economic cost, including opportunity costs.",
          "Total revenue exceeds total economic cost, including opportunity costs.",
          "Total revenue is less than total fixed cost.",
          "Total revenue equals total variable cost but is less than total fixed cost."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Supernormal profit (economic profit) exists when total revenue exceeds total economic cost (including all opportunity costs)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which explanation best accounts for the typical U-shape of a firm's short-run average total cost (ATC) curve?",
        "options": [
          "Average fixed cost and average variable cost both fall at all output levels.",
          "Average fixed cost always rises but average variable cost always falls.",
          "Average total cost is unrelated to marginal cost at different output levels.",
          "Average fixed cost falls as output rises while average variable cost eventually rises due to diminishing returns."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "ATC is U-shaped because AFC falls continuously, while AVC eventually rises due to diminishing marginal returns, causing ATC to fall then rise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a firm selling a single product, total revenue (TR) is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "Average revenue multiplied by average cost.",
          "Marginal revenue minus marginal cost.",
          "Total cost plus economic profit.",
          "Price per unit multiplied by the quantity sold."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Total revenue = Price × Quantity sold, assuming all units are sold at the same price."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A factory has total fixed costs of $1,000. At an output of 250 units, its average total cost (ATC) is $12 and its average variable cost (AVC) is $8. Which of the following is correct?",
        "options": [
          "Total variable cost is $5,000.",
          "Total fixed cost is $2,000.",
          "Total cost is $3,000.",
          "Total variable cost is $1,000."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "TC = ATC × Q = $12 × 250 = $3,000. TVC = AVC × Q = $8 × 250 = $2,000. TFC = $1,000 (given). Check: TFC + TVC = $1,000 + $2,000 = $3,000 = TC."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a firm is producing at an output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost but price is below average total cost, the firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximizing profit and earning economic profit.",
          "Maximizing profit but incurring an economic loss.",
          "Minimizing total cost.",
          "Producing at the shutdown point."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit is maximized where MR = MC, but if P < ATC at that output, the firm incurs an economic loss (though it continues if P ≥ AVC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following will shift a firm’s average variable cost (AVC) curve upward?",
        "options": [
          "An increase in property taxes.",
          "A rise in the wage rate paid to workers.",
          "A decrease in the price of raw materials.",
          "An improvement in production technology."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AVC is variable cost per unit. Higher wages increase variable costs, shifting AVC upward. Property taxes affect fixed costs, not AVC."
