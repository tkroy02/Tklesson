    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In game theory, a Nash equilibrium occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "All players cooperate for mutual benefit.",
          "Each player chooses their dominant strategy.",
          "No player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing strategy.",
          "Total payoffs to all players are maximized."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A Nash equilibrium is reached when each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies chosen by others; no individual has an incentive to deviate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'prisoner's dilemma' illustrates why:",
        "options": [
          "Firms in an oligopoly tend to collude successfully.",
          "Competitive markets achieve efficient outcomes.",
          "Individually rational decisions may lead to collectively worse outcomes.",
          "Monopolies maximize social welfare."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Each prisoner has an incentive to confess (dominant strategy), but if both confess, they get worse combined sentences than if both remained silent—showing how individual rationality can lead to suboptimal group results."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cartel is most likely to be successful when:",
        "options": [
          "There are many firms in the industry.",
          "Products are highly differentiated.",
          "Entry into the industry is easy.",
          "The number of firms is small and detection of cheating is easy."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Cartels work best with few firms, homogeneous products, stable demand, and the ability to monitor compliance—making cheating easy to detect and punish."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a payoff matrix showing two firms deciding to advertise or not, the dominant strategy for each firm is to advertise. The likely outcome is:",
        "options": [
          "Both firms advertise and earn high profits.",
          "Both firms do not advertise and earn moderate profits.",
          "Both firms advertise but earn lower profits than if both did not advertise.",
          "One firm advertises and captures the entire market."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If advertising is a dominant strategy, both will choose it, but they may end up with lower profits than if they could collude and both not advertise—a classic prisoner's dilemma result."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of tacit collusion?",
        "options": [
          "A written agreement to fix prices.",
          "Price leadership by a dominant firm.",
          "A legally binding joint venture contract.",
          "Publicly announcing future price increases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tacit collusion occurs without explicit agreement, often through practices like price leadership, where one firm sets prices and others follow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an oligopolist's rivals match price cuts but not price increases, the firm faces a:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic demand curve.",
          "Kinked demand curve.",
          "Vertical demand curve.",
          "Linear upward-sloping demand curve."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This behavior creates a kinked demand curve—elastic above the current price (rivals don't follow increases) and inelastic below it (rivals match cuts), leading to price rigidity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Game theory is most applicable to the study of:",
        "options": [
          "Perfect competition.",
          "Monopoly.",
          "Monopolistic competition.",
          "Oligopoly."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Oligopoly involves strategic interdependence, where one firm's decisions affect others' outcomes—making game theory a key analytical tool."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A dominant strategy is one that:",
        "options": [
          "Yields the highest payoff regardless of rivals' actions.",
          "Only works if all competitors cooperate.",
          "Maximizes joint industry profits.",
          "Is always the first move in a sequential game."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dominant strategy gives a player a better payoff than any other strategy, no matter what opponents do."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two oligopolists collude to maximize joint profits, they will produce where:",
        "options": [
          "Each firm's MR equals its MC.",
          "Industry MR equals industry MC.",
          "Price equals marginal cost for each firm.",
          "Each firm produces at minimum average total cost."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Colluding oligopolists act like a single monopolist, maximizing total profit where combined marginal revenue equals combined marginal cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, monopolistically competitive firms have excess capacity because they:",
        "options": [
          "Produce at minimum average total cost.",
          "Produce where price equals marginal cost.",
          "Face downward-sloping demand and free entry.",
          "Have significant economies of scale."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Free entry drives profit to zero, but downward-sloping demand means firms don't produce at the minimum of ATC—they operate at a smaller scale than would be cost-minimizing, creating excess capacity."
