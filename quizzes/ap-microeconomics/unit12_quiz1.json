    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of diminishing marginal utility states that as a person consumes more of a good:",
        "options": [
          "Total utility increases at an increasing rate.",
          "Marginal utility eventually decreases with additional consumption.",
          "The price of the good must decrease to maintain consumption.",
          "Income must increase to justify further purchases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal utility: each additional unit of a good provides less additional satisfaction than the previous unit, explaining downward-sloping demand curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm's short-run supply curve is:",
        "options": [
          "Its entire marginal cost curve.",
          "The portion of its marginal cost curve above average variable cost.",
          "The portion of its marginal cost curve above average total cost.",
          "Horizontal at the market price."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In short run, firm produces where P = MC if P ≥ AVC (shutdown rule). Supply curve is MC above minimum AVC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When marginal cost is below average total cost, average total cost must be:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing.",
          "Decreasing.",
          "At its minimum point.",
          "Equal to marginal cost."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If MC < ATC, pulling ATC down. ATC decreases until MC = ATC at minimum point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist maximizes profit by producing where:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal revenue equals marginal cost.",
          "Price equals marginal cost.",
          "Total revenue is maximized.",
          "Average total cost is minimized."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "All profit-maximizing firms produce where MR = MC. Monopolist then charges price on demand curve above this quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the kinked demand curve model of oligopoly, firms assume that:",
        "options": [
          "Rivals will match price increases but not price decreases.",
          "Rivals will match both price increases and decreases.",
          "Rivals will not respond to any price changes.",
          "Demand is perfectly elastic at the current price."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kinked demand curve: above current price, demand elastic (rivals won't follow price increases); below current price, demand inelastic (rivals will follow price decreases). Creates price rigidity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A positive externality in consumption exists when:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal social benefit exceeds marginal private benefit.",
          "Marginal social cost exceeds marginal private cost.",
          "The market produces more than the socially optimal quantity.",
          "Government intervention always reduces efficiency."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Positive externality: third parties benefit. MSB > MPB, leading to underconsumption. Examples: education, vaccinations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price ceiling set below the equilibrium price will result in:",
        "options": [
          "A surplus of the good.",
          "A shortage of the good.",
          "No effect on the market quantity.",
          "Increased producer surplus."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Binding price ceiling (below equilibrium) creates shortage: quantity demanded > quantity supplied. Examples: rent control."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The cross-price elasticity of demand between butter and margarine is likely to be:",
        "options": [
          "Positive, indicating substitute goods.",
          "Negative, indicating complementary goods.",
          "Zero, indicating unrelated goods.",
          "Greater than 1, indicating luxury goods."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitutes: price increase in one increases demand for other → positive cross-price elasticity. Butter and margarine are substitutes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A lump-sum tax on a monopolist will affect:",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost and optimal output level.",
          "Average total cost but not optimal output.",
          "Both price and quantity produced.",
          "Only the firm's fixed costs."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lump-sum tax increases fixed costs, raising ATC. Doesn't affect MC, so profit-maximizing output (MR = MC) and price unchanged. Only profit decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In game theory, a dominant strategy is one that:",
        "options": [
          "Maximizes joint payoffs for all players.",
          "Is optimal regardless of opponents' choices.",
          "Minimizes potential losses in worst-case scenarios.",
          "Requires cooperation between competitors."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Dominant strategy yields highest payoff regardless of what other players do. In prisoner's dilemma, confessing is often dominant strategy even though cooperation yields better joint outcome."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The marginal product of labor begins to diminish when:",
        "options": [
          "Total product is at its maximum.",
          "Average product equals marginal product.",
          "Additional workers add less output than previous workers.",
          "Fixed capital becomes variable in the long run."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Law of diminishing marginal returns: with fixed capital, adding workers eventually yields smaller increases in output. MPL curve eventually slopes downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural monopoly exists when:",
        "options": [
          "A single firm can supply the entire market at lower cost than multiple firms.",
          "The government grants exclusive production rights.",
          "Firms collude to fix prices and output.",
          "Economies of scale are exhausted at very low output levels."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural monopoly: large fixed costs, declining ATC over relevant output range. One firm can produce at lower cost than multiple firms (utilities, railroads)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country has a comparative advantage in producing wine, opening to trade will cause:",
        "options": [
          "Domestic wine price to fall and consumption to increase.",
          "Domestic wine price to rise and production to increase.",
          "No change in domestic wine market equilibrium.",
          "Imports of wine to increase dramatically."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Comparative advantage in wine → country exports wine. Domestic price rises to world price: production increases, consumption decreases, total surplus increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Deadweight loss from a tax is larger when:",
        "options": [
          "Demand and supply are both inelastic.",
          "Demand and supply are both elastic.",
          "The tax rate is very low.",
          "The market is perfectly competitive."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tax DWL measures lost gains from trade. More elastic curves → larger quantity response → larger DWL. Inelastic curves → small quantity change → small DWL."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In monopolistic competition, long-run equilibrium occurs where:",
        "options": [
          "P = MC and firms earn economic profits.",
          "P = ATC and firms earn zero economic profit.",
          "MR = MC and P > ATC.",
          "Firms produce at minimum efficient scale."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolistic competition: free entry/exit drives economic profit to zero in long run. P = ATC, but P > MC (downward-sloping demand gives some market power)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Coase theorem suggests that private solutions to externalities are possible when:",
        "options": [
          "Government imposes Pigouvian taxes.",
          "Transaction costs are low and property rights are clearly defined.",
          "The externality affects many parties.",
          "The government provides subsidies to affected parties."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Coase theorem: with well-defined property rights and low transaction costs, parties can negotiate efficient outcomes regardless of initial rights assignment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit-maximizing firm in perfect competition will shut down in the short run if:",
        "options": [
          "Price is less than average total cost.",
          "Price is less than average variable cost.",
          "Total revenue is less than total cost.",
          "Marginal revenue is less than marginal cost."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shutdown rule: produce if P ≥ AVC (covers variable costs). If P < AVC, shut down (loss = fixed costs only). Continue operating if loss < fixed costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Gini coefficient measures:",
        "options": [
          "The progressivity of a tax system.",
          "Income inequality within a country.",
          "The poverty rate relative to median income.",
          "Labor force participation rates."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gini coefficient: 0 = perfect equality (everyone same income), 1 = perfect inequality (one person has all income). Measures income distribution, not poverty."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A per-unit subsidy to producers will:",
        "options": [
          "Shift supply curve left, increasing price.",
          "Shift supply curve right, decreasing price.",
          "Shift demand curve right, increasing price.",
          "Create a shortage at the original price."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Per-unit subsidy reduces producers' costs, shifting supply right. New equilibrium: lower price, higher quantity. Consumers and producers both gain, but cost to government creates DWL."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The income elasticity of demand for inferior goods is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive.",
          "Negative.",
          "Zero.",
          "Greater than 1."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Income elasticity: % change in quantity demanded / % change in income. Inferior goods: income increases → demand decreases → negative elasticity. Normal goods: positive elasticity."
