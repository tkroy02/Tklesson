      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country A and Country B form a free trade area. Country A previously imported wheat from Country C (low-cost producer) but now imports from Country B (higher-cost than C but lower than A's domestic production). This represents:",
        "options": [
          "Trade creation - welfare improving",
          "Trade diversion - potentially welfare reducing",
          "Absolute advantage realization",
          "Optimal tariff effect",
          "Factor price equalization"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Trade diversion occurs when a trade agreement causes imports to shift from a lower-cost non-member to a higher-cost member due to tariff elimination. This can reduce welfare if the efficiency loss from higher-cost production exceeds gains from tariff elimination."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Heckscher-Ohlin model, Country X is capital-abundant and Country Y is labor-abundant. Country X will:",
        "options": [
          "Export labor-intensive goods and import capital-intensive goods",
          "Export capital-intensive goods and import labor-intensive goods",
          "Have higher wages than Country Y in equilibrium",
          "Experience decreasing returns to scale in export industries",
          "Specialize in goods where it has absolute advantage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Heckscher-Ohlin theorem: countries export goods that intensively use their abundant factor. Capital-abundant Country X exports capital-intensive goods; labor-abundant Country Y exports labor-intensive goods. Through trade, relative factor prices tend to equalize."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the specific factors model, capital is specific to manufacturing and land is specific to agriculture. If the price of agricultural products rises, what happens?",
        "options": [
          "Real wage in terms of manufacturing rises, in terms of agriculture falls",
          "Real wage in terms of both goods rises unambiguously",
          "Real wage in terms of agriculture rises, in terms of manufacturing falls",
          "Nominal wage rises but real wage falls in both sectors",
          "Capital owners gain at the expense of landowners"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher agricultural prices increase value of marginal product of labor in agriculture. Labor shifts from manufacturing to agriculture. Nominal wage rises but less than agricultural price increase. Real wage in terms of agriculture (w/P_ag) falls (can buy less agriculture), real wage in terms of manufacturing (w/P_man) rises (can buy more manufacturing)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'strategic trade policy' argument suggests governments should:",
        "options": [
          "Always impose tariffs to protect domestic industries",
          "Subsidize industries with positive externalities or first-mover advantages",
          "Eliminate all trade barriers for maximum efficiency",
          "Use tariffs to gain monopoly power in world markets",
          "Protect industries facing import competition regardless of circumstances"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Strategic trade policy (Brander-Spencer) argues that in oligopolistic global markets with economies of scale, temporary subsidies can help domestic firms capture global market share, generate positive externalities (R&D spillovers), and yield national benefits exceeding subsidy costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Stolper-Samuelson theorem predicts that when a labor-abundant country opens to trade:",
        "options": [
          "Wages fall and returns to capital rise",
          "Wages rise and returns to capital fall",
          "Both wages and returns to capital rise",
          "Income distribution becomes more equal",
          "Factor prices remain unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Stolper-Samuelson: trade liberalization raises returns to the abundant factor and lowers returns to the scarce factor. In a labor-abundant country opening to trade, labor-intensive exports expand, increasing labor demand and wages. Capital-intensive imports increase, reducing capital demand and returns."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose free trade would lead to 1,000 units imported at \\$100 each. A tariff of \\$20 reduces imports to 600 units. If domestic supply increases from 200 to 400 units, what is the production deadweight loss?",
        "options": [
          "\\$2,000",
          "\\$4,000",
          "\\$1,000",
          "\\$6,000",
          "\\$8,000"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Production DWL = 0.5 × tariff × increase in domestic production = 0.5 × \\$20 × (400 - 200) = 0.5 × \\$20 × 200 = \\$2,000. This represents the cost of producing 200 more units domestically at higher cost than importing them at world price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which policy would be most effective in assisting workers displaced by import competition?",
        "options": [
          "Imposing retaliatory tariffs on the exporting country",
          "Providing trade adjustment assistance and retraining programs",
          "Subsidizing the affected industry indefinitely",
          "Implementing import quotas to protect jobs",
          "Devaluing the national currency"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While trade creates net gains, it creates losers (displaced workers). Trade adjustment assistance (retraining, income support, relocation aid) helps workers transition to growing sectors, addressing equity concerns while preserving efficiency gains from trade."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the elasticity of demand for a country's exports is 1.5 and elasticity of demand for imports is 0.8, a currency depreciation will:",
        "options": [
          "Improve the trade balance (Marshall-Lerner holds)",
          "Worsen the trade balance (Marshall-Lerner fails)",
          "Have no effect on trade balance",
          "Increase export revenues but decrease import costs",
          "Cause inflation without trade effects"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Marshall-Lerner condition: sum of export demand elasticity (1.5) and import demand elasticity (0.8) = 2.3 > 1. Therefore, currency depreciation will improve trade balance in the long run (though J-curve may cause short-run deterioration)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'gravity model' of trade predicts that trade between two countries is proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "Their GDPs and inversely proportional to distance between them",
          "Their comparative advantage differences",
          "Their tariff levels and subsidy policies",
          "Their exchange rate volatility",
          "Their relative factor endowments"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity model: Trade = k × (GDP₁ × GDP₂)/Distance. Larger economies trade more; greater distance reduces trade (transport costs, cultural differences). This empirical model explains much actual trade patterns beyond comparative advantage."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A developing country's government protects its infant automobile industry. According to optimal intervention theory, which policy is most efficient?",
        "options": [
          "Production subsidy to domestic automakers",
          "Import tariff on foreign automobiles",
          "Import quota on foreign automobiles",
          "Export subsidy to domestic automakers",
          "Voluntary export restraint negotiated with trading partners"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the goal is to support domestic production (due to positive externalities or learning-by-doing), a production subsidy is first-best. It encourages domestic production without distorting consumption choices or raising consumer prices like tariffs/quotas do. Subsidy directly addresses production externality."
