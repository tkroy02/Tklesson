      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer buys 10 units of good X and 5 units of good Y. Px = \\$4, Py = \\$2. If MUx = 20 and MUy = 10, is the consumer maximizing utility? If not, how should they adjust?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, maximizing utility",
          "No, should buy more X and less Y",
          "No, should buy more Y and less X",
          "No, should buy less of both"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MUx/Px = 20/4 = 5. MUy/Py = 10/2 = 5. MUx/Px = MUy/Py → consumer is **maximizing utility** given budget constraint."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price elasticity of demand for coffee is –0.5 and the price increases by 10%, total revenue will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Stay the same",
          "Change indeterminately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "|Ed| = 0.5 < 1 → demand is inelastic. When price rises, total revenue **increases** (quantity falls proportionally less)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an inferior good, the income effect of a price decrease:",
        "options": [
          "Increases quantity demanded",
          "Decreases quantity demanded",
          "Has no effect",
          "Reverses the substitution effect"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For an inferior good, a price decrease raises real income, which **reduces** quantity demanded (income effect works against substitution effect)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand curve is Qd = 80 – 4P. At what price is demand unit elastic?",
        "options": [
          "\\$5",
          "\\$10",
          "\\$15",
          "\\$20"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unit elastic where |Ed| = 1. Ed = (dQ/dP) × (P/Q) = –4 × (P / (80 – 4P)). Set |–4P/(80 – 4P)| = 1 → 4P = 80 – 4P → 8P = 80 → P = **\\$10**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer’s indifference curves are vertical lines. This implies:",
        "options": [
          "Good Y is a neutral good",
          "Good X is a neutral good",
          "Goods are perfect complements",
          "Goods are perfect substitutes"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Vertical indifference curves mean utility does not change when quantity of **good X** changes → **X is a neutral good** (consumer doesn’t care about X)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a per‑unit subsidy is given to producers in a market with relatively elastic demand and inelastic supply, who benefits more?",
        "options": [
          "Producers benefit more",
          "Consumers benefit more",
          "Benefits are split equally",
          "Government benefits most"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Subsidy benefits are split based on relative elasticity: the more elastic side captures more of the benefit. Here, demand is elastic → **consumers benefit more** (lower price, bigger quantity increase)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cross‑price elasticity between printers and printer ink is –0.8. If the price of printers rises by 15%, what happens to quantity demanded of ink?",
        "options": [
          "Increases by 12%",
          "Decreases by 12%",
          "Increases by 0.12%",
          "Decreases by 0.12%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity = %∆Qd ink / %∆P printers → –0.8 = %∆Qd / 15% → %∆Qd = –0.8 × 15% = **–12%** (decrease)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A price ceiling is imposed below equilibrium in a market with perfectly inelastic demand. What happens to consumer surplus?",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Remains unchanged",
          "Turns into producer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With perfectly inelastic demand, quantity demanded is fixed. A binding price ceiling creates shortage, reduces quantity traded (if supply is upward‑sloping), and typically **reduces consumer surplus** due to non‑price rationing and lower quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a consumer’s budget line is tangent to an indifference curve at a bundle where MRS = 2 and Px/Py = 1, the consumer should:",
        "options": [
          "Buy more X and less Y",
          "Buy more Y and less X",
          "Stay at current bundle",
          "Increase income"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MRS = 2, Px/Py = 1 → MRS > Px/Py. Consumer values X more than the market relative price suggests → should **buy more X, less Y** until MRS = Px/Py."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The government wants to minimize deadweight loss from a tax. It should tax goods with:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic demand and elastic supply",
          "Inelastic demand and inelastic supply",
          "Elastic demand and inelastic supply",
          "Inelastic demand and elastic supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is smaller when **both demand and supply are inelastic** (quantity changes little). Taxing inelastic goods minimizes efficiency loss."
