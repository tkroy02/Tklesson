      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of physical capital?",
        "options": [
          "A trained chef using culinary skills in a restaurant.",
          "A factory’s modern assembly line machinery used to produce cars.",
          "Innovative ideas that drive a tech startup forward.",
          "A fertile plot of land used to grow vegetables."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Physical capital** (or just 'capital' in economics) refers to human-made goods used to produce other goods and services. Machinery, tools, and buildings are classic examples. (A) is human capital (skills). (C) is entrepreneurial ideas. (D) is land (a natural resource)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A developing nation implements policies that increase its rate of capital formation. After five years, which of the following would most accurately represent the change in its PPC?",
        "options": [
          "Outward shifts only in consumer goods production",
          "Continuous outward shifts with greater expansion in capital-intensive sectors",
          "No shift until the fifth year when all capital is deployed",
          "A single outward shift followed by stability"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increasing 'capital formation' means investing in new capital goods (machines, infrastructure). This increases the economy's productive capacity, causing the PPF to shift outward. Since the policy is sustained ('rate of capital formation'), the shift is **continuous** over time. The shift may be **asymmetric**, expanding more for goods that are capital-intensive or that benefit directly from the new investments."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A nation decides to allocate resources toward building a new highway instead of investing in renewable energy. Which of the following best represents the opportunity cost from a microeconomic perspective?",
        "options": [
          "The monetary cost of highway construction",
          "The potential reduction in carbon emissions",
          "The value of alternative goods and services foregone",
          "The future maintenance costs of the highway"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "**Opportunity cost** is defined as the value of the next-best alternative forgone. From a microeconomic (resource allocation) perspective, it is the value of the **renewable energy projects** (or other public goods) that could have been produced with those same resources. It is not just the monetary cost (A) or a single benefit of the forgone option (B)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy operating at its production possibilities frontier decides to increase production of consumer goods. In this scenario, the opportunity cost is BEST described as:",
        "options": [
          "The monetary value of the additional consumer goods",
          "The capital goods that must be sacrificed",
          "The time required to produce the consumer goods",
          "The total resources used in production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "On the PPF, resources are fully employed. To produce more consumer goods, resources must be reallocated **away from producing something else**. In a simple two-good model (consumer vs. capital goods), the opportunity cost is the quantity of **capital goods that must be given up**. This is the essence of the trade-off shown by the PPF's slope."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a company decides to produce smartphones instead of laptops, its opportunity cost is measured by which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "The revenue generated from smartphone sales.",
          "The amount spent on raw materials for smartphones.",
          "The number of smartphones produced.",
          "The profit that could have been made from producing laptops."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "For a **profit-maximizing firm**, the relevant measure of value is profit. The opportunity cost of using resources to produce smartphones is the **profit those same resources could have earned in their next-best alternative use**—producing laptops. This incorporates both revenue and cost, not just revenue (A) or input costs (B)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an explicit cost?",
        "options": [
          "A direct monetary payment for raw materials used in production.",
          "The cost of using personal savings to invest in a new venture.",
          "The value of leisure time sacrificed to work extra hours.",
          "The potential income lost by an entrepreneur working in their own business instead of elsewhere."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "**Explicit costs** are direct, out-of-pocket monetary payments to purchase resources or services. Paying for raw materials is a classic explicit cost. Options B, C, and D are all **implicit costs**—non-monetary opportunity costs involving owned resources or forgone alternatives."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government imposes a quota on the production of good X, which is currently being produced at an efficient point on the PPC, what is likely to happen to the production of good Y that uses some common resources?",
        "options": [
          "Both goods X and Y will see increased efficiency in their production.",
          "The production of good Y will increase because more resources are available.",
          "The production possibilities for good Y will remain unchanged since it’s a different product.",
          "The production of good Y may decrease due to reallocated resources."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A quota artificially restricts the output of Good X below its efficient level. Resources that would have been used to produce X (labor, capital) are now **idle or must be reallocated**. If these resources can be used to produce Good Y, then the production of Y **will likely increase** as firms utilize the newly available resources. The economy moves **inside** its PPF, representing productive inefficiency."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario illustrates economic agents facing trade-offs in resource allocation?",
        "options": [
          "A company increases production without changing its level of resources",
          "A farmer grows only one type of crop on their farmland every year",
          "A business maintains current levels of investment in all departments equally",
          "A government decides to increase funding for education by decreasing its defense budget"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A **trade-off** exists when getting more of one thing requires getting less of another due to scarce resources. The government's decision to fund more education **by taking funds from defense** is a direct, clear example of a resource allocation trade-off. The other options do not involve a sacrifice of one goal for another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which combination correctly pairs each factor of production with its primary cause of scarcity?",
        "options": [
          "Land: ownership; Labor: education; Capital: interest rates",
          "Land: location; Labor: immigration; Capital: depreciation",
          "Land: pollution; Labor: wages; Capital: technology",
          "Land: fixed supply; Labor: population and skills; Capital: time"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Scarcity arises because our wants exceed the available resources. **Land** is inherently fixed in quantity. **Labor** is limited by population size, participation rates, and skill levels. **Capital** is scarce because it must be produced, which requires time, savings, and forgone consumption. This option correctly identifies the fundamental constraints for each factor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy exhibits the following characteristics: private ownership of capital, government regulation of certain industries, and public provision of some goods. If this economy experiences a significant increase in government ownership of key industries, which economic outcome would most likely occur?",
        "options": [
          "Increased productive efficiency in all sectors",
          "Greater responsiveness to consumer preferences",
          "Elimination of scarcity for essential goods",
          "Reduced allocative efficiency but potentially more equity"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The initial description is of a **mixed economy**. A move toward more government ownership (nationalization) is a shift toward a command system. Historically, this reduces **allocative efficiency** as bureaucratic decisions replace market signals, often leading to mismatches between production and consumer wants. However, it may be pursued to achieve other goals like **equity** or stability. It does not eliminate scarcity (C) and often reduces productive efficiency (A) and consumer responsiveness (B)."

        "90": "Expert-level synthesis. You correctly analyze the dynamic effects of capital formation on the PPF, apply the firm-level profit definition of opportunity cost, and predict the outcomes of government intervention in mixed economies. You have mastered the applied, real-world dimension of Unit 1 principles.",
        "70": "Strong analytical foundation. You may have missed the nuanced effects of a production quota or the precise pairing of factors with scarcity. Focus on: 1) How artificial constraints (quotas, taxes) move the economy inside its PPF and affect other sectors, and 2) The root causes of scarcity for each factor of production.",
        "50": "Core concepts are understood in isolation. To connect them, practice: 1) Tracing the chain of effects from a policy (like a quota) to resource reallocation and efficiency, 2) Identifying explicit vs. implicit costs in business scenarios, and 3) Relating characteristics of economies to likely efficiency outcomes.",
        "0": "Foundational review is critical. Re-engage with the three key frameworks: 1) The Four Factors of Production and why each is scarce, 2) The PPF model and what moves you along, inside, or shifts the curve, 3) The spectrum of economic systems from market to command. These are the building blocks for every question here."
