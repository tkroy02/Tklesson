        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economists normally assume that the goal of a firm is to earn (i) profits as large as possible, even if it means reducing output. (ii) profits as large as possible, even if it means incurring a higher total cost. (iii) revenues as large as possible, even if it reduces profits.",
        "options": [
          "(i) and (ii) are true.",
          "(i) and (iii) are true.",
          "(ii) and (iii) are true.",
          "(i), (ii), and (iii) are true."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Firms aim to maximize profit, not revenue. Reducing output or incurring higher costs can be consistent with profit maximization if MR = MC. Pursuing maximum revenue regardless of profit is not the goal."

        "answer": "C",
