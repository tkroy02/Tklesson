      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A common argument for agricultural price supports (price floors) is to ensure farmers a stable income. From a strict efficiency standpoint, a direct income subsidy to farmers is preferable to a price floor because the subsidy:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Lowers food prices for consumers.",
          "Increases total farm output.",
          "Can achieve the same income goal without creating a surplus and deadweight loss.",
          "Is easier for the government to administer."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A price floor creates a surplus (excess supply), leading to deadweight loss from overproduction and inefficient resource allocation. A direct lump-sum income transfer can increase farmers' income to the desired level without distorting the market price or quantity. This maintains production at the efficient level (where P = MC) and avoids the deadweight loss, making it more efficient while meeting the equity goal."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a per-unit tax is imposed on a good and the entire tax burden is borne by consumers, which of the following must be true?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Demand is perfectly inelastic.",
          "Supply is perfectly inelastic.",
          "Demand is more elastic than supply.",
          "Supply is perfectly elastic."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If consumers bear the entire burden, it means the price they pay rises by the full amount of the tax, and the price sellers receive does not change. For sellers' price to remain unchanged, the supply curve must be perfectly elastic (horizontal). However, for consumers to bear the *entire* burden in that case, they must also be unable to reduce quantity, implying perfectly inelastic demand. More precisely, the condition for consumers to bear the *entire* economic burden is that demand is perfectly inelastic (vertical). Quantity doesn't change, so sellers don't need to lower their price to sell the same amount; consumers absorb the full tax."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume a market is initially in equilibrium. A new technology lowers production costs, shifting the supply curve rightward. At the same time, a successful advertising campaign increases consumer preference, shifting the demand curve rightward. What is the definite effect on equilibrium quantity and price?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Quantity increases; price change is ambiguous.",
          "Price increases; quantity change is ambiguous.",
          "Quantity increases; price increases.",
          "Price decreases; quantity change is ambiguous."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A rightward supply shift increases quantity and decreases price. A rightward demand shift increases quantity and increases price. Both shifts unequivocally increase the equilibrium quantity. However, they have opposing effects on price (supply pushes it down, demand pulls it up). Therefore, the net effect on price is ambiguous and depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider a corrective (Pigovian) tax designed to internalize a negative externality from production. The efficient tax is set equal to the marginal external cost at the socially optimal quantity. If the tax is mistakenly set HIGHER than this level, the result will be:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Overproduction relative to the social optimum.",
          "Underproduction relative to the social optimum and a deadweight loss from too little production.",
          "Zero production of the good.",
          "Maximized government revenue with no efficiency loss."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A Pigovian tax shifts the private supply curve up to reflect social costs. The optimal tax aligns private MC with social MC at the optimal quantity. If the tax is too high, it shifts the supply curve too far upward, making the private cost (including tax) exceed the social cost at the optimum. This leads to a quantity lower than the social optimum, creating a deadweight loss from underproduction (forgone trades where social benefit still exceeds social cost)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A city has a fixed number of taxi medallions (licenses), creating a quota in the market for taxi rides. If the city auctions off new medallions (instead of giving them away), what is the most likely effect on the market price of a taxi ride and the number of rides provided?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Price increases; quantity increases.",
          "Price decreases; quantity increases.",
          "Price stays the same; quantity increases.",
          "Price stays the same; quantity stays the same."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The quota fixes the total quantity of taxi services (via the fixed number of medallions). Auctioning new medallions simply transfers ownership of the right to supply from the government to a new owner; it does not change the total number of medallions (the quota). Therefore, the total quantity of taxi rides supplied remains fixed by the quota. With demand unchanged, the market price will also remain unchanged. The auction affects who gets the producer surplus, not the market outcome."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a tax is imposed, the difference between the price buyers pay and the price sellers receive is:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The deadweight loss per unit.",
          "The tax revenue per unit.",
          "The total tax revenue.",
          "The marginal external cost."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The tax creates a wedge between the two prices. This vertical gap is the amount of the tax per unit sold (t). When multiplied by the quantity sold with the tax (Q_tax), it gives total tax revenue: Tax Revenue = (P_buyer - P_seller) * Q_tax."

        "question": "A binding price ceiling on gasoline is likely to cause a larger deadweight loss in the long run than in the short run because:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Demand for gasoline is more elastic in the long run.",
          "Supply of gasoline is more elastic in the long run.",
          "The government usually abandons the policy in the long run.",
          "Consumers find more substitutes in the short run."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the short run, the supply of gasoline (refining capacity, number of stations) is relatively fixed and inelastic. A price ceiling causes a shortage, but the quantity supplied doesn't drop drastically. In the long run, producers can exit the market, reduce maintenance, and avoid new investment, making supply much more elastic. This causes a larger reduction in the quantity supplied, increasing the size of the deadweight loss triangle (the area of forgone trades between the new quantity and the efficient quantity)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "Increase efficiency.",
          "Create a more desirable distribution of well-being.",
          "Eliminate all deadweight loss.",
          "Maximize government revenue."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This highlights the key trade-off between efficiency and equity. Efficiency is about maximizing the size of the economic pie (total surplus). Equity is about how the pie is sliced (distribution). A society might accept a smaller total pie (some deadweight loss) if it results in a slice considered more fair or just (e.g., progressive taxes with transfers)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Graphically, the deadweight loss from a monopoly (compared to perfect competition) exists because the monopoly:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Produces at a point where price equals marginal cost.",
          "Produces at a point where marginal revenue is less than marginal cost.",
          "Charges a price higher than marginal cost, resulting in underproduction.",
          "Has higher average costs than a competitive firm."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A monopolist restricts output to where MR = MC to maximize profit. At this quantity, the price (read from the demand curve) is greater than MC. This P > MC condition signals that the value to consumers of an additional unit exceeds the cost of producing it. The deadweight loss is the triangle of forgone consumer and producer surplus for the units between the monopoly quantity and the competitive quantity (where P = MC)."

          "A price ceiling will create a shortage.",
          "The burden of a sales tax depends on the relative elasticities of supply and demand.",
          "The government should impose a price floor on milk to help dairy farmers.",
          "A subsidy increases the equilibrium quantity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Normative statements involve value judgments, opinions, or prescriptions about what *ought* to be. They cannot be tested by data alone. Options A, B, and D are positive statements—they describe cause-and-effect relationships that can be tested and verified (or falsified). Option C expresses an opinion about a desirable policy action."
