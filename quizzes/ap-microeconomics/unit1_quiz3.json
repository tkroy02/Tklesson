        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume an economy produces only investment goods (I) and consumption goods (C). A sustained shift in production from point A (high C, low I) on the PPF to point B (low C, high I) will most likely result in:",
        "options": [
          "Immediate inward shift of the PPF due to reduced consumer demand.",
          "Long-run outward shift of the PPF as the capital stock grows.",
          "A movement from productive efficiency to allocative efficiency.",
          "No change in the PPF, as it only represents current capacity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Investment goods (capital) increase future productive capacity. By sacrificing current consumption (C) for investment (I), the economy increases its capital stock, which is a key driver of long-run economic growth, represented by an outward shift of the future PPF."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Worker A can produce 10 tables or 20 chairs in a day. Worker B can produce 8 tables or 24 chairs in a day. According to the theory of comparative advantage:",
        "options": [
          "Worker A should specialize in tables and Worker B in chairs.",
          "Worker A should specialize in chairs and Worker B in tables.",
          "Worker A has an absolute advantage in both goods, so no specialization is beneficial.",
          "They should each produce both goods to ensure variety."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Step 1: Find opportunity cost (OC). For Tables: A's OC of 1 Table = 20/10 = 2 Chairs. B's OC of 1 Table = 24/8 = 3 Chairs. A has a lower OC for Tables (2 < 3), so A has a comparative advantage in Tables. Step 2: For Chairs: A's OC of 1 Chair = 10/20 = 0.5 Tables. B's OC of 1 Chair = 8/24 ≈ 0.33 Tables. B has a lower OC for Chairs (0.33 < 0.5), so B has a comparative advantage in Chairs. Therefore, A should specialize in Tables, B in Chairs. (Note: A has an absolute advantage in both, but that does not preclude gains from trade based on comparative advantage.)"

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market economy, a sudden increase in consumer preference for electric vehicles (EVs) over gasoline cars will primarily be communicated to producers through:",
        "options": [
          "Government mandates and production quotas.",
          "A rise in the price and profitability of EVs relative to gasoline cars.",
          "Public opinion polls conducted by central planners.",
          "A decrease in the opportunity cost of producing EVs."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a market system, consumer sovereignty is exercised through 'dollar votes.' Increased demand for EVs raises their price and creates higher profit opportunities for producers. This price signal, not government directive, informs firms to reallocate resources toward EV production."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The production of national defense is nearly always undertaken by the government because it is the best example of a:",
        "options": [
          "Private good with positive externalities.",
          "Common resource that must be regulated.",
          "Public good, where the free-rider problem prevents efficient private provision.",
          "Natural monopoly due to massive economies of scale."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "National defense is non-rival (one person's protection doesn't reduce another's) and non-excludable (you can't easily exclude non-payers). These characteristics define a public good. Private markets fail to provide it efficiently because individuals can free-ride, leading to under-provision."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the marginal cost of producing a public park is $100,000 and the marginal benefit to society is $150,000, but no single citizen values it at more than $10, this illustrates:",
        "options": [
          "The law of diminishing marginal utility.",
          "A market failure requiring government provision.",
          "That the park should be provided by a profit-maximizing firm.",
          "The principle of comparative advantage."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is the classic public goods problem. The total social benefit ($150k) exceeds the cost ($100k), making provision efficient. However, because benefits are diffuse and no individual can be charged their full valuation (due to non-excludability), private firms won't provide it. This is a market failure justifying government intervention."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point inside the PPF is attainable but undesirable because it represents:",
        "options": [
          "An output mix that does not maximize consumer satisfaction (allocative inefficiency).",
          "The sacrifice of future growth for current consumption.",
          "A failure to use available resources fully (productive inefficiency).",
          "A level of output beyond the economy's sustainable capacity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Points inside the frontier signify the economy is not using all its resources (unemployment) or not using them in their most productive manner. This is the definition of productive inefficiency. While also not allocatively efficient, the primary, direct characteristic of an interior point is productive inefficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scenarios best demonstrates the concept of opportunity cost as it is rigorously defined in economics?",
        "options": [
          "A business's total revenue minus its total explicit costs.",
          "The list price of a new laptop computer.",
          "The salary a graduate forgives by spending two years in a Master's program.",
          "The combined value of all alternative uses of a resource."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is not the sum of all alternatives, nor is it just accounting costs. It is specifically the value of the single **next-best** alternative foregone when a choice is made. The forgone salary is the clearest example of this singular, marginal trade-off."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy with a traditional economic system is most likely to answer the 'HOW to produce' question based on:",
        "options": [
          "Cost-minimizing technology chosen by engineers.",
          "Customs, rituals, and methods used by previous generations.",
          "Consumer demand signals transmitted through prices.",
          "Directives from a central planning authority."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a traditional economy, economic behavior is shaped by tradition, custom, and belief. Production methods, occupations, and social roles are passed down through generations, with little change or consideration for efficiency or consumer preference."

        "question": "'A carbon tax will lead to a 15% reduction in emissions over a decade.' This statement is:",
        "options": [
          "Normative because it involves government policy.",
          "Positive because it makes a falsifiable prediction about cause and effect.",
          "Normative because it implies a reduction is desirable.",
          "Positive because the word 'will' makes it a fact."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A positive statement is an objective claim about the world that can, in principle, be tested with data. This statement predicts a specific outcome from a specific policy. Whether the reduction is 'good' or 'bad' is a separate, normative question."

        "question": "The primary purpose of constructing an economic model, such as the PPF, is to:",
        "options": [
          "Accurately depict every detail of a complex economy.",
          "Isolate and understand key relationships by simplifying reality.",
          "Advocate for a specific normative economic policy.",
          "Replace empirical data with theoretical assumptions."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Models are simplifications. They strip away non-essential details to highlight the fundamental causal relationships between variables (e.g., scarcity → trade-offs → opportunity cost). Their power lies in this abstraction, not in photographic realism."
