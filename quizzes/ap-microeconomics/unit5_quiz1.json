      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a perfectly competitive market?",
        "options": [
          "Many buyers and sellers.",
          "Firms are price takers.",
          "Products are differentiated.",
          "Free entry and exit in the long run."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, products are homogeneous (identical), not differentiated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive market, the demand curve faced by an individual firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Downward sloping.",
          "Upward sloping.",
          "Horizontal at the market price.",
          "U-shaped."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A perfectly competitive firm is a price taker; it can sell any quantity at the market price, so its demand curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue (MR) is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "Average total cost (ATC).",
          "Average variable cost (AVC).",
          "Price (P).",
          "Marginal cost (MC) at all output levels."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, MR = P because each additional unit sold adds exactly the market price to total revenue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm will maximize profit by producing the quantity where:",
        "options": [
          "Price equals average total cost.",
          "Marginal revenue equals marginal cost.",
          "Total revenue is maximized.",
          "Average variable cost is minimized."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit is maximized where MR = MC. In perfect competition, this is where P = MC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a perfectly competitive firm should shut down if:",
        "options": [
          "Price is less than average total cost.",
          "Price is less than average variable cost.",
          "Price is less than marginal cost.",
          "Total revenue is less than total fixed cost."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shutdown rule: P < AVC. If price doesn’t cover variable costs, the firm minimizes losses by shutting down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose a perfectly competitive firm is producing where P = MC and P > ATC. This firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Incurring an economic loss.",
          "Earning zero economic profit.",
          "Earning positive economic profit.",
          "Should shut down immediately."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If P > ATC at the profit-maximizing output, the firm earns economic profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market, firms earn:",
        "options": [
          "Positive economic profit.",
          "Negative economic profit.",
          "Zero economic profit (normal profit).",
          "Accounting profit only."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Free entry and exit drive economic profit to zero in the long run; firms earn only normal profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When new firms enter a perfectly competitive market in the long run, the market supply curve shifts _____, and the market price _____. ",
        "options": [
          "Right; rises",
          "Right; falls",
          "Left; rises",
          "Left; falls"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Entry increases supply (shifts right), lowering market price until economic profit is eliminated."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In long-run competitive equilibrium, which condition must hold?",
        "options": [
          "P = MR = MC > ATC",
          "P = MR = MC = ATC",
          "P = MR < MC = ATC",
          "P = MR > MC = AVC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Long-run equilibrium requires P = MR = MC = ATC at the minimum of ATC (zero economic profit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes allocative efficiency in perfect competition?",
        "options": [
          "Producing at the minimum of ATC.",
          "Producing where P = MC.",
          "Producing where MR = MC.",
          "Producing where ATC is falling."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency occurs where P = MC, meaning resources are allocated to produce the quantity where marginal benefit equals marginal cost."
