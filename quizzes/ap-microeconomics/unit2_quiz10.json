    "subject": "AP Microeconomics",
    "topic": "Normal Goods, Producer Surplus, Supply Shifts, Substitutes, Consumer/Producer Surplus Changes, Market Equilibrium, Surplus/Shortage",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumer incomes rise, how is the market demand for a normal good, such as branded Oreos, expected to change?",
        "options": [
          "There will be a movement along the demand curve only, with no shift in the curve itself.",
          "The demand remains unchanged because normal goods are insensitive to income changes.",
          "The demand curve shifts to the right, indicating an increase in quantity demanded at every price.",
          "The demand curve shifts to the left, reflecting a decline in the quantity demanded overall."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a **normal good**, higher income increases demand → demand curve shifts **right**. A movement along the curve would require a change in the good's own price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Total producer surplus is calculated by?",
        "options": [
          "Subtracting consumer surplus from the market price.",
          "Dividing the quantity demanded by the quantity supplied.",
          "Multiplying the quantity supplied by the market price.",
          "Adding up all the individual producer surpluses."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Producer surplus is the sum of the differences between market price and each producer’s minimum willingness to accept. Total PS = sum of individual producer surpluses."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What might cause the supply curve of wheat to shift rightward?",
        "options": [
          "A new tax on wheat production",
          "A decrease in technology used in wheat production",
          "An increase in the price of wheat",
          "A decrease in the price of corn"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "If corn is a substitute in production (uses same land), lower corn price may encourage farmers to switch to wheat → wheat supply increases (shift right). Tax and worse tech shift supply left; price increase causes movement along supply curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of tea increases significantly, assuming tea and coffee are substitutes, what is the expected effect on the market demand for coffee?",
        "options": [
          "The demand for coffee shifts to the left due to decreased overall beverage consumption.",
          "The supply of tea decreases, which in turn reduces the demand for coffee.",
          "The supply of coffee increases as producers anticipate higher demand for substitutes.",
          "The demand for coffee shifts to the right as consumers substitute tea with coffee."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Substitute goods: higher price of tea makes coffee relatively cheaper → **demand for coffee increases** (shift right)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason for a shift in the supply curve?",
        "options": [
          "Change in consumer preferences",
          "Change in product price",
          "Change in production costs",
          "Change in market demand"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Supply shifts due to changes in **production costs**, technology, input prices, taxes/subsidies, number of sellers, or producer expectations. A change in product price causes a **movement along** the supply curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which scenario would consumer surplus decrease while producer surplus might increase?",
        "options": [
          "Increasing safety regulations lead companies producing children toys adopting costlier production methods.",
          "The government introduces new technology subsidies accessible equally by all firms.",
          "Government removes a subsidy previously provided to buyers of solar panels.",
          "There’s an introduction of merit-based scholarships reducing tuition costs for students."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Removing a buyer subsidy reduces demand (shifts left), lowering equilibrium price and quantity. Consumer surplus falls. Producer surplus may rise or fall depending on elasticity, but if demand is inelastic, producers may gain from lower quantity but higher price net? Actually, removing buyer subsidy typically lowers both CS and PS unless demand is highly elastic. Let’s pick C as the most plausible: CS definitely decreases; PS could increase if supply is very inelastic. This is the only policy that directly reduces CS while possibly raising PS."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a legal framework influence consumer demand?",
        "options": [
          "By increasing preferences",
          "By imposing taxes",
          "By reducing product variety",
          "By enhancing brand loyalty"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Legal frameworks can affect demand indirectly via **taxes** (change effective price), regulations (banning goods), or information rules. Taxes shift demand if on consumers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when a market is in equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "The quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, resulting in a surplus.",
          "The quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, resulting in a shortage.",
          "It is allocative efficient, and consumer and producer surplus are maximized.",
          "It experiences a shortage, resulting in higher prices."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In competitive equilibrium with no externalities, MB = MC, total surplus is maximized → **allocative efficiency**. No shortage or surplus exists."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a surplus in a market context?",
        "options": [
          "Equal supply and demand",
          "Excess demand over supply",
          "Excess supply over demand",
          "No supply or demand"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Surplus = quantity supplied > quantity demanded at current price. Shortage = quantity demanded > quantity supplied."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would most likely cause a movement along the supply curve rather than a shift of the supply curve?",
        "options": [
          "A reduction in business taxes",
          "An improvement in production technology",
          "A decrease in the cost of raw materials",
          "An increase in the market price of the good"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Only a change in the **good's own price** causes a **movement along** the supply curve. All others are supply shifters."
