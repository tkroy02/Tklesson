    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm is currently producing where ATC is minimized. If market demand increases, what happens to the firm’s output in the short run and long run?",
        "options": [
          "Short run: increases; long run: returns to original.",
          "Short run: unchanged; long run: increases.",
          "Short run: increases; long run: increases further.",
          "Short run: decreases; long run: increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In short run, higher P leads firm to increase output along MC. In long run, entry drives price back to min ATC, so firm returns to original output at minimum ATC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume a perfectly competitive firm’s MC curve is linear and upward sloping. At the profit-maximizing output, if AVC = \\$10 and ATC = \\$15, and market price is \\$12, what should the firm do in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Shut down immediately.",
          "Produce and earn economic profit.",
          "Produce and incur a loss but continue operating.",
          "Increase output until P = ATC."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "P = \\$12, AVC = \\$10 → P > AVC, so produce. P < ATC (\\$15) → incur loss, but continue in short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive constant-cost industry, a lump-sum tax on firms will cause the long-run market price to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase by the amount of the tax.",
          "Decrease by the amount of the tax.",
          "Remain unchanged.",
          "Increase, but by less than the tax."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lump-sum tax increases ATC but not MC. In constant-cost industry, exit shifts supply left until price rises to new min ATC, which is higher by exactly the per-unit equivalent of the tax (spread over output)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a technological innovation reduces only fixed costs in a perfectly competitive industry, what happens in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "Market price falls, output increases.",
          "Market price unchanged, output unchanged.",
          "Market price rises, output decreases.",
          "Firms earn permanent economic profit."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Only fixed costs fall → ATC shifts down but MC unchanged. In long run, price determined by MC (unchanged), so market price and output unchanged; firms still earn zero economic profit."
      },
{
  "type": "multiple_response",
  "question": "Which two of the following are true in both short-run and long-run profit maximization for a perfectly competitive firm?",
  "options": [
    "P = ATC",
    "P = MC",
    "P = MR",
    "MC = ATC"
  ],
  "answer": ["B", "C"],
  "explanation": "P = MC is the profit-maximizing condition in both short-run and long-run. P = MR is always true in perfect competition (firms are price takers). P = ATC is only true in long-run equilibrium; MC = ATC only at the minimum of ATC."
},
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive market, if government sets a price floor above equilibrium, what is the result in terms of efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "Deadweight loss from underproduction.",
          "Deadweight loss from overproduction.",
          "No deadweight loss, only transfers.",
          "Increase in both consumer and producer surplus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Binding price floor reduces quantity demanded, causing underproduction (Q < equilibrium), leading to deadweight loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the market demand curve for a perfectly competitive industry becomes more inelastic, what happens to the short-run supply curve of the industry?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes more elastic.",
          "It becomes less elastic.",
          "It shifts leftward.",
          "It is unaffected."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Industry supply curve depends on firms’ MC curves, not elasticity of demand. Demand elasticity affects price volatility but not supply curve shape/position in short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm has TC = 100 + 5Q². What is its supply function (assuming it produces in short run)?",
        "options": [
          "P = 5Q",
          "P = 10Q",
          "P = 5Q for P ≥ 10",
          "P = 10Q for P ≥ 0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MC = dTC/dQ = 10Q. Supply is P = MC for P ≥ min AVC. AVC = 5Q, min AVC = 0 at Q=0, so supply is P = 10Q."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a perfectly competitive market is in long-run equilibrium, an increase in consumer preference for the product will initially cause:",
        "options": [
          "Market price to rise and firms to earn economic profit.",
          "Market price to fall and firms to incur losses.",
          "Firms to exit the market.",
          "No change in price or output."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased preference raises demand, increasing price in short run. At higher price, firms earn economic profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following policies in a perfectly competitive market would definitely reduce total surplus?",
        "options": [
          "A per-unit subsidy equal to the external benefit.",
          "A price ceiling set below equilibrium.",
          "A lump-sum tax on producers.",
          "A price floor set below equilibrium."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Binding price ceiling below equilibrium reduces quantity traded, creating deadweight loss and reducing total surplus. Price floor below equilibrium is non-binding."
