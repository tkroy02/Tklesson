    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a per-unit tax is imposed on sellers in a competitive market, the supply curve shifts:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Upward by the amount of the tax",
          "Downward by the amount of the tax",
          "Upward by more than the amount of the tax",
          "It does not shift; demand shifts instead"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A tax on sellers increases their cost of production. To maintain the same profit margin per unit, they require a higher price for each quantity, shifting the supply curve vertically upward by the exact amount of the tax."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a tax is levied on a good where demand is perfectly elastic, the economic burden of the tax falls entirely on:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Consumers",
          "Producers",
          "Equally on consumers and producers",
          "The government"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With perfectly elastic demand (horizontal demand curve), consumers are extremely sensitive to price. If the price they pay rises at all, they buy zero. Therefore, sellers cannot pass any of the tax to consumers via higher prices and must absorb the entire cost, lowering the price they receive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A binding price ceiling in the rental market is likely to lead to all of the following EXCEPT:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A shortage of rental housing",
          "The development of a black market",
          "Increased investment in new rental construction",
          "Non-price rationing methods (e.g., waiting lists)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling below equilibrium reduces the price landlords receive, decreasing their incentive and ability to maintain existing properties or build new ones. Investment in new rental construction would decrease, not increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The area representing the deadweight loss from a tax on a graph is a triangle whose base is:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The amount of the tax per unit",
          "The change in equilibrium price",
          "The reduction in quantity traded caused by the tax",
          "The total tax revenue collected"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The deadweight loss triangle is between the supply and demand curves. Its base is the difference between the original equilibrium quantity and the new, lower quantity traded after the tax is imposed. Its height is the difference between the marginal benefit and marginal cost at the new quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cost-benefit analysis suggests that a government should undertake a public project if:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The total benefits to those who gain exceed the total costs to those who lose.",
          "The project can be funded without raising taxes.",
          "The benefits are received by a majority of voters.",
          "The project increases consumer surplus, regardless of producer surplus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The goal of cost-benefit analysis is economic efficiency. A project should be undertaken if the overall increase in social welfare (total benefits) exceeds the total social costs, meaning it represents a potential Pareto improvement where gainers could, in theory, compensate the losers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government imposes a tax where the statutory incidence (who is legally responsible to pay) is on sellers, but the economic incidence (who actually bears the burden) is mostly on buyers, we can infer that:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Demand is more inelastic than supply.",
          "Supply is more inelastic than demand.",
          "Demand and supply have equal elasticities.",
          "The tax is very small."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Economic incidence depends on relative elasticity. If buyers bear most of the burden, it means they are less responsive to price changes (more inelastic) than sellers. They cannot easily reduce quantity demanded when the price rises, so they end up paying most of the tax."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comparing two markets, the deadweight loss from an identical per-unit tax will be LARGER in the market where:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Both supply and demand are relatively inelastic.",
          "Both supply and demand are relatively elastic.",
          "Supply is elastic, but demand is perfectly inelastic.",
          "The initial equilibrium price is very high."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss arises from the reduction in quantity traded. The more elastic (responsive) supply and demand are, the more the quantity will fall in response to the tax-driven price change. A larger reduction in quantity means a larger area of forgone mutually beneficial trades (deadweight loss)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A government sets a price floor for an agricultural product. To maintain this floor without creating a surplus, the government would most likely need to:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Subsidize consumer purchases",
          "Purchase and store or destroy the excess supply itself",
          "Impose quotas on production",
          "Tax producers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A binding price floor creates a surplus (Q supplied > Q demanded). To avoid this surplus while keeping the price high, the government can restrict the quantity supplied through production quotas. This shifts the supply curve leftward, raising the equilibrium price to the floor level without a surplus. Simply buying the surplus (option B) is a different method to maintain the floor *with* a surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From an efficiency standpoint, a lump-sum tax (a fixed amount regardless of actions) is preferable to an excise tax (per-unit tax) on a good because:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It raises more revenue for the government.",
          "It is easier for consumers to understand.",
          "It does not distort the market price or create a deadweight loss.",
          "It is always more progressive."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A lump-sum tax is a fixed cost that does not change with the quantity of a good produced or consumed. Therefore, it does not alter the marginal decision of firms (MC) or consumers (MB), so the market equilibrium (where MB=MC) remains unchanged. This results in no deadweight loss, unlike an excise tax which drives a wedge between price paid and price received."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary reason economists generally view rent control (a price ceiling) as an inefficient long-term policy is that it:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Transfers surplus from landlords to tenants.",
          "Leads to a shortage and reduces the quantity and quality of housing available over time.",
          "Increases government administrative costs.",
          "Causes temporary inconvenience but fixes itself in the long run."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While rent control transfers surplus in the short run, its major inefficiency is dynamic: the persistent shortage discourages maintenance and new construction, leading to a deteriorating and shrinking housing stock. This reduction in the quantity and quality of housing creates a large and growing deadweight loss."
