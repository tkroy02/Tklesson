      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the relationship between inflation and unemployment",
          "the distribution of income or wealth in an economy",
          "the production possibilities of two goods",
          "market supply and demand for labor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentage of total income earned by cumulative percentages of the population, showing income distribution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a Lorenz curve moves farther away from the line of perfect equality, this indicates",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "income inequality has decreased",
          "income inequality has increased",
          "average income has risen",
          "the poverty rate has fallen"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The line of perfect equality is a 45‑degree line. The farther the Lorenz curve bows away from it, the greater the income inequality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Gini coefficient is calculated as",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality / total area below the line of perfect equality",
          "area below the Lorenz curve / total area below the line of perfect equality",
          "difference between the richest and poorest quintiles’ income shares",
          "ratio of the top 10%’s income to the bottom 10%’s income"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gini coefficient = Area between Lorenz curve and 45‑degree line (A) divided by total area under 45‑degree line (A + B). It ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Gini coefficient of 0.40 suggests",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "perfect income equality",
          "moderate income inequality",
          "extreme income inequality",
          "negative income distribution"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gini coefficient ranges: 0 = perfect equality, 1 = perfect inequality. A value of 0.40 indicates moderate inequality (typical for many developed countries)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following government policies is most directly aimed at reducing income inequality?",

          "Tariffs on imported goods",
          "Progressive income taxes and transfer payments",
          "Subsidies for agricultural exports",
          "Deregulation of industries"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Progressive taxes (higher rates on higher incomes) and transfer payments (e.g., welfare, unemployment benefits) redistribute income and reduce inequality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The poverty line is typically defined as",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the average income of the bottom 20% of households",
          "an absolute income level below which a family is considered poor",
          "the income level of the median household",
          "the point where the Lorenz curve intersects the 45‑degree line"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The poverty line is an absolute threshold (often based on the cost of a minimal standard of living) below which individuals or families are classified as in poverty."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would most likely reduce measured income inequality?",

        "options": [
          "An increase in inheritance taxes on large estates",
          "A shift from progressive to regressive taxation",
          "A decrease in the minimum wage",
          "A reduction in need‑based college scholarships"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher inheritance taxes on large estates reduce the intergenerational transfer of wealth, which can lessen wealth and income inequality over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the bottom 20% of households earn 5% of total income and the top 20% earn 45%, the Lorenz curve will",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "be a straight 45‑degree line",
          "bow significantly away from the line of perfect equality",
          "lie above the line of perfect equality",
          "be horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the bottom quintile earns a small share (5%) and the top quintile earns a large share (45%), income is concentrated at the top, causing the Lorenz curve to bow away from the 45‑degree line."

          "provide cash payments to all citizens regardless of income",
          "subsidize wages for low‑income workers only",
          "increase taxes on capital gains",
          "offer free public college to low‑income families"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "UBI provides a fixed, unconditional cash transfer to every individual, often proposed to reduce poverty and inequality."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of using the Gini coefficient to compare inequality across countries?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It does not account for differences in cost of living or purchasing power.",
          "It cannot be calculated if the Lorenz curve is unknown.",
          "It always overstates inequality in developed nations.",
          "It measures wealth but not income inequality."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Gini coefficient is based on nominal income or consumption, not adjusted for cost‑of‑living differences. It also does not capture non‑monetary benefits, wealth distribution, or social mobility."
