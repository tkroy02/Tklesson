      {

        "question": "A public good is characterized by being",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "rival and excludable",
          "nonrival and excludable",
          "rival and nonexcludable",
          "nonrival and nonexcludable"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Public goods are both nonrival (one person's consumption does not reduce availability for others) and nonexcludable (impossible or costly to prevent non‑payers from consuming)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The free‑rider problem arises because",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "people can benefit from a public good without paying for it",
          "private firms charge too much for excludable goods",
          "resources are overused in common‑pool situations",
          "the government imposes taxes on private goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The free‑rider problem occurs with public goods: individuals have no incentive to pay for a good they can consume anyway, leading to under‑provision by the market."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the best example of a public good?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A toll road",
          "National defense",
          "A public park with an entrance fee",
          "A private swimming pool"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "National defense is both nonrival (protecting one citizen does not reduce protection for others) and nonexcludable (all citizens are protected regardless of payment)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A common resource is characterized by being",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "rival and excludable",
          "nonrival and excludable",
          "rival and nonexcludable",
          "nonrival and nonexcludable"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Common resources are rival (one person's use reduces availability for others) but nonexcludable (difficult to prevent access), leading to overuse."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'tragedy of the commons' refers to",

        "options": [
          "under‑provision of public goods due to free‑riding",
          "overuse of a common resource because individuals ignore the social cost of their use",
          "government failure to provide private goods efficiently",
          "monopoly power in natural resource markets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tragedy of the commons: individuals acting in self‑interest deplete or degrade a shared resource because they do not bear the full social cost of their consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a common resource?",

          "A lighthouse",
          "Clean air",
          "A movie theater",
          "A patented drug"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Clean air is rival (pollution by one reduces air quality for others) and nonexcludable (hard to prevent anyone from breathing it), making it a common resource."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "rival and nonexcludable",
          "nonrival and nonexcludable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Private goods are both rival and excludable — typical market goods like food, clothing, or electronics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which market failure is most directly addressed by the government providing the good itself?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Negative externality",
          "Positive externality",
          "Public good",
          "Common resource"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Because of the free‑rider problem, private markets under‑provide public goods. Government often provides them directly (e.g., national defense, public parks) and funds them through taxation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "nonrival and nonexcludable"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Club goods (or artificially scarce goods) are nonrival but excludable (e.g., cable TV, streaming services, toll roads with low congestion)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To prevent overuse of a common resource like a fishery, the government could",

          "subsidize fishing equipment",
          "assign tradable pollution permits",
          "establish individual transferable quotas (ITQs)",
          "provide the fish free of charge"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) set a total allowable catch, allocate shares to fishers, and allow trading. This internalizes the externality and reduces overfishing."
