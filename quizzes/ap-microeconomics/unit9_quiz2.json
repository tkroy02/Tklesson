    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a competitive market with no externalities, market equilibrium maximizes",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "consumer surplus only",
          "producer surplus only",
          "total surplus (consumer + producer surplus)",
          "government revenue"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The invisible hand of a competitive market leads to an equilibrium where the sum of consumer and producer surplus (total surplus) is maximized. This is the point of allocative efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government imposes an effective price ceiling below the equilibrium price, what happens to total surplus?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Total surplus increases",
          "Total surplus decreases",
          "Total surplus remains the same",
          "Consumer surplus increases but producer surplus decreases by the same amount"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding price ceiling creates a shortage and moves the quantity traded away from the efficient equilibrium. This reduces the total gains from trade, creating a deadweight loss and decreasing total surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The deadweight loss from a tax is caused by",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the transfer of money from consumers and producers to the government",
          "the reduction in the quantity of the good bought and sold compared to the efficient market quantity",
          "the administrative cost of collecting the tax",
          "the fact that sellers receive a lower price than buyers pay"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A tax raises the price buyers pay and lowers the price sellers receive, reducing the quantity traded. The deadweight loss is the loss of total surplus from the transactions that no longer occur, even though their value (to buyers) exceeded their cost (to sellers)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Who bears more of the burden of a per-unit tax when demand is relatively inelastic and supply is relatively elastic?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Buyers bear most of the burden",
          "Sellers bear most of the burden",
          "The burden is split equally",
          "The government bears the burden"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tax incidence depends on relative price elasticity. The side of the market that is less elastic (less responsive to price changes) bears a larger share of the tax burden. If demand is inelastic, buyers cannot easily reduce quantity, so they bear most of the burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cost-benefit analysis of a proposed price floor would conclude the policy is inefficient if:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The increase in producer surplus is greater than the loss in consumer surplus.",
          "The resulting deadweight loss is positive.",
          "The government collects revenue from the policy.",
          "Consumers are made better off."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An efficient policy maximizes total surplus with no deadweight loss. A price floor above equilibrium creates a surplus (e.g., unsold goods, unemployment) and reduces the quantity traded below the efficient level, resulting in a deadweight loss, which indicates inefficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a standard supply and demand diagram, consumer surplus is the area",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Below the demand curve and above the equilibrium price",
          "Above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price",
          "Between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity",
          "Below the supply curve and above the horizontal axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay (shown by the demand curve) and what they actually pay (the market price). Graphically, it's the area below the demand curve and above the market price, up to the quantity sold."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a market is producing at a quantity where the marginal cost to producers is less than the marginal benefit to consumers,",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Total surplus could be increased by producing more.",
          "Total surplus could be increased by producing less.",
          "The market is already efficient.",
          "Producer surplus is negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If MB > MC at the current quantity, the value of an additional unit to buyers exceeds the cost to sellers. Producing and consuming more of that unit would increase total surplus, indicating the market is currently underproducing relative to the efficient point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary economic justification for a government subsidy on a good is to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Increase producer surplus at the expense of consumer surplus",
          "Correct for a market outcome where marginal social benefit exceeds marginal social cost",
          "Raise government revenue to fund public projects",
          "Reduce the quantity of the good consumed"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Subsidies are often used to correct positive externalities or encourage consumption/production of goods where the social benefit exceeds the private benefit (MSB > MSC). The subsidy shifts the market outcome toward the socially optimal, higher quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a consequence of a binding price floor, like a minimum wage set above the equilibrium wage?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A shortage of labor",
          "A decrease in unemployment",
          "An increase in the quantity of labor demanded",
          "A surplus of labor (unemployment)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A binding price floor sets a price (wage) above equilibrium. At this higher price, the quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, resulting in a surplus—in this case, unemployment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Evaluating a tariff (a tax on imports) using the concepts of consumer and producer surplus shows that, for the importing country:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Domestic producer surplus increases, consumer surplus decreases, and a deadweight loss is created.",
          "Both domestic producer and consumer surplus increase.",
          "Government revenue is the only effect; there is no change in total surplus.",
          "The tariff always increases total domestic surplus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A tariff raises the domestic price. This increases producer surplus for domestic sellers, decreases consumer surplus for domestic buyers, and generates government revenue. However, the loss to consumers is greater than the combined gains to producers and government, resulting in a net deadweight loss for the importing country."
