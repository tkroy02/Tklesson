    "subject": "AP Microeconomics",
    "topic": "Production Function, Marginal Product, Law of Diminishing Returns, Fixed/Variable Costs, Short‑Run Cost Curves, Economies of Scale",
    "duration": 45,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The law of diminishing marginal returns applies in:",
        "options": [
          "The long run when all inputs are variable",
          "The short run when at least one input is fixed",
          "Both the short run and the long run",
          "Neither the short run nor the long run"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The **law of diminishing marginal returns** occurs in the **short run** when at least one input (e.g., capital) is fixed, and adding more variable inputs eventually yields smaller increases in output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a fixed cost for a bakery in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Flour",
          "Hourly wages for bakers",
          "Electricity for ovens",
          "Monthly rent for the bakery space"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Fixed costs do not vary with output level. **Rent** is typically fixed in the short run. Flour, wages, and electricity are variable costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If marginal cost is below average total cost, average total cost must be:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing",
          "Decreasing",
          "Constant",
          "At its minimum"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When MC < ATC, the additional unit costs less than the average → pulls the average down. Therefore, **ATC is decreasing**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The production function shows:",
        "options": [
          "The relationship between total cost and output",
          "The maximum output attainable from given inputs",
          "The price at which a firm sells its output",
          "The profit‑maximizing level of production"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The **production function** shows the **maximum output** that can be produced from a given combination of inputs (technology held constant)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm’s total variable cost is \\$400 when producing 50 units and \\$600 when producing 75 units, what is the marginal cost of the 51st through 75th units?",
        "options": [
          "\\$8 per unit",
          "\\$10 per unit",
          "\\$12 per unit",
          "\\$16 per unit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Marginal cost = ∆TVC / ∆Q = (600 – 400) / (75 – 50) = 200 / 25 = **\\$8 per unit**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When marginal product is increasing, marginal cost is:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing",
          "Decreasing",
          "Constant",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increasing marginal product means each additional variable input yields more output → cost per additional unit (MC) **decreases**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run, all costs are:",
        "options": [
          "Fixed",
          "Variable",
          "Sunk",
          "Marginal"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the **long run**, firms can adjust all inputs; there are **no fixed costs** — all costs are variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm experiences economies of scale, its long‑run average total cost curve is:",
        "options": [
          "Upward‑sloping",
          "Downward‑sloping",
          "Horizontal",
          "U‑shaped"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Economies of scale** → increasing returns to scale → long‑run average total cost **decreases** as output increases (downward‑sloping LRATC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the relationship between average fixed cost (AFC) and output?",
        "options": [
          "AFC increases as output increases",
          "AFC decreases as output increases",
          "AFC is constant regardless of output",
          "AFC is U‑shaped"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AFC = TFC / Q. Total fixed cost is constant, so as Q rises, **AFC always falls** (hyperbolic decline)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm’s average variable cost is \\$10 at 20 units and \\$9 at 30 units, what can be inferred about marginal cost in this output range?",
        "options": [
          "MC > AVC",
          "MC < AVC",
          "MC = AVC",
          "MC is constant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AVC falls from \\$10 to \\$9 as output rises. When AVC is falling, **MC < AVC** (marginal cost pulls the average down)."
