      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a pure monopoly?",
        "options": [
          "Many sellers.",
          "Price taker.",
          "Homogeneous product.",
          "Significant barriers to entry.",
          "Perfectly elastic demand."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A pure monopoly exists when one firm is the sole seller of a product with no close substitutes, protected by barriers to entry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopolist, the relationship between price (P) and marginal revenue (MR) is:",
        "options": [
          "P = MR at all output levels.",
          "P > MR at all output levels.",
          "P < MR at all output levels.",
          "P = MR only at the profit-maximizing output.",
          "P and MR are unrelated."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Because a monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve, to sell more it must lower price on all units, so MR < P for every unit beyond the first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist maximizes profit by producing where:",
        "options": [
          "MR = MC.",
          "P = MC.",
          "P = ATC.",
          "MR = AVC.",
          "TR is maximized."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like all profit-maximizing firms, a monopoly produces where MR = MC. Unlike perfect competition, P > MR at that output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist is producing where MR > MC, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase price.",
          "Decrease price and increase output.",
          "Increase output.",
          "Decrease output.",
          "Shut down."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If MR > MC, each additional unit adds more to revenue than to cost, so increasing output increases profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist’s demand curve is:",
        "options": [
          "The same as its marginal revenue curve.",
          "The same as the market demand curve.",
          "Perfectly elastic.",
          "Horizontal at the market price.",
          "Below the marginal revenue curve."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Since the monopolist is the only seller, its demand curve is the market demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist is earning positive economic profit, in the long run:",
        "options": [
          "New firms will enter and compete away the profit.",
          "The government will regulate price.",
          "The monopolist will lower price voluntarily.",
          "Profit may persist due to barriers to entry.",
          "The monopolist will increase output to minimize cost."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Barriers to entry prevent new firms from entering, allowing monopoly profit to persist in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a monopolist, marginal revenue is less than price because:",
        "options": [
          "The firm is a price taker.",
          "To sell more, the firm must lower the price on all units sold.",
          "The demand curve is perfectly elastic.",
          "The firm faces constant returns to scale.",
          "Marginal cost is rising."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lowering price to sell an extra unit reduces revenue on all previous units, so MR < P."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist will never produce in the:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic portion of its demand curve.",
          "Inelastic portion of its demand curve.",
          "Region where MR is positive.",
          "Region where MC is rising.",
          "Short run."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A monopolist maximizes profit where MR = MC. MR is positive only when demand is elastic (|Ed| > 1), so it never produces where demand is inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist’s marginal cost is zero, it will maximize profit by producing where:",
        "options": [
          "MR = 0.",
          "P = 0.",
          "ATC is minimized.",
          "Demand is unit elastic.",
          "TR is maximized."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With MC = 0, profit max occurs where MR = 0, which is where total revenue is maximized (the top of the TR curve)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a perfectly competitive market, a monopoly results in:",
        "options": [
          "Lower price and higher output.",
          "Higher price and higher output.",
          "Lower price and lower output.",
          "Higher price and lower output.",
          "The same price and output."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A monopoly restricts output to raise price above competitive levels, reducing consumer surplus and creating deadweight loss."
