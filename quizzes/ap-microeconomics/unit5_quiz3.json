      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive market graph, if P > ATC at the profit-maximizing output, the firm’s economic profit is represented by:",
        "options": [
          "The area between ATC and AVC up to Q*.",
          "The area between P and ATC over the quantity produced.",
          "The area under the MC curve up to Q*.",
          "The area between P and AVC over the quantity produced."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic profit per unit = P – ATC. Total profit = (P – ATC) × Q*, which is a rectangle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm has the following cost data: at Q=10, MC = \\$8, ATC = \\$12, AVC = \\$6. If market price is \\$8, what should the firm do in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "Produce 10 units and earn economic profit.",
          "Produce where MR = MC and earn zero profit.",
          "Produce 10 units and incur a loss but continue operating.",
          "Shut down immediately."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "P = MC = \\$8 at Q=10. P > AVC (\\$6), so firm should produce and incur loss = (ATC – P) × Q = (\\$12 – \\$8) × 10 = \\$40 loss, but it covers variable costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a perfectly competitive firm is producing where P = MC and P < ATC but P > AVC, the firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximizing profit and should shut down.",
          "Maximizing profit and should continue operating in the short run.",
          "Not maximizing profit; should increase output.",
          "Not maximizing profit; should decrease output."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit max occurs at P = MC. If P < ATC but > AVC, firm incurs loss but continues operating in short run to cover variable costs."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive market, the long-run industry supply curve will be horizontal if:",
        "options": [
          "Input prices rise as industry expands.",
          "Input prices fall as industry expands.",
          "Input prices remain constant as industry expands.",
          "Firms have identical cost structures."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Constant-cost industry: input prices don’t change with industry output, so long-run supply is perfectly elastic (horizontal)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm has TC = 50 + 4Q + 0.5Q². What is its ATC when Q = 10?",
        "options": [
          "\\$9",
          "\\$10",
          "\\$11",
          "\\$14"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "TC = 50 + 4(10) + 0.5(100) = 50 + 40 + 50 = 140. ATC = TC/Q = 140/10 = \\$14? Wait — check: 140/10 = 14, but that’s not an option. Let’s recompute: 0.5Q² = 0.5×100 = 50. 50+40+50 = 140. 140/10 = 14. Options: 9,10,11,14 → answer is \\$14. That is option D."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If market demand increases in a constant-cost perfectly competitive industry, long-run equilibrium will feature:",
        "options": [
          "Higher price and more firms.",
          "Same price and more firms.",
          "Lower price and fewer firms.",
          "Same price and fewer firms."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a constant-cost industry, long-run supply is horizontal. Increased demand raises price short run, attracting entry until price returns to original min ATC — same price, more firms."

          "5",
          "10",
          "15",
          "20"

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Set P = MC: 30 = 3Q → Q = 10."

        "options": [
          "Market demand will increase.",
          "Firm’s ATC curve will shift down.",
          "New firms enter, market supply increases, price falls.",
          "Existing firms expand output, lowering MC."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Economic profit attracts entry, increasing market supply and lowering price until profit returns to zero."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a per-unit tax is imposed on firms in a perfectly competitive market, in the long run in a constant-cost industry:",
        "options": [
          "Firms will all exit the market.",
          "Price will rise by the full amount of the tax.",
          "Firms will bear the entire tax burden.",
          "Market output will remain unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In constant-cost industry, long-run supply is horizontal, so a per-unit tax shifts supply up by tax amount, raising market price by full tax; zero profit is restored."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm’s total cost function is TC = 100 + Q². If market price is \\$20, what is the firm’s short-run profit-maximizing output?",

          "5",
          "10",
          "15",
