    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student must choose between studying for an economics exam or working a part-time job that pays $15 per hour. If the student chooses to study for 4 hours, what is the opportunity cost of this decision?",
        "options": [
          "The knowledge gained from studying",
          "$60 in forgone wages",
          "The time spent studying",
          "The grade received on the exam"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Opportunity cost** is the value of the next-best alternative forgone. By choosing to study instead of work, the student gives up $15/hour × 4 hours = **$60 in wages**. This monetary value represents what was sacrificed. The other options represent benefits received or inputs used, not the economic cost of the choice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy is currently producing at a point inside its production possibilities frontier (PPF). Which of the following would move the economy TO a point ON the PPF?",
        "options": [
          "Discovering new natural resources",
          "Increasing the labor force through immigration",
          "Reducing unemployment and utilizing idle resources",
          "Investing in new technology and capital equipment"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A point **inside** the PPF represents **productive inefficiency**—resources are unemployed or misallocated. Moving **to** the frontier requires using existing resources more fully, such as by **reducing unemployment**. Options A, B, and D increase the economy's *potential* output, causing an **outward shift** of the entire PPF, not a movement along it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing opportunity cost as shown by a bowed-out (concave) PPF?",
        "options": [
          "As more of one good is produced, smaller amounts of the other good must be sacrificed",
          "Resources are perfectly adaptable between the production of both goods",
          "As more of one good is produced, increasingly larger amounts of the other good must be sacrificed",
          "The opportunity cost remains constant regardless of the mix of goods produced"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A **bowed-out (concave) PPF** reflects the **law of increasing opportunity cost**. Resources are not equally productive in all uses. As production of Good X increases, you must use resources that are progressively worse at making X and better at making Y. This means you give up **larger and larger amounts of Y** for each additional unit of X."

        "question": "Country A can produce either 100 units of wheat or 50 units of cloth. Country B can produce either 80 units of wheat or 80 units of cloth. Which statement is correct regarding comparative advantage?",
        "options": [
          "Country A has a comparative advantage in both wheat and cloth",
          "Country A has a comparative advantage in wheat; Country B has a comparative advantage in cloth",
          "Country B has a comparative advantage in both wheat and cloth",
          "Neither country has a comparative advantage in either good"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Comparative advantage** is determined by lower opportunity cost. For A: 1 wheat = 0.5 cloth; 1 cloth = 2 wheat. For B: 1 wheat = 1 cloth; 1 cloth = 1 wheat. A gives up less cloth per wheat (0.5 < 1), so A has CA in **wheat**. B gives up less wheat per cloth (1 < 2), so B has CA in **cloth**."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm is deciding whether to hire an additional worker. The worker would add $500 in revenue but would cost $400 in wages and benefits. Using marginal analysis, what should the firm do?",
        "options": [
          "Not hire the worker because total costs would increase",
          "Hire the worker because marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost",
          "Not hire the worker because average revenue would decrease",
          "Hire the worker only if total revenue doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Marginal analysis** dictates: proceed if Marginal Benefit (MB) ≥ Marginal Cost (MC). Here, MB = $500, MC = $400. Since MB > MC, hiring adds $100 to profit. The firm should hire the worker. Rational decision-making occurs at the margin."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of capital as a factor of production?",
        "options": [
          "A forest used for timber harvesting",
          "A software engineer's programming skills",
          "A delivery truck used by a shipping company",
          "An entrepreneur's innovative business idea"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In economics, **capital** (or physical capital) refers to human-made goods used to produce other goods and services. The delivery truck is a tool for production. Option A is **land** (natural resource). B is **labor/human capital** (skills). D is **entrepreneurship**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy produces only two goods: computers and textbooks. If the economy moves from producing 100 computers and 500 textbooks to producing 120 computers and 400 textbooks, what is the opportunity cost of the additional 20 computers?",
        "options": [
          "20 computers",
          "100 textbooks",
          "120 computers",
          "400 textbooks"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost is what is given up. To gain 20 computers (from 100 to 120), the economy sacrifices 100 textbooks (from 500 to 400). Therefore, the **opportunity cost of 20 computers is 100 textbooks**. This is the trade-off along the PPF."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause an outward shift of an economy's production possibilities frontier?",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in unemployment",
          "An improvement in technology",
          "A reallocation of resources from one industry to another",
          "An increase in consumer demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An **outward shift** represents economic growth—an increase in productive capacity. This is caused by an increase in resources or an improvement in **technology**. (A) moves from inside to on the curve. (C) is movement along the curve. (D) affects which point is chosen on the curve, not the curve itself."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a market economy, the three fundamental economic questions (What? How? For whom?) are primarily answered by:",
        "options": [
          "Government planning agencies",
          "Traditional customs and cultural norms",
          "The interaction of supply and demand in markets",
          "Central allocation based on social welfare"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a **market economy**, decentralized decisions by households and firms, coordinated through **price signals** in markets, determine what is produced, how it's produced, and who gets it. This is the 'invisible hand' described by Adam Smith."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A nation sacrifices current consumption to invest heavily in capital goods. Five years later, what is the most likely effect on its production possibilities frontier?",
        "options": [
          "The PPF shifts inward due to reduced consumer goods",
          "The PPF remains unchanged but the economy moves along it",
          "The PPF shifts outward, especially for capital-intensive goods",
          "The PPF becomes a straight line showing constant opportunity costs"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Investment in **capital goods** (like machinery) increases the economy's future productive capacity. Although it requires a trade-off today (movement along the current PPF), it results in **economic growth**, shown as an **outward shift** of the PPF. The shift may be asymmetric, expanding potential output more for goods that benefit directly from the new capital stock."

        "90": "Excellent mastery of Unit 1 concepts! You demonstrate strong understanding of opportunity cost calculations, PPF analysis, comparative advantage, and economic systems. You're well-prepared for the AP Microeconomics exam.",
        "70": "Good foundation with room for improvement. Review: 1) The difference between movements along vs. shifts of the PPF, 2) How to calculate opportunity cost from production data, 3) Comparative advantage based on lowest opportunity cost. Practice applying marginal analysis to decision-making scenarios.",
        "50": "Basic understanding evident but key concepts need reinforcement. Focus on: 1) Understanding what causes the PPF to shift vs. move along, 2) Calculating opportunity costs correctly, 3) Distinguishing between the four factors of production, 4) How different economic systems answer the three fundamental questions.",
        "0": "Foundational review needed. Start with these core concepts: 1) Scarcity and opportunity cost as the basis of all economics, 2) The PPF model and what it represents, 3) The four factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship), 4) How marginal analysis guides rational decision-making. Review your textbook and class notes carefully."
