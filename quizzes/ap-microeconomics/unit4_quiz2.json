    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If total fixed cost is \\$200 and total variable cost at 40 units is \\$400, what is average total cost at 40 units?",
        "options": [
          "\\$10",
          "\\$15",
          "\\$20",
          "\\$25"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "ATC = (TFC + TVC) / Q = (200 + 400) / 40 = 600 / 40 = **\\$15**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When marginal cost equals average total cost:",
        "options": [
          "ATC is at its minimum",
          "ATC is increasing",
          "ATC is decreasing",
          "MC is at its minimum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MC intersects ATC at the **minimum point of ATC**. When MC = ATC, ATC is neither rising nor falling — it is at its lowest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm doubles all inputs and output more than doubles. This demonstrates:",
        "options": [
          "Diminishing marginal returns",
          "Constant returns to scale",
          "Increasing returns to scale",
          "Decreasing returns to scale"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "**Increasing returns to scale** (economies of scale): output increases by a greater proportion than the increase in inputs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an implicit cost?",
        "options": [
          "Wages paid to employees",
          "Cost of raw materials",
          "Rent paid for factory space",
          "Forgone salary of the owner who works in the firm"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "**Implicit costs** are opportunity costs of using owned resources (e.g., owner’s forgone salary). Explicit costs are direct monetary payments."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If AVC = \\$8 and AFC = \\$2 at 50 units of output, what is total cost?",
        "options": [
          "\\$400",
          "\\$450",
          "\\$500",
          "\\$550"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "ATC = AVC + AFC = 8 + 2 = \\$10. TC = ATC × Q = 10 × 50 = **\\$500**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sunk costs should be:",
        "options": [
          "Included in marginal cost decisions",
          "Ignored in future production decisions",
          "Added to fixed costs in the short run",
          "Subtracted from total revenue to find profit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Sunk costs** are past costs that cannot be recovered. Rational firms ignore them in future decisions (e.g., whether to produce another unit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the marginal product of labor is rising, then marginal cost is:",
        "options": [
          "Rising",
          "Falling",
          "Constant",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rising MP means each additional worker produces more output → cost of producing an extra unit (MC) **falls**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The long‑run average total cost curve is the envelope of:",
        "options": [
          "Short‑run marginal cost curves",
          "Short‑run average total cost curves",
          "Short‑run average variable cost curves",
          "Total cost curves at different output levels"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "LRATC is the **envelope** of all possible short‑run ATC curves, each corresponding to a different plant size."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm has total costs of \\$1,000 at 20 units and \\$1,200 at 30 units. What is the average variable cost at 30 units if total fixed cost is \\$400?",
        "options": [
          "\\$20",
          "\\$26.67",
          "\\$30",
          "\\$40"
        ],
        "explanation": "At 30 units, TC = 1200, TFC = 400 → TVC = 1200 – 400 = 800. AVC = TVC / Q = 800 / 30 ≈ **\\$26.67**.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Diseconomies of scale occur when:",
        "options": [
          "LRATC decreases as output expands",
          "LRATC increases as output expands",
          "Short‑run ATC is above LRATC",
          "Marginal cost is below average cost"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Diseconomies of scale** → decreasing returns to scale → LRATC **rises** as output increases (often due to coordination problems, bureaucracy)."
