    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government imposes a per-unit tax on producers in a perfectly competitive constant-cost industry, in the long run the burden of the tax falls:",
        "options": [
          "Entirely on consumers.",
          "Entirely on producers.",
          "Partly on consumers and partly on producers.",
          "Entirely on workers through lower wages."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In constant-cost industry, long-run supply is horizontal. Tax shifts supply up by full tax amount; price rises by full tax, so consumers bear entire burden; firms still earn zero profit."
      },
      {
        "type": "multiple_response",
        "question": "Which of the following are characteristics of a perfectly competitive market in long-run equilibrium? (Select two.)",
        "options": [
          "P = MC",
          "P = MR",
          "P = min ATC",
          "P > AVC"
        ],
        "answer": ["A", "C"],
        "explanation": "P = MC (profit max) and P = min ATC (zero economic profit) hold in LR equilibrium. P = MR is always true in PC. P > AVC is true in SR but not a defining LR equilibrium condition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is horizontal at the shutdown price because:",
        "options": [
          "MC is constant at that output.",
          "AVC is minimized where MC = AVC.",
          "The firm will not produce if P < min AVC.",
          "ATC is rising sharply."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Shutdown point is where P = min AVC. Below that price, quantity supplied is zero, making supply curve horizontal at P = min AVC (actually, supply is zero below that price)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If market demand for a product increases in a perfectly competitive increasing-cost industry, the long-run industry supply curve will be _____, and the new equilibrium price will be _____.",
        "options": [
          "Horizontal; unchanged",
          "Upward sloping; higher",
          "Downward sloping; lower",
          "Vertical; unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Increasing-cost industry: LR supply slopes upward. Higher demand raises input costs as industry expands, resulting in higher long-run equilibrium price."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm has total cost TC = 50 + 2Q². At market price \\$16, what is the firm’s short-run profit-maximizing quantity?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "6",
          "8",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MC = dTC/dQ = 4Q. Set P = MC: 16 = 4Q → Q = 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a perfectly competitive market is in long-run equilibrium, which of the following will NOT occur if demand decreases?",
        "options": [
          "Firms earn negative economic profit in the short run.",
          "Some firms exit the market in the long run.",
          "Market price falls in the short run.",
          "Market output increases in the long run."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Decreased demand lowers price, causing losses, exit, and a reduction in market output in the long run — output does not increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "multiple_response",
        "question": "Which of the following government interventions in a perfectly competitive market definitely reduce total surplus? (Select two.)",
        "options": [
          "A binding price ceiling.",
          "A per-unit subsidy equal to external benefit.",
          "A lump-sum tax on firms.",
          "A binding price floor."
        ],
        "answer": ["A", "D"],
        "explanation": "Binding price ceilings and price floors create deadweight loss by moving quantity away from equilibrium. Lump-sum tax does not affect output in LR constant-cost industry; subsidy for external benefit can increase total surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a hurricane destroys crops in a perfectly competitive agricultural market, in the short run, what happens to the market price and individual farmer’s output?",
        "options": [
          "Price rises; each farmer increases output.",
          "Price rises; each farmer’s output may increase or decrease.",
          "Price falls; each farmer decreases output.",
          "Price unchanged; output unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Reduced supply raises price. Each farmer (including unaffected ones) faces higher P and will increase output if P > MC, but affected farmers may produce less. On net, some increase, some decrease."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best explains why a perfectly competitive firm’s demand curve is perfectly elastic?",
        "options": [
          "The firm can set its own price.",
          "The firm’s output is a large share of market supply.",
          "The firm sells a product identical to competitors’.",
          "The firm faces significant advertising costs."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Product homogeneity means consumers see no difference between firms’ output, so if one firm raises price, buyers switch to competitors instantly → perfectly elastic demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive market, if P = \\$10 and ATC = \\$12 at the profit-maximizing output, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase output to lower ATC.",
          "Shut down immediately.",
          "Continue operating if AVC < \\$10.",
          "Exit the market in the short run."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "P < ATC means loss, but if P > AVC, firm should continue operating in short run to cover variable costs and some fixed costs. Shutdown occurs only if P < AVC."
