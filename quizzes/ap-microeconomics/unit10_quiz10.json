    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does a government-imposed quota on production typically impact social efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases social efficiency by preventing supply from reaching its optimal level, resulting in deadweight loss.",
          "It increases social efficiency by ensuring that only high-quality products reach the market.",
          "It has no impact on social efficiency as long as demand stays constant regardless of production levels.",
          "It maintains social efficiency by adjusting only the distribution of goods without affecting total output."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Production quotas artificially limit supply below the equilibrium quantity, creating deadweight loss and reducing social efficiency by preventing trade where MSB > MSC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What outcome can be expected when a government subsidy is granted to producers of a good that generates positive externalities?",
        "options": [
          "Negative externalities increase leading to greater market inefficiency.",
          "There is no change in market output but an improvement in equity occurs.",
          "Market output decreases and moves away from the socially optimal level.",
          "Market output increases and moves closer to the socially optimal level."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Subsidies for goods with positive externalities lower production costs, increasing supply and moving output toward the socially optimal level where MSB = MSC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In response to a change from government-funded provision toward privatization of water services (a good that is non-excludable but rivalrous), what change might occur regarding efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "Increased transaction costs reduce overall efficiency.",
          "A potential increase in efficiency due partly to increased competition and market forces.",
          "Deterioration in efficiency owing to natural monopoly issues.",
          "The initial investment overshadows any efficiency gains."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Water services are often common resources (rival but non-excludable). Privatization can create property rights, internalize externalities, and introduce market incentives, potentially increasing efficiency through competition and better resource management."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which outcome is most likely to occur in a competitive free market without some form of government intervention when positive externalities are present?",
        "options": [
          "Decreased innovation",
          "Overregulation",
          "Underproduction",
          "Uncompetitive markets"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Positive externalities cause social benefits to exceed private benefits, leading to underproduction relative to the socially optimal level where MSB = MSC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When considering income inequality within a country where demand for unskilled labor is decreasing due to automation, which government intervention would most effectively mitigate the resulting disparity?",
        "options": [
          "Impose tariffs on imported goods produced through automation technologies.",
          "Subsidize firms employing significant numbers of unskilled workers despite automation trends.",
          "Implement guaranteed universal basic income unrelated work status or skills level.",
          "Implement retraining programs that facilitate transitions into sectors requiring skilled labor."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Retraining programs address the root cause by increasing human capital, enabling displaced workers to transition to growing sectors. This increases long-term earning potential and reduces inequality more sustainably than transfer payments alone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of a regressive tax system on income inequality?",
        "options": [
          "Makes income distribution perfectly equal",
          "Reduces income inequality",
          "Has no effect on income inequality",
          "Increases income inequality"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Regressive taxes take a larger percentage of income from low-income earners than from high-income earners, increasing after-tax income inequality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a common effect of implementing a Pigouvian tax?",
        "options": [
          "Reduced negative externalities",
          "Higher consumer demand",
          "Increased market competition",
          "Lower production costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A Pigouvian tax internalizes external costs, increasing private costs to equal social costs. This reduces production/consumption of the externality-generating good, decreasing the negative externality."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does the 'tragedy of the commons' differ from the 'free-rider problem' in terms of its impact on resource consumption?",
        "options": [
          "The tragedy of the commons is a microeconomic concept, while the free-rider problem is strictly macroeconomic",
          "The tragedy of the commons results in equitable distribution, while the free-rider problem leads to monopolistic control",
          "The tragedy of the commons leads to overuse of shared resources, while the free-rider problem results in underproduction of public goods",
          "The tragedy of the commons applies only to renewable resources, while the free-rider problem affects non-renewable resources"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The tragedy of the commons describes overconsumption/depletion of common resources (rival but non-excludable). The free-rider problem describes underprovision of public goods (non-rival and non-excludable) due to lack of payment incentives."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of road construction, why might a toll road be considered more efficient than a free public road provided by government in terms of allocational efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "Non-exclusive access ensures all users bear no costs thereby encouraging optimal location of traffic flows.",
          "Toll roads usually present lower congestion costs, thus increasing overall economic efficiency.",
          "Because user fees can better reflect actual usage and direct resources towards hierarchy of road network optimization.",
          "Government-funded roads have more consistent maintenance, therefore provide reliable transportation service."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Toll roads use price signals (user fees) that reflect the marginal cost of road use. This encourages efficient allocation by reducing congestion (peak-load pricing) and providing revenue for maintenance/expansion where demand is highest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect does a subsidy for a product with a positive externality have on the MPC curve?",
        "options": [
          "MPC curve shifts downwards",
          "MPC curve shifts upwards",
          "MPC curve becomes steeper",
          "MPC curve remains unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MPC = Marginal Private Cost. A subsidy reduces production costs for firms, shifting the MPC curve downward (reducing the cost of producing each additional unit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A government aims to reduce car emissions to internalize the positive externalities associated with clean air. Which of the following policies would most effectively align the market quantity with the socially optimal quantity?",
        "options": [
          "A per-unit subsidy for consumers who purchase electric vehicles.",
          "A lump-sum subsidy granted to manufacturers of electric vehicle components.",
          "A price floor on public transportation fares to ensure provider profitability.",
          "A corrective tax on the production of renewable energy infrastructure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To correct a positive externality in consumption (cleaner air), the government should provide a per-unit subsidy. This shifts the marginal private benefit (MPB) curve toward the marginal social benefit (MSB) curve. A lump-sum subsidy (Option B) reduces fixed costs but does not change the marginal incentive to produce or consume additional units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A government introduces a universal basic income (UBI) to reduce income inequality. According to the labor-leisure trade-off model, which of the following is a likely unintended consequence in the labor market?",
        "options": [
          "A contraction in the labor supply as the income effect incentivizes the consumption of leisure.",
          "An increase in the equilibrium wage rate due to a rightward shift of the labor supply curve.",
          "A decrease in the natural rate of unemployment as reservation wages fall across all sectors.",
          "A elimination of the deadweight loss associated with existing progressive income tax brackets."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "UBI provides non-labor income. In the labor-leisure model, an increase in non-labor income shifts the budget constraint upward. Since leisure is a normal good, the income effect leads individuals to consume more leisure and supply less labor, potentially decreasing labor force participation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is national defence provided by the government?",
        "options": [
          "free riders make it difficult for private markets to supply the socially optimal quantity",
          "if the good were produced in private markets, most likely too much of the good would be produced",
          "Products provided by the government can be produced more efficiently",
          "It is impossible for private markets to produce public goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "National defense is a pure public good (non-excludable and non-rival). The free-rider problem means private firms cannot charge users effectively, leading to underprovision. Government provision funded by taxation solves this market failure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Economic losses in an industry are a signal that",
        "options": [
          "will lead resources to leave the industry (until the losses disappear).",
          "too few resources are allocated to the industry.",
          "the economy is in a recession.",
          "all of the firms should leave the industry.",
          "a government subsidy is necessary."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In competitive markets, economic losses signal that the value of resources in that industry is less than their opportunity cost elsewhere. Resources (labor, capital) will exit until normal profits are restored (losses disappear)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An economy's marginal social benefit curve for a private good is obtained by summing the individual marginal",
        "options": [
          "cost curves horizontally.",
          "benefit curves vertically.",
          "cost curves vertically.",
          "benefit curves diagonally.",
          "benefit curves horizontally."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "For private goods (rival), each unit can only be consumed by one person. To find total market demand, we horizontally sum individual demand (marginal benefit) curves at each price level."
