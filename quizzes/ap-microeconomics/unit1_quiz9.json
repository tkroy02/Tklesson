        "question": "A student decides to attend a 4-year college rather than entering the workforce immediately. Which of the following most accurately represents the opportunity cost of this decision?",
        "options": [
          "The difference between college and high school expenses",
          "Only the direct expenses of college tuition",
          "Future earnings minus college expenses",
          "Four years of potential wages plus college expenses"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Opportunity cost includes all costs, explicit and implicit. The explicit costs are college expenses (tuition, fees). The implicit cost is the value of the next-best alternative: the wages forfeited by not working for four years. Therefore, the full opportunity cost is the sum of both forgone wages and out-of-pocket expenses."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is true when an economy is producing on its Production Possibilities Curve?",
        "options": [
          "The economy is using all available resources efficiently.",
          "The economy has idle resources.",
          "The economy is in a recessionary period with high unemployment rates.",
          "The economy can increase production without trade-offs."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Points **on** the PPF represent **productive efficiency**: the economy is using all its resources fully and in the most productive way possible, given current technology. There is no waste or unemployment. To produce more of one good, it must trade off producing less of another."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A country increases its investment in renewable energy sources. What could be the reason for this action?",
        "options": [
          "Decreased energy consumption",
          "Concerns about climate change and energy sustainability",
          "A surplus of fossil fuels",
          "Increased efficiency of non-renewable energy sources"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Investment in renewable energy is a decision to allocate resources toward capital goods that address long-term goals. The most likely economic rationale is to address negative externalities (pollution) and ensure sustainable long-term growth—concerns about market failure and future resource scarcity."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Country Alpha and Beta have the following maximum daily production possibilities: Alpha can produce either 30 units of good X or 15 units of good Y, while Beta can produce either 20 units of good X or 20 units of good Y. After specializing and trading, Alpha ends up consuming 20 units of X and 10 units of Y. Based on this, what is the implied terms of trade (units of X per unit of Y)?",
        "options": [
          "1.5 units of Y for 1 unit of X",
          "2 units of X for 1 unit of Y",
          "2 units of Y for 1 unit of X",
          "1 unit of X for 1 unit of Y"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "**Step 1: Find Comparative Advantage.** Alpha's OC: 1X = 0.5Y (15/30). Beta's OC: 1X = 1Y (20/20). Alpha has lower OC for X, so it specializes in X (produces 30X, 0Y). Beta specializes in Y (produces 0X, 20Y). **Step 2: Deduce Trade.** Alpha consumes 20X and 10Y. Since it produces 30X, it exports 10X. It consumes 10Y but produces 0Y, so it must import 10Y. Therefore, Alpha trades 10X for 10Y. The implied terms of trade are **1 unit of X for 1 unit of Y**."

        "question": "What does a movement along the PPC curve illustrate?",
        "options": [
          "Economic contraction",
          "Resource waste",
          "Technological decline",
          "Trade-offs"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A **movement along** an existing PPF represents a reallocation of resources from producing one good to another. It illustrates the fundamental economic concept of a **trade-off**: to get more of one good, you must give up some of the other, reflecting the opportunity cost at that point on the curve."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way does the consideration of implicit costs in cost-benefit analysis differ from traditional accounting practices?",
        "options": [
          "It only focuses on tangible assets and ignores intangible benefits in decision-making",
          "It includes opportunity costs that are not typically recorded in financial statements",
          "It exclusively uses market prices to determine the value of all resources",
          "It disregards all non-monetary factors in the analysis of economic decisions"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Implicit costs** are the opportunity costs of using resources owned by the firm (or individual) that do not involve a direct cash outlay (e.g., owner's forgone salary). Traditional accounting only records **explicit costs** (actual monetary payments). Economic cost-benefit analysis includes both to assess true profitability."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an implicit cost?",

          "The income forgone by using personal savings to invest in a new project.",
          "The salary paid to employees.",
          "The rent paid for a business premises.",
          "The cost of raw materials used in production."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An **implicit cost** is a non-cash opportunity cost. Using personal savings means forgoing the interest income those savings could have earned. This is a cost of using your own capital, but no money changes hands. Options B, C, and D are all **explicit costs**—actual cash payments for resources."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of microeconomics?",
        "options": [
          "A local bakery adjusting its prices in response to rising flour costs.",
          "A government planning its fiscal budget for the entire economy.",
          "The central bank changing interest rates to control the money supply.",
          "A country analyzing its national unemployment and inflation trends."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "**Microeconomics** studies the decisions of individual actors (households, firms) and the workings of specific markets. A bakery's pricing decision is a firm-level choice in a specific market. Options B, C, and D are all **macroeconomics**—they deal with economy-wide aggregates like total output, money supply, and inflation."

        "question": "What does comparative advantage refer to?",
        "options": [
          "Ability to produce more goods",
          "Lowest opportunity cost of production",
          "Largest quantity of goods produced",
          "Highest quality of goods produced"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "**Comparative advantage** is defined as the ability to produce a good at a **lower opportunity cost** than another producer. It is not about being the absolute best, producing the largest quantity, or the highest quality. This concept explains the basis for mutually beneficial trade."

          "Outward shift of the curve",
          "Movement along the curve"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "**Economic growth** is an increase in an economy's productive capacity, which is graphically represented by an **outward shift** of the entire Production Possibilities Frontier. This shift is caused by an increase in resources, an improvement in technology, or better institutions."

        "90": "Masterful synthesis. You correctly calculate complex terms of trade from consumption data, distinguish implicit from explicit costs with precision, and apply the definitions of PPF concepts and comparative advantage flawlessly. This is comprehensive Unit 1 mastery.",
        "70": "Strong understanding. You may have stumbled on the quantitative terms-of-trade deduction or the subtle distinction between accounting and economic costs. Focus on: 1) Working backwards from consumption bundles to infer trade flows and prices, and 2) Memorizing that 'implicit cost = opportunity cost of own resources.'",
        "50": "Adequate grasp of separate concepts. To improve, prioritize: 1) Practicing comparative advantage problems that ask for the implied terms of trade, 2) Creating a clear list of examples for explicit vs. implicit costs, and 3) Drawing the PPF for every relevant question to visualize shifts vs. movements.",
        "0": "Essential review needed. Solidify these three pillars: 1) The PPF model (what it shows, what shifts it, what a movement means), 2) The definition and calculation of opportunity cost, 3) The difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Use these to anchor all other concepts."
