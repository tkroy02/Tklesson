    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a monopoly graph, economic profit is represented by the area of the rectangle where:",
        "options": [
          "P > ATC at the profit-maximizing Q",
          "P = MC",
          "MR = MC",
          "P = ATC"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Profit = (P – ATC) × Q. This is shown as a rectangle between price and ATC at the quantity where MR = MC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist faces demand P = 100 – 2Q and has MC = 20, what is the profit-maximizing price?",
        "options": [
          "$40",
          "$60",
          "$80",
          "$100"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MR = 100 – 4Q. Set MR = MC: 100 – 4Q = 20 → Q = 20. Then P = 100 – 2(20) = 60."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Deadweight loss in monopoly exists because:",
        "options": [
          "Price equals marginal cost",
          "Price is less than marginal cost",
          "Output is less than where P = MC",
          "The monopolist earns economic profit"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "DWL arises because the monopoly produces less than the socially optimal output where P = MC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist practices perfect price discrimination:",
        "options": [
          "Consumer surplus is maximized",
          "Deadweight loss is eliminated",
          "Output is lower than under single-price monopoly",
          "Marginal revenue equals demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfect price discrimination allows the monopolist to capture all consumer surplus and produce where P = MC, eliminating DWL."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist’s marginal revenue curve lies:",
        "options": [
          "Above the demand curve",
          "Below the demand curve",
          "On the demand curve",
          "Horizontal at the market price"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a downward-sloping demand curve, MR is below demand because lowering price reduces revenue on inframarginal units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopoly’s ATC is $50 at the profit-maximizing output and price is $70, what is the per-unit profit?",
        "options": [
          "$10",
          "$20",
          "$30",
          "$50"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit per unit = P – ATC = 70 – 50 = $20."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A natural monopoly occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "One firm owns all natural resources",
          "ATC declines over the entire market demand",
          "The government grants an exclusive license",
          "Firms collude to fix prices"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A natural monopoly exists when economies of scale are so large that one firm can supply the entire market at a lower cost than multiple firms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a single-price monopolist, consumer surplus is the area:",
        "options": [
          "Below demand and above price",
          "Below price and above MC",
          "Between MR and MC",
          "Below ATC and above price"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay (demand) and what they actually pay (price)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is P = 80 – Q and MC = 2Q, what is the monopoly output?",
        "options": [
          "10",
          "16",
          "20",
          "40"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "MR = 80 – 2Q. Set MR = MC: 80 – 2Q = 2Q → 80 = 4Q → Q = 20? Wait, that’s Q = 20. But check: 80 – 2Q = 2Q → 80 = 4Q → Q=20. Option says 20. That’s correct."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopolist will shut down in the short run if:",
        "options": [
          "P < ATC",
          "P < AVC",
          "MR < MC",
          "TR < TC"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Like all firms, a monopolist shuts down if price falls below average variable cost, because it cannot cover variable costs."
