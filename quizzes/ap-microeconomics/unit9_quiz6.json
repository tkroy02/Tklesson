    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a market is producing at a quantity greater than the efficient equilibrium quantity, which of the following must be true?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Marginal social cost exceeds marginal social benefit.",
          "Marginal social benefit exceeds marginal social cost.",
          "Total surplus is maximized.",
          "Consumer surplus is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At quantities greater than the efficient point, the cost of producing the last unit (MSC) is greater than the benefit from consuming it (MSB). This means society is using resources to produce goods worth less than their cost, reducing total surplus and creating deadweight loss from overproduction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A per-unit tax and a quota that result in the same reduction of quantity from the free-market equilibrium will have which of the following in common?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The size of the deadweight loss.",
          "The distribution of the remaining surplus between consumers and producers.",
          "The price that consumers pay.",
          "The revenue generated for the government."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both a tax and a quota create a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive, reducing the quantity traded below the efficient level. If they reduce quantity by the same amount, the area of deadweight loss (the triangle of forgone mutually beneficial trades) will be identical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A subsidy provided to consumers (e.g., a voucher) for a good will shift the _________ curve _________. This will _________ the price producers receive and _________ the quantity traded.",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "supply; rightward; increase; increase",
          "demand; rightward; increase; increase",
          "supply; leftward; decrease; decrease",
          "demand; leftward; decrease; decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A subsidy to consumers increases their willingness to pay at every quantity, shifting the demand curve rightward. This increases the equilibrium price (which is the price producers receive) and increases the equilibrium quantity traded."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the market for labor, a binding minimum wage (a price floor) creates unemployment. The resulting deadweight loss primarily represents:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Lost wages that unemployed workers would have earned.",
          "Lost profit from firms that cannot hire as many workers.",
          "The value of work that would have been performed by the unemployed workers, which was greater than their opportunity cost of leisure.",
          "The administrative cost of enforcing the minimum wage law."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Deadweight loss is the loss of gains from trade. The unemployed workers were willing to work for a wage at or above their opportunity cost (value of leisure/other activities), and firms were willing to hire them at a wage at or below the workers' MRP. The minimum wage prevents these mutually beneficial trades, so the DWL is the value of the lost output (MRP) minus the workers' opportunity cost."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider a market with a horizontal, perfectly elastic supply curve. If a tax is imposed on sellers in this market, what happens to the price buyers pay and the price sellers receive?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Buyers' price rises by the full tax; sellers' price is unchanged.",
          "Buyers' price is unchanged; sellers' price falls by the full tax.",
          "Buyers' price rises by part of the tax; sellers' price falls by the rest.",
          "Neither price changes; the government absorbs the cost."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfectly elastic supply means producers will supply any quantity at a specific price (their cost) and none at a lower price. A tax shifts this horizontal supply curve upward by the tax amount. The new equilibrium has the same quantity, but buyers now pay the original price plus the entire tax. Sellers still receive the original price (their cost), as they cannot accept less and stay in business."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following policies is most likely to INCREASE total surplus in a market?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Imposing a binding price ceiling on a good with a negative externality.",
          "Removing a binding price floor on an agricultural product.",
          "Introducing a quota on imports to protect domestic producers.",
          "Replacing an income tax with an excise tax on a good with very elastic demand."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A binding price floor creates a surplus (overproduction) and reduces quantity traded below the equilibrium, causing deadweight loss. Removing it allows the price to fall to equilibrium, increasing quantity traded to the efficient level and eliminating the deadweight loss, thus increasing total surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When evaluating the social efficiency of a policy, economists primarily focus on:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The fairness of the outcome.",
          "The impact on total surplus.",
          "The number of people who benefit versus the number who lose.",
          "The political popularity of the policy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation:",
        "explanation": "The concept of economic efficiency is centered on maximizing the size of the economic 'pie,' which is measured by total surplus (consumer + producer surplus). While equity (fairness) is important, it is a separate normative consideration. Positive economic analysis of policy focuses on its efficiency effects."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The phrase 'the invisible hand' refers to the idea that:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Government intervention is necessary to guide markets.",
          "In competitive markets, self-interested behavior leads to socially efficient outcomes.",
          "Monopolies naturally promote the public interest.",
          "Taxes and subsidies are the primary tools for achieving efficiency."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Coined by Adam Smith, the 'invisible hand' is the concept that individuals pursuing their own self-interest in competitive markets, through the price system, are led as if by an invisible hand to produce outcomes that are efficient (maximize total surplus) for society as a whole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a market is initially in equilibrium and then supply decreases, what is the effect on producer surplus?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It increases unambiguously.",
          "It decreases unambiguously.",
          "The change is ambiguous; it depends on elasticity.",
          "It remains unchanged because price and quantity move in opposite directions."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A decrease in supply raises price but reduces quantity. Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the price. The higher price increases PS, but the lower quantity (and the fact that the supply curve itself has shifted left) decreases it. The net effect depends on the shapes (elasticities) of the supply and demand curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A key difference between a corrective tax (Pigovian tax) on pollution and a command-and-control regulation requiring a specific pollution reduction technology is that the tax:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Is less effective at reducing pollution.",
          "Achieves the pollution reduction at a lower total cost to society.",
          "Always raises more revenue for the government.",
          "Is easier for politicians to support."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A Pigovian tax sets a price on pollution, allowing firms to choose the cheapest way to reduce it (whether by adopting technology, reducing output, or innovating). A uniform technology mandate may force some firms to use very expensive methods. Therefore, the tax achieves the same environmental goal at a lower total abatement cost, minimizing the efficiency loss."
