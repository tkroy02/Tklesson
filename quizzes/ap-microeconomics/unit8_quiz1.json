    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for labor is described as a derived demand because it depends primarily on",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the wage rate set by the government",
          "the demand for the product that labor produces",
          "the supply of labor in the market",
          "the number of firms in the industry"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Derived demand means the demand for a factor of production (like labor) comes from the demand for the final good or service that the factor helps produce."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor is calculated as",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "marginal product of labor × price of output",
          "total revenue ÷ quantity of labor",
          "change in total cost ÷ change in labor",
          "wage rate × hours worked"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MRP = Marginal Product of Labor (MPL) × Price of Output (P) in a perfectly competitive output market. In imperfect competition, MRP = MPL × Marginal Revenue (MR)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit‑maximizing firm will hire workers up to the point where",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "MRP = wage rate",
          "MPL = wage rate",
          "total revenue = total cost",
          "average product of labor is maximized"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A firm hires labor until the marginal revenue product (MRP) equals the marginal resource cost (MRC), which in a competitive labor market is the wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of the product a firm sells increases, what happens to the demand for labor?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Demand for labor increases",
          "Demand for labor decreases",
          "Demand for labor stays the same",
          "Supply of labor increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher output price raises MRP (since MRP = MPL × P), shifting the labor demand curve rightward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would increase a firm's demand for labor?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A decrease in worker productivity",
          "An increase in the wage rate",
          "A technological improvement that raises MPL",
          "A decrease in product demand"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher marginal product of labor (MPL) increases MRP, shifting labor demand to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, the marginal resource cost (MRC) of labor is",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "equal to the wage rate",
          "greater than the wage rate",
          "less than the wage rate",
          "equal to the MRP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a competitive labor market, each additional worker costs the same wage, so MRC = wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the marginal product of labor (MPL) is falling, the MRP curve will",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "slope downward",
          "slope upward",
          "be horizontal",
          "be vertical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns cause MPL to fall as more labor is hired, making MRP decline — thus the MRP (labor demand) curve slopes downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following events will shift the labor demand curve to the left?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "An increase in the price of the firm's output",
          "A decrease in the wage rate",
          "A decline in consumer demand for the product",
          "A technological advance that boosts MPL"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Lower product demand reduces product price or sales, lowering MRP and shifting labor demand left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a firm selling output in a perfectly competitive market, MRP equals",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "MPL × P",
          "MPL × MR",
          "MPL × ATC",
          "MPL × AFC"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, P = MR, so MRP = MPL × P = MPL × MR."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm's labor demand curve is equivalent to its",
        "image": null,

          "marginal revenue product curve",
          "total product curve",
          "average product curve",
          "marginal cost curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The labor demand curve shows how many workers a firm will hire at each wage, which is determined by the MRP of labor — thus it is the MRP curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assuming a monopolistically competitive firm in factor markets is currently earning short‑term economic profits for their specialized labor, what long‑term adjustments might you expect other firms to make?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Firms will exit the market, reducing labor supply and increasing wages over time.",
          "The equilibrium wage rate is likely to remain unchanged since profits are temporary.",
          "New firms will enter the market, bringing about greater labor supply and driving down wages over time.",
          "Firms will reduce their demand for specialized labor to maintain economic profits."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In monopolistic competition, economic profit attracts new firms. Entry increases demand for specialized labor, raising wages in the short run, but may also increase the supply of similar skills over time, putting downward pressure on wages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government provides a subsidy for worker training in a perfectly competitive labor market, what is the likely effect on wages and employment?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Wages will decrease as supply of labor increases.",
          "There will be no change in wages or employment as the market is perfectly competitive.",
          "Wages might increase, and employment could rise.",
          "Employment will decrease due to increased automation by firms receiving subsidies."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Training subsidies increase workers’ human capital (skills), raising their productivity (MPL). Higher MPL increases MRP, shifting labor demand right. This can lead to higher wages and more employment, assuming labor supply is not perfectly elastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following statements about monopsonistic markets in factor markets are true except:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "In a monopsonistic labor market, the marginal factor cost curve is identical to the individual labor supply curve.",
          "A monopsonist maximizes profit by hiring labor until the marginal revenue product equals the marginal factor cost.",
          "In a monopsony, hiring additional labor forces the firm to raise wages for all workers, resulting in a marginal factor cost curve that lies above the supply curve.",
          "Monopsonistic firms typically pay lower wages and hire fewer workers compared to firms in competitive labor markets."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In monopsony, the MFC curve lies above the labor supply curve (because raising wages to hire more workers increases the cost for all workers). The MFC curve is not identical to the supply curve, so statement A is false."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A factory in a competitive labor market notes that the marginal revenue product (MRP) of its workers is declining. What is the most likely profit‑maximizing response by the firm?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Reduce hiring additional workers.",
          "Replace labor with overtime work.",
          "Invest in automation to replace labor entirely.",
          "Increase wages to retain the current workforce."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Declining MRP (due to diminishing marginal returns) means each additional worker adds less to revenue. The firm should stop hiring when MRP falls to the wage rate, and if MRP is already below wage, it may reduce employment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scenarios best illustrates the concept of diminishing marginal returns in factor markets?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The marginal revenue product remains constant as more workers are added.",
          "Hiring more workers results in a constant increase in total output regardless of the number employed.",
          "Each additional worker hired contributes less output than the previous worker, holding all other inputs constant.",
          "An increase in final product demand leads to a proportional increase in the use of all inputs."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns (or diminishing marginal product) occurs when adding more of a variable input (labor) to a fixed input (capital) eventually yields smaller increases in output. This is shown by each additional worker producing less extra output than the one before."
