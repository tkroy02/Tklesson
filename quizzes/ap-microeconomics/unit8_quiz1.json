    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The demand for labor is described as a derived demand because it depends primarily on",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the wage rate set by the government",
          "the demand for the product that labor produces",
          "the supply of labor in the market",
          "the number of firms in the industry"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Derived demand means the demand for a factor of production (like labor) comes from the demand for the final good or service that the factor helps produce."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor is calculated as",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "marginal product of labor × price of output",
          "total revenue ÷ quantity of labor",
          "change in total cost ÷ change in labor",
          "wage rate × hours worked"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MRP = Marginal Product of Labor (MPL) × Price of Output (P) in a perfectly competitive output market. In imperfect competition, MRP = MPL × Marginal Revenue (MR)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A profit‑maximizing firm will hire workers up to the point where",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "MRP = wage rate",
          "MPL = wage rate",
          "total revenue = total cost",
          "average product of labor is maximized"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A firm hires labor until the marginal revenue product (MRP) equals the marginal resource cost (MRC), which in a competitive labor market is the wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price of the product a firm sells increases, what happens to the demand for labor?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Demand for labor increases",
          "Demand for labor decreases",
          "Demand for labor stays the same",
          "Supply of labor increases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher output price raises MRP (since MRP = MPL × P), shifting the labor demand curve rightward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would increase a firm's demand for labor?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A decrease in worker productivity",
          "An increase in the wage rate",
          "A technological improvement that raises MPL",
          "A decrease in product demand"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Higher marginal product of labor (MPL) increases MRP, shifting labor demand to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, the marginal resource cost (MRC) of labor is",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "equal to the wage rate",
          "greater than the wage rate",
          "less than the wage rate",
          "equal to the MRP"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a competitive labor market, each additional worker costs the same wage, so MRC = wage rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the marginal product of labor (MPL) is falling, the MRP curve will",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "slope downward",
          "slope upward",
          "be horizontal",
          "be vertical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diminishing marginal returns cause MPL to fall as more labor is hired, making MRP decline — thus the MRP (labor demand) curve slopes downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following events will shift the labor demand curve to the left?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "An increase in the price of the firm's output",
          "A decrease in the wage rate",
          "A decline in consumer demand for the product",
          "A technological advance that boosts MPL"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Lower product demand reduces product price or sales, lowering MRP and shifting labor demand left."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a firm selling output in a perfectly competitive market, MRP equals",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "MPL × P",
          "MPL × MR",
          "MPL × ATC",
          "MPL × AFC"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, P = MR, so MRP = MPL × P = MPL × MR."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm's labor demand curve is equivalent to its",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "marginal revenue product curve",
          "total product curve",
          "average product curve",
          "marginal cost curve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The labor demand curve shows how many workers a firm will hire at each wage, which is determined by the MRP of labor — thus it is the MRP curve."
