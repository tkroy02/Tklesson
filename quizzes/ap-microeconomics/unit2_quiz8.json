      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm sells two products with identical production costs. Product A has many close substitutes while Product B has none. If the firm wants to maximize revenue, it should:",
        "options": [
          "Set a higher price for Product B than for Product A",
          "Set a higher price for Product A than for Product B",
          "Set identical prices for both products",
          "Discontinue Product A to focus on Product B"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Product B has no close substitutes → consumers are less sensitive to price changes. With fewer alternatives, the firm can charge a higher price for B without losing many sales. Product A has many substitutes → consumers will switch if price is high, so price must be lower."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If consumer income rises, how are the demand curves for normal and inferior goods affected?",
        "options": [
          "Demand for normal goods decreases, while demand for inferior goods increases.",
          "Demand for both normal and inferior goods increases.",
          "Demand for both normal and inferior goods decreases.",
          "Demand for normal goods increases, while demand for inferior goods decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Normal goods: demand increases with income (shift right). Inferior goods: demand decreases with income (shift left)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a result of a market shortage?",
        "options": [
          "Prices increase",
          "Demand decreases",
          "Prices decrease",
          "Supply decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Shortage = excess demand at current price. In a free market, prices rise to eliminate the shortage by reducing quantity demanded and increasing quantity supplied."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If there is an improvement in medical technology specifically related to diabetes treatment, how will this affect the market for insulin?",
        "options": [
          "There will be no change since medical technology is unrelated to insulin production costs.",
          "It may lead to increased supply as pharmaceutical companies anticipate higher profits from new tech synergies.",
          "It might lead to an increased quantity demanded due to lower equilibrium prices caused by advancements.",
          "It could lead to a decrease in demand if fewer people require insulin due to better treatments."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Better diabetes treatment could reduce the number of insulin-dependent patients → demand for insulin decreases (shift left)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an expected effect of a subsidy granted to producers on the market for corn?",
        "options": [
          "Higher prices for consumers and decreased quantity produced.",
          "Lower prices for consumers and increased quantity produced.",
          "Decreased supply of corn and higher prices for consumers.",
          "No change in quantity produced or consumer prices."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A subsidy lowers production costs, increasing supply (shift right). Equilibrium price falls, quantity rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the market for electric vehicles, if the price of lithium (a key battery component) increases while battery technology simultaneously improves, the most likely result is:",
        "options": [
          "No change in supply as the effects cancel out exactly",
          "A definite leftward shift in supply",
          "A definite rightward shift in supply",
          "An indeterminate shift in supply depending on relative effects"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher input cost → supply decreases (left). Better tech → supply increases (right). Net effect on supply is indeterminate without knowing magnitudes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the market demand curve if individual demand increases?",
        "options": [
          "Becomes vertical",
          "Shifts to the left",
          "Becomes horizontal",
          "Shifts to the right"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Increased individual demand at each price → market demand increases → demand curve shifts right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which outcome is most likely if the government implements a tariff on imported steel?",
        "options": [
          "The supply of steel decreases worldwide",
          "Domestic steel prices increase",
          "Foreign steel producers increase their prices",
          "Importing countries reduce tariffs on exports"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tariff raises the price of imported steel, allowing domestic producers to raise prices toward the new higher import price. Domestic steel price rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The market for electric vehicles (EVs) experiences simultaneous increases in production technology and consumer preferences for EVs. If the demand shift is proportionally larger than the supply shift, what happens to producer surplus?",
        "options": [
          "Increases due to higher equilibrium price and quantity",
          "Decreases as consumer surplus captures all gains",
          "Decreases due to lower per-unit profit margins",
          "Remains unchanged despite market expansion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both shifts increase quantity. If demand increases more than supply, price rises. Higher price and higher quantity both increase producer surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A government provides a \\$5 per-unit subsidy to producers in a competitive market. If the pre-subsidy equilibrium price was \\$20 and the post-subsidy equilibrium price is \\$17, what portion of the subsidy benefit is captured by consumers?",
        "options": [
          "\\$3 per unit",
          "\\$5 per unit",
          "\\$0 per unit",
          "\\$2 per unit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price fell from \\$20 to \\$17 → consumers pay \\$3 less per unit. That \\$3 is the portion of the \\$5 subsidy captured by consumers via lower price. Producers capture the rest (\\$2)."
