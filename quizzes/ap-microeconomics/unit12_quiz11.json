      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At present output levels, a perfectly competitive firm is in the following position: output = 4000 units, market price = $1, fixed costs = $2000, total variable costs = $1000, marginal cost = $1.10. This firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Making a positive economic profit.",
          "Making a zero economic profit.",
          "Losing money, although it could make a profit by decreasing its output.",
          "Producing the output where AVC = MC.",
          "Not maximizing its profit but could do so by increasing its output."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "P = $1, MC = $1.10 → P < MC, so firm is producing too much. To maximize profit (or minimize loss), reduce output until P = MC. Since P > AVC ($1000/4000 = $0.25), it should keep producing in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long-run, competition in competitive markets:",
        "options": [
          "Yields economic inefficiency in the absence of external costs.",
          "Results in output being produced at maximum opportunity cost.",
          "Forces all surviving firms to adopt the most efficient technology.",
          "Guarantees each firm long-run economic profits.",
          "May result in economic losses."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Long-run competitive equilibrium forces firms to produce at minimum ATC using the most efficient technology; otherwise, they will earn losses and exit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run shutdown point for the perfectly competitive firm occurs:",
        "options": [
          "Where total revenue is just sufficient to cover total cost.",
          "When the demand curve facing the firm is tangent to its average variable cost curve.",
          "Where total revenue is just sufficient to cover all explicit cost but not any implicit or imputed costs.",
          "When the firm is able to cover all of its fixed costs and part of its variable costs.",
          "At the same quantity level as the long-run shutdown point."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shutdown point is where P = minimum AVC (tangency of demand curve to AVC curve). Below that, firm shuts down in the short run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the monopolist operated in the inelastic range of its demand curve:",
        "options": [
          "It could raise total revenue by lowering price.",
          "The firm would be acting to maximize total revenue rather than profit.",
          "Marginal revenue would be negative.",
          "It could increase its profit by lowering its price and increasing output.",
          "It could increase its profit by increasing both price and output."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When demand is inelastic (|Ed| < 1), MR is negative. A profit-maximizing monopolist would never produce in the inelastic range because reducing output raises TR and lowers TC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopoly firm will produce at minimum ATC:",
        "options": [
          "When in long-run equilibrium.",
          "If MR happens to equal MC where ATC is at a minimum.",
          "If price happens to equal ATC at the output where ATC is at its minimum.",
          "Under no circumstances.",
          "Whenever price is everywhere below the monopolist's ATC."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A monopolist produces where MR = MC. If that intersection happens to occur at the minimum point of ATC, then output coincides with min ATC, but that is coincidental, not a condition of monopoly equilibrium."
