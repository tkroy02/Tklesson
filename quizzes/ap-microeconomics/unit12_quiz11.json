      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At present output levels, a perfectly competitive firm is in the following position: output = 4000 units, market price = \\$1, fixed costs = \\$2000, total variable costs = \\$1000, marginal cost = \\$1.10. This firm is:",
        "options": [
          "Making a positive economic profit.",
          "Making a zero economic profit.",
          "Losing money, although it could make a profit by decreasing its output.",
          "Producing the output where AVC = MC.",
          "Not maximizing its profit but could do so by increasing its output."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "P = \\$1, MC = \\$1.10 → P < MC, so firm is producing too much. To maximize profit (or minimize loss), reduce output until P = MC. Since P > AVC (\\$1000/4000 = \\$0.25), it should keep producing in the short run."
      },
            {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two alternative production possibility frontiers for apples and wheat are shown in the figures below. As more wheat is produced, how will the opportunity cost of producing wheat, as represented in Figures 1 and 2, be affected?",
        "image": "images/1165.png",
        "options": [
          "Figure 1: Decrease; Figure 2: Increase",
          "Figure 1: Increase; Figure 2: Decrease",
          "Figure 1: No change; Figure 2: Increase",
          "Figure 1: No change; Figure 2: Decrease",
          "Figure 1: Increase; Figure 2: No change"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Figure 1: linear PPF → constant slope → constant opportunity cost (no change). Figure 2: bowed-out PPF → increasing slope as more wheat produced → increasing opportunity cost (due to resource specialization)."
      },
            {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The graph above shows the marginal product and the average product of labor for a firm that uses labor as the only variable input and hires its labor in a perfectly competitive market. At which quantity of labor does marginal cost change from decreasing to increasing?",
        "image": "images/1166.png",
        "options": [
          "L₁",
          "L₂",
          "L₃",
          "L₄",
          "L₅"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Marginal cost ($MC$) is inversely related to marginal product ($MP$): $MC = w/MP$. $MC$ decreases while $MP$ increases, and $MC$ increases once $MP$ decreases. $MP$ reaches maximum at $L₂$ → $MC$ minimum at $L₂$, switching from decreasing to increasing."

          "Yields economic inefficiency in the absence of external costs.",
          "Results in output being produced at maximum opportunity cost.",
          "Forces all surviving firms to adopt the most efficient technology.",
          "Guarantees each firm long-run economic profits.",
          "May result in economic losses."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Long-run competitive equilibrium forces firms to produce at minimum ATC using the most efficient technology; otherwise, they will earn losses and exit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The short-run shutdown point for the perfectly competitive firm occurs:",
        "options": [
          "Where total revenue is just sufficient to cover total cost.",
          "When the demand curve facing the firm is tangent to its average variable cost curve.",
          "Where total revenue is just sufficient to cover all explicit cost but not any implicit or imputed costs.",
          "When the firm is able to cover all of its fixed costs and part of its variable costs.",
          "At the same quantity level as the long-run shutdown point."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shutdown point is where P = minimum AVC (tangency of demand curve to AVC curve). Below that, firm shuts down in the short run."

            {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the graph above, S is the original supply curve, and $S_1$ is the supply curve including an excise tax. The area representing the tax revenue to the government is",

          "$P_3VQ_2O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After tax, equilibrium moves to point V ($S_1$ ∩ D) with price $P_3$ and quantity $Q_2$. The tax per unit = vertical gap between $S_1$ and $S$ at $Q_2$ = $P_3 - P_1$. Tax revenue = ($P_3 - P_1$) × $Q_2$ = area of rectangle $P_1P_3VT$."

        "options": [
          "It could raise total revenue by lowering price.",
          "The firm would be acting to maximize total revenue rather than profit.",
          "Marginal revenue would be negative.",
          "It could increase its profit by lowering its price and increasing output.",
          "It could increase its profit by increasing both price and output."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When demand is inelastic (|Ed| < 1), MR is negative. A profit-maximizing monopolist would never produce in the inelastic range because reducing output raises TR and lowers TC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A monopoly firm will produce at minimum ATC:",
        "options": [
          "When in long-run equilibrium.",
          "If MR happens to equal MC where ATC is at a minimum.",
          "If price happens to equal ATC at the output where ATC is at its minimum.",
          "Under no circumstances.",
          "Whenever price is everywhere below the monopolist's ATC."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A monopolist produces where MR = MC. If that intersection happens to occur at the minimum point of ATC, then output coincides with min ATC, but that is coincidental, not a condition of monopoly equilibrium."

        "question": "Which of the following accurately differentiates allocative efficiency and productive efficiency on a firm graph?",
        "options": [
          "Allocative efficiency is where P = minimum average total cost; Productive efficiency is where P = MC",

          "Allocative efficiency is where P = MC; Productive efficiency is where economic losses are minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency: P = MC (socially optimal output). Productive efficiency: P = min ATC (lowest cost production)."

        "question": "Assume peanut farmers hire their workers in a perfectly competitive labor market and sell their product in a perfectly competitive product market. A decrease in the demand for peanuts will result in which of the following changes in the labor market?",
        "options": [
          "neither supply nor demand will shift, as labor and products are unrelated in this case.",
          "The supply curve for labor will shift to the right.",
          "The demand curve for labor will shift to the right.",
          "The supply curve for labor will shift to the left.",
          "The demand curve for labor will shift to the left."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Lower product demand reduces price of peanuts, lowering MRP of labor (= MP × P), shifting labor demand left."

          "maximize consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Price discrimination requires identifying groups with different price elasticities to charge different prices."

          "They spend more than half their revenue on highly competitive advertising",
          "They differentiate their products",
          "They price discriminate",
          "They produce identical products",
          "They are mutually interdependent"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Mutual interdependence—firms consider rivals' reactions—is unique to oligopoly."

        "question": "All of the following are true statements about market structures EXCEPT",
        "options": [
          "The demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic",
          "Monopolistically competitive firms earn a normal profit in the long run",
          "Oligopolistic firms are more interdependent than monopolistically competitive firms",
          "Competitive firms are more likely to experience economies of scale than oligopolistic firms",
          "Perfectly competitive firms are always productively efficient in the long run"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Oligopolistic firms are often large and can achieve economies of scale more readily than small competitive firms. Competitive firms are usually too small to exploit significant economies of scale."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unemployment means economy is inside the PPC, not on it, but does not shift the PPC inward. Shifts occur from changes in resources or technology."
