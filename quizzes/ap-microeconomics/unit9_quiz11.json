        "question": "In the 1970s, the U.S. faced an oil crisis. In response, the government imposed price ceilings on gasoline to keep it affordable. Long lines formed at gas stations, with people waiting hours and sometimes fighting over fuel. An economist analyzing this situation would argue that the price ceiling primarily caused these lines because:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It reduced the quantity of gasoline supplied while increasing the quantity demanded, creating a shortage.",
          "It gave oil companies an incentive to produce more gasoline than consumers wanted at the controlled price.",
          "It shifted the demand curve for gasoline to the right as consumers stockpiled fuel out of fear.",
          "It encouraged OPEC to increase oil production to help the U.S. market."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The gasoline price ceiling created an artificial shortage by preventing the price from rising to equilibrium. With quantity supplied reduced and quantity demanded increased, non-price rationing mechanisms—like waiting in line—emerged to allocate the scarce gasoline."

        "question": "After World War II, many European cities had extensive rent control policies to address housing shortages. Decades later, cities like Stockholm and Berlin had waiting lists for apartments that stretched 10–20 years, and many controlled apartments fell into disrepair. An economist would explain that rent control caused these outcomes because:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It reduced landlords' incentives to maintain or build new housing.",
          "It increased demand so dramatically that supply could never catch up, regardless of price.",
          "It correctly priced the external benefits of stable communities, but implementation was flawed.",
          "It transferred wealth from tenants to landlords, reducing overall housing investment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rent control creates a shortage by keeping prices below market equilibrium. Over time, it reduces returns to landlords, discouraging maintenance (leading to decay) and new construction (worsening the shortage). The waiting lists are a form of non-price rationing for the artificially scarce resource."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the Great Depression, the U.S. government established the Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933), which paid farmers to reduce production and destroy crops and livestock. This was essentially a production quota combined with direct payments. A critic using EFFICIENCY analysis would argue this policy was problematic because:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It destroyed food while people were hungry.",
          "It increased prices too much, making food unaffordable for all consumers.",
          "It failed to account for the price elasticity of demand for agricultural products.",
          "It should have used price floors instead of quotas to achieve the same outcome."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The policy artificially restricted supply to raise prices, creating deadweight loss. The destruction of crops and livestock that had cost resources to produce—while consumers existed who valued them—represented pure economic waste: goods that could have provided benefit were instead destroyed to maintain higher prices."
      },
   {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In 1990, the U.S. implemented a luxury tax on expensive cars, boats, and jewelry to raise revenue from wealthier consumers. However, the tax largely failed to raise expected revenue and was blamed for job losses in boat manufacturing. An analysis of tax incidence would suggest this outcome occurred because:",
  "image": null,
  "options": [
    "The demand for luxury goods was relatively elastic, meaning consumers significantly reduced purchases when prices rose, shrinking the tax base and hurting producers.",
    "Wealthy consumers have perfectly inelastic demand for luxuries, so they bore the full tax burden but purchased the same quantity, making revenue predictions inaccurate.",
    "The supply of luxury goods was highly elastic, allowing producers to easily shift to untaxed products without affecting employment.",
    "The tax was levied on consumers rather than producers, which always results in lower revenue collection efficiency."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Luxury goods typically have elastic demand (discretionary purchases with substitutes). The tax raised prices, causing a large drop in quantity demanded. This shrank the tax base (quantity sold), reducing revenue below expectations. Producers (and their workers) bore much of the burden through lost sales."

      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "During the California electricity crisis (2000–2001), wholesale electricity prices fluctuated based on market conditions while retail prices were fixed by law. This led to utility bankruptcies and widespread blackouts because:",
  "image": null,
  "options": [
    "The retail price cap prevented the price mechanism from signaling scarcity to consumers, while wholesale costs exceeded retail revenue.",
    "A lack of vertical integration meant that electricity supply was perfectly elastic at the retail level but inelastic at the wholesale level.",
    "Consumer demand was highly elastic, leading to a surplus of energy that utilities could not store or sell profitably.",
    "The retail price fixed by the government acted as a price floor, causing a surplus of electricity that retailers were forced to purchase at a loss."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The crux of the issue was a 'price scissors' effect. The fixed retail price (a price ceiling) prevented the law of demand from reducing consumption during a shortage, while simultaneously making it impossible for utilities to cover the rising marginal costs of wholesale electricity (the input)."

  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In 2008, several nations restricted grain exports to stabilize domestic food costs. While helping domestic consumers in the short run, these policies were criticized for undermining long-term food security because they:",
  "options": [
    "Distorted producer incentives, leading to reduced domestic planting in subsequent seasons.",
    "Increased global price volatility by artificially restricting the aggregate supply available to trade.",
    "Failed to account for the perfectly elastic nature of domestic demand for staple food products.",
    "Acted as a de facto subsidy for foreign consumers by lowering the global equilibrium price."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Export bans suppress domestic prices below world market levels. This reduces the marginal revenue for local farmers, causing them to shift resources to other crops and decreasing the future domestic supply of the protected staple—the opposite of food security."

  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "After Hurricane Katrina, economists generally opposed price ceilings on essential goods like ice and generators. The primary economic argument against these ceilings in a disaster context is that:",
  "options": [
    "Higher prices signal scarcity, encouraging conservation and incentivizing suppliers to transport goods into the affected area.",
    "Price ceilings are administratively impossible to enforce given the breakdown of local government and regulatory oversight.",
    "Disaster victims exhibit perfectly inelastic demand, meaning that price controls have no impact on the final quantity demanded.",
    "Market-clearing prices ensure an equitable distribution based on need rather than the ability to pay or physical proximity."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "High prices perform two functions: they ration demand (preventing hoarding) and incentivize supply (covering the high risk/cost of delivery to a disaster zone). A price ceiling creates a shortage by suppressing both of these market signals."
},
      {
  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, some governments implemented eviction moratoriums. While protecting current tenants, economists noted that these policies created unintended consequences such as:",
  "options": [
    "Reduced incentives for property maintenance and increased screening of future high-risk applicants.",
    "A shift toward perfectly inelastic housing supply, ensuring no change in the long-run quantity available.",
    "Immediate downward pressure on rental rates in neighboring markets not subject to the moratorium.",
    "Significant increases in capital investment in multi-family housing due to enhanced tenant stability."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Eviction moratoriums act as a price ceiling on the cost of non-payment. This reduces the net present value of the rental asset for the landlord, leading to deferred maintenance and a more selective 'flight to quality' when choosing future tenants to mitigate risk."

  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In the 1980s, New York City's taxi medallion system limited the number of cabs, driving medallion prices over $1 million. The collapse of these values following the entry of ride-sharing services demonstrates:",
  "options": [
    "The erosion of scarcity rents when technological innovation bypasses artificial quantity restrictions.",
    "The inherent superiority of price floors over quotas in stabilizing urban transportation markets.",
    "How government licensing ensures long-run economic efficiency by preventing market saturation.",
    "That producer surplus is invariant to changes in market entry barriers and technological shifts."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The medallion was a quota ($Q$ restriction) that created economic rent. Ride-sharing acted as a supply shock that bypassed the regulatory barrier, shifting the supply curve right and eliminating the scarcity rent that the high medallion prices represented."

  "type": "mcq",
  "question": "In 2012, France implemented a 75% marginal tax rate on incomes over €1 million. The policy was reversed in 2015 after tax revenue fell below projections. This outcome specifically illustrates:",
  "options": [
    "The Laffer Curve, where extreme marginal rates contract the tax base through capital and labor flight.",
    "The tendency of high-income labor supply to be perfectly inelastic regardless of marginal tax rates.",
    "The structural inefficiency of progressive taxation compared to proportional tax systems for revenue growth.",
    "The substitution effect being entirely offset by the income effect for workers in high-earning brackets."
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The 75% rate incentivized high-earners to relocate or reduce taxable activity. This demonstrates that when tax rates exceed a certain threshold, the contraction of the tax base (quantity) outweighs the increase in the tax rate (price), leading to a decline in total tax revenue."
