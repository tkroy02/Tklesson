    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a firm is earning positive economic profits, which of the following must also be true?",
        "options": [
          "Its total revenue is less than explicit costs and implicit costs.",
          "Its total revenue is greater than explicit costs but not implicit and explicit costs.",
          "It is earning accounting profits.",
          "Its explicit costs are greater than its implicit costs.",
          "It is earning accounting losses."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Positive economic profit means TR > (Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs). Since accounting profit = TR − Explicit Costs, accounting profit must exceed implicit costs, thus accounting profit is positive. The other options are false or not necessarily true."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose that price in a perfectly competitive industry decreases and it is now below minimum average total cost but remains above minimum average variable cost. Which of the following will occur in the short run?",
        "options": [
          "New firms will enter the industry.",
          "Firms will increase output so that marginal revenue equals the new price.",
          "Firms will produce the output at which average total cost is at a minimum.",
          "Firms will produce the output at which marginal cost equals the new price.",
          "Firms will not produce at all, since they will be unable to cover all their costs."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In short-run perfect competition, a firm will continue to produce if P ≥ AVC. Here, P is above AVC, so the firm will produce where P = MC (its profit-maximizing or loss-minimizing output). Entry does not occur if P < ATC, and firms do not shut down if P > AVC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for both a monopolistically competitive firm and a perfectly competitive firm in long-run equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "Marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue.",
          "Price is greater than marginal cost.",
          "Price is equal to average total cost.",
          "Price is equal to marginal cost.",
          "Marginal revenue is equal to average revenue."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium, both market structures earn zero economic profit, so P = ATC. Perfect competition has P = MC, but monopolistic competition has P > MC. Only (C) holds for both."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Iron ore is an important input in steelmaking. If the cost of iron ore increases, what are the likely effects on the equilibrium price and quantity in the market for steel? Assume a perfectly competitive market.",
        "options": [
          "Price decreases, Quantity increases",
          "No effect",
          "Price increases, Quantity increases",
          "Price increases, Quantity decreases",
          "Price decreases, Quantity decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Higher input costs shift the supply curve for steel leftward. In a competitive market, this raises equilibrium price and reduces equilibrium quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following scenarios will result in an increase in the market price for iron ore?",
        "options": [
          "The completion of a rail network allows iron ore producers to significantly reduce the cost of transporting the product to market.",
          "The wages paid to workers extracting iron ore fall as a depressed construction market reduces the demand for iron.",
          "A significant new deposit of iron ore is discovered.",
          "The cost of other building materials, such as lumber and concrete, falls.",
          "The wages paid to workers extracting iron ore increase, and at the same time a construction boom increases the demand for iron."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Rising wages increase production costs (supply shifts left), while a construction boom increases demand (demand shifts right). Both shifts individually raise price, so combined they will increase price. Quantity effect is ambiguous but price definitely rises."
