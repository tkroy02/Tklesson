      {

        "question": "In a market graph, a binding price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price. The resulting consumer surplus, compared to the free market, is:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Larger.",
          "Smaller.",
          "The same.",
          "Impossible to determine without knowing the elasticity."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "While a price ceiling lowers the price for those who can buy, it also creates a shortage, reducing the quantity sold. Consumer surplus could increase (if demand is very inelastic and the lower price effect dominates), decrease (if the reduced quantity effect dominates, especially with elastic demand), or stay the same in a special case. The net effect depends on the shapes of the supply and demand curves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume a tax is levied on the sellers of a good. If the demand for this good is perfectly inelastic and the supply is upward sloping, the economic burden of the tax falls:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Entirely on sellers.",
          "Entirely on buyers.",
          "More on sellers than buyers.",
          "Equally on buyers and sellers."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With perfectly inelastic demand, the quantity demanded does not change regardless of price. When a tax shifts the supply curve up, the new equilibrium occurs at the same quantity. Buyers pay the entire tax increase in the form of a higher price, while sellers continue to receive the same net price as before the tax. The entire burden is on buyers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A city imposes a tax on hotel rooms to fund tourism advertising. In the short run, the supply of hotel rooms is fixed (perfectly inelastic). Who bears the burden of this tax in the short run?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Hotel owners bear the entire burden.",
          "Tourists bear the entire burden.",
          "The burden is shared equally.",
          "The advertising agency bears the burden."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the short run, the number of hotel rooms is fixed (perfectly inelastic supply). With fixed supply, the supply curve is vertical. When a tax is imposed, the price consumers pay cannot rise above what the market will bear for the fixed quantity; instead, the price received by suppliers (hotel owners) must fall by the full amount of the tax. Therefore, suppliers bear the entire burden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the government's goal is to discourage consumption of a good (like cigarettes) with minimal administrative cost and no black market, the most efficient single policy is a:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Binding price ceiling.",
          "Binding price floor.",
          "Per-unit tax.",
          "Quota on production."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A per-unit tax increases the price to consumers, discouraging consumption (the intended goal). It is administratively simple (added to sales) and, because it operates through the price system, does not create a shortage that would fuel a black market (unlike a price ceiling or quota). A price floor would aim to raise, not lower, consumption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a supply and demand diagram, the total tax revenue collected by the government from a per-unit tax is represented by:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The deadweight loss triangle.",
          "A rectangle with a height equal to the tax per unit and a width equal to the quantity sold after the tax.",
          "The change in consumer surplus.",
          "The area between the old and new supply curves."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tax Revenue = (Tax per unit) * (Quantity sold with the tax). On a graph, the tax per unit is the vertical distance between the supply curves (or the price buyers pay minus the price sellers receive). The quantity sold is on the horizontal axis. The area of this rectangle represents the total revenue transferred from market participants to the government."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider a market with a very steep, inelastic demand curve and a relatively flat, elastic supply curve. The imposition of a per-unit tax will result in a price to buyers that:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Rises by almost the full amount of the tax.",
          "Rises by very little.",
          "Falls.",
          "Is impossible to predict."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When demand is very inelastic (steep), buyers are not very responsive to price changes. When supply is elastic (flat), sellers are very responsive. In this case, the tax burden falls heavily on the inelastic side—the buyers. Therefore, the price buyers pay will increase by almost the full amount of the tax, while the price sellers receive will fall only slightly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'black market' is most likely to arise as a direct consequence of:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A per-unit tax.",
          "A lump-sum tax on firms.",
          "A binding price ceiling.",
          "A subsidy to producers."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A binding price ceiling creates an artificial shortage at the legal price. Some consumers who value the good highly but cannot obtain it through official channels will be willing to pay more. This creates a profit opportunity for sellers to illegally sell the good at a higher price, leading to a black market. Taxes and subsidies affect prices but don't typically create such acute, illegal shortages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The opportunity cost of resources used to build a new public library, as evaluated in a cost-benefit analysis, is:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "The total dollar cost of construction.",
          "The value of the next-best alternative use of those resources (e.g., a new school or road).",
          "The future operating costs of the library.",
          "The amount of taxes collected to fund it."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The true economic cost of any action is the value of the forgone opportunity. In a cost-benefit analysis, the cost of building the library is not just the monetary outlay, but the value of what those resources (labor, concrete, land) could have produced if used in their next-best alternative project. This is the opportunity cost."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a subsidy is removed from a market (e.g., a subsidy for ethanol production), we expect the equilibrium price to _________ and the equilibrium quantity to _________.",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "increase; decrease",
          "decrease; increase",
          "increase; increase",
          "decrease; decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A subsidy acts like a negative cost, shifting the supply curve rightward (or the demand curve rightward if given to consumers). Removing the subsidy reverses this shift. The supply curve shifts leftward (costs effectively rise). This leads to a higher equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A key argument against using price controls to correct for a perceived 'unfair' high price is that they:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Are difficult for the government to enforce.",
          "Lead to inefficiencies (deadweight loss) and often create secondary problems like shortages.",
          "Always benefit producers at the expense of consumers.",
          "Require constant adjustment for inflation."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While price controls may be aimed at equity, economists emphasize their negative efficiency consequences. Binding price ceilings cause shortages, reduce quality, and lead to wasteful non-price rationing. Binding price floors cause surpluses and wasted resources. These deadweight losses often hurt the very groups the policy intends to help in the long run and create new problems."
