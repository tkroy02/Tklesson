      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolist is producing in the inelastic region of their demand curve, they will surely increase profit if they do which of the following?",
        "image": "images/mono_inelastic.png",
        "options": [
          "Increase quantity and decrease price",
          "Increase quantity and increase price",
          "Decrease quantity and not change price",
          "Decrease quantity and increase price",
          "Decrease quantity and decrease price"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In the inelastic portion of demand (|Ed| < 1), marginal revenue is negative. Reducing quantity increases total revenue (since MR < 0 means TR rises as Q falls) and lowers total cost, thereby increasing profit. The monopolist will raise price along the demand curve as quantity decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT true for a perfectly price discriminating monopoly?",
        "image": "images/price_discrimination.png",
        "options": [
          "The firm profit maximizes at the quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue",
          "The firm produces lower quantities than a single price monopoly",
          "The firm sells different units of output for different prices",
          "The firm is allocatively efficient when it produces the profit maximizing quantity",
          "There will be no consumer surplus for the product"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfect price discrimination results in the monopolist producing the allocatively efficient quantity (where P = MC), which is greater than the single-price monopoly quantity. All other statements are true: it profit maximizes where MR = MC (with MR = demand), charges different prices, is allocatively efficient, and captures all consumer surplus as producer surplus."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a monopolistically competitive firm is earning economic profits in the short run, what will happen to the firm’s demand curve and quantity of output in the long run?",
        "image": "images/monopolistic_comp_longrun.png",
        "options": [
          "Demand will shift left and output will decrease",
          "Demand will shift right and output will increase",
          "Demand will shift left and output will increase",
          "Demand will not change and output will decrease",
          "Demand will shift right and output will not change"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Short-run economic profits attract new firms into the market, reducing each existing firm's market share. This causes each firm's demand curve to shift left (and become more elastic). In long-run equilibrium, output decreases, price falls, and economic profit returns to zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose Riaz’s Radios is a profit-maximizing monopolistically competitive firm in the radio market and is currently in long-run equilibrium. If Riaz’s Radios has an average total cost of $6, and a marginal cost of $6, which of the following is necessarily true?",
        "image": "images/monopolistic_comp_riaz.png",
        "options": [
          "Riaz’s Radios will decrease revenue if production is increased",
          "Riaz’s Radios has inelastic demand at the profit-maximizing quantity",
          "Riaz’s Radios has a price of $9",
          "Riaz’s Radios has an average revenue of $8",
          "Riaz’s Radios has a marginal revenue greater than $7"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In monopolistic competition, P > MR. Given MR = MC = $6 (profit-max condition), P must be > $6. Average Revenue (AR) equals price, so AR > $6. Among the options, only AR = $8 satisfies AR > $6. Also, MR positive means demand is elastic, not inelastic (B is false). Revenue increases if output rises when MR > 0 (A is false). Specific prices of $9 or MR > $7 are not guaranteed (C and E are false)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following causes monopolies to be able to earn economic profits in the long run?",
        "image": "images/monopoly_longrun_profits.png",
        "options": [
          "Price above marginal cost",
          "High barriers to entry",
          "The creation of dead weight loss",
          "Marginal revenue is less than demand",
          "No need to advertise"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Monopolies can earn long-run economic profits only if barriers to entry prevent new firms from entering the market and competing away those profits. Price above marginal cost (A) is a result of monopoly power but does not guarantee long-run profits if entry is possible. Deadweight loss (C) is an inefficiency caused by monopoly but not the reason for sustained profits. MR < demand (D) is true for any imperfectly competitive firm but not the cause of long-run profits. Advertising (E) is unrelated to the persistence of monopoly profits."

        "question": "Take a look at this table for the only two appliance stores in town. Each store must decide whether to have a sale or not. The first number in each cell is the profit for Hufsa’s Houseware and the second number is the profit for Max’s Machines. Identify the Nash equilibrium for these firms.",

        "options": [
          "Both firms have a sale",

          "Both firms have no sale",
          "There is no Nash equilibrium"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Find mutual best responses: If Max chooses Sale, Hufsa's best response is No Sale ($4500 > $4000). If Hufsa chooses No Sale, Max's best response is Sale ($6500 > $6200). Thus, (No Sale, Sale) is a Nash equilibrium — neither firm can gain by changing strategy alone. All other strategy pairs leave at least one firm with an incentive to deviate."
