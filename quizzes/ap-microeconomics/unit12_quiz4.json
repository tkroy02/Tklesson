      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the firm increases its capital and decreases its labor and produces the same amount of bundt cakes, what happens to the marginal product of capital ($MP_K$) and the marginal product of labor ($MP_L$)?",
        "options": [
          "$MP_K$ doesn’t change; $MP_L$ decreases",
          "$MP_K$ decreases; $MP_L$ doesn’t change",
          "$MP_K$ decreases; $MP_L$ increases",
          "$MP_K$ increases; $MP_L$ decreases",
          "$MP_K$ increases; $MP_L$ doesn’t change"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When capital increases (holding output constant), the capital-labor ratio rises. More capital per worker means diminishing marginal returns to capital: $MP_K$ falls. Less labor per unit of capital means each remaining worker is more productive: $MP_L$ rises (due to the law of diminishing marginal returns in reverse when a factor becomes relatively scarce)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose a firm was interested in how much their revenue would change if they change the price of their good. Which of the following would a firm use to determine how its revenue changes based on the price elasticity of demand?",
        "options": [
          "Total profit test",
          "Total revenue test",
          "Price elasticity of supply",
          "Income elasticity of demand",
          "Cross-price elasticity of demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The total revenue test examines how total revenue (P × Q) changes when price changes, based on price elasticity of demand: if demand is elastic, price decrease raises TR; if inelastic, price decrease lowers TR. Other options relate to different elasticities or profit, not directly revenue changes from price changes."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The nation of Hamsterville has passed a law that from this day forth, nobody shall sell a bowl of gazpacho for more than \\$10 per bowl. Nobody really cares, however, because the equilibrium price of gazpacho in Hamsterville is \\$8. What is the term for the price control described above?",
        "options": [
          "A binding price floor",
          "A quota",
          "A non-binding price ceiling",
          "A non-binding price floor",
          "A binding price ceiling"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling is a legal maximum price. Here the maximum is \\$10, but the equilibrium is \\$8, so the ceiling is above equilibrium and has no effect—it's non-binding. A binding ceiling would be below equilibrium and create a shortage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is not correct for the perfectly competitive firm, in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "price = minimum average cost",
          "price = marginal revenue",
          "price = minimum average variable cost",
          "price = marginal cost",
          "normal profits"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In long-run perfect competition, firms earn zero economic profit (normal profit) where P = min ATC = MC = MR. P = min AVC is the shutdown point in the short run, not a long-run equilibrium condition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume the government establishes a new binding minimum wage. For a typical firm, which of the following will happen to the marginal resource cost (MRC) and the marginal revenue product (MRP) of the last worker hired?",
        "options": [
          "MRC Increase, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Increase, MRP Decrease",
          "MRC No Change, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Decrease, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Decrease, MRP Decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage raises MRC (wage). To maximize profit (MRP = MRC), the firm hires fewer workers. With fewer workers, the MRP of the last worker hired is higher due to diminishing marginal returns. Thus, both MRC and MRP increase."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these actions most obviously produces a positive externality?",
        "options": [
          "Keeping your yard clean and maintained",
          "Parking rusty, old cars on your front lawn",
          "Remodeling your kitchen",
          "Cutting to the front of the line at the movies",
          "Planting an herb garden in your private backyard"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A well-maintained yard benefits neighbors by improving neighborhood aesthetics and property values—a classic positive externality. Other options either produce negative externalities (rusty cars, cutting in line), private benefits only (remodeling kitchen), or limited private benefits (herb garden)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When consumption of a good generates a positive externality and government takes action to fix the problem created by this externality, what problem is the government most likely attempting to fix?",
        "options": [
          "The product is overproduced, given the social costs and benefits",
          "The subsidy for production of this good is too high",
          "Society wants government to eliminate the spillover costs",
          "Consumption of this good widens the income inequality gap",
          "The product is underproduced, given the social costs and benefits"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Positive externalities mean marginal social benefit > marginal private benefit. This leads to underconsumption and underproduction relative to the socially optimal level. Government intervention (subsidies, public provision) aims to increase consumption/production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume a perfectly competitive labor market. Which of the following correctly describes the individual firm’s demand curve for labor and the market demand curve for labor?",
        "options": [
          "Firm: Downward sloping, Market: Downward sloping",
          "Firm: Downward sloping, Market: Horizontal",
          "Firm: Horizontal, Market: Downward sloping",
          "Firm: Horizontal, Market: Horizontal",
          "Firm: Horizontal, Market: Upward sloping"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both the firm’s and market’s demand curves for labor are downward sloping. The firm’s demand is its MRP curve (diminishing marginal product). Market demand is the horizontal sum of all firms’ MRP curves, also downward sloping."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose there is an increase in both the supply and demand for personal computers. In the market for personal computers, we would expect",
        "options": [
          "the equilibrium quantity to rise and the equilibrium price to rise.",
          "the equilibrium quantity to rise and the equilibrium price to fall.",
          "the equilibrium quantity to rise and the equilibrium price to remain constant.",
          "the change in the equilibrium quantity to be ambiguous and the equilibrium price to rise.",
          "the equilibrium quantity to rise and the change in the equilibrium price to be ambiguous."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Both shifts increase quantity, so quantity rises unambiguously. Demand increase raises price; supply increase lowers price. Net effect on price depends on relative shift sizes, so price change is ambiguous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose there is an increase in both the supply and demand for personal computers. Further, suppose the supply of personal computers increases more than demand for personal computers. In the market for personal computers, we would expect",
        "options": [
          "the change in the equilibrium quantity to be ambiguous and the equilibrium price to fall.",
          "the equilibrium quantity to rise and the equilibrium price to rise.",
          "the equilibrium quantity to rise and the change in the equilibrium price to be ambiguous.",
          "the equilibrium quantity to rise and the equilibrium price to fall.",
          "the equilibrium quantity to rise and the equilibrium price to remain constant."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "If supply increases more than demand, the supply shift dominates the price effect. Quantity rises (both shifts increase quantity), but price falls because the downward pressure from increased supply outweighs upward pressure from increased demand."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A decrease (leftward shift) in the supply for a good will tend to cause",
        "options": [
          "an increase in the equilibrium price and quantity.",
          "a decrease in the equilibrium price and an increase in the equilibrium quantity.",
          "none of these answers.",
          "a decrease in the equilibrium price and quantity.",
          "an increase in the equilibrium price and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Decreased supply shifts supply left, raising price and lowering quantity demanded along the demand curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly competitive labor market, imposing a binding minimum wage will bring about what change(s) on the demand and supply graph?",
        "options": [
          "increase in wage, decrease in quantity of workers hired",
          "increase in wage, increase in quantity of workers hired",
          "decrease in wage, decrease in quantity of workers hired",
          "decrease in wage, increase in quantity of workers hired",
          "none of the above, imposing a binding minimum wage will have no effect on wage or the quantity of workers hired"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Binding minimum wage sets wage above equilibrium → wage rises, quantity of labor demanded falls, quantity supplied rises → surplus (unemployment). Employment (quantity hired) equals quantity demanded, which decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm hires two inputs, labor and capital, in perfectly competitive resource markets. The firm sells its product in a perfectly competitive market for $10 per unit. The marginal cost to hire each unit of capital is $150 per day, and the marginal product of labor is 10. Assuming the firm hires the least-cost combination of labor and capital, the firm's marginal product of capital and the daily wage per worker must be equal to which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Marginal product of capital must be 10 and the daily wage for labor must be $50.",
          "Marginal product of capital must be 10 and the daily wage for labor must be $100.",
          "Marginal product of capital must be 15 and the daily wage for labor must be $50.",
          "Marginal product of capital must be 15 and the daily wage for labor must be $75.",
          "Marginal product of capital must be 15 and the daily wage for labor must be $100."
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Cost minimization requires MP_L / w = MP_K / r. Given MP_L = 10, P = $10, MRP_L = MP_L × P = 100. In competitive labor market, wage = MRP_L = $100. For capital, r = $150, so MP_K must satisfy MRP_K = MP_K × 10 = $150 → MP_K = 15."

        "question": "Which of the following is the best example of a pure public good?",
        "options": [
          "A public fishing pond that only charges a fee to out-of-state residents",
          "A fire station that provides protection to the surrounding community",

          "Music downloads that cost $0.99 cents each"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A pure public good is non-excludable and non-rival. Fire protection for a community is non-excludable (all benefit) and largely non-rival (one more person protected doesn’t reduce protection for others)."
