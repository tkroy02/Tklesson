      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the firm increases its capital and decreases its labor and produces the same amount of bundt cakes, what happens to the marginal product of capital ($MP_K$) and the marginal product of labor ($MP_L$)?",
        "options": [
          "$MP_K$ doesn’t change; $MP_L$ decreases",
          "$MP_K$ decreases; $MP_L$ doesn’t change",
          "$MP_K$ decreases; $MP_L$ increases",
          "$MP_K$ increases; $MP_L$ decreases",
          "$MP_K$ increases; $MP_L$ doesn’t change"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When capital increases (holding output constant), the capital-labor ratio rises. More capital per worker means diminishing marginal returns to capital: $MP_K$ falls. Less labor per unit of capital means each remaining worker is more productive: $MP_L$ rises (due to the law of diminishing marginal returns in reverse when a factor becomes relatively scarce)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose a firm was interested in how much their revenue would change if they change the price of their good. Which of the following would a firm use to determine how its revenue changes based on the price elasticity of demand?",
        "options": [
          "Total profit test",
          "Total revenue test",
          "Price elasticity of supply",
          "Income elasticity of demand",
          "Cross-price elasticity of demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The total revenue test examines how total revenue (P × Q) changes when price changes, based on price elasticity of demand: if demand is elastic, price decrease raises TR; if inelastic, price decrease lowers TR. Other options relate to different elasticities or profit, not directly revenue changes from price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The nation of Hamsterville has passed a law that from this day forth, nobody shall sell a bowl of gazpacho for more than \\$10 per bowl. Nobody really cares, however, because the equilibrium price of gazpacho in Hamsterville is \\$8. What is the term for the price control described above?",
        "options": [
          "A binding price floor",
          "A quota",
          "A non-binding price ceiling",
          "A non-binding price floor",
          "A binding price ceiling"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling is a legal maximum price. Here the maximum is \\$10, but the equilibrium is \\$8, so the ceiling is above equilibrium and has no effect—it's non-binding. A binding ceiling would be below equilibrium and create a shortage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is not correct for the perfectly competitive firm, in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "price = minimum average cost",
          "price = marginal revenue",
          "price = minimum average variable cost",
          "price = marginal cost",
          "normal profits"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In long-run perfect competition, firms earn zero economic profit (normal profit) where P = min ATC = MC = MR. P = min AVC is the shutdown point in the short run, not a long-run equilibrium condition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume the government establishes a new binding minimum wage. For a typical firm, which of the following will happen to the marginal resource cost (MRC) and the marginal revenue product (MRP) of the last worker hired?",
        "options": [
          "MRC Increase, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Increase, MRP Decrease",
          "MRC No Change, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Decrease, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Decrease, MRP Decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage raises MRC (wage). To maximize profit (MRP = MRC), the firm hires fewer workers. With fewer workers, the MRP of the last worker hired is higher due to diminishing marginal returns. Thus, both MRC and MRP increase."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these actions most obviously produces a positive externality?",
        "options": [
          "Keeping your yard clean and maintained",
          "Parking rusty, old cars on your front lawn",
          "Remodeling your kitchen",
          "Cutting to the front of the line at the movies",
          "Planting an herb garden in your private backyard"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A well-maintained yard benefits neighbors by improving neighborhood aesthetics and property values—a classic positive externality. Other options either produce negative externalities (rusty cars, cutting in line), private benefits only (remodeling kitchen), or limited private benefits (herb garden)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When consumption of a good generates a positive externality and government takes action to fix the problem created by this externality, what problem is the government most likely attempting to fix?",
        "options": [
          "The product is overproduced, given the social costs and benefits",
          "The subsidy for production of this good is too high",
          "Society wants government to eliminate the spillover costs",
          "Consumption of this good widens the income inequality gap",
          "The product is underproduced, given the social costs and benefits"
        ],
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Positive externalities mean marginal social benefit > marginal private benefit. This leads to underconsumption and underproduction relative to the socially optimal level. Government intervention (subsidies, public provision) aims to increase consumption/production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume a perfectly competitive labor market. Which of the following correctly describes the individual firm’s demand curve for labor and the market demand curve for labor?",
        "options": [
          "Firm: Downward sloping, Market: Downward sloping",
          "Firm: Downward sloping, Market: Horizontal",
          "Firm: Horizontal, Market: Downward sloping",
          "Firm: Horizontal, Market: Horizontal",
          "Firm: Horizontal, Market: Upward sloping"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In perfect competition, the firm’s demand curve for labor is its MRP curve, which is downward sloping due to diminishing marginal returns. The firm perceives the labor supply curve as horizontal at the market wage (wage-taker), but the market demand for labor is the horizontal sum of individual firms’ MRP curves, which is downward sloping."
