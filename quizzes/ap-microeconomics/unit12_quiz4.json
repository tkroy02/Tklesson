      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the firm increases its capital and decreases its labor and produces the same amount of bundt cakes, what happens to the marginal product of capital ($MP_K$) and the marginal product of labor ($MP_L$)?",
        "options": [
          "$MP_K$ doesn’t change; $MP_L$ decreases",
          "$MP_K$ decreases; $MP_L$ doesn’t change",
          "$MP_K$ decreases; $MP_L$ increases",
          "$MP_K$ increases; $MP_L$ decreases",
          "$MP_K$ increases; $MP_L$ doesn’t change"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When capital increases (holding output constant), the capital-labor ratio rises. More capital per worker means diminishing marginal returns to capital: $MP_K$ falls. Less labor per unit of capital means each remaining worker is more productive: $MP_L$ rises (due to the law of diminishing marginal returns in reverse when a factor becomes relatively scarce)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Suppose a firm was interested in how much their revenue would change if they change the price of their good. Which of the following would a firm use to determine how its revenue changes based on the price elasticity of demand?",
        "options": [
          "Total profit test",
          "Total revenue test",
          "Price elasticity of supply",
          "Income elasticity of demand",
          "Cross-price elasticity of demand"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The total revenue test examines how total revenue (P × Q) changes when price changes, based on price elasticity of demand: if demand is elastic, price decrease raises TR; if inelastic, price decrease lowers TR. Other options relate to different elasticities or profit, not directly revenue changes from price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The nation of Hamsterville has passed a law that from this day forth, nobody shall sell a bowl of gazpacho for more than $10 per bowl. Nobody really cares, however, because the equilibrium price of gazpacho in Hamsterville is $8. What is the term for the price control described above?",
        "options": [
          "A binding price floor",
          "A quota",
          "A non-binding price ceiling",
          "A non-binding price floor",
          "A binding price ceiling"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A price ceiling is a legal maximum price. Here the maximum is $10, but the equilibrium is $8, so the ceiling is above equilibrium and has no effect—it's non-binding. A binding ceiling would be below equilibrium and create a shortage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is not correct for the perfectly competitive firm, in the long run?",
        "options": [
          "price = minimum average cost",
          "price = marginal revenue",
          "price = minimum average variable cost",
          "price = marginal cost",
          "normal profits"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In long-run perfect competition, firms earn zero economic profit (normal profit) where P = min ATC = MC = MR. P = min AVC is the shutdown point in the short run, not a long-run equilibrium condition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assume the government establishes a new binding minimum wage. For a typical firm, which of the following will happen to the marginal resource cost (MRC) and the marginal revenue product (MRP) of the last worker hired?",
        "options": [
          "MRC Increase, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Increase, MRP Decrease",
          "MRC No Change, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Decrease, MRP Increase",
          "MRC Decrease, MRP Decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A binding minimum wage raises MRC (wage). To maximize profit (MRP = MRC), the firm hires fewer workers. With fewer workers, the MRP of the last worker hired is higher due to diminishing marginal returns. Thus, both MRC and MRP increase."
