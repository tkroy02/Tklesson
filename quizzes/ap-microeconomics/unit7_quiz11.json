    "topic": "Monopoly Demand Elasticity, Monopoly Inefficiency",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What range of a monopoly is elastic?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "when price falls and total revenue increases (before MR hits 0)",
          "when price rises and total revenue decreases (after MR becomes negative)",
          "when marginal revenue equals marginal cost (profit-maximizing point)",
          "when total revenue is maximized (MR = 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monopoly's demand is elastic where MR > 0, which occurs when a price decrease raises total revenue. This is the range before MR reaches zero, where the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1 in absolute value."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What range of a monopoly is inelastic?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "when price falls and total revenue falls (when MR is negative)",
          "when price falls and total revenue increases (when MR is positive)",
          "when total revenue is maximized (MR = 0)",
          "when marginal revenue equals marginal cost (profit-maximizing point)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monopoly’s demand is inelastic when MR < 0, meaning a price decrease reduces total revenue. This occurs in the lower portion of the demand curve beyond the revenue-maximizing output."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are monopolies inefficient?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "They produce less than the socially optimal quantity",
          "They charge a price equal to marginal cost",
          "They earn zero economic profit in the long run",
          "They produce where average total cost is minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monopolies are inefficient because they restrict output below the competitive level (where P = MC), creating deadweight loss and failing to achieve allocative efficiency."
