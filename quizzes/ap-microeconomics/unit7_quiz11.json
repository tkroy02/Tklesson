    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What range of a monopoly is elastic?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "when price falls and total revenue increases (before MR hits 0)",
          "when price rises and total revenue decreases (after MR becomes negative)",
          "when marginal revenue equals marginal cost (profit-maximizing point)",
          "when total revenue is maximized (MR = 0)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monopoly's demand is elastic where MR > 0, which occurs when a price decrease raises total revenue. This is the range before MR reaches zero, where the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1 in absolute value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What range of a monopoly is inelastic?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "when price falls and total revenue falls (when MR is negative)",
          "when price falls and total revenue increases (when MR is positive)",
          "when total revenue is maximized (MR = 0)",
          "when marginal revenue equals marginal cost (profit-maximizing point)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A monopoly’s demand is inelastic when MR < 0, meaning a price decrease reduces total revenue. This occurs in the lower portion of the demand curve beyond the revenue-maximizing output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are monopolies inefficient?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "They produce less than the socially optimal quantity",
          "They charge a price equal to marginal cost",
          "They earn zero economic profit in the long run",
          "They produce where average total cost is minimized"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Monopolies are inefficient because they restrict output below the competitive level (where P = MC), creating deadweight loss and failing to achieve allocative efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When price equals marginal cost (produces at maximum efficiency), this is:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "allocatively efficient",
          "productively efficient",
          "economically profitable",
          "a natural monopoly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Allocative efficiency occurs when P = MC, meaning resources are allocated in a way that maximizes total surplus (consumer + producer surplus) and eliminates deadweight loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a firm produces at the lowest costs (minimum of ATC curve), this is:",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "productively efficient",
          "allocatively efficient",
          "economically profitable",
          "socially optimal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Productive efficiency occurs when goods are produced at the lowest possible cost per unit, which happens at the minimum point of the average total cost curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to surplus in a monopoly?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "consumer surplus falls and there is deadweight loss",
          "consumer surplus rises and deadweight loss disappears",
          "producer surplus falls to zero",
          "total surplus is maximized"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a monopoly, higher prices and lower output reduce consumer surplus. Some surplus is transferred to producers, but part is lost entirely—this is deadweight loss, so total surplus is not maximized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a graph with a natural monopoly look like?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "average total cost is always decreasing",
          "marginal cost is always above average total cost",
          "demand is perfectly elastic",
          "price equals marginal cost at all output levels"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A natural monopoly exists when economies of scale are so large that ATC declines over the entire relevant range of output. One firm can supply the market at lower cost than multiple firms could."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the government typically regulate monopolies?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "By setting price ceilings — taxes tend to reduce output",
          "By imposing price floors to raise consumer surplus",
          "By subsidizing production to increase monopoly profits",
          "By encouraging collusion to stabilize prices"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price ceilings (e.g., P = MC) can move a monopoly toward allocative efficiency. Taxes usually raise marginal cost, further reducing output and worsening deadweight loss."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the socially optimal price?",

          "price = average total cost (zero economic profit)",
          "price = marginal revenue (profit maximization)",
          "price = average variable cost (shutdown point)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The socially optimal price is where P = MC, achieving allocative efficiency and maximizing total surplus with no deadweight loss."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fair-return (break even) price?",

          "price = average variable cost (shutdown point)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The fair-return price is where P = ATC, allowing the firm to cover all costs including a normal profit, resulting in zero economic profit."
