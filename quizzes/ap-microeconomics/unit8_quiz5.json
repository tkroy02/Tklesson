        "question": "Economic rent is defined as",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "payment for the use of land only",
          "payment above what is necessary to keep a factor in its current use",
          "the total earnings of a factor of production",
          "the minimum payment required to prevent a factor from moving to another use"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic rent is any payment to a factor that exceeds its opportunity cost (transfer earnings)—the extra amount it receives because its supply is fixed or inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transfer earnings are",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the total income of a factor",
          "the minimum payment needed to keep a factor in its current use",
          "the same as economic rent",
          "payments made when a factor switches jobs"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transfer earnings are what a factor could earn in its next‑best alternative use—the payment necessary to prevent it from moving."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the supply of a factor is perfectly elastic, its income consists entirely of",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "economic rent",
          "transfer earnings",
          "monopoly profit",
          "consumer surplus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With perfectly elastic supply, the factor will leave if paid less than its opportunity cost, so all payment is transfer earnings (no economic rent)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the supply of a factor is perfectly inelastic, its income consists entirely of",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "economic rent",
          "transfer earnings",
          "normal profit",
          "implicit costs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With perfectly inelastic supply, the factor cannot move elsewhere, so its entire payment is economic rent (no transfer earnings needed to retain it)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run in perfect competition, economic profit is zero because",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "firms earn only normal profit",
          "revenue equals explicit costs only",
          "firms make accounting losses",
          "barriers to entry prevent new firms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zero economic profit means total revenue equals total costs (explicit + implicit), so firms earn a normal profit—just enough to keep them in the industry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Normal profit is best described as",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "accounting profit minus implicit costs",
          "the minimum return needed to keep an entrepreneur in business",
          "economic profit plus explicit costs",
          "profit earned by monopolies"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Normal profit is the opportunity cost of entrepreneurship—the return necessary to keep the entrepreneur from shifting resources to another venture. It is included in total costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would earn substantial economic rent?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "A worker with skills easily transferable to many jobs",
          "A plot of land in a prime downtown location",
          "A machine with many close substitutes",
          "A factor with perfectly elastic supply"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Prime downtown land is fixed in supply (inelastic), so its price largely consists of economic rent—payment above what's needed to keep it in use."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The functional distribution of income refers to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "how income is divided among individuals",
          "how income is divided among factors of production (wages, rent, interest, profit)",
          "how income is distributed across regions",
          "the share of income going to the richest 1%"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Functional distribution breaks down total income by factor payments: wages (labor), rent (land), interest (capital), and profit (entrepreneurship)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The marginal productivity theory of distribution states that",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "each factor is paid its marginal revenue product",
          "profits are distributed equally among workers",
          "land earns no economic rent",
          "wages are set by collective bargaining only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In competitive factor markets, each factor receives payment equal to the value of its marginal product (MRP), explaining how income is distributed among factors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "$500,000",
          "$4.5 million",
          "$5 million",
          "$0"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Economic rent = actual earnings − transfer earnings. Here, $5 million − $500,000 = $4.5 million."
