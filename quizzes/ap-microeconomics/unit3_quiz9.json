    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a double‑shift scenario where both supply and demand increase, what can be definitively stated about the new equilibrium quantity?",
        "options": [
          "The effect on equilibrium quantity is indeterminate",
          "The new equilibrium quantity will be higher",
          "The new equilibrium quantity will be lower",
          "The new equilibrium quantity will remain unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Both increases in demand and supply put upward pressure on quantity. Therefore, **equilibrium quantity will definitely rise**. Price effect is indeterminate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following expressions correctly represents the formula for calculating the cross‑price elasticity of demand between goods X and Y?",
        "options": [
          "(% change in quantity supplied of X) / (% change in price of Y)",
          "(% change in quantity demanded of X) / (% change in income)",
          "(% change in quantity demanded of X) / (% change in price of Y)",
          "(% change in price of X) / (% change in quantity demanded of X)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity of demand = **%∆Qd of good X / %∆P of good Y**. Measures how demand for X responds to price changes of Y."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If three consumers in a market have individual demand schedules for a product where at a price of \\$5, they demand 10, 15, and 20 units respectively, what happens to the market demand curve if a fourth consumer enters with a demand of 25 units at the same price?",
        "options": [
          "The market demand curve shifts rightward by 25 units",
          "The market demand curve shifts leftward",
          "The market demand curve becomes more elastic",
          "The market demand curve becomes steeper"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Market demand is the sum of individual quantities at each price. Adding a consumer increases quantity demanded at every price → demand curve **shifts right**. At P = \\$5, shift magnitude = 25 units."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Assuming that movie tickets have an elastic demand, what would most likely happen to a cinema’s total revenue if it raises ticket prices?",
        "options": [
          "The cinema’s total revenue would increase due to higher earnings per ticket sold despite potentially selling fewer tickets.",
          "The cinema’s total revenue would stay constant as increases in ticket prices balance out with reduced number of tickets sold.",
          "The cinema’s total revenue would decrease as fewer people buy tickets at higher prices resulting in loss outweighing gains from increased prices.",
          "The effect on the cinema’s total revenues cannot be determined without information regarding their cost structure and other sources of income."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Elastic demand (|Ed| > 1) → %∆Qd > %∆P. Price increase causes proportionally larger drop in quantity sold → **total revenue decreases**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What would most likely happen to the equilibrium price if there is an increase in demand while the supply remains perfectly inelastic?",
        "options": [
          "The equilibrium price would increase.",
          "There would be no change in the equilibrium price or quantity.",
          "The equilibrium quantity would decrease.",
          "The equilibrium price would decrease."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic supply → vertical supply curve. Increase in demand raises price but quantity stays the same → **price increases**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer spends all income on goods A and B. If the price of A falls, the substitution effect will encourage the consumer to:",
        "options": [
          "Buy more of A and less of B",
          "Buy less of A and more of B",
          "Buy more of both goods",
          "Buy less of both goods"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substitution effect (holding utility constant): when price of A falls, A becomes relatively cheaper → consumer substitutes toward A → **buys more A, less B**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the income elasticity of demand for a good is negative, the good is:",
        "options": [
          "A luxury good",
          "A necessity",
          "An inferior good",
          "A normal good"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Negative income elasticity → **inferior good**. Demand falls as income rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When two goods are complements, their cross‑price elasticity of demand is:",
        "options": [
          "Positive",
          "Negative",
          "Zero",
          "Greater than 1"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Complements: price of one ↑ → demand for the other ↓ → **negative cross‑price elasticity**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer’s budget line shifts outward parallelly. This could result from:",
        "options": [
          "A decrease in the price of one good",
          "An increase in income",
          "A change in consumer preferences",
          "An increase in the price of both goods"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A **parallel outward shift** occurs when **income increases** with no change in relative prices."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If MUx/Px > MUy/Py, a utility‑maximizing consumer should:",
        "options": [
          "Buy more X and less Y",
          "Buy more Y and less X",
          "Buy the same amounts",
          "Spend all income on X"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "MUx/Px > MUy/Py means the consumer gets more marginal utility per dollar from X → should **increase consumption of X, decrease Y** until MUx/Px = MUy/Py."
