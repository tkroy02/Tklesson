      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At present output levels, a firm in a perfectly competitive industry is in the following position: output = 1000 units, market price = \\$3, total cost = \\$6000, fixed cost = \\$2000, marginal cost = \\$3. To achieve optimum output, the firm should:",
        "options": [
          "Reduce output but keep producing.",
          "Increase its selling price.",
          "Leave output unchanged.",
          "Reduce output to zero.",
          "Increase output but keep its price constant."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "P = MC = $3, so profit is maximized (or loss minimized) at current output. Since P = MC, no change is needed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which option shows the distinguishing feature between perfect and monopolistic competition?",
        "options": [
          "In perfect competition, there exist homogeneous products but in monopolistic competition, the products are different from one another.",
          "Barriers to entry are present in perfect competition but in monopolistic competition, there are no barriers to entry.",
          "Monopolistic competition faces many barriers to entry but there is no such problem in perfect competition.",
          "In perfect competition goods sold by the sellers are different from one another while the goods sold in the monopolistic market are identical."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Product homogeneity is the key distinction: perfect competition has identical products; monopolistic competition has differentiated products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the long run in perfect competition:",
        "options": [
          "The price equals the total revenue.",
          "Firms are allocatively inefficient.",
          "Firms are productively efficient.",
          "The price equals total cost.",
          "Firms face a downward-sloping demand curve."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In long-run equilibrium, firms produce at the minimum of ATC, achieving productive efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Firms in perfect competition face a:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic demand curve.",
          "Perfectly inelastic demand curve.",
          "Perfectly elastic supply curve.",
          "Perfectly inelastic supply curve."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfectly competitive firms are price takers; they can sell any quantity at the market price, so their demand curve is horizontal (perfectly elastic)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In perfect competition:",
        "options": [
          "Short-run abnormal profits are competed away by firms leaving the industry.",
          "Short-run abnormal profits are competed away by firms entering the industry.",
          "Short-run abnormal profits are competed away by the government.",
          "Short-run abnormal profits are competed away by greater advertising."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Positive economic profit attracts new firms, increasing supply, lowering price, and eliminating profit in the long run."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, firms in perfect competition will still produce provided:",
        "options": [
          "The price covers average variable cost.",
          "The price covers variable costs.",
          "The price covers average fixed cost.",
          "The price covers fixed costs."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Short-run production rule: continue operating if P ≥ AVC."

        "question": "In the long-run equilibrium in perfect competition:",
        "options": [
          "Price = average cost = marginal cost.",
          "Price = average cost = total cost.",
          "Price = marginal revenue = total cost.",
          "Total revenue = total variable cost."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Long-run equilibrium satisfies P = MC (profit max) and P = ATC (zero economic profit)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a perfectly competitive firm:",
        "options": [
          "Total revenue is a straight line.",
          "Price is greater than marginal revenue.",
          "Price equals total revenue.",
          "Price equals total cost."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since P is constant, TR = P × Q is a straight line through the origin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A perfectly competitive firm's short-run supply curve is:",
        "options": [
          "The portion of its ATC curve above AVC.",
          "The portion of its MC curve above AVC.",
          "The portion of its AVC curve above MC.",
          "Its entire MC curve.",
          "Horizontal at the market price."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The firm supplies output where P ≥ min AVC, so the supply curve is the MC curve above the AVC minimum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the short run, a perfectly competitive firm will continue to produce as long as:",
        "options": [
          "Price exceeds average total cost.",
          "Price exceeds average fixed cost.",
          "Price exceeds average variable cost.",
          "Total revenue exceeds total fixed cost.",
          "Marginal revenue is positive."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Short-run production decision: produce if P ≥ AVC; shut down if P < AVC."
