      {

        "question": "Suppose that a monopolist knows the following information:<br><br>Price = $10.00, Quantity = 1500, MR = $7.00, Fixed Cost = $6000, ATC = $5.00, MC = $5.00<br><br>The monopolist could maximize profits by",

        "options": [
          "staying at the current price and output.",
          "lowering price and increasing output.",
          "shutting down.",
          "lowering price and leaving output unchanged.",
          "raising price and leaving output unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At current output, MR ($7) > MC ($5), so the monopolist can increase profit by producing more where MR = MC. To sell more units, the monopolist must lower price along the downward-sloping demand curve. Since P ($10) > ATC ($5), the firm earns economic profit and should not shut down."

          "$200"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Marginal Cost = Change in Total Cost / Change in Quantity. Between Q=100 and Q=200: TC at 100 meals = TFC + TVC = $150 + $300 = $450. TC at 200 meals = $150 + $500 = $650. Change in TC = $650 - $450 = $200. Change in Q = 100. MC = $200 / 100 = $2.00 per meal."

          "$275"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Marginal revenue is calculated as the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. Moving from 100 to 200 meals: Total revenue increases from $325 to $600, a change of $275. Quantity increases by 100 meals. Thus MR = $275 / 100 = $2.75 per meal."

          "400 meals at $2.50 per meal.",
          "700 meals at $1.75 per meal."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Profit is maximized where MR = MC. Checking intervals: From 500 to 600 meals, MR = ($1200 - $1125)/100 = $0.75, MC = ($905 - $830)/100 = $0.75 → MR = MC exactly at 600 meals. At 700 meals, MR = ($1225 - $1200)/100 = $0.25, MC = ($995 - $905)/100 = $0.90 → MR < MC, so profit would fall. Therefore, 600 meals at $2.00 is the profit-maximizing point."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The profit-maximizing output is 600 meals (where MR = MC). At 600 meals: Price = $2.00, Total Revenue = $1200, Total Variable Cost = $905, Total Fixed Cost = $150, so Total Cost = $1055. Profit = TR - TC = $1200 - $1055 = $145. (Note: 500 meals also yields $145 profit, but 600 meals is where MR = MC, confirming profit maximization.)"
