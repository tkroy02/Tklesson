      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In economics, 'capital' refers to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "money used to start a business",
          "human skills and education",
          "manufactured resources used to produce goods and services",
          "stocks and bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Capital in factor market context means physical capital: tools, machinery, buildings, and other produced means of production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The interest rate is the price paid for",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the use of land",
          "the use of labor",
          "the use of money",
          "consumer goods"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Interest is the payment for borrowing money (or the return for lending it), representing the price of credit in capital markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The present value of a future sum of money is",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "higher when the interest rate is higher",
          "lower when the interest rate is higher",
          "unaffected by the interest rate",
          "the same as its future value"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Present value = Future Value / (1 + r)ⁿ. A higher interest rate (r) discounts future money more heavily, lowering present value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm will invest in a capital project if",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the present value of expected returns exceeds the cost",
          "the future value is positive",

          "it has enough cash on hand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Investment decisions compare the present value of expected future profits (marginal revenue product of capital) to the initial cost of the investment."

        "options": [
          "the wage rate",
          "the price of land",
          "the real interest rate",
          "the level of government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The loanable funds model shows how the supply of savings and demand for borrowing interact to set the equilibrium real interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the demand for loanable funds will lead to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "a lower interest rate and more investment",
          "a higher interest rate and less investment",
          "a higher interest rate and more investment",
          "no change in interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increased demand for borrowing shifts the demand curve for loanable funds right, raising the interest rate and increasing the quantity of funds loaned (investment)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The nominal interest rate equals",

          "inflation rate only",
          "real interest rate only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nominal interest rate ≈ real interest rate + expected inflation rate (Fisher equation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the expected rate of return on an investment is 8% and the interest rate is 5%, the firm should",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "invest, because return > cost of borrowing",
          "not invest, because return < cost of borrowing",
          "invest only if the interest rate rises",
          "wait for inflation to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the expected return (8%) exceeds the interest rate (cost of borrowing, 5%), the investment is profitable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would increase the supply of loanable funds?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Higher government borrowing",
          "Increased household saving",
          "A decrease in investment demand",
          "Higher inflation expectations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More saving increases the supply of loanable funds, shifting the supply curve right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Crowding out occurs when",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "private investment decreases due to increased government borrowing",
          "private saving increases due to tax cuts",
          "interest rates fall because of more saving",
          "firms invest more because of higher returns"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crowding out: higher government borrowing increases demand for loanable funds, raising interest rates and reducing private investment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a country imposes tariffs on imported goods, how would domestic employment and domestic product prices likely change?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Domestic employment decreases, Domestic product prices increase",
          "Domestic employment increases, Domestic product prices increase",
          "Domestic employment increases, Domestic product prices decrease",
          "Domestic employment decreases, Domestic product prices decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tariffs raise the price of imports, making domestic goods relatively cheaper and increasing demand for them. This higher demand for domestic products can increase output and employment in domestic industries, but domestic product prices may also rise due to reduced foreign competition and higher input costs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors would most likely shift the derived demand for labor to the right?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Stricter government regulations.",
          "A decrease in technological efficiency.",
          "An increase in consumer demand for the firm’s product.",
          "Higher wages in the industry."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Derived demand for labor comes from demand for the final product. An increase in consumer demand for the product raises the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor, shifting labor demand right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In what way can a subsidy provided by the government directly to workers for skill development affect the factor market?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "It can create a surplus of unskilled labor as workers leave those positions for training opportunities.",
          "It can reduce overall employment as firms may rely more on technology than subsidized skilled workers.",
          "It can lead to an increase in human capital and potentially shift the supply curve for skilled labor to the right.",
          "It can result in higher wages without changing employment levels or productivity rates."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A subsidy for skill development (e.g., training, education) increases workers’ human capital, making them more productive and increasing the supply of skilled labor, shifting the supply curve right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive labor market has achieved optimal input allocation, which of the following must be true?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "MPL/MPK = w/r",
          "MPL/w = MPK/r",
          "MPL - w = MPK - r",
          "MPL × w = MPK × r"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The least‑cost rule for optimal input allocation states that MP per dollar spent on each input must be equal: MPL / w = MPK / r."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between marginal product and marginal revenue product?",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "Marginal product and marginal revenue product are always equal",
          "Marginal product and marginal revenue product are unrelated",
          "When marginal product increases, so does marginal revenue product",
          "When marginal decreases, so does marginal revenue product"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "MRP = MPL × MR (or MPL × P under perfect competition). Thus, if MPL increases (and MR or P remains constant), MRP also increases. Similarly, a decrease in MPL typically decreases MRP."
