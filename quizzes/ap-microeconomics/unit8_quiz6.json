      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In economics, 'capital' refers to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "money used to start a business",
          "human skills and education",
          "manufactured resources used to produce goods and services",
          "stocks and bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Capital in factor market context means physical capital: tools, machinery, buildings, and other produced means of production."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The interest rate is the price paid for",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the use of land",
          "the use of labor",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Interest is the payment for borrowing money (or the return for lending it), representing the price of credit in capital markets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "the same as its future value"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Present value = Future Value / (1 + r)ⁿ. A higher interest rate (r) discounts future money more heavily, lowering present value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A firm will invest in a capital project if",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "the present value of expected returns exceeds the cost",
          "the future value is positive",
          "the interest rate is zero",
          "it has enough cash on hand"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Investment decisions compare the present value of expected future profits (marginal revenue product of capital) to the initial cost of the investment."

          "the level of government spending"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The loanable funds model shows how the supply of savings and demand for borrowing interact to set the equilibrium real interest rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An increase in the demand for loanable funds will lead to",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "a lower interest rate and more investment",
          "a higher interest rate and less investment",
          "a higher interest rate and more investment",
          "no change in interest rates"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Increased demand for borrowing shifts the demand curve for loanable funds right, raising the interest rate and increasing the quantity of funds loaned (investment)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The nominal interest rate equals",

          "real interest rate only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nominal interest rate ≈ real interest rate + expected inflation rate (Fisher equation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the expected rate of return on an investment is 8% and the interest rate is 5%, the firm should",
        "image": null,
        "options": [
          "invest, because return > cost of borrowing",
          "not invest, because return < cost of borrowing",
          "invest only if the interest rate rises",
          "wait for inflation to increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the expected return (8%) exceeds the interest rate (cost of borrowing, 5%), the investment is profitable."

          "Higher inflation expectations"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "More saving increases the supply of loanable funds, shifting the supply curve right."

        "question": "Crowding out occurs when",
        "image": null,

          "firms invest more because of higher returns"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crowding out: higher government borrowing increases demand for loanable funds, raising interest rates and reducing private investment."
