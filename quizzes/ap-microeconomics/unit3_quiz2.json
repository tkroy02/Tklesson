    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors would make the demand for a good more elastic?",
        "options": [
          "The good is a necessity",
          "There are many close substitutes",
          "The time period considered is very short",
          "The good represents a small portion of consumers' budgets"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Demand is more elastic when there are **many close substitutes** (consumers can easily switch). Necessities, short time periods, and small budget shares tend to make demand more inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a consumer spends all their income on two goods, X and Y, and the price of X falls, what happens to the budget constraint?",
        "options": [
          "It shifts outward in a parallel fashion",
          "It pivots outward along the X‑axis",
          "It shifts inward along the Y‑axis",
          "It becomes steeper"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A decrease in the price of good X increases the maximum quantity of X affordable (if all income is spent on X) → budget line **pivots outward along the X‑axis**, slope = –Px/Py becomes flatter."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A tax is imposed on a good with perfectly inelastic demand. Who bears the burden of the tax?",
        "options": [
          "Producers bear the entire burden",
          "Consumers bear the entire burden",
          "The burden is shared equally",
          "The government bears the burden"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic demand → quantity demanded does not change when price changes. Sellers can pass the full tax to buyers via higher prices → **consumers bear the full tax burden**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the price elasticity of supply is 0.8, a 10% increase in price will lead to a:",
        "options": [
          "8% increase in quantity supplied",
          "12.5% increase in quantity supplied",
          "0.8% increase in quantity supplied",
          "80% increase in quantity supplied"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Price elasticity of supply = %∆Qs / %∆P. Given Es = 0.8 and %∆P = 10%, %∆Qs = 0.8 × 10% = **8% increase**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A consumer maximizes utility when:",
        "options": [
          "Total utility is maximized",
          "Marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for all goods",
          "The budget constraint is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve",
          "Both B and C"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Utility is maximized when **MUX/PX = MUY/PY** (equal marginal utility per dollar) **and** the chosen bundle lies on the budget line tangent to the highest indifference curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If demand is unit elastic, a price increase will cause total revenue to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Change in an indeterminate direction"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Unit elastic demand (|Ed| = 1) → %∆Qd = %∆P → total revenue remains unchanged when price changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario describes a Giffen good?",
        "options": [
          "Demand increases as income rises",
          "Demand decreases as price rises",
          "Demand increases as price rises",
          "Demand is perfectly inelastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A **Giffen good** is an inferior good for which the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, leading to an upward‑sloping demand curve: **quantity demanded rises when price rises**."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the cross‑price elasticity between coffee and tea is +0.3, and the price of coffee rises by 20%, what happens to the quantity demanded of tea?",
        "options": [
          "Increases by 6%",
          "Decreases by 6%",
          "Increases by 0.15%",
          "Decreases by 0.15%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cross‑price elasticity = %∆Qd of tea / %∆P of coffee. +0.3 = %∆Qd / 20% → %∆Qd = 0.3 × 20% = **6% increase** (substitutes)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The price of movie tickets rises from \\$10 to \\$12, and quantity demanded falls from 200 to 160. Using the midpoint formula, what is the price elasticity of demand?",
        "options": [
          "0.8",
          "1.0",
          "1.2",
          "1.5"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Midpoint formula: Ed = [(Q2 – Q1) / ((Q2+Q1)/2)] / [(P2 – P1) / ((P2+P1)/2)] = [–40 / 180] / [2 / 11] = (–0.222) / (0.1818) ≈ –1.22 → |Ed| ≈ **1.2**? Wait, math: Avg Q = 180, %∆Q = –40/180 = –22.22%. Avg P = 11, %∆P = 2/11 = 18.18%. Ed = –22.22% / 18.18% ≈ –1.22 → |Ed| ≈ 1.22. That’s closest to **1.2** (option C)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a good accounts for a very small portion of a consumer’s budget, demand for that good is likely to be:",
        "options": [
          "Elastic",
          "Inelastic",
          "Unit elastic",
          "Perfectly elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a good represents a **small budget share**, consumers are less responsive to price changes → demand tends to be **inelastic**."
