      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a step-up transformer, which of the following remains constant between the primary and secondary coils (assuming an ideal transformer)?",
        "options": [
          "Voltage",
          "Current",
          "Electric Power",
          "Magnetic Flux Density"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For ideal transformers: $P_p = P_s$ (power conservation). Voltage increases, current decreases proportionally, but $V_pI_p = V_sI_s$ remains constant. Magnetic flux density is not necessarily constant across both coils."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary cause of \"Copper Losses\" in a transformer?",
        "options": [
          "The realignment of magnetic domains in the core.",
          "The resistance of the wire used in the coils.",
          "Magnetic field lines that do not link the two coils.",
          "Eddy currents induced in the casing."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Copper losses (also called $I^2R$ losses) result from electrical resistance in the copper windings. Power dissipated as heat: $P_{loss} = I_p^2R_p + I_s^2R_s$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A transformer has 500 turns on the primary and 2500 turns on the secondary. What is the voltage ratio ($V_p : V_s$)?",
        "options": [
          "$1 : 5$",
          "$5 : 1$",
          "$1 : 25$",
          "$25 : 1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Turns ratio $N_p:N_s = 500:2500 = 1:5$. Voltage ratio equals turns ratio: $V_p:V_s = N_p:N_s = 1:5$. This is a step-up transformer (secondary voltage 5× primary)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can a transformer NOT function when connected to a steady DC battery?",
        "options": [
          "DC current is too weak to create a magnetic field.",
          "The battery would explode due to high resistance.",
          "Induction requires a changing magnetic flux, which DC does not provide.",
          "DC current only flows through the secondary coil."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Faraday's Law: $\\varepsilon = -d\\Phi/dt$. With steady DC, current is constant → constant magnetic flux → $d\\Phi/dt = 0$ → no induced EMF in secondary. Only during switch-on/off transients does DC produce changing flux."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "\"Magnetostriction\" is the phenomenon that causes:",
        "options": [
          "The transformer to step up voltage.",
          "The physical vibration and \"hum\" of the transformer core.",
          "The melting of the insulation.",
          "The attraction between the primary and secondary wires."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Magnetostriction: ferromagnetic materials change dimensions when magnetized. In AC transformers, the core expands/contracts at twice the AC frequency (120 Hz for 60 Hz), causing audible vibration heard as a hum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To reduce energy loss from \"Eddy Currents,\" the transformer core should be:",
        "options": [
          "A solid block of soft iron.",
          "Made of a non-magnetic material like plastic.",
          "Laminated with insulated sheets.",
          "Wrapped in copper foil."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Laminated cores use thin steel sheets insulated from each other (often with varnish). This increases electrical resistance to circulating eddy currents, reducing $I^2R$ heating while maintaining good magnetic properties."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a step-down transformer ($V_p > V_s$), which coil will typically have thicker wire?",
        "options": [
          "The primary coil.",
          "The secondary coil.",
          "Both are always the same thickness.",
          "Neither; they use hollow tubes."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Step-down transformers have $N_s < N_p$ and $I_s > I_p$ (power conservation). Higher current in secondary requires thicker wire to handle increased current density and reduce $I^2R$ losses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the efficiency of a transformer as the load (output current) increases significantly?",
        "options": [
          "Efficiency remains 100%.",
          "Efficiency decreases due to increased Joule heating in the wires.",
          "Efficiency increases because the core is more active.",
          "Efficiency stays exactly at 90%."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Efficiency $\\eta = P_{out}/P_{in}$. As load current increases, copper losses ($I^2R$) increase quadratically, reducing efficiency. Transformers are typically most efficient at 70-80% of rated load."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the secondary coil of a transformer is left as an \"open circuit\" (not connected to anything), the current in the primary coil will be:",
        "options": [
          "Infinite.",
          "Zero (in an ideal case).",
          "Higher than if a load were connected.",
          "Reversing direction constantly."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ideal case: no load → no secondary current → no power transfer → primary current zero. Real case: small magnetizing current flows to establish magnetic flux in core (typically 1-5% of rated current)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The \"turns ratio\" is defined as $N_s / N_p$. If this ratio is 0.5, the transformer is a:",
        "options": [
          "Step-up transformer.",
          "Step-down transformer.",
          "Isolation transformer.",
          "Autotransformer."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$N_s/N_p = 0.5$ means $N_s = 0.5N_p$, so $V_s = 0.5V_p$ (assuming same flux linkage). This halves the voltage, making it a step-down transformer. Isolation transformers have $N_s/N_p = 1$."

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) The transformer equation $V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p$, 2) Power conservation $P_p = P_s$, 3) Types of energy losses (copper, core, flux leakage), 4) Real-world design considerations.",
