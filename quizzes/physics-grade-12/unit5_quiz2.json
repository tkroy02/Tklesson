    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for the magnetic force ($F_B$) acting on a charge $q$ moving with velocity $\\vec{v}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$?",
        "options": [
          "$F = qvB\\cos\\theta$",
          "$F = qvB\\sin\\theta$",
          "$F = qE + qvB$",
          "$F = mv^2/r$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The magnetic force magnitude is given by $F = qvB\\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{B}$. The force is maximum when $\\vec{v} \\perp \\vec{B}$ ($\\theta = 90^\\circ$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a proton is moving due East in a magnetic field directed straight down into the Earth, what is the direction of the force?",
        "options": [
          "North",
          "South",
          "East",
          "Upward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the right-hand rule for positive charges: point fingers in direction of velocity (East), curl them toward magnetic field direction (down), thumb points in force direction (North). For protons (positive), force is North."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A charged particle enters a uniform magnetic field at an angle of $0^\\circ$ (parallel to the field). The resulting path of the particle is:",
        "options": [
          "A circle.",
          "A helix.",
          "A straight line.",
          "A parabola."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When $\\vec{v}$ is parallel to $\\vec{B}$, $\\theta = 0^\\circ$, so $\\sin\\theta = 0$ and magnetic force $F = 0$. The particle continues with constant velocity in a straight line."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the net Lorentz force on a charge $q$ that is moving through both an electric field $\\vec{E}$ and a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\vec{F} = q\\vec{v}B$",
          "$\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E}$",
          "$\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$",
          "$\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{E} - vB)$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The complete Lorentz force is $\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$, combining both electric and magnetic forces on a moving charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An electron and a proton enter a magnetic field with the same velocity perpendicular to the field. Which one will have a smaller orbital radius?",
        "options": [
          "The proton.",
          "The electron.",
          "They will have the same radius.",
          "Neither will curve."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Radius $r = \\frac{mv}{qB}$. The electron has much smaller mass ($m_e \\approx 1/1836 \\, m_p$) but same charge magnitude, so its radius is much smaller despite having the same speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The magnetic force on a moving charge does zero work because:",
        "options": [
          "The force is always parallel to the displacement.",
          "The force is always perpendicular to the velocity.",
          "The magnetic field has no energy.",
          "The charge is too small."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Magnetic force $\\vec{F} = q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$ is always perpendicular to velocity. Work $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{d}$ requires force component along displacement. Since $\\vec{F} \\perp \\vec{v}$, no work is done and kinetic energy remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the speed of a particle and double the magnetic field strength, the magnetic force increases by a factor of:",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "4",
          "8",
          "It remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$F = qvB\\sin\\theta$. Doubling $v$ gives factor of 2, doubling $B$ gives factor of 2. Combined effect: $2 \\times 2 = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle enters a magnetic field at an angle of $45^\\circ$. Its motion will be a combination of linear and circular motion, resulting in a:",
        "options": [
          "Spiral",
          "Helix",
          "Cycloid",
          "Ellipse"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When velocity has components both perpendicular and parallel to $\\vec{B}$, the perpendicular component causes circular motion, while the parallel component causes linear motion along the field. The combination is helical motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which device uses the balance of electric and magnetic forces to select particles of a specific speed?",
        "options": [
          "Cyclotron",
          "Velocity Selector",
          "Solenoid",
          "Transformer"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A velocity selector uses perpendicular $\\vec{E}$ and $\\vec{B}$ fields. When $qE = qvB$, net force is zero for particles with speed $v = E/B$. Only particles with this speed pass through undeflected."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2.0\\text{ C}$ charge moves at $10\\text{ m/s}$ perpendicular to a $0.5\\text{ T}$ field. What is the magnitude of the force?",
        "options": [
          "$1.0\\text{ N}$",
          "$5.0\\text{ N}$",
          "$10\\text{ N}$",
          "$20\\text{ N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$F = qvB\\sin\\theta = 2.0 \\times 10 \\times 0.5 \\times \\sin 90^\\circ = 2.0 \\times 10 \\times 0.5 \\times 1 = 10\\text{ N}$."

      "scoreMessages": {
        "90": "Excellent! You have mastered the magnetic force on moving charges, including direction rules, path determination, and applications like velocity selectors.",
        "70": "Very good! Solid understanding of magnetic forces. Review the right-hand rule for force direction and how velocity components relative to the field affect particle trajectories.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) The magnetic force formula $F = qvB\\sin\\theta$, 2) Using the right-hand rule for force direction, 3) Different paths (straight, circular, helical), 4) The Lorentz force combination.",
        "0": "Start with the fundamentals: Review the magnetic force equation, practice the right-hand rule for different charge types, and understand why magnetic forces do no work."
