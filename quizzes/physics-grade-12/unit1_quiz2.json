    "topic": "Advanced Mechanics",
    "duration": 45,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a system where only conservative forces do work, which of the following remains constant?",
        "options": [
          "The sum of kinetic and potential energy.",
          "The kinetic energy of the system.",
          "The potential energy of the system.",
          "The momentum of each individual particle."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the principle of Conservation of Mechanical Energy. $E_{total} = K + U$. While $K$ and $U$ can transform into each other, their sum remains constant if no non-conservative forces (like friction) do work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The potential energy function for a certain force is given by U(x) = ax² - bx. What is the expression for the force F(x)?",
        "options": [
          "F(x) = b - 2ax",
          "F(x) = 2ax - b",
          "F(x) = ax³ / 3 - bx² / 2",
          "F(x) = -2ax"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Force is the negative gradient of potential energy: $F = -dU/dx$. Differentiating $ax^2 - bx$ gives $2ax - b$. Multiplying by $-1$ gives $b - 2ax$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle is in 'stable equilibrium' at a certain point x₀. Which of the following must be true at that point?",
        "options": [
          "dU/dx = 0 and d²U/dx² > 0",
          "dU/dx = 0 and d²U/dx² < 0",
          "U(x) is at a maximum value.",
          "The force at that point is at its maximum."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, the force (and thus the first derivative of U) is zero. For stability, the potential energy must be at a local minimum, which requires a positive second derivative (concave up)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.0 kg ball is dropped from a height of 10 m. If 5.0 J of energy is lost to air resistance, what is the kinetic energy of the ball just before it hits the ground?",
        "options": [
          "191 J",
          "196 J",
          "201 J",
          "5 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial $U = mgh = 2.0 \\times 9.8 \\times 10 = 196\\text{ J}$. Final $K = U_{initial} - W_{friction} = 196 - 5 = 191\\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring-loaded toy gun uses a spring with k = 100 N/m. If the spring is compressed 0.1 m, what is the maximum speed of a 0.02 kg projectile?",
        "options": [
          "7.07 m/s",
          "5.00 m/s",
          "10.0 m/s",
          "0.50 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elastic $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = 0.5 \\times 100 \\times (0.1)^2 = 0.5\\text{ J}$. Setting $U = K$: $0.5 = 0.5 \\times 0.02 \\times v^2$. $v^2 = 50$, so $v = \\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07\\text{ m/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes an 'unstable equilibrium' point on a potential energy graph?",
        "options": [
          "A local maximum on the U(x) vs x graph.",
          "A local minimum on the U(x) vs x graph.",
          "A point where the slope is constant and non-zero.",
          "The point of lowest possible potential energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At a local maximum, any small displacement results in a force that pushes the particle further away from the equilibrium point, making it unstable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The gravitational potential energy of a two-body system (like Earth and a satellite) is U = -GMm/r. Why is it negative?",
        "options": [
          "Because work must be done by an external force to move the bodies infinitely far apart.",
          "Because gravity is a repulsive force at large distances.",
          "Because kinetic energy is always negative in space.",
          "It is a mathematical error in the derivation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The zero-point of potential energy is defined at $r = \\infty$. Since gravity is attractive, you must add energy to separate the masses; therefore, they have less than zero energy when they are close together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the potential energy of a system is constant over a region of space, the force on a particle in that region is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Constant and non-zero",
          "Proportional to the displacement",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Force is the derivative of potential energy ($F = -dU/dx$). The derivative of a constant is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pendulum is released from an angle θ. At the bottom of its swing, its tension is T. The work done by the tension force during the swing is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "T multiplied by the arc length",
          "mgh",
          "Negative T multiplied by the length of the string"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The tension force is always perpendicular to the instantaneous displacement (the arc) of the pendulum bob. Therefore, $\\vec{T} \\cdot d\\vec{r} = 0$ at all times."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block slides down a curved, frictionless ramp. The final speed of the block at the bottom depends on:",
        "options": [
          "The vertical height of the ramp only.",
          "The exact shape of the curve.",
          "The total distance traveled along the ramp surface.",
          "The angle of the ramp at the starting point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the ramp is frictionless, only gravity (a conservative force) does work. The change in kinetic energy depends only on the change in vertical potential energy ($mgh$), regardless of the path shape."
