    "topic": "Quantum Mechanics",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental process that creates the continuous part of the X-ray spectrum?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons being absorbed by the nucleus.",
          "High-speed electrons slowing down as they pass near a nucleus.",
          "Electrons jumping from the L-shell to the K-shell.",
          "Protons being ejected from the target."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bremsstrahlung ('braking radiation'): electrons decelerate in nuclear Coulomb field, emitting photons with continuous energy range (up to electron's kinetic energy). Produces smooth background in X-ray spectrum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an X-ray tube, if the accelerating potential is $V$, what is the maximum energy a single X-ray photon can have?",
        "options": [
          "$hf$",
          "$eV$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$",
          "$mc^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Electron gains kinetic energy $KE = eV$ from potential difference. Maximum photon energy = electron's entire KE (in single collision): $E_{max} = hf_{max} = eV$. Duane-Hunt law: $\\lambda_{min} = hc/(eV)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'minimum wavelength' ($\\lambda_{min}$) in an X-ray spectrum corresponds to:",
        "options": [
          "The lowest energy photon.",
          "The electron that lost the least amount of energy.",
          "An electron that gave up its entire kinetic energy in a single collision.",
          "The temperature of the filament."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda_{min}$ = shortest wavelength = highest frequency = maximum photon energy. Occurs when electron loses all KE to single photon. Shorter wavelengths impossible - violates energy conservation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following will decrease the minimum wavelength ($\\lambda_{min}$) of the produced X-rays?",
        "options": [
          "Increasing the filament current.",
          "Decreasing the target's atomic number.",
          "Increasing the accelerating voltage.",
          "Cooling the target material."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda_{min} \\propto 1/V$. Higher voltage → faster electrons → higher possible photon energy → shorter $\\lambda_{min}$. Filament current affects intensity (photon count), not maximum energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a graph of X-ray intensity vs. wavelength, the sharp 'spikes' or peaks are called:",
        "options": [
          "Bremsstrahlung radiation.",
          "Thermal radiation.",
          "Characteristic radiation.",
          "Gamma radiation."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Characteristic lines: discrete wavelengths specific to target material. From inner-shell electron transitions. Bremsstrahlung = continuous background. Gamma rays come from nucleus, not electron transitions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to increase the number of X-rays produced without changing their energy, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase the tube voltage.",
          "Increase the filament current.",
          "Change the target material.",
          "Decrease the distance to the target."
        ],
        "explanation": "Filament current controls electron emission rate → controls tube current → controls X-ray intensity (photons/sec). Voltage controls photon energies. Distance affects intensity at detector but not production rate.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "X-rays are part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This means they travel at what speed in a vacuum?",
        "options": [
          "$340 \\text{ m/s}$",
          "$9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "$3.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$",
          "Variable speeds depending on frequency."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "All electromagnetic waves travel at $c = 3.00\\times 10^8\\ \\text{m/s}$ in vacuum. Speed depends only on medium, not frequency. Sound = 340 m/s, $g$ = acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the efficiency of an X-ray tube very low (usually $< 1\\%$)?",
        "options": [
          "Most electrons miss the target.",
          "Most of the electron's kinetic energy is converted into heat in the target.",
          "X-rays are absorbed by the glass tube.",
          "The filament takes too much power."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Electrons undergo many collisions, losing energy gradually as heat (~99%). Only ~1% of electron KE converts to X-rays via bremsstrahlung. Targets need active cooling (water/oil)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Duane-Hunt limit ($hc/\\lambda_{min} = eV$) is a proof of:",
        "options": [
          "The wave nature of light.",
          "The conservation of momentum.",
          "The particle (quantum) nature of light.",
          "The theory of relativity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Shows photon energy $E = hf$ is quantized, not continuous. Electron's kinetic energy $eV$ converts to photon energy $hf_{max}$ in discrete packets. Classical wave theory couldn't explain sharp cutoff."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Characteristic X-rays are produced when:",
        "options": [
          "An incident electron knocks an inner-shell electron out of a target atom.",
          "A proton hits the filament.",
          "The target material melts.",
          "The magnetic field is turned off."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Incident electron creates vacancy in inner shell (e.g., K-shell). Outer-shell electron drops into vacancy, emitting X-ray photon with energy = shell difference. Produces discrete spectral lines unique to element."
