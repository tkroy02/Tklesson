    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Compton scattering event, what happens to the wavelength of the incident photon after it hits the electron?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It increases.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Photon loses energy to electron → lower frequency → longer wavelength ($\\lambda' > \\lambda$). Conservation: $hf + m_ec^2 = hf' + E_e'$ where $E_e' > m_ec^2$ → $hf' < hf$ → $\\lambda' > \\lambda$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which conservation laws are obeyed during a Compton collision?",
        "options": [
          "Conservation of energy only.",
          "Conservation of momentum only.",
          "Both conservation of energy and momentum.",
          "Neither; energy is converted to mass."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Treated as relativistic elastic collision. Energy: $hf + m_ec^2 = hf' + E_e'$. Momentum: $\\vec{p}_\\gamma = \\vec{p}_\\gamma' + \\vec{p}_e'$ (vector sum). These yield Compton formula $\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\\cos\\theta)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the electron involved in the collision?",
        "options": [
          "It is absorbed by the photon.",
          "It remains stationary.",
          "It recoils with kinetic energy gained from the photon.",
          "It turns into a positron."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Electron gains kinetic energy from photon and recoils at angle $\\phi$. Recoil energy: $K_e = hf - hf'$. Scattered photon and recoil electron directions are correlated (not independent)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The change in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) depends primarily on which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "The intensity of the light.",
          "The initial energy of the photon.",
          "The angle at which the photon is scattered.",
          "The temperature of the target."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Compton formula: $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda' - \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\\cos\\theta)$. Independent of initial photon energy! $\\Delta\\lambda$ depends only on scattering angle $\\theta$ (0° to 180°)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At which scattering angle will the photon experience the maximum shift in wavelength?",
        "options": [
          "$0^\\circ$ (Forward scattering)",
          "$45^\\circ$",
          "$90^\\circ$",
          "$180^\\circ$ (Backscattering)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$\\Delta\\lambda_{max} = \\frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\\cos180^\\circ) = \\frac{2h}{m_ec} = 0.00486\\ \\text{nm}$. Head-on collision maximizes momentum transfer. At $\\theta=0^\\circ$: $\\Delta\\lambda=0$ (no collision)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a photon is scattered at $0^\\circ$ (it passes straight through), the change in wavelength is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximum.",
          "Zero.",
          "Equal to the Compton wavelength.",
          "Infinite."
        ],
        "explanation": "$\\theta=0^\\circ$ → $\\cos0^\\circ=1$ → $\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_ec}(1-1)=0$. No interaction occurred or photon was undeflected. Actually corresponds to no scattering event.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Compton Effect not usually observed with visible light?",
        "options": [
          "Visible light doesn't have momentum.",
          "Visible light photons are too large.",
          "The wavelength shift is so small that it is only detectable when the initial wavelength is already very short (like X-rays).",
          "Visible light only reflects off electrons."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\Delta\\lambda_{max} \\approx 0.005\\ \\text{nm}$. For visible light ($\\lambda \\approx 500\\ \\text{nm}$), shift is ~0.001% → undetectable. For X-rays ($\\lambda \\approx 0.1\\ \\text{nm}$), shift is ~5% → easily measurable."

        "options": [
          "$3.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m}$",
          "$2.43 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$",
          "$6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ m}$",
          "$1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda_C = \\frac{h}{m_ec} = \\frac{6.626\\times 10^{-34}}{(9.11\\times 10^{-31})(3.00\\times 10^8)} = 2.426\\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{m}$. Appears in Compton formula. For proton: $\\lambda_{C,p} \\approx 1.32\\times 10^{-15}\\ \\text{m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the results of the Compton Effect, photons have:",
        "options": [
          "Mass but no momentum.",
          "Momentum but no mass.",
          "Neither mass nor momentum.",
          "Both mass and momentum."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Compton scattering proves photons carry momentum $p = h/\\lambda$. Momentum transfer to electron is measurable. Photons are massless ($m=0$) but have momentum via $E=pc$. Classical waves couldn't explain this."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the scattered photon has less energy than the incident photon, what must be true about its frequency ($f$)?",
        "options": [
          "$f_{scattered} > f_{incident}$",
          "$f_{scattered} = f_{incident}$",
          "$f_{scattered} < f_{incident}$",
          "$f_{scattered} = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$E = hf$ → $E' < E$ → $hf' < hf$ → $f' < f$. Energy loss = frequency decrease. Example: 100 keV X-ray scattered at 90° → 95.5 keV → frequency drops from $2.4\\times 10^{19}$ Hz to $2.3\\times 10^{19}$ Hz."

        "90": "Excellent! Mastery of Compton scattering including angle dependence, conservation principles, wavelength shift calculations, and experimental significance for proving photon particle properties.",
