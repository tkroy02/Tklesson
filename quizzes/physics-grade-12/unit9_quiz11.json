    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the simple addition of velocities ($u' = u + v$) invalid at relativistic speeds?",
        "options": [
          "Because it violates the principle of conservation of energy.",
          "Because it would allow relative speeds to exceed the speed of light $c$.",
          "Because it doesn't account for air resistance.",
          "Because it only works in one spatial dimension."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Classical velocity addition has no upper limit. If you added $0.9c$ to $0.9c$, you'd get $1.8c$, which is impossible according to special relativity. The relativistic formula ensures that the resultant speed never exceeds $c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spaceship moves away from Earth at $v = 0.6c$. From the ship, a probe is launched forward at $u' = 0.6c$ (relative to the ship). According to an Earth observer, the speed of the probe is:",
        "options": [
          "$1.2c$",
          "$0.88c$",
          "$0.6c$",
          "$0.95c$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Use the relativistic velocity addition formula: $u = \\frac{u' + v}{1 + \\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$.\nHere, $v=0.6c$, $u'=0.6c$.\n$u = \\frac{0.6c + 0.6c}{1 + (0.6)(0.6)} = \\frac{1.2c}{1.36} \\approx 0.882c$.\nEven though $0.6c+0.6c=1.2c$ classically, relativity gives $\\approx 0.88c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a spaceship is moving at $v = 0.8c$ relative to Earth and shines a laser beam forward (speed of light $c$ relative to the ship), what speed does an Earth observer measure for the laser light?",
        "options": [
          "$1.8c$",
          "$c$",
          "$0.8c$",
          "$1.25c$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a critical test of the formula. Let $u' = c$ (light speed relative to the ship).\n$u = \\frac{c + 0.8c}{1 + \\frac{(c)(0.8c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{1.8c}{1 + 0.8} = \\frac{1.8c}{1.8} = c$.\nThe speed of light is invariant—all observers measure it as $c$, regardless of the motion of the source. This is the second postulate of special relativity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relativistic velocity addition formula reduces to the classical formula ($u = u' + v$) under what condition?",
        "options": [
          "When $v$ is very close to $c$.",
          "When both $u'$ and $v$ are very small compared to $c$.",
          "When one of the velocities is zero.",
          "It never reduces to the classical formula."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If $u' \\ll c$ and $v \\ll c$, then the term $\\frac{u'v}{c^2}$ in the denominator is approximately zero. The formula becomes $u \\approx \\frac{u' + v}{1 + 0} = u' + v$. This is why classical addition works perfectly fine for everyday speeds like cars or planes."

        "question": "Two particles are fired directly towards each other. Particle A moves at $0.7c$ to the right, and Particle B moves at $0.7c$ to the left, as seen in the lab frame. What is the speed of Particle A as measured by Particle B?",
        "options": [
          "$1.4c$",
          "$0.7c$",
          "$0.94c$",
          "$0c$ (they are at rest relative to each other)"
        ],
        "explanation": "This is a head-on approach. In B's frame, the lab is moving to the right at $v = 0.7c$. In the lab frame, A's velocity is $u = +0.7c$. We want $u'$, A's velocity in B's frame.\nUse the formula solving for $u'$: $u' = \\frac{u - v}{1 - \\frac{uv}{c^2}}$.\n$u' = \\frac{0.7c - (-0.7c)}{1 - \\frac{(0.7c)(-0.7c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{1.4c}{1 + 0.49} = \\frac{1.4c}{1.49} \\approx 0.94c$.\nThey do not see each other approaching at $1.4c$, but at $0.94c$.",
        "answer": "C"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $u' = 0.4c$ and $v = 0.3c$, both in the same direction, what is the relativistic sum $u$?",
        "options": [
          "$0.7c$",
          "$0.63c$",
          "$0.58c$",
          "$1.0c$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Calculation: $u = \\frac{0.4c + 0.3c}{1 + (0.4)(0.3)} = \\frac{0.7c}{1.12} \\approx 0.625c$.\nThe classical sum is $0.7c$, but the relativistic sum is slightly less due to the denominator term $>1$."

        "question": "What is the maximum possible relative speed between two objects, as measured by either one, if they are launched in opposite directions from a common point, each at $0.9c$ in some inertial frame?",
        "options": [
          "$1.8c$",
          "$0.9c$",
          "$0.994c$",
          "$c$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is similar to the head-on problem. Using the formula with $u = 0.9c$ and $v = 0.9c$ (with opposite signs):\n$u' = \\frac{0.9c - (-0.9c)}{1 - \\frac{(0.9c)(-0.9c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{1.8c}{1 + 0.81} = \\frac{1.8c}{1.81} \\approx 0.994c$.\nNo matter how high the individual speeds are (as long as they are less than $c$), their relative speed will always be less than $c$."

        "options": [
          "The velocity of the object in the 'primed' frame.",
          "The velocity of the 'primed' frame relative to the 'unprimed' frame.",
          "The final resultant velocity.",
          "The speed of light."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Standard notation: $v$ is the constant velocity of the moving (primed) frame S' relative to the stationary (unprimed) frame S. $u'$ is the velocity of an object as measured in frame S'. $u$ is the velocity of that same object as measured in frame S."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle is moving at $0.5c$ relative to the lab. Another particle is moving at $0.5c$ in the exact opposite direction relative to the lab. What is their speed of approach according to the lab frame?",
        "options": [
          "$c$ (by classical addition)",
          "$1.0c$",
          "$0.8c$",
          "$0.5c$"
        ],
        "explanation": "**Caution:** This question asks for the speed of approach *in the lab frame*, not in the frame of either particle. In the lab frame, we simply add their speeds relative to us: $0.5c + 0.5c = 1.0c$. This is the *closing speed* or *separation rate*, which can be greater than $c$ and does not violate relativity because no single object is moving faster than $c$, and no information is being transmitted at that rate. The *relative speed* (what one particle measures for the other) is found via the relativistic formula and is less than $c$ (~0.8c).",
        "answer": "B"

      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "The relativity of simultaneity.",
          "The invariance of the speed of light.",
          "Time dilation.",
          "Mass-energy equivalence."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The constancy of the speed of light is the second postulate. The fact that plugging $u' = c$ into the relativistic velocity addition formula always yields $u = c$, regardless of $v$, is a mathematical confirmation of this postulate. It shows that the theory is self-consistent and that light's speed is the ultimate speed limit and invariant."

        "90": "Excellent! Mastery of relativistic velocity addition: You can apply the formula correctly to solve for any variable, understand its derivation from the Lorentz transformations, know why it supersedes classical addition, and grasp subtle distinctions like closing speed vs. relative speed. You see its direct link to the invariance of $c$.",
        "70": "Very good! Solid understanding of velocity addition. Key review areas: 1) Careful application of the formula, especially with opposite directions (signs), 2) The distinction between *closing speed* (can be >c) and *relative speed* (always <c), 3) How the formula guarantees $c$ is the limit, 4) Its reduction to the classical formula at low speeds.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) Memorizing the standard formula $u = \\frac{u' + v}{1 + \\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$, 2) Practicing straightforward calculations with velocities in the same direction, 3) Understanding that the result is always less than $c$, 4) Knowing that light speed $c$ is the same for all observers.",
        "0": "Start with the basics: Learn that you cannot simply add speeds at relativistic velocities. The correct formula is $u = \\frac{u' + v}{1 + \\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$. Practice using it for simple cases where all speeds are in the same direction."
