      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which experiment most directly challenged the Thomson 'Plum Pudding' model by showing that atoms have a dense, positive core?",
        "options": [
          "The Double Slit Experiment",
          "The Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment",
          "The Photoelectric Effect",
          "The Stern-Gerlach Experiment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rutherford's 1911 gold foil experiment: α-particles deflected at large angles → small, dense, positive nucleus. Thomson's model (electrons in uniform positive 'pudding') predicted only small-angle scattering."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Bohr model of the atom, what happens when an electron moves from an excited state to the ground state?",
        "options": [
          "The atom absorbs a photon of arbitrary energy.",
          "A photon is emitted with energy equal to the difference between the levels.",
          "The electron's charge changes from negative to positive.",
          "The electron spirals into the nucleus and disappears."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bohr's postulate: $hf = E_i - E_f$. Emission: higher → lower energy level → photon released. Absorption: lower → higher → photon absorbed. Solved classical radiation problem (accelerating charges should radiate continuously)."

          "The product nucleus has a higher binding energy per nucleon than the reactants.",

        "explanation": "Binding energy per nucleon: H (0), D (1.1 MeV/n), T (2.8 MeV/n), $^4$He (7.1 MeV/n). Fusion to heavier nuclei (up to Fe-56: 8.8 MeV/n) increases binding energy → mass defect → energy release."
