      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the SI unit of capacitance, the Farad (F)?",
        "options": [
          "1 Coulomb per Volt (C/V)",
          "1 Joule per Coulomb (J/C)",
          "1 Newton per Coulomb (N/C)",
          "1 Volt per Meter (V/m)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capacitance is defined by the ratio $C = Q/V$, hence 1 Farad equals 1 Coulomb of stored charge per Volt of potential difference."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a parallel-plate capacitor, what is the effect of doubling the plate area $A$ while keeping the separation $d$ constant?",
        "options": [
          "The capacitance doubles.",
          "The capacitance is halved.",
          "The capacitance quadruples.",
          "The capacitance remains unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to $C = \\epsilon_0 A / d$, capacitance is directly proportional to the surface area of the plates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A dielectric material with constant $\\kappa > 1$ is inserted between the plates of a capacitor. What happens to the capacitance?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of $\\kappa$.",
          "It decreases by a factor of $1/\\kappa$.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The presence of a dielectric reduces the effective electric field, allowing more charge to be stored at the same voltage, effectively multiplying $C$ by $\\kappa$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A capacitor is connected to a battery. If the plates are pulled further apart while remaining connected, which quantity stays constant?",
        "options": [
          "Potential difference ($V$)",
          "Stored charge ($Q$)",
          "Capacitance ($C$)",
          "Electric field ($E$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because it is connected to a battery, the potential difference (voltage) is fixed by the battery's EMF regardless of physical changes to the capacitor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the energy stored in a capacitor ($U$) change if the voltage across it is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of 4.",
          "It increases by a factor of 2.",
          "It decreases by a factor of 2.",
          "It remains constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy is proportional to the square of the voltage ($U = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$), so doubling $V$ results in $2^2 = 4$ times the energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the equivalent capacitance of two identical capacitors ($C$) connected in parallel?",
        "options": [
          "2C",
          "C/2",
          "C",
          "C²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel connection increases the total plate area, so $C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2$. For two identical capacitors, this is $2C$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A capacitor is charged and then isolated. If the distance between plates is tripled, what happens to the stored charge $Q$?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant.",
          "It triples.",
          "It is reduced to 1/3.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an isolated system (disconnected from a battery), there is no path for the charge to leave the plates, so $Q$ remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy density (energy per unit volume) in the electric field of a capacitor is proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "The square of the electric field ($E^2$).",
          "The electric field ($E$).",
          "The square root of the electric field ($\\sqrt{E}$).",
          "The distance $d$ between the plates."

          "Q / 2V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By substituting $V = Q/C$ into $U = \\frac{1}{2}QV$, we derive $U = Q^2 / 2C$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the electric field between the plates of a $5\\, \\mu F$ capacitor is $1000\\, V/m$ and the plates are $0.01\\, m$ apart, what is the stored charge?",
        "options": [
          "50 \\mu C",
          "10 \\mu C",
          "5 \\mu C",
          "0.5 \\mu C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find $V = Ed = 1000 \\times 0.01 = 10\\, V$. Then $Q = CV = 5\\, \\mu F \\times 10\\, V = 50\\, \\mu C$."
