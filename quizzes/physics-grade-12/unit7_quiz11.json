      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the de Broglie hypothesis, the wavelength ($\\lambda$) of a matter wave is inversely proportional to the particle's:",
        "options": [
          "Charge",
          "Momentum ($p$)",
          "Spin",
          "Potential energy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "De Broglie relation: $\\lambda = h/p$, where $p = mv$ (non-relativistic). Direct inverse proportionality: double momentum → half wavelength. Independent of charge, spin, or potential energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation correctly expresses the de Broglie wavelength?",
        "options": [
          "$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$",
          "$\\lambda = \\frac{p}{h}$",
          "$\\lambda = h \\cdot p$",
          "$\\lambda = \\frac{E}{c}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fundamental de Broglie relation: $\\lambda = h/p$. For photons: also $\\lambda = hc/E$ since $p = E/c$. For non-relativistic particles: $\\lambda = h/(mv)$. Planck's constant $h = 6.626\\times 10^{-34}$ J·s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an electron and a proton are moving at the same speed, which one will have a longer de Broglie wavelength?",
        "options": [
          "The proton, because it is more massive.",
          "The electron, because it has less mass.",
          "Both will have the same wavelength.",
          "Neither; only light has a wavelength."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda = h/(mv)$ → $\\lambda \\propto 1/m$ for same $v$. $m_p \\approx 1836\\ m_e$ → $\\lambda_e \\approx 1836\\ \\lambda_p$. Example: 1% speed of light: $\\lambda_e \\approx 2.4\\ \\text{pm}$, $\\lambda_p \\approx 0.0013\\ \\text{pm}$."

          "Diffraction",
          "Thermal expansion"

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Electrons scattered from nickel crystal produced diffraction pattern (1927). Pattern matched Bragg's law for waves with $\\lambda = h/p$. G.P. Thomson independently observed electron diffraction through thin films. Shared 1937 Nobel Prize."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the wave nature of a car moving at $100 \\text{ km/h}$ not observable?",
        "options": [
          "Macroscopic objects do not have momentum.",
          "The car's mass is so large that its wavelength is far smaller than the size of an atom.",
          "The car's wave is blocked by air resistance.",
          "Only charged particles have de Broglie waves."
        ],
        "explanation": "Car ($m \\approx 1500\\ \\text{kg}$, $v \\approx 28\\ \\text{m/s}$): $\\lambda = h/(mv) \\approx 1.6\\times 10^{-38}\\ \\text{m}$. Atomic scale ~$10^{-10}$ m → wavelength $\\sim 10^{28}$ times smaller! No observable interference/diffraction.",
        "answer": "B"

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the kinetic energy of an electron is increased, its de Broglie wavelength will:",

          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Remain constant",
          "Become infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Non-relativistic: $KE = p^2/(2m)$ → $p = \\sqrt{2m\\cdot KE}$ → $\\lambda = h/\\sqrt{2m\\cdot KE} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{KE}$. Increasing $KE$ decreases $\\lambda$. Relativistic correction at high energies."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "De Broglie's theory helped explain Bohr's model of the atom by suggesting that electrons in orbit form:",

          "Standing waves",
          "Traveling waves",
          "Longitudinal waves"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bohr's quantization condition $mvr = n\\hbar$ equivalent to $2\\pi r = n\\lambda$ (circumference = integer × wavelength). Electron wave must constructively interfere with itself → standing wave pattern. Explains stable orbits."

        "options": [
          "Electrons are smaller than photons.",
          "Electrons travel faster than the speed of light.",
          "High-speed electrons have a much shorter wavelength than visible light.",
          "Electrons are not affected by gravity."
        ],
        "explanation": "Resolution limit ~$\\lambda/2$. Visible light: $\\lambda \\approx 500\\ \\text{nm}$. 100 keV electrons: $\\lambda \\approx 0.0037\\ \\text{nm}$ (relativistic). Electron microscopes achieve ~0.1 nm resolution vs. ~200 nm for light microscopes.",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the de Broglie wavelength of a particle when it is brought to rest ($v = 0$)?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes zero.",
          "It becomes one.",
          "It theoretically approaches infinity.",
          "It stays the same."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda = h/p$. As $v → 0$, $p → 0$, so $\\lambda → \\infty$. Perfectly localized particle ($\\Delta x = 0$) has infinite wavelength uncertainty ($\\Delta p → \\infty$) by uncertainty principle. Practical: cooling atoms increases $\\lambda$ (BEC)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To observe diffraction effects for a particle, the size of the slit or opening it passes through must be:",
        "options": [
          "Much larger than the particle's wavelength.",
          "Exactly $1 \\text{ meter}$ wide.",
          "Comparable to the particle's de Broglie wavelength.",
          "Thicker than the particle's diameter."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Diffraction requires $a \\sim \\lambda$ (slit width comparable to wavelength). If $a \\gg \\lambda$: geometric optics, no diffraction. If $a \\ll \\lambda$: strong diffraction but intensity low. Electron diffraction uses crystals with spacing ~0.1-0.4 nm."
