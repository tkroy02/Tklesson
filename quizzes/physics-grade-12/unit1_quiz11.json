        "question": "A solid sphere (I = 0.4 MR²) and a hollow sphere (I = 0.67 MR²) roll from rest down the same incline. What is the ratio of their translational velocities (v_solid / v_hollow) at the bottom?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$v = \\sqrt{2gh / (1 + \\beta)}$. Ratio is $\\sqrt{(1+0.67)/(1+0.4)} = \\sqrt{1.67/1.4} \\approx 1.09$."

          "The point of contact has zero instantaneous velocity relative to the surface.",
          "Friction is non-existent in pure rolling.",
