      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The \"Ultraviolet Catastrophe\" was a term coined to describe the failure of which law?",
        "options": [
          "Planck's Law",
          "Wien's Displacement Law",
          "Rayleigh-Jeans Law",
          "Stefan-Boltzmann Law"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rayleigh-Jeans Law predicted infinite radiation intensity at short wavelengths (UV catastrophe), contradicting experiments. This failure exposed limitations of classical physics and led to quantum mechanics."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a blackbody becomes hotter, what happens to the color it predominantly emits?",
        "options": [
          "It stays red but gets brighter.",
          "It shifts from red to orange, then yellow, then white/blue.",
          "It shifts from blue to red.",
          "It shifts from infrared to radio waves."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By Wien's Displacement Law ($\\lambda_{max} \\propto 1/T$):\n~1000 K: red glow\n~3000 K: orange/yellow (incandescent bulb)\n~5800 K: white (Sun's surface)\n>10000 K: bluish-white (hot stars)"

          "9",
          "27",
          "81"
        ],
        "explanation": "$P/A = \\sigma T^4$. If $T \\to 3T$, then $P_{new}/P_{old} = (3T)^4/T^4 = 3^4 = 81$.\nExample: Star at 3000 K → 9000 K increases radiated power 81×.",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Planck proposed that the energy levels of atomic oscillators are \"quantized.\" This means the energy levels are:",
        "options": [
          "Continuous and can take any value.",
          "Fixed at specific, discrete values.",
          "Only available at absolute zero.",
          "Dependent on the speed of the object."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Quantization: energy can only take specific discrete values, not any continuous value. For harmonic oscillator: $E_n = nhf$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$ (integer multiples of $hf$)."

          "$2000\\ \\text{nm}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wien's Law: $\\lambda_{max} T = \\text{constant}$. Doubling temperature halves peak wavelength: $\\lambda_{max}' = 500/2 = 250\\ \\text{nm}$.\nSun (5800 K) peaks ~500 nm (green); doubled (11600 K) would peak ~250 nm (UV)."

          "A pane of clear glass."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Stars approximate blackbodies well. Sun's spectrum closely matches 5800 K blackbody curve. Cavity with small hole is laboratory blackbody. Mirrors reflect, white paper scatters, glass transmits."

          "Planck's constant"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Rayleigh-Jeans: $u(f) \\propto f^2 T$. As $f \\to \\infty$, $u(f) \\to \\infty$ (UV catastrophe). Planck's Law: $u(f) \\propto f^3/(e^{hf/kT} - 1)$ → 0 as $f \\to \\infty$."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$n$ is quantum number: $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$ (non-negative integers). Energy is quantized in multiples of $hf$. $n$ photons of frequency $f$ have total energy $nhf$."
