      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After exactly three half-lives have passed, what fraction of the original radioactive sample remains?",
        "options": [
          "$1/3$",
          "$1/6$",
          "$1/8$",
          "$1/9$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "After $n$ half-lives: remaining fraction = $(1/2)^n$. For $n=3$: $(1/2)^3 = 1/8 = 0.125 = 12.5\\%$. Decayed fraction = $1 - 1/8 = 7/8 = 87.5\\%$. General formula: $N = N_0 (1/2)^{t/T_{1/2}}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The half-life of a specific isotope is 10 minutes. If you start with 80 grams, how much is left after 30 minutes?",
        "options": [
          "40 g",
          "20 g",
          "10 g",
          "5 g"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Number of half-lives: $n = t/T_{1/2} = 30/10 = 3$. Remaining mass: $80 \\times (1/2)^3 = 80 \\times 1/8 = 10$ g. Step-by-step: 0 min: 80 g, 10 min: 40 g, 20 min: 20 g, 30 min: 10 g."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors can change the half-life of a radioactive isotope?",
        "options": [
          "Increasing the temperature.",
          "Increasing the pressure.",
          "Chemical reactions involving the atom's electrons.",
          "None of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Half-life depends only on nuclear structure, not external conditions (T, P, chemical state). Exception: electron capture depends slightly on electron density. Beta decay rates can change in extreme environments (stars). For practical purposes, constant."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the decay constant ($\\lambda$) of a material is large, what does this tell you about its half-life?",
        "options": [
          "The half-life is very long.",
          "The half-life is very short.",
          "The material is stable.",
          "The half-life is exactly 1 second."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Relationship: $T_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/\\lambda ≈ 0.693/\\lambda$. Large $\\lambda$ → small $T_{1/2}$ (rapid decay). Example: $\\lambda = 1\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ → $T_{1/2} ≈ 0.693$ s. Stable: $\\lambda = 0$, $T_{1/2} = \\infty$."

          "Metal tools from the Iron Age.",
          "Volcanic rocks.",
          "Organic materials (once-living things) up to about 50,000 years old.",
          "The Earth's core."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C-14 ($T_{1/2} = 5730$ years) forms in atmosphere, incorporated into living organisms. Death stops intake → C-14 decays while C-12 stable. Ratio C-14/C-12 gives age. Range: ~100 to ~50,000 years. Beyond: too little C-14 remains."

          "8 hours",
          "12 hours"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$N/N_0 = 125/1000 = 1/8 = (1/2)^3$ → 3 half-lives in 24 hours. $T_{1/2} = 24/3 = 8$ hours. Using formula: $125 = 1000(1/2)^{24/T_{1/2}}$ → $(1/2)^{24/T_{1/2}} = 1/8$ → $24/T_{1/2} = 3$ → $T_{1/2}=8$ h."

          "A horizontal line."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Activity $A(t) = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t} = A_0 (1/2)^{t/T_{1/2}}$. Exponential decay. Linear on semi-log plot: $\\ln A = \\ln A_0 - \\lambda t$. Half-life constant: equal time intervals for each halving."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you have a very small sample of radioactive material (e.g., only 4 atoms), can you accurately predict exactly when the next atom will decay?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, by calculating the average.",
          "No, decay is a random quantum process.",
          "Yes, if you know the temperature.",
          "Yes, if you use a microscope."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Quantum randomness: cannot predict individual decay times. Probability per time = $\\lambda$. For 4 atoms: probability all decay in one half-life = $(1/2)^4 = 1/16$. Large samples: statistics smooth out → predictable exponential behavior."

          "One decay per second.",
          "One gram of decay.",
          "One million decays per hour.",
          "One half-life per day."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bq = 1 decay/s (SI unit). Curie (Ci) = $3.7\\times 10^{10}$ Bq (activity of 1 g Ra-226). Typical: banana ~15 Bq (K-40), human ~4000 Bq, smoke detector (Am-241) ~30,000 Bq."

          "75%",
          "100%"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "After 2 half-lives: remaining = $(1/2)^2 = 1/4 = 25\\%$. Decayed = 100% - 25% = 75%. After 1 half-life: 50% decayed. After 3: 87.5% decayed. Never reaches 100% decayed (approaches asymptotically)."
