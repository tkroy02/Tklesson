    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "X-rays are produced when high-speed electrons are suddenly decelerated by a metal target. This specific radiation is called:",
        "options": [
          "Characteristic radiation",
          "Bremsstrahlung (Braking radiation)",
          "Gamma radiation",
          "Photoelectric emission"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bremsstrahlung ('braking radiation' in German): electron decelerates in Coulomb field of nucleus, emitting photon. Produces continuous X-ray spectrum. Characteristic X-rays come from electron transitions within target atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an X-ray tube, the 'Cut-off Wavelength' ($\\lambda_{min}$) depends solely on:",
        "options": [
          "The material of the target (Anode).",
          "The temperature of the filament.",
          "The accelerating voltage ($V$) applied to the tube.",
          "The size of the X-ray tube."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda_{min} = hc/(eV)$ (Duane-Hunt law). Maximum photon energy $E_{max} = eV$ when electron loses all KE in single collision. Independent of target material. Example: 50 kV → $\\lambda_{min} \\approx 0.025\\ \\text{nm}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What causes the sharp 'characteristic peaks' seen in an X-ray spectrum graph?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons slowing down as they pass through the nucleus.",
          "Electrons transition from higher energy shells to fill vacancies in lower shells of the target atoms.",
          "The heating of the target material.",
          "Reflection of electrons off the surface."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Incoming electron knocks out inner-shell electron (e.g., K-shell). Outer-shell electron drops into vacancy, emitting X-ray photon with energy equal to shell difference. Results in discrete lines (K-series, L-series)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the accelerating voltage in an X-ray tube is doubled, the minimum wavelength ($\\lambda_{min}$) will:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Be cut in half.",
          "Quadruple."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda_{min} = hc/(eV) \\propto 1/V$. Doubling $V$ halves $\\lambda_{min}$. Energy doubles: $E_{max} = eV$. Example: 40 kV → $\\lambda_{min} = 0.031\\ \\text{nm}$, 80 kV → $\\lambda_{min} = 0.0155\\ \\text{nm}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is a high-atomic-number material (like Tungsten) typically used as the target in an X-ray tube?",
        "options": [
          "It has a low melting point.",
          "It is a poor conductor of heat.",
          "It provides a strong electric field to decelerate electrons effectively.",
          "It is very cheap to manufacture."
        ],
        "explanation": "High Z → stronger nuclear charge → greater electron deceleration → more efficient X-ray production. Also: high melting point (W: 3422°C) withstands heating, good thermal conductivity. Tungsten (Z=74) is standard.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Most of the kinetic energy of the electrons hitting the target in an X-ray tube is converted into:",
        "options": [
          "X-ray photons.",
          "Visible light.",
          "Heat.",
          "Potential energy."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Typical X-ray tube efficiency: ~1% for X-rays, ~99% for heat. Electrons undergo multiple collisions, losing energy gradually. Tungsten targets require cooling (water/oil). Medical tubes operate at ~0.5-1.5% efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'K-alpha' ($\\text{K}_\\alpha$) X-ray is produced when an electron from the L-shell ($n=2$) drops into a vacancy in the:",
        "options": [
          "M-shell ($n=3$)",
          "K-shell ($n=1$)",
          "Valence shell",
          "Nucleus"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "K-series: transitions to K-shell (n=1). $\\text{K}_\\alpha$: L→K (2→1). $\\text{K}_\\beta$: M→K (3→1), etc. Energy: $E_{\\text{K}_\\alpha} = E_L - E_K$. For tungsten: $\\text{K}_\\alpha \\approx 59.3\\ \\text{keV}$."

        "options": [
          "$f_{max} = \\frac{eV}{h}$",
          "$f_{max} = \\frac{h}{eV}$",
          "$f_{max} = \\frac{hc}{V}$",
          "$f_{max} = \\frac{V}{e}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From $E_{max} = hf_{max} = eV$ → $f_{max} = eV/h$. Combined with $c = f\\lambda$ gives $\\lambda_{min} = hc/(eV)$. For 100 kV: $f_{max} \\approx 2.4\\times 10^{19}\\ \\text{Hz}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of increasing the filament current in an X-ray tube?",
        "options": [
          "The X-rays become more 'penetrating' (higher energy).",
          "The minimum wavelength decreases.",
          "The intensity (number of X-rays per second) increases.",
          "The characteristic peaks shift to the left."
        ],
        "explanation": "Filament current heats filament → more thermionic emission → more electrons → higher tube current → more X-ray photons/second (higher intensity). Photon energy spectrum unchanged (depends on voltage).",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "X-rays differ from visible light primarily because they have:",
        "options": [
          "A higher velocity.",
          "A larger wavelength.",
          "A higher frequency and higher photon energy.",
          "No momentum."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "X-rays: $\\lambda \\approx 0.01-10\\ \\text{nm}$, $f \\approx 3\\times 10^{16}-3\\times 10^{19}\\ \\text{Hz}$, $E \\approx 100\\ \\text{eV}-100\\ \\text{keV}$. Visible: $\\lambda \\approx 400-700\\ \\text{nm}$, $E \\approx 1.8-3.1\\ \\text{eV}$. Both travel at $c$, both have momentum $p=h/\\lambda$."
