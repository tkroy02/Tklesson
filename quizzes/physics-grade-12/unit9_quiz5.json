          "12.5 hours",
          "16.7 hours"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Step 1: $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2} = 1/\\sqrt{0.64} = 1/0.8 = 1.25$.\nStep 2: $\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta t_0 = 1.25 \\times 10 = 12.5$ hours.\nPilot measures proper time $\\Delta t_0$ (events at same location on ship).

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta t_0 = 2.0 \\times 1\\ \\text{hour} = 2\\ \\text{hours}$. This speed is $v = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} c = \\sqrt{1 - 1/4} c = \\sqrt{0.75} c ≈ 0.866c$. For traveler: 1 hour personal time; Earth: 2 hours elapsed."

          "$0.866c$",
          "$0.99c$"
        ],
        "explanation": "Need $\\gamma = 2$. Solve $2 = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ → $\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = 1/2$ → $1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/4$ → $v^2/c^2 = 3/4$ → $v = \\sqrt{3}/2 c ≈ 0.866c$. Example: muons at this speed live 2× longer in lab frame.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Proper time = time measured in object's rest frame. Muon at rest: $\\Delta t_0 = 2.2$ µs. Earth frame: $\\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_0$. For $v=0.999c$, $\\gamma ≈ 22.4$, so $\\Delta t ≈ 22.4 × 2.2 ≈ 49.2$ µs."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. As $v → c$, $1 - v^2/c^2 → 0$, so $\\gamma → ∞$. For $v=0.99c$: $\\gamma≈7.09$; $v=0.999c$: $\\gamma≈22.4$; $v=0.9999c$: $\\gamma≈70.7$. At $v=c$, $\\gamma$ undefined (infinite)."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Proper time $\\Delta t_0$ is shortest possible time between two events. Since $\\gamma ≥ 1$, $\\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_0 ≥ \\Delta t_0$. Equality only when $v=0$ ($\\gamma=1$). Proper time = time in frame where events occur at same location."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Moving clocks run slow (time dilation). For $v=0.5c$: $\\gamma=1.155$ → moving clock ticks once every 1.155 seconds of your time. For $v=0.9c$: $\\gamma=2.29$ → tick every 2.29 seconds. Verified experimentally."

        options: [
          "Because gravity cancels it out.",
          "Because $v^2/c^2$ is so small that $\\gamma$ is effectively $1.00000000000000$.",
          "Because the car is not in a vacuum.",
          "Time dilation only happens to light."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$v = 100\\ \\text{km/h} ≈ 27.8\\ \\text{m/s}$. $v^2/c^2 = (27.8)^2/(3×10^8)^2 ≈ 7.7×10^{-15}$. $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-7.7×10^{-15}} ≈ 1 + 3.85×10^{-15}$. Too small to measure with ordinary clocks. Need precision better than 1 part in $10^{14}$."

        ],
        "explanation": "Special relativistic effect: moving clocks run slow. GPS satellites: orbital speed ~3.87 km/s → special relativistic time dilation = -7.2 μs/day (clocks slow). Combined with general relativistic effect (+45.9 μs/day from weaker gravity) = net +38.7 μs/day fast.",
