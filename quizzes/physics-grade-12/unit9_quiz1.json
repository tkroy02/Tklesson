      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'Frame of Reference' in physics?",
        "options": [
          "A physical box that contains an experiment.",
          "A coordinate system used by an observer to measure the position and motion of objects.",
          "The speed at which an object is traveling.",
          "A set of mirrors used to reflect light."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Frame of reference = coordinate system (x,y,z,t) + observer. Essential for describing motion. Position/velocity measurements depend on frame choice. Example: Earth frame vs. train frame give different velocity measurements for same object."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following defines an 'Inertial Frame of Reference'?",
        "options": [
          "A frame that is rotating rapidly.",
          "A frame that is speeding up or slowing down.",
          "A frame that is at rest or moving at a constant velocity (no acceleration).",
          "A frame that is influenced by strong magnetic fields."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inertial frame: zero net external force → constant velocity (including zero). Newton's first law holds: object with no net force moves with constant velocity. Non-inertial: accelerating frames where fictitious forces appear (centrifugal, Coriolis)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are in a windowless plane flying at a perfectly constant velocity in smooth air, can you perform an experiment to prove you are moving without looking outside?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, by dropping a ball to see if it falls at an angle.",
          "Yes, by measuring the speed of sound.",
          "No, all laws of physics remain the same in all inertial frames.",
          "Yes, by weighing yourself."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Galilean/Newtonian relativity: no mechanical experiment can detect uniform motion. Einstein extended to all physics (special relativity). Only acceleration is detectable. This leads to principle of relativity foundation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the principle of 'Relative Velocity,' if a train moves at $20 \\text{ m/s}$ and you walk toward the front at $2 \\text{ m/s}$, how fast are you moving relative to the ground?",
        "options": [
          "$18 \\text{ m/s}$",
          "$20 \\text{ m/s}$",
          "$22 \\text{ m/s}$",
          "$2 \\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Galilean velocity addition: $\\vec{v}_{person/ground} = \\vec{v}_{person/train} + \\vec{v}_{train/ground} = 2 + 20 = 22$ m/s. Valid for speeds ≪ $c$. For relativistic speeds: Lorentz transformation $v' = (u+v)/(1+uv/c^2)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a 'Non-Inertial' frame of reference?",
        "options": [
          "A car parked in a driveway.",
          "A spaceship moving through deep space at $10,000 \\text{ km/s}$ (no thrust).",
          "A merry-go-round spinning at a constant speed.",
          "An elevator moving upward at a constant $1 \\text{ m/s}$."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Merry-go-round: constant speed but changing direction → centripetal acceleration → non-inertial. Fictitious forces: centrifugal force pushes outward, Coriolis force affects moving objects. Constant velocity elevator is inertial (ignoring Earth's rotation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a non-inertial (accelerating) frame, an observer might experience 'Fictitious Forces.' An example of this is:",
        "options": [
          "Gravity pulling you down.",
          "Friction stopping a sliding book.",
          "Being pushed back into your seat when a car accelerates.",
          "Magnetic attraction."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fictitious/Inertial forces: appear in accelerating frames but have no reaction pair. Car acceleration: you feel 'pushed' backward (actually seat pushing you forward). Other examples: centrifugal force in rotating frames, Coriolis force on Earth (weather patterns)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Earth technically a non-inertial frame of reference?",
        "options": [
          "Because it is made of rock.",
          "Because it is rotating on its axis and orbiting the Sun.",
          "Because it has an atmosphere.",
          "Because it is not moving fast enough."
        ],
        "explanation": "Earth: 1) Rotation: centripetal acceleration at equator = $0.034\\ \\text{m/s}^2$ (≈0.3% g), 2) Orbital acceleration around Sun = $0.006\\ \\text{m/s}^2$. Small but measurable (Foucault pendulum, Coriolis effect). For most lab experiments, treated as inertial.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Principle of Relativity' states that:",
        "options": [
          "Everything is relative and nothing is certain.",
          "The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames of reference.",
          "Time moves at the same speed for everyone in the universe.",
          "Mass changes depending on your point of view."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Galilean relativity: mechanical laws same in all inertial frames. Einstein (1905): extended to all laws of physics (including electromagnetism). Led to special relativity with constant speed of light $c$ in all inertial frames."

        "question": "If Observer A is on a truck moving at $30 \\text{ m/s}$ and throws a ball forward at $10 \\text{ m/s}$, Observer B (standing on the road) sees the ball moving at $40 \\text{ m/s}$. This type of coordinate transformation is called:",
        "options": [
          "Einsteinian Transformation",
          "Lorentzian Transformation",
          "Galilean Transformation",
          "Nuclear Transformation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Galilean transformation: $x' = x - vt$, $t' = t$. Simple velocity addition: $u' = u - v$. Works for $v ≪ c$. Fails for light: Michelson-Morley showed light speed constant regardless of motion → Lorentz transformation needed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What 'special' speed did Michelson and Morley attempt to measure relative to the Earth's 'frame' that eventually led to the breakdown of Galilean relativity?",
        "options": [
          "The speed of sound.",
          "The speed of the Earth's rotation.",
          "The speed of light ($c$).",
          "The speed of gravity."
        ],
        "explanation": "Michelson-Morley experiment (1887): attempted to detect Earth's motion through 'aether' by measuring light speed changes. Found null result: $c$ constant in all directions. Key evidence leading to special relativity (Einstein 1905).",

        "0": "Start with basics: Review coordinate systems for describing motion, how motion appears differently to different observers, and why some frames (inertial) are special because physics works simply in them."
