    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the resonant frequency ($f_0$), what is the relationship between inductive reactance ($X_L$) and capacitive reactance ($X_C$)?",
        "options": [
          "$X_L > X_C$",
          "$X_L < X_C$",
          "$X_L = X_C$",
          "$X_L + X_C = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Resonance condition: $X_L = X_C$. Since $X_L = 2\\pi f L$ and $X_C = 1/(2\\pi f C)$, setting them equal gives resonant frequency $f_0 = 1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{LC})$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following formulas is used to calculate the resonant frequency of a series RLC circuit?",
        "options": [
          "$f_0 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}$",
          "$f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$",
          "$f_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{LC}}{2\\pi}$",
          "$f_0 = \\frac{1}{LC}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Resonant frequency: $f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$. Derivation: Set $X_L = X_C$ → $2\\pi f L = 1/(2\\pi f C)$ → $f^2 = 1/(4\\pi^2 LC)$ → $f = 1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{LC})$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At resonance, the total impedance ($Z$) of a series RLC circuit is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Infinity",
          "The resistance ($R$)",
          "The sum of $X_L$ and $X_C$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At resonance: $X_L = X_C$, so $X_L - X_C = 0$. Impedance $Z = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2} = \\sqrt{R^2 + 0} = R$. Minimum possible impedance."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the current in a series RLC circuit when it reaches resonance?",

          "It is at its minimum value.",
          "It is at its maximum value.",
          "It drops to zero.",
          "It becomes independent of voltage."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Current $I = V/Z$. At resonance, $Z$ is minimum ($= R$), so $I$ is maximum: $I_{max} = V/R$. This is why resonance curves show current peaks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the resonant frequency, the phase angle ($\\phi$) between the source voltage and the total current is:",
        "options": [
          "$0^\\circ$",
          "$45^\\circ$",
          "$90^\\circ$",
          "$180^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phase angle $\\phi = \\tan^{-1}((X_L - X_C)/R)$. At resonance $X_L = X_C$, so $\\phi = \\tan^{-1}(0) = 0^\\circ$. Voltage and current are in phase (purely resistive behavior)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It doubles."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$f_0 = 1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}) \\propto 1/\\sqrt{C}$. Increasing $C$ decreases $f_0$. Doubling $C$ reduces $f_0$ by factor $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a series RLC circuit at resonance, the voltage across the inductor ($V_L$) and the voltage across the capacitor ($V_C$) are:",
        "options": [
          "Zero.",
          "Equal to the source voltage ($V_S$).",
          "Equal in magnitude but $180^\\circ$ out of phase.",
          "In phase with the resistor voltage ($V_R$)."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At resonance: $V_L = I X_L$ and $V_C = I X_C$ with $X_L = X_C$, so $|V_L| = |V_C|$. Phase: $V_L$ leads current by $90^\\circ$, $V_C$ lags by $90^\\circ$ → $180^\\circ$ between them. They cancel in phasor sum."

          "The source voltage",
          "The Quality Factor ($Q$)",
          "The frequency of the source",
          "The phase angle"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Quality factor $Q = \\frac{\\omega_0 L}{R} = \\frac{1}{R}\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}$. High Q means narrow bandwidth (sharp peak), low Q means broad peak. Bandwidth $\\Delta f = f_0/Q$."

        "question": "A series RLC circuit has $L = 10\\ \\text{mH}$, $C = 10\\ \\mu\\text{F}$, and $R = 5\\ \\Omega$. If the resistance is increased to $20\\ \\Omega$, the resonant frequency will:",

          "Increase.",

          "Stay the same.",
          "Become zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Resonant frequency $f_0 = 1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{LC})$ depends only on $L$ and $C$, not on $R$. Changing $R$ affects Q-factor and bandwidth, not resonance frequency.\nFor these values: $f_0 = 1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{0.010 × 10^{-5}}) ≈ 503\\ \\text{Hz}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a common practical application of RLC resonance?",

          "Converting DC to AC in a battery.",
          "Reducing the resistance of a copper wire."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Radio tuning: LC circuit resonates at desired station frequency, passing that signal while rejecting others. Variable capacitor adjusts resonant frequency to select different stations. Also used in filters, oscillators, and impedance matching."
