        "question": "A patient is injected with 20 mg of a radioactive tracer with a half-life of 6 hours. How much of the tracer remains in the patient's body after 24 hours?",
        "options": [
          "5.0 mg",
          "2.5 mg",
          "1.25 mg",
          "0.625 mg"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$n = t/T_{1/2} = 24/6 = 4$ half-lives. $N = N_0(1/2)^n = 20(1/2)^4 = 20 \\times 1/16 = 1.25$ mg. Stepwise: 0h: 20 mg, 6h: 10 mg, 12h: 5 mg, 18h: 2.5 mg, 24h: 1.25 mg."

        "question": "A sample of Iodine-131 has an initial activity of 800 counts per second. If its half-life is 8 days, how long will it take for the activity to drop to 50 counts per second?",
        "options": [
          "16 days",
          "24 days",
          "32 days",
          "40 days"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Activity: $800 \\to 400 \\to 200 \\to 100 \\to 50$ (4 half-lives). $t = n \\times T_{1/2} = 4 \\times 8 = 32$ days. Using formula: $50 = 800(1/2)^{t/8} \\Rightarrow (1/2)^{t/8} = 1/16 \\Rightarrow t/8 = 4 \\Rightarrow t = 32$ days."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$6.25\\% = 1/16 = (1/2)^4$ → 4 half-lives in 12 days. $T_{1/2} = 12/4 = 3$ days. Can solve: $0.0625 = (1/2)^{12/T} \\Rightarrow (1/2)^{12/T} = (1/2)^4 \\Rightarrow 12/T = 4 \\Rightarrow T = 3$ days."

          "22,920 years"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$25\\% = 1/4 = (1/2)^2$ → 2 half-lives. Age = $2 \\times 5,730 = 11,460$ years. Carbon dating: $t = \\frac{T_{1/2}}{\\ln 2} \\ln(N_0/N) = \\frac{5730}{0.693} \\ln(4) ≈ 11,460$ years."

          "$1/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$t = 6$ h, $T_{1/2} = 2$ h → $n = 3$ half-lives. Fraction remaining = $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$. Fraction decayed = $1 - 1/8 = 7/8 = 87.5\\%$. After 6h: 12.5% remains, 87.5% decayed."

          "$N = N_0 / (2t)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Standard decay law: $N = N_0(1/2)^{t/T_{1/2}}$. Also equivalent to exponential form: $N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$ where $\\lambda = \\ln 2 / T_{1/2}$. Option A would be growth, not decay."

          "0 g"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "After 2 years: $100(1/2)^2 = 25$ g. After 3 years: $100(1/2)^3 = 12.5$ g. At 2.5 years: $N = 100(1/2)^{2.5} = 100/2^{2.5} = 100/5.657 ≈ 17.68$ g. Between 12.5 and 25 g."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$T_{1/2} = \\ln 2 / \\lambda = 0.693 / 0.1 = 6.93$ days. Relationship: $\\lambda T_{1/2} = \\ln 2 ≈ 0.693$. Higher $\\lambda$ = faster decay = shorter half-life."

        "question": "Why is it impossible to define the 'total life' of a radioactive sample?",
        "options": [
          "Because the atoms decay all at once.",
          "Because the rate of decay is constant, but the amount remaining only approaches zero asymptotically.",
          "Because the atoms eventually turn into light.",
          "Because the half-life changes as the sample gets smaller."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Exponential decay: $N(t) → 0$ as $t → ∞$, but never exactly zero. After 10 half-lives: $N ≈ N_0/1024$; after 20: $N ≈ N_0/1,048,576$. Practically 'gone' but mathematically never zero. Half-life constant."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$N/N_0 = 50/400 = 1/8 = (1/2)^3$ → 3 half-lives. $T_{1/2} = 414/3 = 138$ days. Actual Po-210 half-life = 138.376 days. Using formula: $50 = 400(1/2)^{414/T} \\Rightarrow T = 414/3 = 138$ days."
