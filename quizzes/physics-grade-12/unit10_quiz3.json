      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block sits at rest on a rough incline. The force of friction acting on the block must be:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to the block's weight",
          "Equal to $mg \\sin \\theta$",
          "Equal to $mg \\cos \\theta$",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At rest, static friction exactly balances the component of gravity pulling the block down the incline: $f_s = mg\\sin\\theta$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The area under a Velocity vs. Time graph represents the object's:",
        "options": [
          "Acceleration",
          "Instantaneous velocity",
          "Displacement",
          "Total time"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Area under $v$ vs. $t$ gives displacement. Slope of $v$ vs. $t$ gives acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a car's speed is doubled while taking the same turn, the required centripetal force:",
        "options": [
          "Stays the same",
          "Doubles",
          "Triples",
          "Quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$. If $v$ doubles, $F_c$ increases by a factor of $2^2 = 4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the distance between two planets is doubled, the gravitational force between them:",
        "options": [
          "Increases by $2 \\times$",
          "Decreases to $1/2$",
          "Decreases to $1/4$",
          "Decreases to $1/8$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's Law of Gravitation: $F_g \\propto 1/r^2$. Doubling $r$ reduces force to $1/4$ of the original."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is dropped from height $h$. Ignoring air resistance, halfway down ($h/2$):",
        "options": [
          "$E_k = E_p$",
          "$E_k > E_p$",
          "$E_p > E_k$",
          "$E_k = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By conservation of energy, at $h/2$, half the initial potential energy has converted to kinetic energy, so $E_k = E_p$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The electric field lines between two opposite charges (dipole) move:",
        "options": [
          "From negative to positive",
          "From positive to negative",
          "In concentric circles",
          "Parallel to each other"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Electric field lines point from positive to negative charges by convention, showing the direction a positive test charge would move."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a North pole of a magnet is pushed into a coil, the induced current creates a field that:",
        "options": [
          "Attracts the magnet",
          "Repels the magnet",
          "Has no effect",
          "Points in the same direction"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lenz's Law: the induced current opposes the change in magnetic flux. A north pole approaching induces a north pole to repel it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As an object's velocity approaches $c$, its total energy:",
        "options": [
          "Becomes zero",
          "Approaches $mc^2$",
          "Approaches infinity",
          "Remains constant"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total energy is $E = \\gamma m c^2$. As $v \\to c$, $\\gamma \\to \\infty$, so $E \\to \\infty$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sound source moves away from a stationary observer. The observer detects a:",
        "options": [
          "Higher pitch (frequency)",
          "Lower pitch (frequency)",
          "Faster speed of sound",
          "Constant pitch"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Doppler effect for a receding source: observed frequency is lower than emitted frequency, resulting in a lower pitch."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of a photon is doubled, its energy:",
        "options": [
          "Is halved",
          "Remains the same",
          "Doubles",
          "Quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Photon energy is $E = hf$, proportional to frequency. Doubling frequency doubles energy."

        "50": "Fair overall. Focus on: static friction balance, area under velocity-time graph, centripetal force scaling, gravitational force scaling, and photon energy-frequency relationship.",
        "0": "Start with fundamental definitions: friction on an incline, graph area meaning, centripetal force formula ($F=mv^2/r$), gravitational inverse-square law, and $E=hf$ for photons."
