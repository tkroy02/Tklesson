    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Proper Time' ($\\Delta t_0$)?",
        "options": [
          "Time as measured by a perfectly synchronized atomic clock on Earth.",
          "The time interval measured by an observer who sees the two events occur at the same location.",
          "The time it takes for light to travel one meter.",
          "Time that has been corrected for gravitational errors."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Proper time: time interval measured in frame where events occur at same spatial location. Shortest possible time between events. Example: wristwatch measures proper time of wearer. For moving clock: $\\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_0$, where $\\gamma > 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As an object's velocity ($v$) approaches the speed of light ($c$), what happens to the time interval ($\\Delta t$) measured by a stationary observer?",
        "options": [
          "It approaches zero.",
          "It stays exactly the same as $\\Delta t_0$.",
          "It approaches infinity (time appears to nearly stop for the moving object).",
          "It becomes negative, meaning the object moves backward in time."
        ],
        "explanation": "$\\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_0 = \\Delta t_0/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. As $v \\to c$, $\\gamma \\to \\infty$, $\\Delta t \\to \\infty$. Time appears frozen for light-speed objects. For $v=0.99c$: $\\gamma=7.09$; $v=0.999c$: $\\gamma=22.4$.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the 'Twin Paradox,' one twin stays on Earth while the other travels to a star at $0.9c$ and returns. When they reunite:",
        "options": [
          "The Earth twin is younger.",
          "The traveling twin is younger.",
          "They are exactly the same age.",
          "The traveling twin has turned into pure energy."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Traveling twin undergoes acceleration (turnaround) → not always in inertial frame → breaks symmetry. For $v=0.9c$ ($\\gamma=2.29$), 10-year round trip for traveler = 22.9 years on Earth. Traveler ages less. Verified with atomic clocks on airplanes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which real-world technology must account for time dilation to remain accurate?",
        "options": [
          "Microwave ovens.",
          "Internal combustion engines.",
          "Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.",
          "Fiber optic internet."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "GPS satellites: 1) Special relativity: moving at 3.87 km/s → clocks slow by ~7 μs/day, 2) General relativity: weaker gravity → clocks fast by ~45 μs/day. Net: ~38 μs/day fast. Without correction: position errors ~10 km/day accumulating."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Muons are subatomic particles with a very short lifespan. How do they reach the Earth's surface from the upper atmosphere despite their short life?",
        "options": [
          "They travel faster than the speed of light.",
          "Their 'internal clock' slows down due to their high speed, allowing them to live longer from our perspective.",
          "They are constantly regenerated by air molecules.",
          "They don't actually have mass."
        ],
        "explanation": "Muons: created at ~15 km altitude, mean lifetime at rest = 2.2 μs. Even at $c$, would decay in ~660 m. But moving at ~0.995c ($\\gamma≈10$), lifetime extended to ~22 μs → travel ~6.6 km. Many reach surface. Direct experimental proof.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are on a spaceship moving at $0.99c$, how does your own heart rate feel to you?",
        "options": [
          "Extremely slow.",
          "Extremely fast.",
          "Perfectly normal.",
          "It stops entirely."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In your own rest frame, you're stationary. Time dilation affects how others see you, not your own experience. Biological processes, clocks, aging proceed normally in own frame. Only relative motion matters."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Lorentz Factor' ($\\gamma$) is used to calculate the degree of dilation. What is the value of $\\gamma$ when $v = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "Infinity",
          "0.5"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. $v=0$ → $\\gamma=1$ (no dilation). $v=0.5c$ → $\\gamma=1.155$. $v=0.866c$ → $\\gamma=2$. $v=0.99c$ → $\\gamma=7.09$. Maximum at $v=c$: $\\gamma=\\infty$."

        "options": [
          "Runs fast.",
          "Runs slow.",
          "Runs at a constant $c$.",
          "Ticks backwards."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Moving clocks run slow (time dilation). Example: $v=0.5c$, $\\gamma=1.155$ → 1 second on moving clock = 1.155 seconds on stationary clock. Verified by: 1) Airplane atomic clocks, 2) Muon decay, 3) Particle accelerator lifetimes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an astronaut travels for 1 year of their time at a speed where $\\gamma = 2$, how much time has passed on Earth?",
        "options": [
          "6 months",
          "1 year",
          "2 years",
          "4 years"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_0 = 2 \\times 1\\ \\text{year} = 2\\ \\text{years}$. Requires $v = \\sqrt{3}/2 c ≈ 0.866c$. For traveler: ages 1 year, Earth: ages 2 years. Space travel consequence: 'time gain' for traveler."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Time dilation is a 'symmetric' effect between two inertial observers. This means:",
        "options": [
          "Only one person is actually moving.",
          "Both observers see the other's clock running slow.",
          "Time dilation only happens in one direction.",
          "Time dilation doesn't exist if both people are moving."
        ],
        "explanation": "Symmetry: each inertial observer sees other's clock running slow. Resolved by relativity of simultaneity: they disagree on 'now'. Paradoxical but consistent. Broken in twin paradox due to acceleration (non-inertial segment).",
        "answer": "B"
