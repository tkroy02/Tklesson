    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What was the primary reason classical physics failed to explain the blackbody radiation spectrum at short wavelengths?",
        "options": [
          "The Photoelectric Effect",
          "The Ultraviolet Catastrophe",
          "The Doppler Shift",
          "Newtonian Mechanics"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Classical Rayleigh-Jeans law predicted infinite radiation intensity at short wavelengths (UV catastrophe), contradicting experimental observations. This failure led to quantum mechanics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Max Planck solved the blackbody problem by assuming that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete \"packets\" called:",
        "options": [
          "Waves",
          "Electrons",
          "Quanta",
          "Auras"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Planck proposed energy quantization: electromagnetic energy can only be exchanged in discrete amounts called quanta. Each quantum has energy $E = hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Planck's Law, the energy ($E$) of a quantum of radiation is proportional to its frequency ($f$). What is the constant of proportionality?",
        "options": [
          "Boltzmann Constant ($k$)",
          "Speed of Light ($c$)",
          "Planck's Constant ($h$)",
          "Gravitational Constant ($G$)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Planck's energy equation: $E = hf$, where $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\text{J·s}$. This fundamental constant links energy and frequency, marking birth of quantum physics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes an \"ideal\" blackbody?",
        "options": [
          "An object that reflects all incident light.",
          "An object that only emits visible light.",
          "An object that absorbs all incident radiation and reflects none.",
          "A cold object that does not emit any radiation."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Perfect blackbody: absorbs all electromagnetic radiation incident upon it (absorption = 1, reflection = 0). Also emits radiation according to its temperature (Kirchhoff's Law)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Wien's Displacement Law states that as the temperature of a blackbody increases, the peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{max}$) of its emission spectrum:",
        "options": [
          "Increases (shifts toward Red/Infrared).",
          "Decreases (shifts toward Blue/Ultraviolet).",
          "Remains the same.",
          "Disappears."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Wien's Law: $\\lambda_{max} T = \\text{constant} \\approx 2.898 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m·K}$. Higher temperature → shorter peak wavelength. Sun (5800 K) peaks in visible; humans (310 K) peak in infrared."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The total power radiated per unit area of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature ($T^4$). This is known as:",
        "options": [
          "The Stefan-Boltzmann Law",
          "Ohm's Law",
          "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle",
          "The Law of Conservation of Energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $P = \\sigma AT^4$, where $\\sigma = 5.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{W/m}^2\\text{K}^4$. Power increases dramatically with temperature: doubling T increases power 16×."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the total area under the blackbody radiation curve as the temperature increases?",
        "options": [
          "It stays constant.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It increases significantly.",
          "It shifts only to the right."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Area under intensity-wavelength curve represents total radiated power. By Stefan-Boltzmann Law ($P \\propto T^4$), area increases dramatically with temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Before Planck, the Rayleigh-Jeans Law was used to describe blackbody radiation. Where did it work best?",
        "options": [
          "Short wavelengths (high frequencies)",
          "Long wavelengths (low frequencies)",
          "Only at absolute zero",
          "Only for visible light"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rayleigh-Jeans Law: $I(\\lambda) \\propto T/\\lambda^4$. Works well at long wavelengths (low frequencies) but predicts infinite intensity at short wavelengths → UV catastrophe."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a blackbody's absolute temperature is doubled, by what factor does the total radiated power increase?",

          "2",
          "4",
          "8",
          "16"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "From Stefan-Boltzmann: $P \\propto T^4$. $P_{new}/P_{old} = (2T)^4/T^4 = 2^4 = 16$. Example: increasing from 300 K to 600 K increases power by factor 16."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Planck's constant ($h$) has the units of:",
        "options": [
          "Watts (W)",
          "Joule-seconds (J·s)",
          "Newtons (N)",
          "Joules per second (J/s)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $E = hf$: $[h] = [E]/[f] = \\text{J} / \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{J·s}$. Fundamental quantum constant appears in many equations: $E = hf$, $p = h/\\lambda$, etc."
