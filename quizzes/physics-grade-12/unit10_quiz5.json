      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two masses ($m_1 = 5\\text{ kg}, m_2 = 10\\text{ kg}$) are connected by a string over a frictionless pulley (Atwood Machine). The magnitude of the acceleration of the system is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Exactly $g$",
          "Less than $g$",
          "More than $g$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Net force is the difference in weights: $(m_2 - m_1)g$. This force accelerates the total mass $(m_1 + m_2)$. Since it's less than the weight of either mass alone, acceleration is less than $g$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A boat travels at $4\\text{ m/s}$ North relative to the water. The river flows at $3\\text{ m/s}$ East. The magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the shore is:",
        "options": [
          "$1\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$5\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$7\\text{ m/s}$",
          "$12\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The velocities are perpendicular. Magnitude is found using the Pythagorean theorem: $v = \\sqrt{(4)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\text{ m/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Motor A does the same amount of work as Motor B but in half the time, the power output of Motor A is:",
        "options": [
          "Half of Motor B",
          "Equal to Motor B",
          "Twice that of Motor B",
          "Four times that of Motor B"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Power is work divided by time: $P = W/t$. Same work in half the time means double the power."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The gravitational field strength ($g$) at the surface of a planet depends on:",
        "options": [
          "The mass of the object placed there",
          "The radius of the planet only",
          "The mass and radius of the planet",
          "The orbital speed of the planet"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From Newton's Law: $g = GM/r^2$, where $M$ is the planet's mass and $r$ is its radius. It is independent of the test object's mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an explosion where a stationary object breaks into two pieces of unequal mass, the two pieces will have:",
        "options": [
          "The same speed",
          "The same kinetic energy",
          "Momenta of equal magnitude but opposite direction",
          "The same acceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Initial momentum is zero. For momentum to remain zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: $p_1 = -p_2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a positive test charge is moved against the direction of an electric field, its electric potential energy:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Remains constant",
          "Drops to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work must be done on the charge to move it against the electric field force. This work increases the charge's electric potential energy, similar to lifting a mass against gravity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Faraday's Law, the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a loop is proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "The magnetic flux",
          "The resistance of the wire",
          "The rate of change of magnetic flux",
          "The size of the magnet"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Faraday's Law: $\\epsilon = -N \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{\\Delta t}$. The magnitude of induced EMF depends on how quickly magnetic flux through the loop changes, not on the flux itself."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object moves at $v = 0.99c$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is approximately:",
        "options": [
          "$1.0$",
          "$1.4$",
          "$7.0$",
          "$100$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (0.99)^2} = 1/\\sqrt{0.0199} \\approx 1/0.141 \\approx 7.08$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When light travels from air into glass, which property remains unchanged?",
        "options": [
          "Velocity",
          "Wavelength",
          "Frequency",
          "Direction"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Frequency is determined by the light source and does not change when light enters a different medium. Velocity and wavelength both decrease in glass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an electron in an atom drops from a high energy level to a lower one, the atom:",
        "options": [
          "Absorbs a photon",
          "Emits a photon",
          "Gains mass",
          "Becomes a different element"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The electron loses energy, which is emitted as a photon with energy equal to the difference between the two energy levels: $E_{\\text{photon}} = hf = E_{\\text{high}} - E_{\\text{low}}$."
