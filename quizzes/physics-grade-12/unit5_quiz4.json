      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The magnitude of the magnetic force on a straight conductor is given by which formula?",
        "options": [
          "$F = qvB\\sin\\theta$",
          "$F = ILB\\sin\\theta$",
          "$F = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$",
          "$F = \\frac{V}{R}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a straight wire of length $L$ carrying current $I$ in a magnetic field $B$, the force is $F = ILB\\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the current direction and magnetic field."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A horizontal wire carries current from left to right. If a magnetic field is applied vertically upward, in which direction will the wire be pushed?",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2.0\\text{ m}$ long wire carrying a $5.0\\text{ A}$ current is placed in a $0.1\\text{ T}$ magnetic field. If the wire is parallel to the field, the force is:",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Force $F = ILB\\sin\\theta$. When wire is parallel to field, $\\theta = 0^\\circ$, so $\\sin 0^\\circ = 0$ and $F = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Parallel wires with opposite currents generate magnetic fields that interact repulsively. The field around each wire exerts a force pushing the other wire away."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The definition of the \"Ampere\" is based on the force between two parallel wires. What is that force per unit length when $I_1 = I_2 = 1\\text{ A}$ and $r = 1\\text{ m}$?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Force per unit length between parallel wires: $\\frac{F}{L} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 1 \\times 1}{2\\pi \\times 1} = 2 \\times 10^{-7}\\text{ N/m}$. This defines the ampere."

          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "D",

        "options": [
          "Net charge",
          "Resistance increase",
          "Torque",
          "Change in frequency"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Forces on opposite sides of the loop are equal and opposite but may not act along the same line, creating a torque that tends to rotate the loop even when net force is zero."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a DC motor, what is the role of the \"Split-Ring Commutator\"?",
        "options": [
          "To increase the magnetic field strength.",
          "To reverse the current direction every half-rotation.",
          "To prevent the wire from melting.",
          "To convert AC to DC."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The commutator reverses the current in the coil each half-rotation, ensuring the magnetic torque always acts in the same direction to maintain continuous rotation."

          "$4.0\\text{ T}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$F = ILB \\Rightarrow B = \\frac{F}{IL} = \\frac{1.2}{6 \\times 0.5} = \\frac{1.2}{3} = 0.4\\text{ T}$ (perpendicular means $\\sin\\theta = 1$)."
