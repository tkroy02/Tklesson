    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the definition of resonance in an oscillating system?",
        "options": [
          "A system oscillating with maximum amplitude at its natural frequency",
          "A system with zero damping",
          "A system that oscillates forever without energy loss",
          "A system that vibrates at multiple frequencies simultaneously"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resonance occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency, resulting in maximum energy transfer from the driving force to the system and maximum amplitude oscillations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor most significantly affects the sharpness (width) of a resonance curve?",
        "options": [
          "The amplitude of the driving force",
          "The natural frequency of the system",
          "The amount of damping in the system",
          "The mass of the oscillating object"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Damping determines the sharpness of resonance. Light damping produces a sharp, narrow resonance peak, while heavy damping produces a broad, less pronounced peak."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the phase difference between the driving force and the oscillator's displacement at resonance?",
        "options": [
          "They are in phase ($0^\\circ$ difference)",
          "They are $\\pi/2$ ($90^\\circ$) out of phase",
          "They are $\\pi$ ($180^\\circ$) out of phase",
          "The phase difference is random"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At resonance, the driving force leads the displacement by $\\pi/2$ radians ($90^\\circ$). The velocity is in phase with the driving force, allowing maximum energy transfer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a real-world example of resonance?",
        "options": [
          "A child pumping a swing at the right moment",
          "A wine glass shattering from a singer's high note",
          "A pendulum swinging with constant amplitude",
          "A bridge collapsing due to wind or marching soldiers"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A pendulum swinging with constant amplitude without external driving is an example of undamped oscillation, not resonance. Resonance requires an external driving force matching the natural frequency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the resonant frequency compare to the natural frequency for a lightly damped system?",
        "options": [
          "Resonant frequency is slightly lower than natural frequency",
          "Resonant frequency equals natural frequency",
          "Resonant frequency is slightly higher than natural frequency",
          "They are unrelated quantities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For lightly damped systems, the resonant frequency (where maximum amplitude occurs) is slightly lower than the natural frequency: $\\omega_{res} = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - (b/2m)^2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main reason resonance can be dangerous in mechanical structures?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases the natural frequency",
          "It causes excessive damping",
          "It leads to large amplitude vibrations that can cause structural failure",
          "It prevents energy transfer to the system"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Resonance causes large amplitude oscillations that can exceed the elastic limits of materials, leading to fatigue, cracking, or catastrophic failure in structures like bridges and buildings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a forced oscillator, what happens to the amplitude when the driving frequency is much higher than the natural frequency?",
        "options": [
          "Amplitude becomes very large",
          "Amplitude becomes very small",
          "Amplitude remains constant at its natural value",
          "Amplitude oscillates between large and small values"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When $\\omega_{drive} \\gg \\omega_0$, the system cannot respond quickly enough to the driving force, resulting in very small amplitude oscillations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between power transfer and resonance?",
        "options": [
          "Maximum power transfer occurs at resonance",
          "Minimum power transfer occurs at resonance",
          "Power transfer is constant regardless of frequency",
          "Power transfer decreases linearly with frequency"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At resonance, the driving force and velocity are in phase, maximizing the instantaneous power $P = F \\cdot v$ delivered to the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which musical instrument principle relies on resonance?",
        "options": [
          "A piano string vibrating at its natural frequency when struck",
          "A drum membrane being stretched tightly",
          "A flute player blowing air across an opening",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All musical instruments use resonance principles. Strings, membranes, and air columns vibrate at their natural frequencies when excited, producing specific musical notes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can unwanted resonance be prevented in engineering structures?",
        "options": [
          "By increasing the natural frequency",
          "By adding damping materials",
          "By changing the shape to alter natural frequencies",
          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Engineers prevent resonance by: 1) Changing natural frequencies through design, 2) Adding damping (shock absorbers, viscoelastic materials), 3) Avoiding driving frequencies that match natural frequencies."
