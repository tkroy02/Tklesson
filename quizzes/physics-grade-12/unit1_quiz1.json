      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2.0 kg block is pushed across a horizontal frictionless surface by a constant force of 10 N over a distance of 5.0 m. If the block started from rest, what is its final kinetic energy?",
        "options": [
          "50 J",
          "20 J",
          "100 J",
          "25 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Work-Energy Theorem states that $W_{net} = \\Delta K$. Since $W = Fd$, $10\\text{ N} \\times 5\\text{ m} = 50\\text{ J}$, which is the change in kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves along the x-axis under the influence of a variable force F(x) = 3x². How much work is done by this force as the object moves from x = 0 to x = 2 m?",
        "options": [
          "8 J",
          "12 J",
          "6 J",
          "4 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work is the integral of force: $\\int_{0}^{2} 3x^2 dx = [x^3]_{0}^{2} = 8\\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car traveling at speed v skids to a stop over a distance d. If the car were traveling at 2v, what would be the stopping distance, assuming constant braking force?",
        "options": [
          "4d",
          "2d",
          "√2d",
          "8d"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kinetic energy is proportional to $v^2$. Doubling velocity quadruples the energy ($2^2 = 4$), requiring four times the work and distance to stop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements best describes the work done by a non-conservative force like friction?",
        "options": [
          "The work done depends on the path taken between positions.",
          "The work done is always zero over a closed loop.",
          "The work done can be fully recovered as potential energy.",
          "The work done is independent of the path taken."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non-conservative forces dissipate energy; the total energy lost depends on the total distance (path) traveled, not just displacement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5.0 kg object is lifted vertically 10 m at a constant speed. What is the total net work done on the object?",
        "options": [
          "0 J",
          "490 J",
          "-490 J",
          "50 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At constant speed, $\\Delta K = 0$. By the Work-Energy Theorem, $W_{net}$ must be zero because the work of the lift and the work of gravity cancel out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring with constant k is compressed a distance x. If the compression is doubled to 2x, how does the work required change?",
        "options": [
          "The work increases by a factor of 4.",
          "The work increases by a factor of 2.",
          "The work remains the same.",
          "The work increases by a factor of 8."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elastic potential energy is $\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Doubling $x$ results in $(2x)^2$, which is $4x^2$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A box is pulled 10 m by a force of 20 N applied at an angle of 60° above the horizontal. How much work is done?",
        "options": [
          "100 J",
          "200 J",
          "173 J",
          "50 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work is $Fd \\cos(\\theta)$. Here, $20 \\times 10 \\times \\cos(60°) = 200 \\times 0.5 = 100\\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the net work done on a particle is negative, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "The kinetic energy of the particle is decreasing.",
          "The particle is moving in the negative x-direction.",
          "The potential energy of the particle is decreasing.",
          "The particle's speed is increasing."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Negative net work means the force opposes the motion, slowing the object down and decreasing its kinetic energy."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1000 kg elevator moves downward at a constant speed of 2 m/s. What is the power delivered by the tension in the cable?",

          "-19.6 kW",
          "19.6 kW",
          "2 kW",
          "-2 kW"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Power is $Fv$. Tension is upward ($mg = 9800\\text{ N}$) and velocity is downward ($2\\text{ m/s}$). $P = 9800 \\times (-2) = -19600\\text{ W}$."
      },

          "18 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work is the dot product $\\vec{F} \\cdot \\Delta\\vec{r} = (2)(0) + (3)(5) = 15\\text{ J}$."
