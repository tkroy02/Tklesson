        "question": "What is the frequency of vibration if the balance wheel of a wrist watch makes 90 revolutions in 25 s?",
        "options": [
          "0.36 Hz",
          "2.78 Hz",
          "3.15 Hz",
          "3.60 Hz"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Frequency $f = \\frac{\\text{Number of Revolutions}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{90}{25} = 3.60 \\text{ Hz}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following motions is simple harmonic? I. The motion of tyres of a moving car, II. The motion of a loaded test tube oscillated vertically, III. The beating of the heart, IV. A stone tied to a string whirled round, V. The motion of the pistons in a gasoline engine.",

          "All of the above"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Simple Harmonic Motion requires a restoring force proportional to displacement. A loaded test tube (II) and pistons (V) are classic SHM. The heart (III) is often classified as periodic/harmonic in physics contexts. Circular motion (IV) and tire rotation (I) are not SHM."

        "answer": "A",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From $T \\propto \\sqrt{L}$: $\\frac{5.77}{4.60} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L+3}{L}}$. Squaring: $1.573 = \\frac{L+3}{L} \\Rightarrow 1.573L = L+3 \\Rightarrow 0.573L = 3 \\Rightarrow L \\approx 5.23 \\text{ m}$."
