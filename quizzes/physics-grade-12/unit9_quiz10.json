    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the $c^2$ in $E=mc^2$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "The speed of the object squared.",
          "A very large constant that acts as a conversion factor between mass and energy.",
          "The acceleration of the object.",
          "The curvature of spacetime."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The $c^2$ is the square of the speed of light in a vacuum. Its numerical value (~$9 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2$) is the massive conversion factor that shows how a tiny amount of rest mass corresponds to an enormous amount of energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is at rest ($v=0$), what is its total energy?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$",
          "$mc^2$",
          "$\\infty$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is the rest energy, $E_0 = m c^2$, which is the intrinsic energy stored in an object's mass. It is the energy an object possesses simply by virtue of having mass, even when it is not moving."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a nuclear reaction, if the products have less total mass than the starting reactants, what happened to the 'missing' mass?",
        "options": [
          "It was destroyed and is gone forever.",
          "It was converted into kinetic or radiant energy.",
          "It turned into dark matter.",
          "It is hidden in the electrons."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The principle of mass-energy equivalence states that mass can be converted into other forms of energy and vice-versa. This 'mass defect' is not lost; it is released, typically as kinetic energy of the products or as gamma-ray photons (radiant energy)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to $E = \\gamma mc^2$, as an object's speed approaches $c$, its total energy approaches:",
        "options": [
          "Its rest energy.",
          "$3.0 \\times 10^8$ Joules.",
          "Infinity.",
          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "As $v \\to c$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the total energy $E = \\gamma m c^2$ also approaches infinity. This is another way of seeing why infinite energy is required to accelerate a massive object to the speed of light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct formula for Relativistic Kinetic Energy?",
        "options": [
          "$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$",
          "$K = mc^2$",
          "$K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$",
          "$K = \\gamma mc^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total energy is $E = \\gamma m c^2$. Rest energy is $E_0 = m c^2$. The kinetic energy is the total energy *in excess* of the rest energy: $K = E - E_0 = (\\gamma - 1)m c^2$. At low speeds, this simplifies to the classical $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Sun loses approximately 4 million tons of mass every second. Where does this mass go?",
        "options": [
          "It is blown away by solar winds.",
          "It is converted into the light and heat that radiates into the solar system.",
          "It is absorbed by the planets' gravity.",
          "It turns into helium, which weighs nothing."
        ],
        "explanation": "In the Sun's core, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen into helium. The mass of the resulting helium is slightly less than the mass of the original hydrogen. This 'lost' mass is transformed into electromagnetic radiation (light and heat) via $E=mc^2$, which is the ultimate source of solar energy.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "'Pair Production' is a process where a high-energy photon vanishes and creates an electron and a positron. This is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "Energy being converted into mass.",
          "Mass being converted into energy.",
          "Time dilation.",
          "Chemical combustion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In pair production, the pure energy of a photon (with energy $E = hf$) is converted into the rest masses of two particles ($e^-$ and $e^+$). The photon's energy must be at least $2m_e c^2$ for this to occur. This is the inverse of annihilation, where mass is converted into energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't a photon (a particle of light) ever be at rest?",
        "options": [
          "Because it would explode.",
          "Because it has zero rest mass; it only exists because of its momentum and energy at speed $c$.",
          "Because gravity pushes it too hard.",
          "Because it is made of pure electricity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Photons are massless particles. In relativity, any massless particle must travel at the speed of light $c$ in all inertial frames. A photon at rest would have zero energy and momentum ($E=pc$), implying it wouldn't exist. Its existence is intrinsically tied to its motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the energy-momentum relationship $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, if a particle is massless ($m=0$), what is its energy?",
        "options": [
          "$E = 0$",
          "$E = pc$",
          "$E = mc^2$",
          "$E = \\gamma c$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Substituting $m=0$ simplifies the famous equation to $E^2 = (pc)^2$, or $E = pc$. This is the relationship for photons and all massless particles. It shows that their energy is directly proportional to their momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you could perfectly convert 1 gram of matter into energy, it would be enough to power a small town for a significant time. Why don't we do this for all our energy needs?",
        "options": [
          "Energy cannot be created from matter.",
          "It is extremely difficult to achieve 100% conversion (total annihilation).",
          "Matter is too expensive.",
          "The resulting energy would be too cold to use."
        ],
        "explanation": "Perfect conversion ($100\\%$ mass-to-energy) is only possible through matter-antimatter annihilation, which is incredibly difficult to produce and contain on a practical scale. Current nuclear technologies (fission, fusion) only convert a very small fraction (less than $1\\%$) of the mass involved into usable energy.",

        "90": "Excellent! Mastery of mass-energy equivalence: You understand $E=mc^2$ as a conversion formula, can distinguish rest energy, total energy, and kinetic energy, apply the concept to nuclear reactions and astrophysics, and understand the limits and practical implications of mass-energy conversion.",
        "70": "Very good! Strong conceptual grasp of $E=mc^2$. Key review areas: 1) The relationship between total energy, rest energy, and kinetic energy ($K=(\\gamma-1)mc^2$), 2) Applying the concept to real phenomena (Sun's energy, nuclear power, pair production), 3) The energy-momentum relation for massless particles, 4) Why 100% conversion is not currently practical.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) Memorizing the core equations: Rest Energy $E_0=mc^2$, Total Energy $E=\\gamma m c^2$, Kinetic Energy $K=(\\gamma-1)mc^2$, 2) Understanding that mass can be converted into energy and vice-versa, 3) Knowing that the Sun and nuclear power are practical examples.",
        "0": "Start with the basics: Learn the meaning of $E=mc^2$: mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into each other. A small amount of mass corresponds to a huge amount of energy. Understand that this is the principle behind nuclear power and the Sun's energy."
