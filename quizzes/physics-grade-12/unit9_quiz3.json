      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What was the primary conclusion of the Michelson-Morley experiment regarding the 'Luminiferous Aether'?",
        "options": [
          "The Aether exists and affects the speed of light.",
          "The Earth is stationary in the center of the Aether.",
          "The Aether does not exist; light does not require a medium to travel.",
          "Light moves faster when traveling with the Aether wind."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Michelson-Morley (1887): no detectable aether wind despite Earth's orbital speed (30 km/s). Null result disproved luminiferous aether hypothesis. Key evidence that light doesn't need medium, speed $c$ independent of motion through hypothesized aether."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Einstein's First Postulate (The Principle of Relativity) states that:",
        "options": [
          "Time is the same for all observers.",
          "The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.",
          "Light travels in a straight line only in a vacuum.",
          "Only moving observers see the effects of gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First postulate: extension of Galilean relativity to all physics, not just mechanics. No preferred inertial frame → cannot detect uniform motion by local experiments. Fundamental symmetry principle underlying special relativity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Einstein's Second Postulate (The Constancy of the Speed of Light) states that:",
        "options": [
          "Light speed changes based on the speed of the source.",
          "The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant $c$, regardless of the motion of the source or observer.",
          "Light travels faster if the observer is moving toward the source.",
          "The speed of light is infinite in a perfect vacuum."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$c = 299,792,458\\ \\text{m/s}$ exactly (SI definition). Independent of source/observer motion. From Maxwell's equations: $c = 1/\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0}$. Leads to Lorentz transformation replacing Galilean transformation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an observer on a spaceship moving at $0.8c$ fires a laser beam forward, an observer standing on a nearby planet will measure the speed of that laser beam to be:",
        "options": [
          "$1.8c$",
          "$0.8c$",
          "$c$",
          "$0.2c$"
        ],
        "explanation": "Light speed invariant: $c$ always. Galilean would give $1.8c$ → violates second postulate. Verified by experiments: binary stars, particle accelerators (decay of moving π⁰→γγ), GPS timing. Lorentz velocity addition formula gives $c$ for any combination.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an immediate consequence of the two postulates?",
        "options": [
          "Mass is always conserved in nuclear reactions.",
          "Simultaneous events for one observer may not be simultaneous for another.",
          "The speed of sound is also constant in all frames.",
          "Gravity is stronger for moving objects."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Relativity of simultaneity: because $c$ constant, different inertial frames disagree on timing of spatially separated events. Example: lightning strikes at train ends appear simultaneous to platform observer but not to moving train observer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Special Relativity is 'Special' because it only applies to:",
        "options": [
          "Objects moving at the speed of light.",
          "Frames of reference that are not accelerating (Inertial frames).",
          "Gravity-heavy environments like black holes.",
          "Subatomic particles only."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Special' = restricted to inertial frames. 'General' relativity (1915) extends to accelerating frames and gravity via equivalence principle. Special relativity foundation for particle physics, electromagnetism, but needs generalization for cosmology, gravity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you are in a spaceship with no windows moving at a constant velocity, which experiment could you perform to determine your speed?",
        "options": [
          "Measure the time it takes for a ball to drop.",
          "Measure the speed of light from a bulb inside the ship.",
          "Use a highly sensitive accelerometer.",
          "No experiment can determine your constant velocity from within the frame."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "First postulate: no local experiment detects uniform motion. Ball drops straight down, light speed constant inside. Only acceleration detectable (accelerometer). Only by looking outside (external reference) can velocity be measured."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In classical (Galilean) relativity, $v = v_1 + v_2$. In Special Relativity, this formula is replaced because:",
        "options": [
          "It allows for speeds greater than $c$, which is impossible.",
          "It only works for sound waves.",
          "It assumes time is relative.",
          "It doesn't account for friction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Galilean addition: $u' = u + v$ can exceed $c$. Lorentz velocity addition: $u' = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c^2)$. For $u,v \\ll c$ reduces to Galilean. For $u=c$: $u'=c$ always. Ensures $c$ as universal speed limit."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Relativity of Simultaneity' is most noticeable when events are:",
        "options": [
          "Happening at the same location.",
          "Spatially separated (at different locations).",
          "Happening very slowly.",
          "Observed by people at rest."
        ],
        "explanation": "For events at same location: simultaneity absolute (all observers agree). For spatially separated events: light travel time differences cause frame-dependent simultaneity. Effect proportional to $Lv/c^2$ where $L$ = separation.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Einstein was inspired to create these postulates because of a contradiction between:",
        "options": [
          "Newton's Laws and Maxwell's Equations of Electromagnetism.",
          "Gravity and Friction.",
          "Thermodynamics and Chemistry.",
          "Planetary motion and Atomic structure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conflict: Galilean relativity + Newton's mechanics vs. Maxwell's electromagnetism (constant $c$). Michelson-Morley showed no aether wind. Einstein's 1905 resolution: modify concepts of space/time rather than electromagnetism. Result: special relativity."
