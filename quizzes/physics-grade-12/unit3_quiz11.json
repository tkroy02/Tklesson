          "$7\\pi/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $x = 4$ cm: $v = \\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - x^2} = \\omega\\sqrt{25 - 16} = 3\\omega$ and $a = \\omega^2 x = 4\\omega^2$. Setting magnitudes equal: $3\\omega = 4\\omega^2 \\Rightarrow \\omega = 3/4$ rad/s. Period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega = 8\\pi/3$ s."

If the radius of the bottle is 2.5 cm then $\\omega$ is close to (density of water = $10^3$ kg/m³):",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Restoring force: $F = -(\\rho A g)x$, where $A = \\pi r^2$. Angular frequency $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho A g}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho (\\pi r^2) g}{m}}$. Mass $m = 0.31$ kg, $r = 0.025$ m, $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m³. Calculation gives $\\omega \\approx 7.95$ rad/s (none of the options match exactly, but 5.00 is closest)."

        "explanation": "$K_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2A^2$ with $\\omega = \\sqrt{g/L}$ and $A = L\\theta$. So $K \\propto \\frac{1}{L} \\times L^2 = L$. Doubling length doubles maximum kinetic energy: $K_2 = 2K_1$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Amplitude: $A = A_0 e^{-(b/2m)t}$. Halving in 10 oscillations (2 seconds): $1/2 = e^{-(b/2m)2} \\Rightarrow b/2m = (\\ln 2)/2$. For $A/A_0 = 1/1000$: $e^{-(b/2m)t} = 10^{-3} \\Rightarrow (b/2m)t = 3\\ln 10$. Solving: $t = (6\\ln 10)/\\ln 2 \\approx 20$ s."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For jagged end: $\\lambda/4 = \\text{distance} + \\text{end correction}$. Let end correction = $e$. For 512 Hz: $v/(4\\times512) = 0.11 + e$. For 256 Hz: $v/(4\\times256) = 0.27 + e$. Subtracting: $v/(4\\times256) - v/(4\\times512) = 0.16 \\Rightarrow v/(1024) = 0.16 \\Rightarrow v = 327.68$ m/s."
