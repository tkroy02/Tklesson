        "question": "Which of the following best describes a longitudinal wave?",
        "options": [
          "Particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the wave direction.",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For mechanical waves on a string, speed is determined by the medium properties: $v = \\sqrt{T/\\mu}$, where $T$ is tension and $\\mu$ is linear density. Frequency changes affect wavelength but not speed."

          "$2\\pi$ rad ($360^\\circ$)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A crest represents maximum positive displacement, while a trough represents maximum negative displacement. They are opposite phases, separated by $\\pi$ radians or $180^\\circ$."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For transverse waves on a string, speed is given by $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$, where $T$ is tension and $\\mu$ is mass per unit length."

          "Seismic wave"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Light (electromagnetic waves) does not require a physical medium and can propagate through a vacuum. Sound, water, and seismic waves all require material media."

          "The period of the wave."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The wave number $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$ represents the spatial frequency of the wave, indicating how many radians of phase change occur per unit distance."

          "Amplitude"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Frequency is determined by the source and remains constant when a wave crosses boundaries between different media. Velocity and wavelength change according to $v = f\\lambda$."
