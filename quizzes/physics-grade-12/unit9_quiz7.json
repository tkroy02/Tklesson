      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spaceship has a proper length ($L_0$) of $100\\text{ m}$. If it flies past Earth at $v = 0.8c$, what length do Earth-based observers measure?",
        "options": [
          "$36\\text{ m}$",
          "$60\\text{ m}$",
          "$100\\text{ m}$",
          "$167\\text{ m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Step 1: $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2} = 1/\\sqrt{0.36} = 1/0.6 = 1.667$.\nStep 2: $L = L_0 / \\gamma = 100\\text{ m} / 1.667 = 60\\text{ m}$. Earth observers measure the contracted length."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A meter stick ($L_0 = 1.0\\text{ m}$) is moving at such a high speed that it appears to be only $50\\text{ cm}$ ($0.5\\text{ m}$) long to a stationary observer. What is the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) for this speed?",
        "options": [
          "$0.5$",
          "$1.5$",
          "$2.0$",
          "$4.0$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using the length contraction formula $L = L_0 / \\gamma$, we solve for $\\gamma$: $0.5\\text{ m} = 1.0\\text{ m} / \\gamma \\implies \\gamma = 1.0 / 0.5 = 2.0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what speed must an object travel for its length to contract to exactly half of its proper length?",

          "$0.5c$",
          "$0.707c$",
          "$0.866c$",
          "$0.99c$"
        ],
        "explanation": "Half-length means $L = L_0 / 2$, requiring $\\gamma = 2$. Solve $2 = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \\implies \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = 0.5 \\implies v^2/c^2 = 3/4 \\implies v = \\sqrt{3}/2\\ c \\approx 0.866c$.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A painting on the wall of a spaceship is $2.0\\text{ m}$ wide and $1.0\\text{ m}$ tall. If the ship flies past you at $0.9c$ in the horizontal direction (width-wise), what dimensions do you observe?",
        "options": [
          "$2.0\\text{ m}$ wide, $1.0\\text{ m}$ tall",
          "$0.87\\text{ m}$ wide, $1.0\\text{ m}$ tall",
          "$0.87\\text{ m}$ wide, $0.44\\text{ m}$ tall",
          "$2.0\\text{ m}$ wide, $0.44\\text{ m}$ tall"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Only the dimension parallel to motion (width) contracts. At $v=0.9c$, $\\gamma \\approx 2.29$. Contracted width: $2.0\\text{ m} / 2.29 = 0.87\\text{ m}$. The height (perpendicular to motion) remains $1.0\\text{ m}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To an observer on Earth, the distance to a nearby star is $10\\text{ light-years}$. To an astronaut traveling at $v = 0.99c$ ($\\gamma \\approx 7$), the distance to that same star is approximately:",
        "options": [
          "$70\\text{ light-years}$",
          "$10\\text{ light-years}$",
          "$1.4\\text{ light-years}$",
          "$0.14\\text{ light-years}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From the astronaut's frame, the star is moving at high speed towards them. Therefore, the distance is contracted: $L = L_0 / \\gamma = 10\\text{ ly} / 7 \\approx 1.42\\text{ ly}$. This explains how they can make the trip in a much shorter proper time."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you measure the length of a moving rod to be $L$, and then you speed up so you are moving at the same velocity as the rod, your new measurement will be:",
        "options": [
          "Smaller than $L$.",
          "Equal to $L$.",
          "Greater than $L$.",
          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Initially, you measured the contracted length $L$. Once you are in the rod's rest frame, you are measuring its proper length $L_0$, and since $L_0 > L$, the new measurement will be greater than $L$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the formula $L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}$, the variable $\\beta$ represents:",
        "options": [
          "The Lorentz factor.",
          "The ratio $v/c$.",
          "The speed of light.",
          "The proper time."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In relativity, $\\beta$ is the standard notation for the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of light: $\\beta = v/c$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A square with area $1.0\\text{ m}^2$ moves past an observer at $0.6c$ ($\\gamma = 1.25$) parallel to one of its sides. What is the observed area?",
        "options": [
          "$1.0\\text{ m}^2$",
          "$1.25\\text{ m}^2$",
          "$0.8\\text{ m}^2$",
          "$0.64\\text{ m}^2$"
        ],
        "explanation": "Side length = $\\sqrt{1.0} = 1.0\\text{ m}$. The side parallel to motion contracts to $1.0 / 1.25 = 0.8\\text{ m}$. The perpendicular side remains $1.0\\text{ m}$. New area = $0.8 \\times 1.0 = 0.8\\text{ m}^2$.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the measured length of an object traveling at the speed of light ($c$)?",
        "options": [
          "Its proper length.",
          "Infinity.",
          "Zero.",
          "Negative."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For $v = c$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-1}$ is undefined (approaches infinity). The formula $L = L_0 / \\gamma$ would give $L \\to 0$ as $v \\to c$. This is a theoretical limit for massless particles like photons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the proper length of a spaceship ($L_0$) considered an 'invariant' property for the pilot, but not for the observer on the ground?",
        "options": [
          "Because the pilot is biased.",
          "Because the ground observer's clock is broken.",
          "Because 'proper' measurements are only defined in the rest frame.",
          "Because the pilot is moving."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The proper length $L_0$ is an invariant property of the object itself, but it is *defined* as the length measured in the object's rest frame. The pilot measures it directly. The ground observer measures a different, contracted length. However, if both know the relative speed $v$, they can use the formula $L_0 = \\gamma L$ to compute the same invariant $L_0$."

        "70": "Very good! Strong quantitative skills in length contraction. Review: 1) Solving for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) from a given contraction, 2) Applying contraction to multi-dimensional objects (areas, painting dimensions), 3) The 'star travel' distance contraction scenario, 4) The conceptual meaning of an 'invariant' like $L_0$.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) Memorizing and directly applying the formula $L = L_0 / \\gamma$, 2) Practicing basic $\\gamma$ calculations for given speeds, 3) Recognizing that only the parallel dimension contracts, 4) Understanding that proper length is the maximum length (rest frame measurement).",
        "0": "Start with the basics: Learn the length contraction formula $L = L_0 / \\gamma$. Practice calculating $\\gamma$ for simple speeds like $0.6c$ and $0.8c$. Work on identifying which length is the proper length ($L_0$) in a word problem."
