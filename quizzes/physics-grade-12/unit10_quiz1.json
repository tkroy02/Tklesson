    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Equivalence Principle. In a closed system, Einstein asserted that:",
        "options": [
          "Gravity is fundamentally different from acceleration.",
          "Gravity is equivalent to acceleration in its local effects.",
          "Gravity originates from magnetic interactions.",
          "Gravity is proportional to velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Equivalence Principle states that, locally, the effects of a uniform gravitational field are indistinguishable from those of being in an accelerating frame of reference."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Spacetime Geometry. General Relativity defines gravity as:",
        "options": [
          "A force mediated by graviton particles.",
          "A form of mechanical tethering between masses.",
          "A consequence of the curvature of spacetime.",
          "A pressure differential in the cosmic fluid."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Einstein's revolutionary insight: mass and energy curve spacetime, and objects move along the straightest possible paths (geodesics) in this curved geometry, which we perceive as gravity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Light and Gravity. When light passes a massive object, it:",
        "options": [
          "Increases its speed momentarily.",
          "Slows down due to gravitational drag.",
          "Follows a curved path (gravitational lensing).",
          "Refracts as in a standard optical medium."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Light follows the curvature of spacetime. When passing near a massive object like a star or galaxy, its path bends—a phenomenon called gravitational lensing, first confirmed during the 1919 solar eclipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Gravitational Time Dilation. As you move closer to a massive body, time:",
        "options": [
          "Accelerates relative to a distant observer.",
          "Passes more slowly relative to a distant observer.",
          "Stops changing entirely (gravitational freeze).",
          "Begins to flow backwards."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Clocks in stronger gravitational fields (closer to massive bodies) tick slower compared to clocks in weaker fields. This has been verified by comparing clocks at different altitudes on Earth."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Free-Fall Physics. An observer in free-fall experiences:",
        "options": [
          "A constant sensation of weight.",
          "Inertial motion (no feeling of gravity).",
          "A measurable 'proper' acceleration.",
          "A state of absolute rest."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the Equivalence Principle, a freely falling observer is locally inertial—they feel weightless and cannot detect the gravitational field by local experiments. This is the physics behind astronauts 'floating' in orbit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Geodesics. In curved spacetime, a geodesic is the:",
        "options": [
          "Longest possible route between two events.",
          "Straightest possible path between two events.",
          "Fixed orbital radius around a central mass.",
          "Boundary separating different time flows."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In the curved geometry of general relativity, a geodesic is the generalization of a 'straight line'—the path of extremal proper time (usually maximum) that a free-falling object follows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Gravitational Redshift. As light escapes a gravity well, its frequency:",
        "options": [
          "Increases (shifts toward blue).",
          "Decreases (shifts toward red).",
          "Remains exactly the same.",
          "Becomes infinite at the boundary."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Photons lose energy as they climb out of a gravitational field. Since photon energy is proportional to frequency (E = hf), the frequency decreases, causing a redshift toward longer wavelengths."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Black Hole Boundary. The Event Horizon is defined by:",
        "options": [
          "A surface of infinite mass density.",
          "The radius where escape velocity equals c.",
          "The location of the central singularity.",
          "A boundary of absolute zero temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The event horizon is the 'point of no return.' At this boundary, the escape velocity equals the speed of light. Since nothing can exceed c, nothing inside can escape to the outside universe."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Real-world Application. GPS satellites must account for:",
        "options": [
          "Gravitational blueshift from Earth.",
          "Frame-dragging effects of Earth's rotation.",
          "Relativistic time drift from speed and gravity.",
          "Atmospheric friction in low orbit."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "GPS satellites experience both special relativistic time dilation (from their orbital speed) and general relativistic time dilation (from being in a weaker gravitational field than Earth's surface). If unaccounted for, these effects would cause GPS positioning errors of several kilometers per day."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Spacetime Curvature Source. What determines the degree of curvature?",
        "options": [
          "The distribution of mass and energy.",
          "Linear momentum alone.",
          "The local temperature of space.",
          "The chemical composition of matter."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Einstein's field equations state that the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the stress-energy tensor, which includes mass, energy, momentum, and pressure. Mass-energy tells spacetime how to curve."

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: Gravity as curvature (not a force), the Equivalence Principle (gravity ≈ acceleration), gravitational time dilation (clocks slow in stronger fields), and the cause of gravitational lensing/redshift.",
        "0": "Start with the big ideas: 1) Gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. 2) The Equivalence Principle: Being in gravity feels like accelerating. 3) Strong gravity slows time and bends light."
