    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A projectile is launched at an angle. At the very top of its trajectory, its vertical velocity ($v_y$) is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximum",
          "Equal to $v_x$",
          "Zero",
          "$9.8\\ \\text{m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At the peak, the vertical velocity is zero. The object has stopped moving upward but has not yet begun moving downward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves at a constant velocity. The net force ($F_{net}$) acting on the object is:",
        "options": [
          "Proportional to velocity",
          "Zero",
          "Equal to weight",
          "Constant and positive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's First Law: An object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force. Constant velocity means zero acceleration, which requires zero net force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the velocity of a moving car, its Kinetic Energy ($K$):",
        "options": [
          "Doubles",
          "Triples",
          "Quadruples",
          "Stays the same"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Kinetic energy is $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If velocity doubles ($v \\to 2v$), then $K \\to \\frac{1}{2}m(2v)^2 = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Kinetic energy increases by a factor of four."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly inelastic collision, the two objects:",
        "options": [
          "Bounce off each other",
          "Explode",
          "Stick together",
          "Lose all momentum"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A perfectly inelastic collision is defined by maximum kinetic energy loss while conserving momentum. The objects coalesce and move together as one combined mass after impact."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car rounds a curve. The centripetal force is provided by:",
        "options": [
          "Inertia",
          "Friction",
          "Gravity",
          "Centrifugal force"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a car on a horizontal road, the inward centripetal force needed to turn is supplied by static friction between the tires and the road surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the distance between two point charges is tripled, the Electric Force ($F_e$) becomes:",
        "options": [
          "$3 \\times$ stronger",
          "$9 \\times$ stronger",
          "$1/3$ as strong",
          "$1/9$ as strong"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Coulomb's Law: $F_e \\propto 1/r^2$. If distance $r$ triples, the force decreases by a factor of $3^2 = 9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A proton enters a magnetic field moving parallel to the field lines. The magnetic force ($F_B$) is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximum",
          "Downward",
          "Zero",
          "Circular"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Magnetic force is $F_B = qvB\\sin\\theta$. If velocity is parallel to the field ($\\theta = 0$), then $\\sin 0 = 0$, and the force is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To a stationary observer, a clock moving at $0.9c$ appears to tick:",
        "options": [
          "Faster",
          "Slower",
          "Normally",
          "Backward"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Time dilation: Moving clocks run slow as measured by a stationary observer. At $v = 0.9c$, $\\gamma \\approx 2.3$, so each second on the moving clock takes about 2.3 seconds of the observer's time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy equivalent of a mass at rest is defined by:",
        "options": [
          "$E = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2$",
          "$E = mgh$",
          "$E = mc^2$",
          "$E = hf$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Einstein's mass-energy equivalence: $E_0 = mc^2$ is the rest energy—the energy an object possesses due to its mass when it is not moving."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $100\\ \\text{m}$ ship flies past at $0.8c$. In the direction of motion, you measure it to be:",
        "options": [
          "$100\\ \\text{m}$",
          "$125\\ \\text{m}$",
          "$60\\ \\text{m}$",
          "$80\\ \\text{m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Length contraction: $L = L_0/\\gamma$. For $v = 0.8c$, $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-0.8^2} = 1/0.6 \\approx 1.667$. Contracted length: $100 / 1.667 \\approx 60\\ \\text{m}$."
