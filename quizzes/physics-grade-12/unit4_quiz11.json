    "duration": 45,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two point charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$, are separated by distance $r$. If $q_1$ is doubled and $r$ is tripled, how does the new electrostatic force $F'$ compare to the original force $F$?",
        "options": [
          "2/9 F",
          "2/3 F",
          "4/9 F",
          "6 F"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By Coulomb's Law, $F \\propto q/r^2$. Doubling the charge gives a factor of 2, and tripling the distance gives a factor of $1/3^2 = 1/9$. The net change is $2/9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement is always true regarding the relationship between electric field lines and equipotential surfaces?",
        "options": [
          "Field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces.",
          "Field lines are always parallel to equipotential surfaces.",
          "Field lines point in the direction of increasing potential.",
          "Equipotential surfaces only exist in uniform fields."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since no work is done moving a charge along an equipotential surface ($W = 0$), the force (field) must have no component parallel to the surface, making it perpendicular."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle with charge $+q$ is moved from a point with potential $100\\,V$ to a point with potential $150\\,V$. What is the change in the particle's electric potential energy?",
        "options": [
          "+50q",
          "-50q",
          "+150q",
          "+50/q"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The change in potential energy $\\Delta U = q\\Delta V$. Here, $q(150V - 100V) = +50q$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the capacitance $C$ of a parallel-plate capacitor if a dielectric ($\\kappa = 4$) is inserted and the plate separation is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "The capacitance doubles.",
          "The capacitance is halved.",
          "The capacitance quadruples.",
          "The capacitance remains unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $C = \\kappa\\epsilon_0 A/d$, the factor is $4/2 = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the electric field in a region is zero, what must be true about the electric potential $V$?",
        "options": [
          "The potential is constant throughout the region.",
          "The potential must be zero.",
          "The potential is infinitely large.",
          "The potential increases linearly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $E = -\\Delta V/\\Delta r$, a zero field means the gradient of potential is zero, implying $V$ is constant (not necessarily zero)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An electron is released from rest in a uniform electric field pointing to the right. What is its motion?",
        "options": [
          "It accelerates to the left at a constant rate.",
          "It moves to the right at a constant velocity.",
          "It accelerates to the right at a constant rate.",
          "It moves in a circular path."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The force on a negative charge ($F = qE$) is opposite the direction of the field. A uniform field exerts a constant force, resulting in constant acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two capacitors ($3\\,\\mu F$ and $6\\,\\mu F$) are connected in series. What is the total equivalent capacitance?",

          "2 \\mu F",
          "9 \\mu F",
          "4.5 \\mu F",
          "18 \\mu F"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For series: $1/C_{eq} = 1/3 + 1/6 = 3/6$. Therefore, $C_{eq} = 2\\,\\mu F$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The electric potential at distance $r$ from a point charge is $V$. What is the potential at distance $3r$?",
        "options": [
          "V / 3",
          "V / 9",
          "3V",
          "V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Potential $V$ follows a $1/r$ relationship, unlike the electric field which follows $1/r^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the energy density of a vacuum electric field is $u_E$, what is the energy density if the field strength $E$ is tripled?",

          "9 u_E",
          "3 u_E",
          "27 u_E",
          "\\sqrt{3} u_E"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy density $u_E = 0.5\\epsilon_0 E^2$. Tripling $E$ results in $3^2 = 9$ times the density."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A capacitor is charged and then disconnected from a battery. If the plates are moved closer, what happens to the stored energy?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases.",
          "It increases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With $Q$ constant, $U = Q^2/2C$. Moving plates closer increases $C$, which inversely decreases $U$."
