    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A force F is applied to a rigid body at a position vector r. If both F and r are doubled in magnitude while keeping their relative angle the same, the resulting torque changes by what factor?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "2",
          "1",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torque is defined as $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$. Since it is a linear product of both $r$ and $F$, doubling both results in $2r \\times 2F = 4(r \\times F)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle moves in the xy-plane along the line y = 5. As the particle's x-coordinate increases, what happens to its angular momentum relative to the origin?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant.",
          "It increases linearly.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It depends on the mass only."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a particle moving at constant velocity, $L = mvd$, where $d$ is the perpendicular distance to the origin. Since $y=5$ is parallel to the velocity, $d$ remains constant at 5, keeping $L$ constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The net torque on a system is zero, but the system is undergoing a change in its internal mass distribution. Which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "Angular momentum is conserved, but angular velocity changes.",
          "Angular momentum and angular velocity are both conserved.",
          "Neither angular momentum nor angular velocity is conserved.",
          "Rotational kinetic energy must be conserved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conservation of angular momentum ($L = I\\omega$) applies when $\\tau_{ext} = 0$. If mass distribution changes ($I$ changes), $\\omega$ must change to keep $L$ constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A torque is applied to a spinning gyroscope in a direction perpendicular to its angular momentum vector. What is the primary physical result?",
        "options": [
          "The axis of rotation precesses.",
          "The gyroscope spins faster.",
          "The gyroscope stops spinning.",
          "The moment of inertia increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\vec{\\tau} = d\\vec{L}/dt$, a torque perpendicular to $L$ changes the direction of the angular momentum vector without changing its magnitude, causing precession."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the angular momentum vector of a system is pointing in the +z direction and it begins to decrease in magnitude, in which direction is the net torque acting?",
        "options": [
          "-z direction",
          "+z direction",
          "+x direction",
          "-y direction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torque is the rate of change of angular momentum. To decrease a vector in the +z direction, the change vector ($d\\vec{L}$) must be in the opposite direction (-z)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two cylinders have the same mass and the same angular momentum. Cylinder A has a larger radius than Cylinder B. Which has the higher rotational kinetic energy?",
        "options": [
          "Cylinder B",
          "Cylinder A",
          "They have the same energy.",
          "It depends on their lengths."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{rot} = L^2 / (2I)$. Since $L$ is equal, the cylinder with the smaller $I$ (Cylinder B, smaller radius) will have the higher kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rigid body is rotating about a fixed axis. If the net torque is suddenly removed, what happens to the work-energy state of the system?",
        "options": [
          "The rotational kinetic energy remains constant.",
          "The angular acceleration becomes constant and non-zero.",
          "The angular velocity decreases to zero.",
          "The power delivered to the system increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$W = \\int \\tau d\\theta$. If $\\tau = 0$, no work is done, and by the Work-Energy Theorem, $\\Delta K_{rot} = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Consider the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Why is the Earth's angular momentum about the Sun considered conserved despite the Sun's gravitational pull?",
        "options": [
          "The gravitational force is central and exerts no torque.",
          "The gravitational force is too weak to create torque.",
          "The Earth is a rigid body.",
          "The Sun's rotation cancels the Earth's torque."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity acts along the line connecting the two centers ($r$). Since $F$ is parallel to $r$, the cross product $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hollow sphere and a solid sphere of equal mass are rotating with the same angular momentum. Which one is spinning with a higher angular velocity?",
        "options": [
          "The solid sphere",
          "The hollow sphere",
          "They have the same angular velocity.",
          "The hollow sphere, because it is less dense."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$L = I\\omega$. The solid sphere has a smaller moment of inertia ($0.4MR^2$ vs $0.67MR^2$). Therefore, it must have a higher $\\omega$ to achieve the same $L$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a situation where a system has linear momentum but zero angular momentum relative to a specific origin?",
        "options": [
          "The velocity vector of the center of mass points directly toward the origin.",
          "The system is rotating at a constant rate.",
          "The system is in static equilibrium.",
          "The system is moving in a perfect circle around the origin."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the velocity vector $v$ passes through the origin, the position vector $r$ and momentum $p$ are collinear ($0^\\circ$ or $180^\\circ$), making the cross product $r \\times p = 0$."
