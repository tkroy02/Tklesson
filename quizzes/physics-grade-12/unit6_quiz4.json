    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a purely inductive circuit, what is the phase relationship between current ($I$) and voltage ($V$)?",
        "options": [
          "They are in phase.",
          "Current leads voltage by $90^\\circ$.",
          "Current lags voltage by $90^\\circ$.",
          "Current lags voltage by $180^\\circ$."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inductors oppose changes in current: $V_L = L(di/dt)$. For sinusoidal AC, this creates 90° phase lag. Mnemonic: ELI (Emf/Voltage leads Current in Inductor)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the inductive reactance ($X_L$) if the frequency of the AC source is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "It is halved.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inductive reactance: $X_L = 2\\pi f L$, directly proportional to frequency $f$. Doubling $f$ doubles $X_L$. High $f$ → high opposition to current change."
      },
      {

        "question": "In a purely capacitive circuit, what is the phase relationship between current and voltage?",

          "Current leads voltage by $90^\\circ$.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capacitors oppose voltage changes: $I_C = C(dv/dt)$. For sinusoidal AC, current leads voltage by 90°. Mnemonic: ICE (Current leads Emf/Voltage in Capacitor)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which component acts as a \"short circuit\" to high-frequency AC signals?",

          "Capacitor",
          "Battery"

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Capacitive reactance $X_C = 1/(2\\pi f C) \\to 0$ as $f \\to \\infty$. At very high frequencies, capacitors effectively become short circuits (low impedance)."

          "Resistance",
          "Impedance ($Z$)",
          "Capacitance"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Impedance $Z$ combines resistance $R$ and reactance $X = X_L - X_C$: $Z = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}$. Measured in ohms ($\\Omega$), it's AC equivalent of DC resistance."

          "The phase angle is $90^\\circ$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resonance occurs when $X_L = X_C$ (at $f_0 = 1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{LC})$). Reactances cancel: $Z = R$ (minimum impedance), current maximum, phase angle $\\phi = 0°$ (voltage and current in phase)."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Both $X_L$ and $X_C$ are measured in ohms ($\\Omega$). $X_L = 2\\pi f L$: $[\\text{Hz}] \\times [\\text{H}] = [\\text{s}^{-1}] \\times [\\text{V·s/A}] = [\\text{V/A}] = [\\Omega]$. Similarly for $X_C$."

          "Current / Voltage"

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Power factor $= \\cos\\phi = R/Z$, where $\\phi$ is phase angle between voltage and current. Range: 0 to 1. Measures efficiency of power delivery; low PF means more current needed for same real power."
