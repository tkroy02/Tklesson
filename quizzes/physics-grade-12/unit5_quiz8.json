    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Lenz's Law is primarily used to determine which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "The magnitude of induced EMF.",
          "The direction of induced current.",
          "The resistance of the induction coil.",
          "The speed of the magnet."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lenz's Law gives the direction of induced current: \"The induced current flows in such a direction as to oppose the change that produced it.\" The magnitude comes from Faraday's Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a North pole of a magnet is moved away from a stationary coil, the side of the coil facing the magnet will become a:",
        "options": [
          "North pole to repel it.",
          "South pole to attract it.",
          "Neutral pole.",
          "Positive charge."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As the North pole moves away, the flux through the coil decreases. The induced current creates a magnetic field to oppose this decrease—by trying to maintain the original flux. This requires attracting the departing North pole, so the coil's face becomes a South pole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A copper ring is dropped horizontally through a vertical magnetic field pointing up. As the ring enters the field, the induced current is:",
        "options": [
          "Clockwise (viewed from above).",
          "Counter-clockwise (viewed from above).",
          "Zero.",
          "Alternating."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Flux upward through the ring increases as it enters. To oppose this increase, the induced current creates a magnetic field downward. Using right-hand rule for loops: a downward field requires clockwise current (viewed from above)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is Lenz's Law a necessary consequence of the Law of Conservation of Energy?",
        "options": [
          "If the induced field reinforced the change, the magnet would accelerate indefinitely without extra work.",
          "It ensures that resistance is always positive.",
          "It prevents electrons from escaping the wire.",
          "It allows transformers to step up voltage."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If induced current reinforced the change (instead of opposing it), it would create a positive feedback loop: motion would increase EMF, which would increase current, which would increase motion, generating energy from nothing. Opposition requires work to be done against the induced forces, conserving energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A magnet is falling through a plastic pipe vs. a copper pipe. Which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "The magnet falls at the same speed in both.",
          "The magnet falls slower in the plastic pipe.",
          "The magnet falls slower in the copper pipe due to magnetic braking.",
          "The magnet speeds up in the copper pipe."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In the conducting copper pipe, the falling magnet induces eddy currents. By Lenz's Law, these currents create magnetic fields that oppose the magnet's motion (magnetic braking). Plastic is an insulator, so no significant eddy currents form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metal loop is shrinking in a constant magnetic field directed into the page. The induced current will be:",
        "options": [
          "Clockwise.",
          "Counter-clockwise.",
          "Zero.",
          "Random."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the loop shrinks, area decreases, so flux into the page ($\\Phi = BA$) decreases. To oppose this decrease, the induced current creates additional magnetic field into the page. Right-hand rule: for field into page inside loop, current flows clockwise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the direction of induced current in a straight wire moving through a field (Motional EMF), which rule is best?",
        "options": [
          "Right-Hand Grip Rule.",
          "Fleming's Right-Hand Rule (Gen. Rule).",
          "Left-Hand Rule.",
          "Lenz's Law does not apply to straight wires."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fleming's Right-Hand Rule (for generators): Thumb = Motion, First finger = Field, Second finger = Current. This is equivalent to applying Lenz's Law to determine current direction in moving conductors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a South pole is pushed into a coil, what is the direction of the induced current (facing the coil)?",
        "options": [
          "Clockwise.",
          "Counter-clockwise.",
          "Upward.",
          "Downward."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As South pole approaches, flux into the coil (if South pole faces it) increases. To oppose, the coil creates a South pole to repel the incoming South pole. A South pole field lines enter the coil face. Right-hand rule: for field into coil face, current is clockwise when viewed from that side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A flat coil is rotated 180° in a magnetic field. At what point is the induced EMF zero?",
        "options": [
          "When the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the field.",
          "When the plane of the coil is parallel to the field.",
          "At the 45° mark.",
          "It is never zero during rotation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "EMF $\\varepsilon = -d\\Phi/dt$. When coil is perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$, flux $\\Phi = BA\\cos\\theta$ is maximum ($\\cos 0° = 1$) but its rate of change is zero (derivative of cosine at peak). At that instant, $d\\Phi/dt = 0$, so $\\varepsilon = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An induced current only exists in a loop if:",
        "options": [
          "There is a magnetic field.",
          "The loop is made of a magnetic material like iron.",
          "There is a change in magnetic flux and the loop is a closed circuit.",
          "The loop is stationary."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Two conditions are necessary: (1) Changing magnetic flux ($d\\Phi/dt \\neq 0$) to induce an EMF (Faraday's Law), and (2) a closed conducting path to allow current to flow. A constant field or an open circuit produces no sustained current."
