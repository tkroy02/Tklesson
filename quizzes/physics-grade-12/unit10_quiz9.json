      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is launched from the ground at an angle. If it takes $4$ seconds to reach its maximum height, what is its total 'hang time' before hitting the ground?",
        "options": [
          "$4$ s",
          "$8$ s",
          "$16$ s",
          "$2$ s"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a symmetric projectile (launched and landing at the same height), time up equals time down. Total time of flight = 2 × time to max height = 2 × 4 s = 8 s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is in static equilibrium. This means:",
        "options": [
          "Both $\\sum F = 0$ and $\\sum \\tau = 0$",
          "Only $\\sum F = 0$",
          "The object must be at rest",
          "Only $\\sum \\tau = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Static equilibrium requires both conditions: net force zero (no linear acceleration) and net torque zero (no rotational acceleration)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a non-conservative force?",
        "options": [
          "Gravity",
          "Elastic spring force",
          "Friction",
          "Electric force"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A conservative force (gravity, spring, electrostatic) does work independent of path and allows energy recovery. Friction is non-conservative—work depends on path and energy dissipates as heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a frictionless banked curve, the force that provides the centripetal acceleration is:",
        "options": [
          "Friction",
          "The horizontal component of the Normal Force",
          "The vertical component of Gravity",
          "Tension"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "On a frictionless banked turn, the normal force from the road has a horizontal component pointing toward the center of the curve, which provides the necessary centripetal force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2\\text{ kg}$ mass moving at $10\\text{ m/s}$ hits an identical $2\\text{ kg}$ mass at rest. If the collision is perfectly elastic and head-on, the first mass will:",
        "options": [
          "Continue moving at $10\\text{ m/s}$",
          "Stop completely",
          "Bounce back at $10\\text{ m/s}$",
          "Move forward at $5\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a 1D elastic collision between identical masses, the incoming object stops, transferring all its momentum and kinetic energy to the target object."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the charge inside a Gaussian surface, the total electric flux through the surface:",
        "options": [
          "Remains the same",
          "Doubles",
          "Quadruples",
          "Is halved"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gauss's Law: $\\Phi_E = q_{enc} / \\epsilon_0$. Flux is directly proportional to the enclosed charge. Doubling $q_{enc}$ doubles the flux."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle with charge $q$ and velocity $v$ enters a field $B$. If $v$ is doubled and $B$ is halved, the magnetic force:",
        "options": [
          "Stays the same",
          "Doubles",
          "Is quartered",
          "Quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Magnetic force: $F = qvB\\sin\\theta$. New force = $q (2v) (B/2) = qvB$, unchanged if the angle $\\theta$ remains 90°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The equation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$ shows that even if a particle has no mass (like a photon), it still has:",
        "options": [
          "Velocity $= 0$",
          "Momentum",
          "Rest energy",
          "Infinite time dilation"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For $m = 0$, the equation simplifies to $E = pc$, showing that massless particles have energy and momentum but zero rest energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of wave cannot be polarized?",
        "options": [
          "Light waves",
          "Radio waves",
          "Sound waves",
          "X-rays"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Polarization is a property of transverse waves. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves (particle displacement parallel to direction of travel) and cannot be polarized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'mass defect' in a nucleus is converted into:",
        "options": [
          "Kinetic energy of electrons",
          "Binding energy holding the nucleus together",
          "Gravitational potential energy",
          "Neutrinos"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The mass defect is the difference between the mass of individual nucleons and the mass of the nucleus. This 'missing' mass, via $E=mc^2$, is the binding energy that holds the nucleus together."

        "90": "Excellent comprehensive mastery! You demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of symmetry in motion, equilibrium, force types, collisions, electromagnetism, relativity, and nuclear physics.",
        "70": "Very good cumulative review. Strengthen: symmetry in projectile flight, conditions for static equilibrium, non-conservative forces, identical mass elastic collisions, and Gauss's Law applications.",
        "50": "Fair overall. Focus on: time of flight for projectiles, $\\sum F=0$ and $\\sum\\tau=0$ for equilibrium, identifying non-conservative forces, velocity swap in elastic collisions, and the energy-momentum relation.",
        "0": "Start with fundamental concepts: symmetrical projectile time, static equilibrium conditions, what makes a force non-conservative, and the basic outcome of identical-mass elastic collisions."
