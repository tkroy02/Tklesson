    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Proper Length' ($L_0$)?",
        "options": [
          "The length of an object measured by an observer moving at $c$.",
          "The length of an object measured in the frame where the object is at rest.",
          "The length of an object corrected for gravitational curvature.",
          "The maximum possible length an object can reach."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The proper length $L_0$ is the length measured by an observer at rest relative to the object. It is the maximum measurable length of the object, analogous to proper time being the minimum measurable time interval."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which direction does an object contract when moving at relativistic speeds?",
        "options": [
          "In all directions (it shrinks uniformly).",
          "Only in the direction perpendicular to the motion.",
          "Only in the direction parallel to the motion.",
          "It actually expands rather than contracts."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Length contraction occurs exclusively in the dimension parallel to the object's velocity. Dimensions perpendicular to the motion remain unchanged."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A meter stick flies past you at $0.866c$ (where $\\gamma = 2$). What length do you measure for the meter stick?",
        "options": [
          "$2.0\\text{ meters}$",
          "$1.0\\text{ meter}$",
          "$0.5\\text{ meters}$",
          "$0.25\\text{ meters}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Step 1: $L_0 = 1.0\\ \\text{meter}$. \nStep 2: Use length contraction formula $L = L_0 / \\gamma$. \nStep 3: $L = 1.0 / 2 = 0.5$ meters. An observer moving with the stick would measure $1.0$ meter."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To the pilot of a spaceship moving at $0.99c$, the length of their own ship appears to be:",
        "options": [
          "Much shorter than its original length.",
          "Much longer than its original length.",
          "Its normal 'proper' length.",
          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Length contraction is a phenomenon measured by an observer in relative motion to the object. In the pilot's rest frame (the spaceship's frame), the ship is at rest. Therefore, the pilot measures the ship's proper length, $L_0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a moving observer view the distance between two stars compared to a stationary observer?",
        "options": [
          "The moving observer sees a shorter distance (contracted).",
          "The moving observer sees a longer distance (dilated).",
          "They both see the same distance.",
          "The stars appear to disappear."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distance between two fixed points (like two stars) is a length. From the moving observer's frame, the stars are moving at high speed. Therefore, the distance between them (their separation along the direction of motion) is contracted: $L = L_0 / \\gamma$. This explains why the moving observer can cover the distance in a shorter time from their perspective."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As an object's velocity approaches the speed of light ($v \\to c$), its measured length ($L$) along the direction of motion approaches:",
        "options": [
          "Infinity.",
          "Its proper length.",
          "Zero.",
          "The speed of light."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$L = L_0 / \\gamma$, and $\\gamma \\to \\infty$ as $v \\to c$. Therefore, $L \\to 0$. This is a theoretical limit; no object with mass can reach $v = c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a circle moves past you at a significant fraction of $c$ along the x-axis, what shape would you observe?",
        "options": [
          "A larger circle.",
          "An ellipse (squashed horizontally).",
          "A square.",
          "A point."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The horizontal diameter (parallel to motion) contracts by $1/\\gamma$, while the vertical diameter (perpendicular to motion) remains unchanged. The resulting shape is an ellipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Length contraction is a 'reciprocal' effect. If two identical rockets fly past each other at high speed:",
        "options": [
          "Only one pilot sees the other ship as shorter.",
          "Both pilots see the other's ship as shorter.",
          "Neither pilot sees any change.",
          "One sees a contraction, the other sees an expansion."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From the frame of Rocket A, Rocket B is moving, so B appears contracted. From the frame of Rocket B, Rocket A is moving, so A appears contracted. This symmetry is a cornerstone of special relativity and resolves the 'paradox' of which ship is 'really' shorter."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why don't we see a $100\\text{ m}$ dash track contract when we run on it?",
        "options": [
          "Human speed is too low for the Lorentz factor to be significantly different from $1$.",
          "The track is attached to the Earth.",
          "Our eyes move too fast to catch the effect.",
          "Length contraction only applies to light beams."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$v \\approx 10 \\ \\text{m/s}$. $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = 1/\\sqrt{1 - 10^2 / (9\\times10^{16})} \\approx 1 + 5.6\\times10^{-16}$. This is a deviation of less than one part in a quadrillion, far too small to measure or perceive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which experiment involving subatomic particles provides evidence for length contraction (from the particle's perspective)?",
        "options": [
          "The double-slit experiment.",
          "Muons reaching the ground (the muons 'see' the atmosphere's thickness as contracted).",
          "The gold foil experiment.",
          "The photoelectric effect."
        ],
        "explanation": "Muons created in the upper atmosphere have a very short half-life at rest. From Earth's frame, their high speed causes time dilation, allowing them to reach the surface. Equivalently, from the muon's frame, its lifetime is normal, but the thickness of the atmosphere is length-contracted, making the journey short enough to complete.",

      "scoreMessages": {
        "90": "Excellent! Mastery of length contraction concepts: clear identification of proper length, correct application of $L = L_0/\\gamma$, understanding of the reciprocal nature and direction of contraction, and ability to relate it to real-world evidence like muon decay.",
        "70": "Very good! Solid grasp of length contraction. Key review areas: 1) Reciprocal nature of the effect (each observer sees the other's frame contracted), 2) Distinction between what a moving observer measures for their own ship vs. a passing object, 3) Relationship between length contraction and time dilation in problems like muon decay.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) Memorizing and applying the formula $L = L_0 / \\gamma$, 2) Identifying which length is the 'proper length' in a scenario, 3) Understanding that contraction happens only in the direction of motion, 4) Recognizing why effects are negligible at everyday speeds.",
        "0": "Start with the basics: Learn the length contraction formula $L = L_0 / \\gamma$. Practice identifying the object at rest to find $L_0$. Understand that $\\gamma$ is always $\\geq 1$, so $L$ is always $\\leq L_0$."
