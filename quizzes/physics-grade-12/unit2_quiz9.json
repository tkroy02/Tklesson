    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Kepler's First Law, what is the shape of a planet's orbit, and where is the Sun located?",
        "options": [
          "Elliptical, with the Sun at one of the two foci.",
          "Circular, with the Sun at the exact center.",
          "Elliptical, with the Sun at the center of the ellipse.",
          "Parabolic, with the Sun at the vertex."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kepler's First Law states that planets move in ellipses, and the central body (the Sun) occupies one of the two mathematical focal points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Kepler's Second Law (the Law of Equal Areas) is a direct consequence of which fundamental physical principle?",
        "options": [
          "Conservation of Angular Momentum",
          "Conservation of Linear Momentum",
          "Newton's Third Law",
          "The Principle of Superposition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As a planet gets closer to the Sun, its speed increases to keep its angular momentum constant, resulting in an imaginary line sweeping out equal areas in equal times."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A planet is at its 'Perihelion' (closest approach to the Sun). Which of the following is true at this point?",
        "options": [
          "Its kinetic energy is at a maximum and potential energy is at a minimum.",
          "Its kinetic energy is at a minimum and potential energy is at a maximum.",
          "Both kinetic and potential energy are at their maximum.",
          "The orbital speed is at its minimum."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At Perihelion ($r$ is smallest), $E_g$ is most negative (minimum). To maintain constant total energy, $E_k$ (and thus speed) must be at its maximum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Planet X is 4 times further from the Sun than Planet Y, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet X compared to Planet Y?",
        "options": [
          "8 times",
          "4 times",
          "16 times",
          "64 times"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $T^2 \\propto r^3$: if $r$ is $4$, then $T^2 = 4^3 = 64$. Taking the square root, $T = \\sqrt{64} = 8$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'highly eccentric' orbit?",
        "options": [
          "A long, thin, stretched-out ellipse.",
          "An almost perfect circle.",
          "A path that is perfectly straight.",
          "An orbit that is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Eccentricity measures the deviation from a circle. An eccentricity near 0 is circular; an eccentricity near 1 is a very elongated ellipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two planets, A and B, orbit the same star. If $T_A/T_B = 27$, what is the ratio of their semi-major axes $r_A/r_B$?",
        "options": [
          "9",
          "3",
          "81",
          "27"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From $(T_A/T_B)^2 = (r_A/r_B)^3$, we have $27^2 = r_{ratio}^3$. Since $27 = 3^3$, then $(3^3)^2 = r_{ratio}^3 \\rightarrow 3^6 = r_{ratio}^3 \\rightarrow r_{ratio} = 3^2 = 9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the total mechanical energy of a comet as it moves from its furthest point (aphelion) to its closest point (perihelion)?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant.",
          "It increases as it speeds up.",
          "It decreases as it gets deeper into the gravity well.",
          "It fluctuates depending on the solar wind."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While kinetic and potential energy trade off, the total mechanical energy ($E_k + E_g$) of a closed orbit remains constant (neglecting external work)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Kepler's Third Law constant ($T^2/r^3$) depends only on:",
        "options": [
          "The mass of the central body being orbited.",
          "The mass of the orbiting planet.",
          "The eccentricity of the orbit.",
          "The speed of the planet at perihelion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Derived from $GmM/r^2 = m(4\\pi^2r/T^2)$, the constant is $4\\pi^2/GM$. The mass of the satellite ($m$) cancels out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an elliptical orbit, where is the orbital speed at its minimum?",
        "options": [
          "Aphelion",
          "Perihelion",
          "At the two focal points",
          "At the semi-minor axis intersections"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At Aphelion, the planet is at its furthest distance from the Sun; therefore, it moves at its slowest speed to conserve angular momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a small satellite and a massive planet are both orbiting the same star at the same average distance, which one will have the shorter orbital period?",
        "options": [
          "They will have the same orbital period.",
          "The massive planet.",
          "The small satellite.",
          "The one with the higher eccentricity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kepler's Third Law shows that the period depends on the distance from the center and the mass of the *star*, not the mass of the orbiting object."
