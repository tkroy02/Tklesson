    "subject": "Physics",
    "topic": "Gravitation and Satellites",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the universal formula for gravitational potential energy, $E_g = -GMm/r$, why is the value always negative?",
        "options": [
          "Because the zero reference point is defined at an infinite distance away.",
          "Because gravity is a repulsive force at large distances.",
          "Because the mass of the object is lost as it moves away from the planet.",
          "Because the energy is being consumed by the vacuum of space."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We define $E_g$ as zero at infinity. Since gravity is attractive, work must be done to move a mass to infinity; therefore, any point closer than infinity must have a lower (negative) energy state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Binding Energy' of a planet-satellite system?",
        "options": [
          "The minimum energy required to move the satellite to an infinite distance.",
          "The amount of kinetic energy the satellite possesses in orbit.",
          "The energy released when the satellite crashes into the planet.",
          "The gravitational force multiplied by the orbital period."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Binding energy is the absolute value of the total energy ($|E_T|$). It represents the energy 'debt' that must be paid to liberate the satellite from the gravitational pull."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 500 kg satellite is moved from an orbit of radius $R$ to an orbit of radius $2R$. What happens to its gravitational potential energy?",
        "options": [
          "It increases (becomes less negative).",
          "It decreases (becomes more negative).",
          "It doubles in magnitude.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $r$ increases, the fraction $1/r$ decreases. Since the value is negative, a smaller magnitude (like $-5$ vs $-10$) represents an increase in energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the escape velocity from a planet that has the same mass as Earth but four times the radius?",
        "options": [
          "Half of Earth's escape velocity.",
          "One-fourth of Earth's escape velocity.",
          "Double Earth's escape velocity.",
          "The same as Earth's escape velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Escape velocity $v_e = \\sqrt{2GM/r}$. If $r$ becomes $4r$, $v_e$ becomes $\\sqrt{1/4}$ of the original, which is $1/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a satellite in a stable circular orbit, how does the magnitude of its kinetic energy ($E_k$) compare to the magnitude of its potential energy ($E_g$)?",
        "options": [
          "$E_k = 0.5 |E_g|$",
          "$E_k = |E_g|$",
          "$E_k = 2 |E_g|$",
          "$E_k = \\sqrt{|E_g|}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In orbit, $mv^2/r = GMm/r^2 \\rightarrow mv^2 = GMm/r$. Since $E_k = 0.5mv^2$, it follows that $E_k = GMm/2r$, which is half the magnitude of $E_g = -GMm/r$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much work is required to lift a mass $m$ from the surface of a planet (radius $R$, mass $M$) to an altitude equal to the radius ($h=R$)?",
        "options": [
          "GMm / 2R",
          "GMm / R",
          "2GMm / R",
          "GMm / 4R"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work = $\\Delta E_g = E_{gf} - E_{gi} = (-GMm/2R) - (-GMm/R) = GMm/2R$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two planets have the same radius, but Planet X is four times as dense as Planet Y. How does the escape velocity of Planet X compare to Planet Y?",
        "options": [
          "It is 2 times greater.",
          "It is 4 times greater.",
          "It is 16 times greater.",
          "It is the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If density is $4\\times$, then mass $M$ is $4\\times$ (since volume is the same). $v_e \\propto \\sqrt{M}$, so $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ times greater."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the total mechanical energy of a spacecraft as it uses its thrusters to move into a higher circular orbit?",
        "options": [
          "The total energy increases.",
          "The total energy decreases.",
          "The total energy remains constant, but potential energy increases.",
          "The total energy remains constant, but kinetic energy increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moving to a higher orbit requires positive work from the engines, increasing the total mechanical energy ($E_T = -GMm/2r$), making it less negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Schwarzchild radius of a black hole is the distance from the center where the escape velocity equals:",
        "options": [
          "The speed of light ($c$)",
          "The orbital velocity of Earth",
          "Zero",
          "The speed of sound"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A black hole is defined by the region where even light cannot escape, meaning $v_e \\geq c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a rocket is launched with exactly the escape velocity, what will its kinetic energy be when it is 'infinitely' far from the planet?",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Equal to its starting kinetic energy",
          "Half its starting kinetic energy",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Escape velocity is the minimum speed needed to reach infinity with zero velocity left over ($E_{total} = 0$)."
