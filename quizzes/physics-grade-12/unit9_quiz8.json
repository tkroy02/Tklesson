    "subject": "Physics",

    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the classical formula $p = mv$ insufficient at high speeds?",
        "options": [
          "It predicts that momentum becomes zero at $c$.",
          "It allows an object's momentum to grow linearly, failing to account for the 'universal speed limit' $c$.",
          "It only works for objects with no mass.",
          "It doesn't account for friction."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The classical formula has no upper limit—as $v$ increases, $p$ increases linearly. This suggests you could reach and exceed $c$ with enough force. The relativistic formula, $p = \\gamma m v$, corrects this by including the Lorentz factor, which ensures $p$ approaches infinity as $v$ approaches $c$, enforcing the cosmic speed limit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As an object's velocity approaches $c$, its relativistic momentum ($p$):",
        "options": [
          "Levels off at a maximum value.",
          "Approaches infinity.",
          "Decreases toward zero.",
          "Becomes equal to its rest mass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$p = \\gamma m v$. As $v \\to c$, $\\gamma \\to \\infty$, causing the momentum $p$ to also approach infinity. This is why infinite energy would be required to accelerate a massive object to the speed of light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an electron is traveling at $v = 0.9c$, its relativistic momentum is ________ its classical momentum.",
        "options": [
          "Equal to",
          "Less than",
          "Greater than",
          "Exactly double"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-(0.9)^2} \\approx 2.29$, the relativistic momentum is $p_{rel} = 2.29 m v$, while the classical momentum is $p_{class} = m v$. Therefore, $p_{rel}$ is more than double the classical value. For any $v > 0$, $\\gamma > 1$, making relativistic momentum greater."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the momentum of a particle as its speed $v$ goes from $0.1c$ to $0.99c$?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of 9.9.",
          "It increases much more than a factor of 9.9 because of the $\\gamma$ factor.",
          "It stays the same because mass is constant.",
          "It becomes imaginary."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The speed increases by a factor of 9.9, but the momentum increase is far greater due to the skyrocketing Lorentz factor. At $0.1c$, $\\gamma \\approx 1.005$. At $0.99c$, $\\gamma \\approx 7.09$. Therefore, the relativistic momentum increases by a factor of roughly $7.09/1.005 \\times (0.99/0.1) \\approx 70$, much larger than 9.9."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a particle with a rest mass $m$, what is the relativistic momentum when $v = 0$?",
        "options": [
          "$mc$",
          "$1$",
          "$0$",
          "Infinity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The relativistic momentum formula is $p = \\gamma m v$. If $v = 0$, then $p = 0$, regardless of the value of $\\gamma$ (which would be 1). This is consistent with our common-sense, classical understanding: a stationary object has no momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct expression for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$",
          "$1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)$",
          "$1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$",
          "$v/c$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. It is the fundamental scaling factor in special relativity for time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic momentum. It is always greater than or equal to 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In particle accelerators (like the LHC), why must engineers use the relativistic formula for momentum?",
        "options": [
          "Because the particles are moving through a vacuum.",
          "Because the particles are moving at nearly the speed of light.",
          "Because the particles have no charge.",
          "Because the magnets only work on relativistic particles."
        ],
        "explanation": "Particles in the LHC are accelerated to speeds where $\\gamma$ is in the thousands (e.g., 7,000 for protons at top energy). Using the classical formula $p=mv$ would severely underestimate the actual momentum by a factor of $\\gamma$, leading to incorrect calculations for the magnetic fields needed to steer and contain the particle beams.",
        "answer": "B"

        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "Doubles.",
          "More than doubles.",
          "Stays the same.",
          "Triples."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At $v=0.4c$, $\\gamma \\approx 1.09$. At $v=0.8c$, $\\gamma \\approx 1.67$. Momentum is proportional to $\\gamma v$. The ratio of the new to old momentum is $(1.67*0.8) / (1.09*0.4) \\approx 1.336 / 0.436 \\approx 3.06$. The momentum more than doubles; it roughly triples."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can a particle with mass ever reach a momentum such that its velocity is exactly $c$?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, if enough force is applied.",
          "Yes, but only in a vacuum.",
          "No, because it would require infinite energy/momentum.",
          "Only if the particle is a photon."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "As $v$ approaches $c$, $\\gamma$ and thus momentum $p$ approach infinity. To reach $v = c$ would require an infinite amount of energy and impart infinite momentum, which is impossible. Only massless particles (like photons) travel at $c$ and have finite momentum given by $p = E/c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'rest mass' ($m$ or $m_0$) in the relativistic momentum formula?",
        "options": [
          "The mass of the object when it is moving at $c$.",
          "The mass measured by an observer in the object's own frame of reference.",
          "The mass of the object minus its kinetic energy.",
          "A value that changes depending on the observer's speed."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rest mass (often simply $m$) is an invariant property of an object. It is defined as the mass measured in the inertial frame where the object is at rest. It does not change with speed. In the formula $p = \\gamma m v$, $m$ is this constant rest mass."

        "70": "Very good! Strong conceptual understanding of relativistic momentum. Key review areas: 1) Comparing relativistic vs. classical momentum at a given speed, 2) Understanding why momentum approaches infinity as $v \\to c$, 3) The non-linear relationship between velocity and momentum (e.g., doubling $v$ more than doubles $p$), 4) The invariant nature of rest mass.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) Memorizing the formula $p = \\gamma m v$, 2) Understanding that $\\gamma$ is always $\\ge 1$, 3) Recognizing that relativistic momentum is always greater than classical momentum for $v>0$, 4) Knowing that rest mass is constant and measured in the object's rest frame.",
        "0": "Start with the basics: Learn the relativistic momentum formula $p = \\gamma m v$. Understand that $\\gamma$ increases as speed increases. Practice comparing it to the classical formula $p = m v$ for low and high speeds."
