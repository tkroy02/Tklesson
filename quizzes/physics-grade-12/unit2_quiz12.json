    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite is in a stable circular orbit with radius r. If it needs to escape the planet's gravitational pull, by what factor must its current orbital speed (vc) be multiplied?",
        "options": [
          "√2",
          "2",
          "0.5",
          "√3"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Orbital speed is √(GM/r) and escape speed is √(2GM/r). The ratio is √(2GM/r) / √(GM/r) = √2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical planets, each of mass M, are separated by a distance D. What is the gravitational field intensity at the exact midpoint between them?",
        "options": [
          "0 N/kg",
          "8GM/D²",
          "2GM/D²",
          "4GM/D²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the midpoint, the two gravitational field vectors are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a vector sum of zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite orbits a planet in an elliptical path. At which point is the satellite's Total Mechanical Energy (Et) the greatest?",
        "options": [
          "It is the same at all points.",
          "Periapsis",
          "Apoapsis",
          "The focal point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a closed system with only gravity acting, total mechanical energy (Ek + Eg) is conserved and remains constant at every point in the orbit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the density of a planet is tripled but its radius remains the same, how does the escape velocity from its surface change?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of √3.",
          "It increases by a factor of 3.",
          "It increases by a factor of 9.",
          "It remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass is proportional to density when radius is constant. Since ve ∝ √M, tripling the density triples the mass, resulting in a √3 increase in escape velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A planet's moon has an orbital period T and a circular orbital radius r. What expression can be used to calculate the mass of the planet?",
        "options": [
          "4π²r³ / (GT²)",
          "GT² / (4π²r³)",
          "2πr / (GT²)",
          "Gr³ / (4π²T²)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Starting from T² = (4π²/GM)r³, rearranging for M gives M = 4π²r³ / (GT²)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite in a circular orbit of radius R has a kinetic energy K. What is its gravitational potential energy?",
        "options": [
          "-2K",
          "2K",
          "-0.5K",
          "-K"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a circular orbit, Ek = GMm/2R and Eg = -GMm/R. Therefore, Eg = -2(Ek) = -2K."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the angular momentum of a planet in an elliptical orbit as it moves from perihelion to aphelion?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant.",
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It becomes zero at aphelion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity is a central force, meaning it exerts no torque relative to the center of mass. Therefore, angular momentum (L = mvr) is conserved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is at a distance r from the center of a planet. If it is moved to a distance 3r, by what factor does the gravitational field intensity change?",
        "options": [
          "1/9",
          "1/3",
          "3",
          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By the inverse-square law, g ∝ 1/r². If distance is tripled, g becomes 1/3² = 1/9 of its original value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is required for a satellite to be in a geostationary orbit?",
        "options": [
          "The orbit must be circular and located directly above the equator.",
          "The orbit must pass over the North and South poles.",
          "The satellite must move faster than the Earth's rotation.",
          "The mass of the satellite must be equal to the mass of the Earth."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A geostationary orbit requires a 24-hour period, a circular path, and a zero-degree inclination (equatorial) to remain stationary relative to the ground."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a satellite in a circular orbit has its orbital radius increased, what happens to its orbital period?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Kepler's Third Law (T² ∝ r³), as the radius increases, the period required to complete an orbit also increases."
