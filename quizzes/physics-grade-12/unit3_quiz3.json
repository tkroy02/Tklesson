    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental relationship between the period ($T$) and the frequency ($f$) of an oscillator?",
        "options": [
          "$T = f$",
          "$T = 1/f$",
          "$T = 2\\pi f$",
          "$T = f^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Period is the time for one complete cycle, and frequency is the number of cycles per second. They are reciprocals: $T = 1/f$ and $f = 1/T$."

          "The material of the string."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For small angles, the period of a simple pendulum is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$, depending only on length $L$ and gravitational acceleration $g$, not on mass or amplitude."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a mass-spring system is taken to a planet where the gravity is four times stronger, how does the period of oscillation change?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The period of a horizontal mass-spring system is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k}$, which depends only on mass $m$ and spring constant $k$, not on gravity."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An oscillator completes 20 full cycles in 5 seconds. What is its frequency?",

          "$20\\text{ Hz}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Frequency is cycles per second: $f = \\text{Number of cycles} / \\text{Time} = 20 / 5 = 4.0\\text{ Hz}$."

          "Radians per second (rad/s)",
          "Meters per second (m/s)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Angular frequency measures the angular displacement per unit time, with units of radians per second (rad/s)."

          "$\\sqrt{2}L$",
          "$4L$",
          "$L/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a simple pendulum, $T \\propto \\sqrt{L}$. To double $T$, $\\sqrt{L}$ must double, so $L$ must increase by a factor of $2^2 = 4$."
      },

          "It stays the same.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It increases by $2\\pi$."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Angular frequency is related to frequency by $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. If $f$ doubles, $\\omega$ also doubles."
      },

          "The frequency of an object moving in a circle."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Natural frequency is the inherent oscillation frequency of a system when displaced from equilibrium and allowed to oscillate freely without external driving forces."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A vertical spring-mass system oscillates with frequency $f$. If a second identical spring is added in parallel, the new frequency will:",

          "Increase.",
          "Decrease.",
          "Stay the same.",
          "Drop to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding a spring in parallel increases the effective spring constant $k_{eff}$. Since $f \\propto \\sqrt{k}$, the frequency increases."

          "$100\\text{ Hz}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Moving from highest to lowest point is half a complete cycle. Therefore, the full period $T = 2 \\times 0.01\\text{ s} = 0.02\\text{ s}$."
