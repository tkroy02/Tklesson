    "subject": "Physics",
    "topic": "Electrostatics",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy stored in a capacitor is equal to the work done to charge it. Why is the formula $U = \\frac{1}{2}QV$ rather than simply $QV$?",
        "options": [
          "The potential difference increases linearly from $0$ to $V$ during charging.",
          "Half of the energy is always lost to heat in the wires.",
          "The $1/2$ accounts for the two separate plates.",
          "It accounts for the vector nature of the electric field."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As charge builds up, the potential $V$ increases. The total work is the integral $\\int V dq$, which results in the average potential $V/2$ being used."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the charge on a capacitor is doubled, by what factor does the stored energy increase?",
        "options": [
          "4",
          "2",
          "\\sqrt{2}",
          "8"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $U = Q^2 / 2C$, energy is proportional to the square of the charge. Doubling $Q$ results in $2^2 = 4$ times the energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following expressions represents the energy density ($u_E$) within the uniform electric field of a capacitor?",
        "options": [
          "\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2",
          "\\frac{1}{2}CV^2",
          "\\epsilon_0 E / d",
          "QE / A"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy density is energy per unit volume ($U/Ad$). Substituting capacitor formulas yields $u_E = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $100\\, \\mu F$ capacitor stores $2.0\\, J$ of energy. What is the potential difference across its plates?",
        "options": [
          "200 V",
          "20 V",
          "400 V",
          "141 V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$V = \\sqrt{2U/C} = \\sqrt{(2 \\times 2.0) / (100 \\times 10^{-6})} = \\sqrt{40000} = 200\\, V$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An isolated charged capacitor has energy $U_0$. If a dielectric with constant $\\kappa = 3$ is inserted, what is the new energy?",
        "options": [
          "U_0 / 3",
          "3U_0",
          "9U_0",
          "U_0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an isolated capacitor, $Q$ is constant. Since $C$ increases by $\\kappa$, $U = Q^2 / 2C$ decreases by a factor of $\\kappa$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A capacitor is connected to a $12\\, V$ battery. If a dielectric is inserted while it is still connected, what happens to the stored energy?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With $V$ constant, $U = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$. Since the dielectric increases $C$, the stored energy must also increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a capacitor discharges through a resistor, what happens to the stored energy?",
        "options": [
          "It is dissipated as thermal energy in the resistor.",
          "It is converted back into chemical energy in the battery.",
          "It remains in the electric field indefinitely.",
          "It is converted into gravitational potential energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the electric field collapses, the moving charges (current) do work on the resistor's atoms, producing heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which variable, when graphed against Energy ($U$) on the y-axis, would produce a linear slope of $\\frac{1}{2}C$?",
        "options": [
          "V²",
          "V",
          "Q",
          "1/V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From $U = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$, $U$ is linear with respect to $V^2$."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$U = 0.5 \\times 1 \\times 10^2 = 50\\, J$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical capacitors are charged to the same voltage. One is filled with a dielectric ($\\kappa=2$) and the other is vacuum. What is the ratio of energy $U_{dielectric} / U_{vacuum}$ if they remain connected to the battery?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1/2",
          "4",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At constant $V$, $U \\propto C$. Since $C_{dielectric} = 2C_{vacuum}$, the energy ratio is 2."
