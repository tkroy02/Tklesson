    "subject": "Physics",
    "topic": "Gravitation and Satellites",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an elliptical orbit, where is the orbiting body's kinetic energy at its absolute minimum?",
        "options": [
          "Apoapsis (furthest point)",
          "Periapsis (closest point)",
          "At the empty focus of the ellipse",
          "Along the semi-minor axis"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At apoapsis, the distance $r$ is at its maximum. To conserve angular momentum ($mvr$), the velocity $v$ must be at its minimum, resulting in the lowest kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following values for eccentricity ($e$) would describe an orbit that is nearly a perfect circle?",
        "options": [
          "0.01",
          "0.50",
          "0.95",
          "1.00"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Eccentricity ranges from 0 to 1 for bound orbits. $e=0$ is a perfect circle, so $0.01$ is very close to circular."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the conservation of angular momentum, if a planet's distance from the sun doubles as it moves along its ellipse, what happens to its orbital speed?",
        "options": [
          "It is reduced by half.",
          "It is reduced by one-fourth.",
          "It increases by √2.",
          "It remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $L = mvr$ is constant, $v$ is inversely proportional to $r$. If $r$ doubles, $v$ must be halved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'Semi-Major Axis' ($a$) of an elliptical orbit?",
        "options": [
          "Half of the longest diameter of the ellipse.",
          "The distance from the center to a focus.",
          "The distance of closest approach.",
          "The average of the periapsis and apoapsis velocities."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The semi-major axis is half the 'major axis' (the longest line passing through both foci). It is also equal to the average of the periapsis and apoapsis distances: $a = (r_{min} + r_{max}) / 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the Vis-Viva equation, what is the total mechanical energy of an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $a$?",
        "options": [
          "-GMm / 2a",
          "-GMm / a",
          "-GMm / r",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just as in circular orbits ($r=a$), the total energy of an elliptical orbit depends only on the semi-major axis: $E_T = -GMm / 2a$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A comet has a very high eccentricity ($e = 0.99$). How does its speed at perihelion compare to its speed at aphelion?",
        "options": [
          "It is significantly faster at perihelion.",
          "It is significantly faster at aphelion.",
          "The speeds are almost identical.",
          "The speed is zero at aphelion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High eccentricity means a huge difference between $r_{min}$ and $r_{max}$. To conserve angular momentum, the speed at the very close perihelion must be much higher than at the distant aphelion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the central mass (like the Sun) located in an elliptical orbital system?",
        "options": [
          "At one of the two foci.",
          "At the geometric center of the ellipse.",
          "At both foci simultaneously.",
          "It moves along the semi-minor axis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kepler's First Law specifies that the central body occupies one focus ($F_1$), while the other focus ($F_2$) remains empty."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a satellite in a circular orbit fires its engines forward (increasing velocity), what happens to the point where the engine was fired?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes the periapsis of a new elliptical orbit.",
          "It becomes the apoapsis of a new elliptical orbit.",
          "The satellite immediately moves to a larger circular orbit.",
          "The satellite falls toward the planet."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By increasing speed at one point, you increase the 'height' of the opposite side of the orbit. The burnout point becomes the lowest point (periapsis) of the new ellipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the Gravitational Potential Energy ($E_g$) as a planet moves from Periapsis to Apoapsis?",
        "options": [
          "It increases (becomes less negative).",
          "It decreases (becomes more negative).",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As distance $r$ increases, the planet moves 'uphill' against gravity, increasing its potential energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an object in an elliptical orbit, the sum of the distances from the object to each of the two foci ($r_1 + r_2$) is always:",
        "options": [
          "Constant and equal to 2a.",
          "Equal to the eccentricity.",
          "Increasing as it moves toward apoapsis.",
          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the geometric definition of an ellipse: the set of all points where the sum of distances to two fixed points (foci) is constant."
