      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves in a circle at a constant speed. If the radius is doubled while the speed stays the same, the centripetal acceleration ($a_c$):",
        "options": [
          "Doubles",
          "Is halved",
          "Quadruples",
          "Stays the same"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$a_c = v^2/r$. Doubling $r$ with constant $v$ halves the acceleration: $a_c' = v^2/(2r) = (1/2)(v^2/r)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An elevator accelerates upward. A passenger's apparent weight (normal force) will be:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to their true weight",
          "Greater than their true weight",
          "Less than their true weight",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Upward acceleration requires a net upward force: $F_N - mg = ma$. Therefore, $F_N = mg + ma > mg$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system absorbs $100\\text{ J}$ of heat and does $40\\text{ J}$ of work. The change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) is:",
        "options": [
          "$140\\text{ J}$",
          "$60\\text{ J}$",
          "$-60\\text{ J}$",
          "$40\\text{ J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First Law: $\\Delta U = Q - W$. $\\Delta U = 100\\text{ J} - 40\\text{ J} = 60\\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a perfectly elastic collision, which of the following is conserved?",
        "options": [
          "Only Momentum",
          "Only Kinetic Energy",
          "Both Momentum and Kinetic Energy",
          "Neither Momentum nor Kinetic Energy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A perfectly elastic collision is defined by conservation of both total kinetic energy and total linear momentum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The fundamental frequency (first harmonic) of a string fixed at both ends has a wavelength ($\\lambda$) equal to:",
        "options": [
          "$L$",
          "$L/2$",
          "$2L$",
          "$4L$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The fundamental standing wave has one antinode in the middle and nodes at the ends. The string length is half a wavelength: $L = \\lambda/2$, so $\\lambda = 2L$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the distance between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor is doubled, the capacitance:",
        "options": [
          "Doubles",
          "Is halved",
          "Quadruples",
          "Stays the same"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Capacitance $C = \\epsilon_0 A/d$. Doubling $d$ halves $C$: $C' = \\epsilon_0 A/(2d) = C/2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Three identical $15\\text{ \\Omega}$ resistors are connected in parallel. The total resistance is:",
        "options": [
          "$5\\text{ \\Omega}$",
          "$15\\text{ \\Omega}$",
          "$45\\text{ \\Omega}$",
          "$1.5\\text{ \\Omega}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For $n$ identical resistors in parallel: $R_p = R/n$. $R_p = 15\\text{ \\Omega} / 3 = 5\\text{ \\Omega}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A loop of wire sits in a magnetic field directed into the page. If the field strength decreases, the induced current flows:",
        "options": [
          "Clockwise",
          "Counter-clockwise",
          "No current is induced",
          "Toward the center"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decreasing into-the-page flux induces a current that creates its own magnetic field into the page to oppose the decrease (Lenz's Law). Using the right-hand rule for the induced field, a clockwise current produces a field into the page."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Special Relativity, the speed of light ($c$) is constant for:",
        "options": [
          "Only stationary observers",
          "Only observers moving at $v < c$",
          "All inertial observers",
          "No one; it is relative"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The second postulate of Special Relativity states: The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the source or observer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle links which two variables?",
        "options": [
          "Mass and Energy",
          "Time and Velocity",
          "Position and Momentum",
          "Charge and Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\hbar/2$. It states a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) can be known simultaneously."
