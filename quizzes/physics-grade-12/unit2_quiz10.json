    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following expressions correctly represents the total mechanical energy of a satellite of mass $m$ in a circular orbit of radius $r$ around a planet of mass $M$?",
        "options": [
          "-GMm / 2r",
          "-GMm / r",
          "GMm / 2r",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total energy is the sum of $E_k$ ($GMm/2r$) and $E_g$ ($-GMm/r$). This simplifies to $-GMm/2r$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a satellite in circular orbit fires its thrusters to increase its speed, what is the immediate effect on its orbital energy and path?",
        "options": [
          "Total energy increases and the orbit becomes elliptical.",
          "Total energy decreases and the orbit becomes smaller.",
          "Total energy remains constant but potential energy increases.",
          "The satellite immediately enters a higher circular orbit."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing speed adds kinetic energy, raising the total energy. This breaks the circular balance, pushing the satellite into an elliptical path with a higher average radius."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the kinetic energy ($E_k$) of a satellite change if its orbital radius is doubled while maintaining a circular orbit?",
        "options": [
          "It is reduced by half.",
          "It is reduced by one-fourth.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $E_k = GMm/2r$, doubling $r$ puts a factor of 2 in the denominator, halving the kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a satellite to escape Earth's gravity from a circular orbit, how much additional energy must be added?",
        "options": [
          "An amount equal to its kinetic energy ($E_k$).",
          "An amount equal to its potential energy ($E_g$).",
          "An amount equal to half its kinetic energy.",
          "Energy cannot be added once in orbit."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To escape, $E_T$ must reach 0. Since $E_T = -E_k$ in a circular orbit, adding $E_k$ brings the total energy to exactly zero, allowing escape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding a satellite's potential energy ($E_g$) as it moves from a low Earth orbit (LEO) to a higher geostationary orbit (GEO)?",
        "options": [
          "Its $E_g$ increases (becomes less negative).",
          "Its $E_g$ decreases (becomes more negative).",
          "Its $E_g$ remains constant.",
          "Its $E_g$ becomes positive."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moving further from the Earth increases potential energy. In the negative scale, moving from $-10$ to $-5$ is an increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the work required to move a 1000 kg satellite from an orbit of $2R_E$ to $3R_E$ (where $R_E$ is Earth's radius).",
        "options": [
          "GMm / 12R_E",
          "GMm / 6R_E",
          "GMm / R_E",
          "5GMm / 6R_E"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work = $E_{T,f} - E_{T,i} = (-GMm/6R_E) - (-GMm/4R_E) = (-2+3)GMm/12R_E = GMm/12R_E$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an elliptical orbit, what remains constant throughout the entire motion?",
        "options": [
          "Total Mechanical Energy",
          "Orbital Velocity",
          "Gravitational Potential Energy",
          "Distance from the planet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an isolated two-body system, total energy ($E_k + E_g$) is conserved, even as $E_k$ and $E_g$ fluctuate during the orbit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Paradox of the Satellite' states that a satellite experiencing atmospheric drag eventually moves faster. Why?",
        "options": [
          "Loss of $E_T$ causes it to drop to a lower orbit where $E_k$ must be higher.",
          "Drag pushes the satellite forward.",
          "The satellite's mass decreases due to friction.",
          "The planet's rotation pulls the satellite along."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Drag reduces $E_T$, which forces a smaller $r$. Because $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$, the smaller $r$ requires a higher velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the binding energy of a satellite?",
        "options": [
          "The absolute value of its total mechanical energy.",
          "The sum of its kinetic and potential energy.",
          "The energy released when it was launched.",
          "The work done by gravity during one orbit."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Binding energy is $|E_T|$. It is the energy required to bring the satellite's total energy to zero (escape)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a satellite's total energy is positive ($E_T > 0$), what is the shape of its trajectory?",
        "options": [
          "Hyperbolic",
          "Circular",
          "Elliptical",
          "Parabolic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Negative energy is a bound orbit (circle/ellipse). Zero energy is a parabolic escape. Positive energy is a hyperbolic flyby."
