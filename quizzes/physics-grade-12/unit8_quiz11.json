      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of a 'Moderator' (such as heavy water or graphite) in a nuclear fission reactor?",
        "options": [
          "To cool down the reactor core to prevent melting.",
          "To slow down fast-moving neutrons so they are more likely to be captured by fuel nuclei.",
          "To absorb all neutrons and stop the reaction.",
          "To increase the speed of the alpha particles."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Moderators: H₂O, D₂O, graphite, beryllium. Slow neutrons from ~2 MeV (fission) to ~0.025 eV (thermal). U-235 fission cross-section for thermal neutrons ~585 barns vs. ~1 barn for fast neutrons. Slowing increases probability of fission vs. capture."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following equations represents a typical nuclear fusion reaction occurring in a star?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "D-T fusion: Deuterium ($^2$H) + Tritium ($^3$H) → Helium-4 + neutron + 17.6 MeV. Main candidate for terrestrial fusion. In stars: proton-proton chain ($4^1\\text{H} → ^4\\text{He} + 2e^+ + 2\\nu_e + 26.7\\text{MeV}$) dominates in Sun-like stars."

        "question": "In a fission chain reaction, if the 'Multiplication Factor' ($k$) is exactly 1.0, the reactor is said to be:",
        "options": [
          "Subcritical (the reaction will die out).",
          "Supercritical (the reaction will grow exponentially).",
          "Critical (the reaction is stable and self-sustaining).",
          "Melted down."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$k = \\text{(neutrons in generation n+1)} / \\text{(neutrons in generation n)}$. $k<1$: subcritical (decays), $k=1$: critical (steady power), $k>1$: supercritical (increasing power). Reactors operate at $k=1$, controlled by control rods adjusting neutron absorption."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason why nuclear fusion is not yet a viable source for commercial power plants?",
        "options": [
          "There is not enough hydrogen on Earth to fuel it.",
          "It produces more dangerous waste than fission.",
          "It requires more energy to contain the plasma than the reaction currently produces (the 'break-even' problem).",
          "It is impossible to stop once it starts."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Lawson criterion: $nT\\tau > 3\\times10^{21}\\ \\text{keV·s·m}^{-3}$ for D-T. Q = fusion power/input power. Currently: Q~0.67 (JET, 1997). ITER goal: Q≥10. Challenges: plasma instability, heat management, neutron damage to materials."

          "Protons",
          "Positrons",
          "Neutrons",
          "Neutrinos"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fission neutrons: prompt (released immediately) and delayed (from fission fragments). Average ~2.5 neutrons per U-235 fission. Neutrons sustain chain by inducing more fissions. Neutrinos weakly interacting, not useful for chain reaction."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Binding Energy curve, why does fusion stop being exothermic (releasing energy) once it reaches Iron-56?",
        "options": [
          "Iron is too soft to fuse.",
          "Nuclei heavier than Iron have a lower binding energy per nucleon, so fusing them would require an input of energy.",
          "Iron has no neutrons.",
          "Iron is a liquid in the center of stars."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fe-56 peak: ~8.8 MeV/nucleon. Fusion beyond iron (e.g., Fe + He → Ni) requires energy input → endothermic. Only occurs in extreme environments (supernova shockwaves, neutron star mergers). This creates elements heavier than iron."

          "Particle acceleration."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Magnetic: tokamaks (ITER), stellarators use magnetic fields to contain plasma (10⁸ K). Inertial: lasers (NIF) or particle beams compress fuel pellet rapidly. Both aim to achieve conditions for net energy gain (Q>1)."

          "It increases.",
          "A small amount of mass is converted into a large amount of energy.",
          "The mass doubles because two nuclei are joining."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "D + T → $^4$He (3.5 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV). Neutron carries 80% of energy. In reactor: neutron captured in lithium blanket to breed tritium ($n + ^6\\text{Li} → ^4\\text{He} + ^3\\text{H}$) and produce heat for electricity."
