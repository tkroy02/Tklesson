    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the unit of measurement for capacitive reactance?",
        "options": [
          "Farad (F)",
          "Henry (H)",
          "Ohm ($\\Omega$)",
          "Tesla (T)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Capacitive reactance $X_C$, like inductive reactance $X_L$ and resistance $R$, is measured in ohms ($\\Omega$). It represents opposition to AC current flow through a capacitor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula correctly represents capacitive reactance?",
        "options": [
          "$X_C = 2\\pi fC$",
          "$X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi fC}$",
          "$X_C = \\frac{2\\pi f}{C}$",
          "$X_C = \\frac{C}{2\\pi f}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Correct formula: $X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi fC}$, where $f$ is frequency (Hz), $C$ is capacitance (F). Derived from capacitor impedance: $Z_C = -j/(\\omega C)$ where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency ($f$) of the AC source increases, what happens to the capacitive reactance ($X_C$)?",
        "options": [
          "It increases linearly.",
          "It remains unchanged.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It doubles automatically."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From $X_C = 1/(2\\pi fC)$, reactance is inversely proportional to frequency. Doubling frequency halves $X_C$. High frequencies encounter less opposition through capacitors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a capacitor behave in a DC circuit (where $f = 0$)?",
        "options": [
          "As a short circuit with zero resistance.",
          "As an open circuit with infinite resistance.",
          "As a resistor with $100\\ \\Omega$ resistance.",
          "As a constant voltage source."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "DC = zero frequency → $X_C = 1/(2\\pi × 0 × C) = \\infty$ (infinite reactance). Capacitor blocks DC current once charged; acts as open circuit in steady state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the capacitance of a capacitor is doubled while keeping frequency constant, the reactance will:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Quadruple.",
          "Be cut in half.",
          "Stay the same."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_C \\propto 1/C$ (inverse relationship). Doubling $C$ halves $X_C$: $X_C' = 1/(2\\pi f × 2C) = \\frac{1}{2}X_C$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a purely capacitive AC circuit, the average power dissipated is:",
        "options": [
          "$V_{rms} \\times I_{rms}$",
          "$I^2 R$",
          "Zero",
          "$1/2 CV^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average power (real power) $P_{avg} = V_{rms}I_{rms}\\cos\\phi$, where $\\phi = 90^\\circ$ for pure capacitor ($\\cos 90^\\circ = 0$). Energy is stored/returned each cycle (reactive power), not dissipated as heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does current \"lead\" voltage in a capacitor?",
        "options": [
          "Because the voltage must build up across the plates before the current can flow.",
          "Because charge must flow onto the plates (current) before a potential difference (voltage) can be established.",
          "Because the capacitor acts as a battery.",
          "Because the magnetic field pushes the electrons faster."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Current (charge flow) creates voltage (charge separation). Mathematically: $I = C(dV/dt)$. Maximum current occurs when voltage is changing fastest (crossing zero), leading to 90° phase lead."

        "question": "A $2\\ \\mu\\text{F}$ capacitor is connected to a $1000\\ \\text{Hz}$ source. What is the approximate $X_C$? (Use $\\pi \\approx 3.14$)",
        "options": [
          "$0.8\\ \\Omega$",
          "$80\\ \\Omega$",
          "$159\\ \\Omega$",
          "$318\\ \\Omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi fC} = \\frac{1}{2 × 3.14 × 1000 × 2 × 10^{-6}} = \\frac{1}{0.01256} \\approx 79.6\\ \\Omega ≈ 80\\ \\Omega$.\nExact: $X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi × 1000 × 2 × 10^{-6}} = \\frac{10^6}{4\\pi × 1000} = \\frac{250}{\\pi} \\approx 79.6\\ \\Omega$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a phasor diagram for a purely capacitive circuit, if the voltage phasor is at $0^\\circ$, where is the current phasor?",
        "options": [
          "at $0^\\circ$",
          "at $90^\\circ$",
          "at $-90^\\circ$",
          "at $180^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Current leads voltage by $90^\\circ$ in capacitors. If voltage phasor at $0^\\circ$ (reference), current phasor at $+90^\\circ$. Mnemonic: ICE (I leads E)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the relationship between current ($I$) and frequency ($f$) in a capacitive circuit with constant voltage?",
        "options": [
          "Current is inversely proportional to frequency.",
          "Current is directly proportional to frequency.",
          "Current is independent of frequency.",
          "Current decreases as frequency increases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For constant voltage $V$: $I = V/X_C = V × (2\\pi fC)$. Thus $I \\propto f$. Higher frequency → lower $X_C$ → higher current. This is opposite to inductive circuits."
