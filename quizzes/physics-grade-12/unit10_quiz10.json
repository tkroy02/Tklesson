      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform 10 m plank weighs 200 N and rests on two supports at its ends. If a 600 N person stands 2.5 m from the left end, the upward force exerted by the right support is:",
        "options": [
          "150 N",
          "250 N",
          "300 N",
          "400 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Choose left support as pivot. Counterclockwise torques: Person: $600 \\times 2.5 = 1500\\ \\text{N·m}$. Plank weight (at center): $200 \\times 5 = 1000\\ \\text{N·m}$. Clockwise torque from right support: $F_R \\times 10$. Equilibrium: $F_R \\times 10 = 1500 + 1000 = 2500$, so $F_R = 250\\ \\text{N}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object of mass $m$ is accelerated from rest by a constant force $F$. The power $P$ delivered to the object is proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "$t$",
          "$t^2$",
          "$1/t$",
          "$\\sqrt{t}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a = F/m$, $v = at = (F/m)t$. Power $P = Fv = F \\cdot (F/m)t = (F^2/m)t$. Thus, $P \\propto t$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels around a banked curve with a specific radius. If the road is icy (frictionless), the only way to stay on the road is to drive at the 'design speed.' This speed is independent of:",
        "options": [
          "The radius of the curve",
          "The angle of the bank",
          "The mass of the car",
          "Acceleration due to gravity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a frictionless banked curve, $v = \\sqrt{rg\\tan\\theta}$. The design speed depends on $r$, $g$, and $\\theta$, but not on the mass of the vehicle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical positive charges are moved closer together. The work done by the external agent and the change in electric potential energy are, respectively:",
        "options": [
          "Positive, Positive",
          "Positive, Negative",
          "Negative, Positive",
          "Negative, Negative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To bring like charges closer, the external agent must do positive work against the repulsive electric force. This work increases the system's electric potential energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A loop of wire is falling vertically through a horizontal magnetic field that is uniform in a specific region. As the loop exits the field, the magnetic force on the loop is:",
        "options": [
          "Downward",
          "Upward",
          "Zero",
          "To the left"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Exiting the field, the downward magnetic flux through the loop decreases. Lenz's Law induces a current to oppose this decrease, creating an upward magnetic force that opposes the loop's downward motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a photoelectric experiment, if the intensity of the light is doubled while keeping the frequency constant, the stopping potential ($V_s$):",
        "options": [
          "Doubles",
          "Quadruples",
          "Is halved",
          "Remains the same"
        ],
        "explanation": "Stopping potential $V_s$ measures the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons: $eV_s = hf - \\phi$. Since $f$ is unchanged, $V_s$ is unchanged. Intensity affects the current (number of electrons), not their individual maximum energy.",
        "answer": "D"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Light reflects off a thin film of oil ($n=1.45$) floating on water ($n=1.33$). Phase shifts occur at:",
        "options": [
          "Both the air-oil and oil-water interfaces",
          "Only the air-oil interface",
          "Only the oil-water interface",
          "Neither interface"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A $180^\\circ$ phase shift occurs when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index. At air ($n\\approx1$)-oil ($n=1.45$): shift occurs. At oil ($n=1.45$)-water ($n=1.33$): no shift (reflecting off a lower index medium)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A flash of light is emitted from the center of a ship moving at $0.8c$. To an observer inside the ship, the light reaches the front and back walls:",
        "options": [
          "Simultaneously",
          "Front wall first",
          "Back wall first",
          "Not at all"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the ship's inertial frame, the ship is at rest. Light travels at $c$ in all directions, and the walls are equidistant from the source, so the light reaches both walls simultaneously."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ice skater spinning with their arms out pulls them in. Their angular momentum ($L$) and kinetic energy ($K$):",
        "options": [
          "Both increase",
          "$L$ stays constant, $K$ increases",
          "$L$ increases, $K$ stays constant",
          "Both stay constant"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With no external torque, angular momentum is conserved ($L = I\\omega$ constant). As moment of inertia $I$ decreases, $\\omega$ increases. Rotational kinetic energy $K = L^2/(2I)$ increases because $L$ is constant and $I$ decreases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Compton Effect' provided evidence for the:",
        "options": [
          "Wave nature of light",
          "Particle nature of light (photons have momentum)",
          "Quantization of the atom",
          "Uncertainty principle"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Compton Effect (1923) showed that X-rays scattered off electrons lose energy and increase in wavelength, explained perfectly by treating photons as particles with momentum $p = h/\\lambda$, colliding elastically with electrons."
