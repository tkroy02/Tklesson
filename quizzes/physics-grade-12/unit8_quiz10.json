    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes nuclear fission?",
        "options": [
          "The combining of two light nuclei to form a heavier one.",
          "The splitting of a heavy, unstable nucleus into two smaller, more stable nuclei.",
          "The emission of an alpha particle from a nucleus.",
          "The conversion of a proton into a neutron."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Fission: heavy nucleus (e.g., U-235, Pu-239) splits into medium-mass fragments + neutrons + energy. Example: $^{235}\\text{U} + n \\rightarrow ^{141}\\text{Ba} + ^{92}\\text{Kr} + 3n + \\text{energy}$. Typically triggered by neutron absorption."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a nuclear reactor, 'Chain Reactions' are sustained by the continuous release and absorption of:",
        "options": [
          "Electrons",
          "Protons",
          "Neutrons",
          "Gamma rays"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Fission releases 2-3 neutrons per event. For sustained chain reaction: exactly 1 neutron from each fission causes another fission. Controlled in reactors; uncontrolled in bombs. Moderators slow neutrons, control rods absorb excess."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Nuclear Fusion is the process that powers:",
        "options": [
          "Commercial nuclear power plants on Earth.",
          "Geothermal energy in the Earth's core.",
          "The Sun and other stars.",
          "X-ray machines."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Sun's core: ~15 million K, proton-proton chain: $4^1\\text{H} \\rightarrow ^4\\text{He} + 2e^+ + 2\\nu_e + \\gamma$ + 26.7 MeV. Also CNO cycle in heavier stars. Terrestrial fusion not yet commercially viable (research: ITER, JET)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does nuclear fusion require extremely high temperatures (millions of degrees)?",
        "options": [
          "To melt the nuclei into a liquid.",
          "To give the nuclei enough kinetic energy to overcome the strong electrostatic repulsion between positive protons.",
          "To create enough gravity to pull the atoms together.",
          "To prevent the electrons from interfering with the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Coulomb barrier: proton repulsion at ~$10^{-14}$ m requires ~0.1 MeV kinetic energy → temperature ~$10^9$ K. Quantum tunneling reduces required temp to ~$10^7$ K. Tokamaks use magnetic confinement, inertial confinement uses lasers."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Energy per kg: Fusion (~$3.4\\times 10^{14}$ J/kg, D-T), Fission (~$8.2\\times 10^{13}$ J/kg, U-235), Chemical (~$5\\times 10^7$ J/kg, gasoline). Fusion ~4× fission, ~10⁷× chemical. Sun: 600 million tons H → 596 million tons He/sec."

          "Act as the primary fuel source."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Control rods: Boron, Cadmium, Hafnium (strong neutron absorbers). Insert/withdraw to maintain criticality ($k=1$). Safety: scram = rapid insertion to stop reaction. Moderator (water, graphite) slows neutrons to thermal energies."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Critical mass depends on: enrichment, density, geometry, neutron reflectors. U-235: ~52 kg (sphere, no reflector), ~15 kg (with reflector). Plutonium-239: ~10 kg. Subcritical: $k<1$, critical: $k=1$, supercritical: $k>1$ (explosive)."
