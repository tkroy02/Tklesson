    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental definition of electric current ($I$)?",
        "options": [
          "The total energy stored in a battery.",
          "The rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor.",
          "The amount of resistance a wire provides.",
          "The potential difference between two points."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Electric current is defined as the rate of charge flow: $I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}$, measured in amperes ($\\text{A}$), where $1\\text{ A} = 1\\text{ C/s}$. It's analogous to water flow rate in a pipe."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Ohm's Law, if the resistance in a circuit is doubled while the voltage remains constant, what happens to the current?",
        "options": [
          "The current doubles.",
          "The current remains the same.",
          "The current is reduced to half.",
          "The current quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From Ohm's Law: $V = IR \\Rightarrow I = \\frac{V}{R}$. With constant $V$, $I \\propto 1/R$. Doubling resistance halves the current: $I' = \\frac{V}{2R} = \\frac{1}{2}I$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a series circuit containing three resistors ($R_1, R_2, R_3$), the total equivalent resistance ($R_{eq}$) is:",
        "options": [
          "The sum of the individual resistances.",
          "The reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals.",
          "Equal to the smallest resistance.",
          "Always lower than any individual resistor."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Series resistors: $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$. Current must pass through each resistor sequentially, so resistances add. This increases total resistance compared to any single resistor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement is true regarding a parallel circuit?",
        "options": [
          "The current is the same through all branches.",
          "The total resistance is greater than the largest individual resistance.",
          "The voltage across each branch is the same as the source voltage.",
          "If one branch is disconnected, all branches stop working."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In parallel circuits: (1) Voltage across each branch equals source voltage, (2) Current divides among branches, (3) Total resistance is less than smallest branch resistance, (4) Branches operate independently."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Kirchhoff's Current Law (The Junction Rule) is a statement of which conservation law?",
        "options": [
          "Conservation of Energy",
          "Conservation of Momentum",
          "Conservation of Charge",
          "Conservation of Mass"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Kirchhoff's Current Law: $\\sum I_{in} = \\sum I_{out}$ at any junction. This follows from charge conservation—charge cannot accumulate at a point in a circuit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (The Loop Rule) states that the sum of the potential differences around any closed loop is:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to the total resistance.",
          "Zero.",
          "Equal to the current times the number of components.",
          "Always positive."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Kirchhoff's Voltage Law: $\\sum V = 0$ around any closed loop. This is energy conservation—gains (batteries) equal losses (resistors, capacitors)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for electric power ($P$) dissipated by a resistor?",
        "options": [
          "$P = V/I$",
          "$P = I^2R$",
          "$P = VR$",
          "$P = Q/t$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Resistor power dissipation: $P = VI = I^2R = V^2/R$. $P = I^2R$ is particularly useful when current is known. Power measured in watts ($\\text{W}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a battery is described as having \"Internal Resistance\" ($r$), the terminal voltage ($V$) of the battery is:",
        "options": [
          "Exactly equal to the electromotive force ($\\text{emf}$).",
          "Slightly higher than the $\\text{emf}$.",
          "Lower than the $\\text{emf}$ when current is flowing.",
          "Always zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Terminal voltage: $V = \\mathcal{E} - Ir$, where $\\mathcal{E}$ is emf, $I$ is current, $r$ is internal resistance. Voltage drop across internal resistance reduces terminal voltage when current flows."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a DC circuit, how does a capacitor behave after it has been connected to the battery for a long period of time?",
        "options": [
          "It acts like a short circuit (zero resistance).",
          "It acts like an open circuit (infinite resistance).",
          "It allows a constant steady current to flow.",
          "It oscillates the current back and forth."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When fully charged, capacitor voltage equals battery voltage, no potential difference exists to drive current. It blocks DC current—acts as open circuit in steady state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $12\\text{ V}$ battery is connected to a $4\\text{ }\\Omega$ and an $8\\text{ }\\Omega$ resistor in series. What is the current flowing through the $4\\text{ }\\Omega$ resistor?",
        "options": [
          "$3\\text{ A}$",
          "$1.5\\text{ A}$",
          "$1\\text{ A}$",
          "$12\\text{ A}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Series equivalent: $R_{eq} = 4 + 8 = 12\\text{ }\\Omega$.\nCurrent: $I = V/R_{eq} = 12/12 = 1\\text{ A}$.\nSeries current is same everywhere, so $I_{4\\Omega} = 1\\text{ A}$."
