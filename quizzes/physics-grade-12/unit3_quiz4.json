    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an ideal mass-spring system, what happens to the total mechanical energy as the object moves from the equilibrium position to the maximum amplitude?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It becomes zero at the amplitude."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In an undamped system, total mechanical energy is conserved. It simply transforms between kinetic and potential energy as the object oscillates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what displacement $x$ is the energy of an oscillator exactly half kinetic and half potential?",
        "options": [
          "$x = A/2$",
          "$x = A/\\sqrt{2}$",
          "$x = A/4$",
          "$x = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When $K = U$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Using energy conservation $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, we get $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = kx^2$, so $x^2 = A^2/2$ or $x = A/\\sqrt{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the amplitude of an oscillating mass is tripled, by what factor does the total energy of the system increase?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "$\\sqrt{3}$",
          "6",
          "9"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Total energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, which is proportional to $A^2$. Tripling the amplitude ($A \\to 3A$) gives $E' = \\frac{1}{2}k(3A)^2 = 9 \\times \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = 9E$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the equilibrium position ($x=0$), which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "$U$ is maximum; $K$ is zero.",
          "$U$ is zero; $K$ is maximum.",
          "Both $U$ and $K$ are zero.",
          "Both $U$ and $K$ are equal to $\\frac{1}{2}E_{total}$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, spring potential energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = 0$ since $x=0$. All energy is kinetic, so $K = E_{total}$ and is at its maximum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2.0\\text{ kg}$ mass is attached to a spring with $k = 50\\text{ N/m}$. If the amplitude is $0.1\\text{ m}$, what is the total energy?",
        "options": [
          "$0.25\\text{ J}$",
          "$0.50\\text{ J}$",
          "$1.0\\text{ J}$",
          "$2.5\\text{ J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = 0.5 \\times 50 \\times (0.1)^2 = 0.5 \\times 50 \\times 0.01 = 0.25\\text{ J}$. Note that mass is not needed for this calculation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which graph correctly shows the total energy of an undamped oscillator as a function of time?",
        "options": [
          "A sine wave.",
          "A parabola.",
          "A horizontal straight line.",
          "An exponentially decaying curve."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In an ideal (undamped) system, total mechanical energy is constant, so it would graph as a horizontal line over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the displacement is $x = A$ (maximum amplitude), the velocity of the mass is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximum.",
          "Zero.",
          "Half of maximum.",
          "$A\\omega$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At maximum displacement, all energy is potential ($U = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$) and kinetic energy is zero, meaning velocity is zero as the mass momentarily stops to reverse direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a simple pendulum, at what point in the swing is the gravitational potential energy at its minimum?",
        "options": [
          "At the highest point of the swing.",
          "At the lowest point (equilibrium).",
          "Halfway between the highest and lowest points.",
          "It is constant throughout the swing."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gravitational potential energy $U_g = mgh$ is minimum at the lowest point of the swing (typically set as the reference height $h=0$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the mass of an oscillator is doubled but the amplitude and spring constant remain the same, the total energy will:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Be halved.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Quadruple."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$ depends only on spring constant and amplitude, not on mass. Therefore, doubling mass has no effect on total energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The velocity of an object in SHM can be expressed in terms of $x$ and $A$ as:",
        "options": [
          "$v = \\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - x^2}$",
          "$v = \\omega(A - x)$",
          "$v = \\sqrt{k/m} \\cdot Ax$",
          "$v = \\omega\\sqrt{x^2 - A^2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From energy conservation: $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Solving for $v$ gives $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}(A^2 - x^2)} = \\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - x^2}$, since $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$."

        "90": "Excellent! You have mastered energy conservation in SHM, including transformations between kinetic and potential energy and how parameters affect total energy.",
        "70": "Very good! Solid understanding of energy in oscillating systems. Review the energy equations and how to find velocities at specific displacements.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) The energy conservation equation $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$, 2) How kinetic and potential energy vary with position, 3) The velocity formula $v = \\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - x^2}$, 4) Which parameters affect total energy.",
        "0": "Start with the fundamentals: Review the formulas for spring potential energy ($U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$), kinetic energy ($K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$), and how they sum to constant total energy in undamped SHM."
