      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A power plant generates $100\\text{ kW}$ of power at $500\\text{ V}$. It uses a step-up transformer with a $1:20$ turns ratio before sending the power through transmission lines with a total resistance of $10\\text{ }\\Omega$. What is the power lost as heat in the lines?",
        "options": [
          "$100\\text{ W}$",
          "$1,000\\text{ W}$",
          "$40,000\\text{ W}$",
          "$10\\text{ W}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Step 1: Transmission voltage $V_t = 500 \\times 20 = 10,000\\text{ V}$.\nStep 2: Transmission current $I = P/V_t = 100,000/10,000 = 10\\text{ A}$.\nStep 3: Power loss $P_{loss} = I^2R = 10^2 \\times 10 = 1,000\\text{ W}$.\nThis demonstrates why high-voltage transmission reduces losses: without stepping up, current would be $200\\text{ A}$ and losses would be $200^2 \\times 10 = 400,000\\text{ W}$!"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A square loop of wire ($0.10\\text{ m}$ per side) enters a uniform $2.0\\text{ T}$ magnetic field at a constant speed of $5.0\\text{ m/s}$. If the loop is connected to a transformer with a $1:100$ turns ratio, what is the peak voltage in the secondary coil while the loop is entering the field?",
        "options": [
          "$1.0\\text{ V}$",
          "$10\\text{ V}$",
          "$100\\text{ V}$",
          "$0\\text{ V}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Motional EMF in loop: $\\varepsilon = BLv = 2.0 \\times 0.10 \\times 5.0 = 1.0\\text{ V}$.\nTransformer step-up: $V_s = V_p \\times (N_s/N_p) = 1.0 \\times 100 = 100\\text{ V}$.\nThis combines motional EMF ($\\varepsilon = BLv$) with transformer action ($V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p$)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would simultaneously increase the magnetic field inside a solenoid and the EMF it induces in a nearby secondary coil?",
        "options": [
          "Replacing the iron core with an aluminum core.",
          "Increasing the frequency of the AC current in the solenoid.",
          "Decreasing the number of turns in the solenoid.",
          "Increasing the DC current in the solenoid."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AC frequency increase: (1) Magnetic field $B = \\mu n I$ is unaffected by frequency for same current amplitude. (2) Induced EMF $\\varepsilon = -d\\Phi/dt$ increases with frequency since $d\\Phi/dt \\propto \\omega$ for sinusoidal AC.\nNote: DC increase would boost $B$ but produce zero steady EMF; aluminum core reduces $B$; fewer turns reduces both."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A horizontal conductor moves vertically through a horizontal magnetic field. If the speed of the conductor is doubled and it is then connected to a transformer that halves the voltage, the final output voltage will be:",
        "options": [
          "Four times the original.",
          "Half the original.",
          "The same as the original.",
          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Original: $\\varepsilon_1 = BLv$.\nDoubling speed: $\\varepsilon_2 = BL(2v) = 2\\varepsilon_1$.\nTransformer halves voltage: $\\varepsilon_3 = 0.5 \\times 2\\varepsilon_1 = \\varepsilon_1$.\nThus final output equals original. Proportional changes cancel."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a real-world transformer, why does the iron core get hot even if the wire coils are perfectly superconducting (zero resistance)?",
        "options": [
          "Because of magnetic flux leakage.",
          "Because of eddy currents and hysteresis in the core.",
          "Because the magnetic field is too strong.",
          "Because of friction from the moving parts."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Core losses persist even with zero-resistance windings: (1) Eddy currents: circulating currents induced in core material ($P_{eddy} \\propto B^2f^2$). (2) Hysteresis: energy lost realigning magnetic domains each AC cycle ($P_{hyst} \\propto fB^n$).\nThese are inherent to the ferromagnetic material, not the windings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A proton moves at $3.0 \\times 10^6\\text{ m/s}$ perpendicular to a magnetic field of $0.5\\text{ T}$. If this magnetic field is created by a large solenoid, what happens to the force on the proton if the solenoid is connected to a $1:2$ step-up transformer?",
        "options": [
          "The force doubles.",
          "The force is halved.",
          "The force becomes zero because transformers only work with AC.",
          "The force quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Critical detail: Transformers require AC to function. If solenoid is powered through transformer, the field oscillates at AC frequency.\nMagnetic force $F = qvB\\sin\\theta$ requires a non-zero $B$. If $B$ oscillates sinusoidally ($B = B_0\\sin\\omega t$), the force oscillates too, with time-average zero for symmetric oscillation.\nThus no steady force on proton."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A transformer has an efficiency of 80%. If the primary current is $2\\text{ A}$ at $100\\text{ V}$, and the secondary voltage is $200\\text{ V}$, what is the secondary current?",
        "options": [
          "$1.0\\text{ A}$",
          "$0.8\\text{ A}$",
          "$1.6\\text{ A}$",
          "$4.0\\text{ A}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Input power: $P_{in} = V_pI_p = 100 \\times 2 = 200\\text{ W}$.\nOutput power: $P_{out} = \\eta P_{in} = 0.80 \\times 200 = 160\\text{ W}$.\nSecondary current: $I_s = P_{out}/V_s = 160/200 = 0.8\\text{ A}$.\nFor comparison, ideal transformer would give $I_s = 1.0\\text{ A}$ ($200/200$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you wrap a secondary coil around a DC electromagnet and then suddenly pull the iron core out, what happens in the secondary coil?",
        "options": [
          "Nothing happens because it is a DC system.",
          "A momentary EMF is induced.",
          "A constant EMF is induced as long as the core is out.",
          "The secondary coil becomes a permanent magnet."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Faraday's Law: $\\varepsilon = -d\\Phi/dt$. Removing iron core suddenly changes magnetic flux through secondary coil (iron concentrates field lines).\nThis change induces momentary EMF during removal. Once core is fully removed and flux stabilizes, $d\\Phi/dt = 0$, so EMF returns to zero.\nDC vs AC distinction matters for sustained induction, not transient changes."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The primary of a transformer is connected to an AC source. If the secondary coil is moved further away from the primary coil (with no core linking them), the output voltage decreases. This is due to:",
        "options": [
          "Increased resistance.",
          "Decreased flux linkage.",
          "Lenz's Law.",
          "Hysteresis."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Without iron core, magnetic field lines spread out in space. Flux through secondary $\\Phi_s = \\int \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$.\nMoving secondary away reduces the fraction of primary's magnetic flux that links with secondary.\nTransformers rely on mutual inductance $M$, which depends on flux linkage: $\\varepsilon_s = -M(dI_p/dt)$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $100\\%$ efficient transformer has $N_p = 50$ and $N_s = 200$. If the primary is connected to a $12\\text{ V}$ AC source and the secondary is connected to a $10\\text{ }\\Omega$ resistor, what is the current in the primary coil?",
        "options": [
          "$1.2\\text{ A}$",
          "$4.8\\text{ A}$",
          "$19.2\\text{ A}$",
          "$0.3\\text{ A}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Step 1: Secondary voltage $V_s = V_p \\times (N_s/N_p) = 12 \\times (200/50) = 48\\text{ V}$.\nStep 2: Secondary current $I_s = V_s/R = 48/10 = 4.8\\text{ A}$.\nStep 3: Power conservation ($100\\%$ efficient): $V_pI_p = V_sI_s$.\n$12 \\times I_p = 48 \\times 4.8 = 230.4$.\n$I_p = 230.4/12 = 19.2\\text{ A}$.\nCheck: Turns ratio 1:4 gives current ratio 4:1 (inverse of voltage ratio)."
