    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pair of physical quantities is directly related by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?",
        "options": [
          "Energy and Mass",
          "Position and Momentum",
          "Charge and Spin",
          "Velocity and Acceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The most famous form: $\\Delta x \\Delta p_x \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi) \\approx 1.055\\times 10^{-34}\\ \\text{J·s}$. This applies to position and momentum in the same direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you know the position of an electron with very high precision, what happens to your knowledge of its momentum?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes equally precise.",
          "It becomes very uncertain.",
          "It becomes exactly zero.",
          "It becomes negative."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Uncertainty principle: $\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\hbar/2$. As $\\Delta x \\to 0$ (perfect position knowledge), $\\Delta p \\to \\infty$ (complete momentum uncertainty). This is a fundamental limit, not measurement error."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the other important uncertainty relationship (besides position-momentum)?",

          "Mass-Energy",
          "Charge-Field",
          "Energy-Time",
          "Spin-Temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. Different interpretation than $\\Delta x \\Delta p$: $\\Delta E$ = energy uncertainty, $\\Delta t$ = time for measurement or lifetime of state. Explains natural linewidth in spectra."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why doesn't the uncertainty principle affect our everyday observations of macroscopic objects?",
        "options": [
          "It only applies to charged particles.",
          "Planck's constant ($h$) is extremely small.",
          "Gravity overrides quantum effects.",
          "Macroscopic objects have zero uncertainty."
        ],
        "explanation": "$\\hbar \\approx 10^{-34}\\ \\text{J·s}$ is negligible for macroscopic scales. Example: Baseball ($m=0.15\\ \\text{kg}$) with $\\Delta x = 0.1\\ \\text{mm}$ → $\\Delta v \\geq 4\\times 10^{-30}\\ \\text{m/s}$ (immeasurably small).",

          "Wave-particle duality.",
          "Thermodynamic limitations.",
          "Electromagnetic interference."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Comes from wave nature of matter. Localized wave packet (small $\\Delta x$) requires superposition of many wavelengths (large $\\Delta p$). Fourier transform relation between position and momentum wavefunctions."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an electron is confined to a region of size $1\\ \\text{nm}$ ($10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}$), what is the minimum uncertainty in its velocity? ($m_e = 9.11\\times 10^{-31}\\ \\text{kg}$)",
        "options": [
          "$1.15\\times 10^5\\ \\text{m/s}$",
          "$5.8\\times 10^4\\ \\text{m/s}$",

        "explanation": "$\\Delta x = 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}$, $\\Delta p \\geq \\hbar/(2\\Delta x) \\approx 5.3\\times 10^{-26}\\ \\text{kg·m/s}$. $\\Delta v = \\Delta p/m_e \\approx 5.8\\times 10^4\\ \\text{m/s}$. Minimum uncertainty ~$1.15\\times 10^5\\ \\text{m/s}$ (factor of 2 from $\\geq$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The zero-point energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator is a direct result of:",

          "Electromagnetic Induction."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Confined particle cannot have both $\\Delta x = 0$ and $\\Delta p = 0$. Minimum energy $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega > 0$ even at absolute zero. Classical oscillator would have $E=0$ at rest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the uncertainty principle imply about the concept of an electron's 'orbit' in an atom?",

          "Electrons orbit like planets.",
          "Electrons have definite trajectories.",
          "Electrons exist as probability clouds.",
          "Electrons are stationary."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Cannot simultaneously know position and momentum → no precise trajectory. Electron described by wavefunction $\\psi(x)$, with $|\\psi|^2$ = probability density. Bohr 'orbits' replaced by orbitals (probability clouds)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is NOT a correct interpretation of the uncertainty principle?",
        "options": [
          "It's a fundamental property of quantum systems.",
          "It limits simultaneous measurement precision.",
          "It's caused by measurement disturbance.",
          "It applies to all conjugate variables."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Common misconception: measurement disturbs system. Actually inherent in quantum states themselves. Even with perfect instruments, uncertainty exists. Conjugate variables: position-momentum, energy-time, angular momentum components."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the uncertainty principle explain why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons are repelled by protons.",
          "Confinement increases momentum uncertainty, creating kinetic energy.",
          "Electrons have fixed orbits by quantum rules.",
          "The strong nuclear force prevents it."
        ],
        "explanation": "If electron were confined to nucleus ($\\Delta x \\sim 10^{-15}\\ \\text{m}$), $\\Delta p$ would be huge → enormous kinetic energy ($\\sim \\Delta p^2/(2m)$). Balance with electrostatic attraction gives finite radius (~$10^{-10}\\ \\text{m}$).",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Schrödinger equation, what does the wave function, denoted by the Greek letter $\\Psi$ (psi), represent?",
        "options": [
          "The exact trajectory of a particle through space.",

          "The force acting on a particle at a given point."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\Psi(x,t)$ contains all information about quantum system. Time-dependent: $i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = H\\Psi$. Gives probability amplitudes, not trajectories. Different from classical waves (e.g., water, sound)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Max Born's interpretation, what physical quantity is provided by $|\\Psi|^2$?",

          "The total energy of the particle.",
          "The probability density of finding a particle at a specific location.",
          "The velocity of the particle wave.",
          "The electrical charge of the wave function."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Born rule (1926): $P(x) = |\\Psi(x)|^2 dx$ = probability to find particle between $x$ and $x+dx$. Total probability = $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\Psi|^2 dx = 1$ (normalization). Foundation of quantum probability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the Hamiltonian operator ($H$) represent in the time-independent Schrödinger equation $H\\Psi = E\\Psi$?",
        "options": [
          "The total energy of the system (Kinetic + Potential).",
          "The momentum of the particle.",
          "The height of the probability wave.",
          "The time elapsed since the system was created."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r})$. First term = kinetic energy operator, second = potential energy. Eigenvalues $E$ = allowed energy values. For 1D: $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)$."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Schrödinger equation considered a 'wave' equation?",
        "options": [
          "Because it only describes sound and water waves.",
          "Because its solutions allow for interference and diffraction of matter.",
          "Because it proves that particles are made of physical fluid.",
          "Because it only applies to particles moving in a circle."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Solutions exhibit wave properties: superposition (interference), diffraction, standing waves. Electron double-slit experiment shows interference pattern. Mathematical form similar to classical wave equations but with imaginary unit $i$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In quantum mechanics, what is a 'Stationary State'?",
        "options": [
          "A state where the particle has stopped moving entirely.",
          "A state where the probability density $|\\Psi|^2$ does not change over time.",
          "A state where the particle is physically stuck to the nucleus.",
          "A state that only exists at absolute zero temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Stationary states: solutions to time-independent Schrödinger equation. $\\Psi(x,t) = \\psi(x)e^{-iEt/\\hbar}$. Then $|\\Psi|^2 = |\\psi(x)|^2$ (time-independent). Examples: electron orbitals in atom, particle in box states."

          "It must always be a positive value."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Boundary conditions: 1) Continuous, 2) Single-valued, 3) Finite, 4) Normalizable ($\\int |\\Psi|^2 dV$ finite). $\\Psi$ can be complex (phase matters). Discontinuities violate probability conservation."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Quantum tunneling occurs when a particle passes through a barrier it classically cannot cross. How does the Schrödinger equation explain this?",
        "options": [
          "The particle gains a temporary boost of speed.",
          "The wave function does not immediately drop to zero inside a barrier, allowing a 'tail' to exist on the other side.",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For $E < V_0$: $\\psi(x)$ decays exponentially in barrier ($\\psi \\sim e^{-\\kappa x}$) but nonzero. Finite probability to find particle on other side. Applications: alpha decay, tunnel diodes, scanning tunneling microscopes."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\Psi|^2 dx = 1$. Probability interpretation requires this. Normalization constant $N$: $\\Psi_{norm} = N\\Psi$. For particle in infinite well: $\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L})$."
