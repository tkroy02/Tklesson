      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When two capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ are connected in series, the equivalent capacitance $C_{eq}$ is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "(1/C₁ + 1/C₂)⁻¹",
          "C₁ + C₂",
          "C₁ \\times C₂",
          "\\sqrt{C₁² + C₂²}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In series, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual capacitances, effectively increasing the 'distance' between the outer plates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A dielectric with constant $\\kappa$ is inserted into a capacitor while it is disconnected from a battery. What happens to the energy stored in the capacitor?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases by a factor of $1/\\kappa$.",
          "It increases by a factor of $\\kappa$.",
          "It remains constant because $Q$ is constant.",
          "It doubles regardless of $\\kappa$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With $Q$ constant, $U = Q^2 / 2C$. Since $C$ increases to $\\kappa C$, the energy $U$ must decrease to $U/\\kappa$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical property of a dielectric material is primarily responsible for increasing capacitance?",
        "options": [
          "Molecular polarization",
          "High electrical conductivity",
          "Increase in plate temperature",
          "Magnetic permeability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dielectric molecules align with the electric field, creating an internal opposing field that reduces the overall potential difference for a given charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical capacitors are connected in series to a $10\\, V$ battery. What is the voltage across each capacitor?",
        "options": [
          "5 V",
          "10 V",
          "2.5 V",
          "20 V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a series circuit with identical components, the total potential difference is divided equally across them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'dielectric strength' of a material refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The maximum electric field the material can withstand before breaking down.",
          "The ratio of charge to voltage for that specific material.",
          "The amount of energy stored per unit volume.",
          "The mechanical force required to compress the dielectric."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the electric field exceeds the dielectric strength, the material becomes conductive (sparking/arc), damaging the capacitor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to store a large amount of charge at low voltage, you should choose a capacitor with:",
        "options": [
          "Large plate area and small separation.",
          "Small plate area and large separation.",
          "Large plate area and large separation.",
          "Vacuum-only insulation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maximizing $A$ and minimizing $d$ increases $C$, and since $Q=CV$, a high $C$ stores more charge at any given $V$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $4\\, \\mu F$ and a $6\\, \\mu F$ capacitor are connected in parallel. What is the total capacitance?",

          "2.4 \\mu F",
          "5 \\mu F",
          "24 \\mu F"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For parallel capacitors, $C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 = 4 + 6 = 10\\, \\mu F$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the charge on a capacitor connected to a battery if a dielectric is inserted?",
        "options": [
          "The charge increases.",
          "The charge decreases.",
          "The charge remains the same.",
          "The charge becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $V$ is constant (battery connected) and $C$ increases with the dielectric, $Q = CV$ must increase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy stored in a capacitor is physically located:",
        "options": [
          "In the electric field between the plates.",
          "On the surface of the metal plates.",
          "Inside the battery connected to it.",
          "In the wires connecting the plates."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work is done to set up the electric field; that energy is stored within the field itself."
