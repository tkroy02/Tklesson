    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Magnetic flux ($\\Phi$) is a measure of the total magnetic field passing through a given area. It is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "$B/A$",
          "$BA\\cos\\theta$",
          "$ILB$",
          "$V/R$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Magnetic flux $\\Phi = \\vec{B} \\cdot \\vec{A} = BA\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ and the normal vector to the surface area $\\vec{A}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Faraday's Law, the magnitude of the induced electromotive force (EMF) is proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "The strength of the magnetic field.",
          "The area of the loop.",
          "The rate of change of magnetic flux.",
          "The resistance of the wire."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Faraday's Law states: $\\varepsilon = -N \\frac{d\\Phi}{dt}$, where $N$ is number of turns. The induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following will NOT induce a current in a loop of wire?",
        "options": [
          "Moving a magnet toward the loop.",
          "Rotating the loop within a constant magnetic field.",
          "Keeping the loop stationary in a constant magnetic field.",
          "Changing the area of the loop while in a magnetic field."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Induced current requires a change in magnetic flux over time. A stationary loop in a constant field has constant flux ($d\\Phi/dt = 0$), so no EMF is induced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Lenz's Law states that the direction of an induced current is such that it creates a magnetic field that:",
        "options": [
          "Reinforces the change in flux.",
          "Opposes the change in flux that created it.",
          "Points toward the North pole.",
          "Is always clockwise."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Lenz's Law is the minus sign in Faraday's Law: induced EMF opposes the change in flux that produced it. This ensures conservation of energy by resisting the change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A coil has 50 turns. If the magnetic flux through the coil changes by $0.2\\text{ Wb}$ in $0.1\\text{ s}$, what is the induced EMF?",
        "options": [
          "$10\\text{ V}$",
          "$100\\text{ V}$",
          "$25\\text{ V}$",
          "$250\\text{ V}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\varepsilon = N \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{\\Delta t} = 50 \\times \\frac{0.2}{0.1} = 50 \\times 2 = 100\\text{ V}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you push the North pole of a magnet into a coil, the end of the coil facing the magnet will behave as:",
        "options": [
          "A South pole to attract it.",
          "A North pole to repel it.",
          "A neutral point.",
          "A grounded wire."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By Lenz's Law, the induced current creates a field opposing the increasing flux. As a North pole approaches, the coil's face becomes a North pole to repel it, opposing the motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "\"Motional EMF\" is induced when a conductor of length $L$ moves at velocity $v$ perpendicular to a field $B$. The formula is:",
        "options": [
          "$\\varepsilon = BLv$",
          "$\\varepsilon = IR$",
          "$\\varepsilon = B/L$",
          "$\\varepsilon = qvB$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a rod moving perpendicular to both its length and $\\vec{B}$, $\\varepsilon = BLv$. This comes from $\\varepsilon = -d\\Phi/dt$ where $d\\Phi = B \\cdot dA = BL(vdt)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which device converts mechanical energy into electrical energy using induction?",

          "Battery",
          "Electric Generator",
          "Resistor"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Generators use electromagnetic induction: mechanical rotation moves a coil in a magnetic field, inducing an EMF and converting mechanical work to electrical energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Eddy currents are loops of electrical current induced within:",
        "options": [
          "Vacuum tubes.",
          "Bulk pieces of conductors moving through magnetic fields.",
          "Insulators like rubber.",
          "Superconductors only."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Eddy currents are circulating currents induced in solid conducting masses when they move through magnetic fields or experience changing magnetic fields, often causing energy loss as heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The negative sign in Faraday's Law ($\\varepsilon = -N \\frac{d\\Phi}{dt}$) represents:",
        "options": [
          "Negative charge.",
          "Loss of energy.",
          "Lenz's Law (opposition to change).",
          "The direction of the electron flow."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The negative sign is mathematical expression of Lenz's Law: it indicates the induced EMF (and thus current) opposes the change in magnetic flux that created it."
