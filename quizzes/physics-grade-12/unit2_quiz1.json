    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, if the distance between two massive spheres is tripled, by what factor does the gravitational force between them change?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases by a factor of 9",
          "It decreases by a factor of 3",
          "It increases by a factor of 9",
          "It remains the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The inverse-square law dictates that $F_g \\propto 1/r^2$. Therefore, tripling the distance ($3r$) results in a force of $1/3^2 = 1/9$ the original magnitude."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$, exert a gravitational force $F$ on each other. If $m_1$ is doubled and the distance between them is also doubled, what is the new gravitational force?",
        "options": [
          "0.5 F",
          "F",
          "2.0 F",
          "0.25 F"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$F_{new} = G(2m_1)(m_2) / (2r)^2 = 2 G m_1 m_2 / 4r^2 = 0.5 F$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why did Newton's Law of Gravitation represent a 'Unification' in physics?",
        "options": [
          "It showed that the same laws apply to both terrestrial and celestial motions.",
          "It combined electricity and magnetism into a single force.",
          "It proved that gravity is the only force acting in the universe.",
          "It unified the concepts of mass and energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newton proved that the force pulling an apple to the ground is the same force keeping the Moon in orbit, unifying 'Earthly' and 'Heavenly' physics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between the symbols $G$ and $g$ in gravitational physics?",
        "options": [
          "$G$ is a universal constant, while $g$ is a local acceleration.",
          "$g$ is a universal constant, while $G$ is a local acceleration.",
          "Both are universal constants, but used in different units.",
          "$G$ applies only to planets, while $g$ applies to small objects."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$G$ ($6.67 \\times 10^{-11}$ N·m²/kg²) is constant throughout the universe; $g$ is the local field strength (e.g., 9.8 m/s² on Earth)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the Earth were to shrink to half its current radius without losing any mass, how would the gravitational acceleration ($g$) at the surface change?",
        "options": [
          "It would increase by a factor of 4.",
          "It would decrease by a factor of 4.",
          "It would double.",
          "It would remain unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $g = GM/r^2$, reducing $r$ to $r/2$ results in $g$ becoming $1/(1/2)^2 = 4$ times larger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two asteroids are floating in deep space. If the mass of both asteroids is doubled and the distance remains the same, the gravitational force will:",
        "options": [
          "Quadruple.",
          "Double.",
          "Increase by a factor of 8.",
          "Remain the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Force is proportional to the product of the masses ($m_1 \\times m_2$). If both double, $2 \\times 2 = 4$ times the force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the gravitational field inside a hollow spherical shell of uniform mass?",
        "options": [
          "The gravitational field is zero everywhere inside.",
          "The field is strongest at the exact center.",
          "The field increases as you move closer to the inner wall.",
          "The field is constant and equal to the field at the surface."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Shell Theorem, the gravitational vectors from all parts of the shell cancel out perfectly at any point inside the volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the gravitational force between two objects if they are moved from Earth to deep space, maintaining the same separation distance?",
        "options": [
          "The force remains the same.",
          "The force becomes zero.",
          "The force increases because there is no air resistance.",
          "The force decreases because Earth is no longer pulling on them."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The fundamental force between two masses depends only on their masses and their distance, not their external environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Cavendish Experiment was significant because it allowed for the first accurate measurement of:",
        "options": [
          "The universal gravitational constant G.",
          "The speed of light.",
          "The charge of an electron.",
          "The distance to the Moon."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cavendish measured the weak gravitational attraction between lead spheres, allowing the calculation of $G$ and effectively 'weighing the Earth'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is moved to a distance from the center of a planet that is double the planet's radius, its weight will be:",
        "options": [
          "One-fourth its surface weight.",
          "One-half its surface weight.",
          "The same.",
          "Four times its surface weight."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weight is gravitational force. Moving from $r=R$ to $r=2R$ means the force becomes $1/2^2 = 1/4$ the original value."
