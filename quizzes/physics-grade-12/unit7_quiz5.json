    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation correctly relates the momentum ($p$) of a photon to its wavelength ($\\lambda$)?",
        "options": [
          "$p = h\\lambda$",
          "$p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$",
          "$p = \\frac{\\lambda}{h}$",
          "$p = mc$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "De Broglie relation for photons: $p = h/\\lambda$. Photons are massless ($m=0$), so $p=mc$ doesn't apply. For electrons: $p = h/\\lambda$ also holds but with different interpretation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a massless particle like a photon, what is the relationship between its energy ($E$) and momentum ($p$)?",
        "options": [
          "$E = pc$",
          "$E = \\frac{p}{c}$",
          "$E = p^2c$",
          "$E = \\frac{c}{p}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From relativity: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. For $m=0$: $E = pc$. Combined with $E = hf = hc/\\lambda$, gives $p = h/\\lambda = E/c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of a photon is tripled, what happens to its momentum?",
        "options": [
          "It is reduced to one-third.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It triples.",
          "It increases ninefold."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$p = hf/c$ → $p \\propto f$. Tripling frequency triples momentum. Alternatively: $\\lambda = c/f$, so tripling $f$ reduces $\\lambda$ to 1/3 → $p = h/\\lambda$ triples."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A beam of light hits a surface and is perfectly reflected. How does the momentum transfer compare to if the light were perfectly absorbed?",
        "options": [
          "It is the same.",
          "It is half as much.",
          "It is twice as much.",
          "It is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Absorption: $\\Delta p = p$ (photon stops). Reflection: $\\Delta p = p - (-p) = 2p$ (photon reverses direction). Perfect reflection delivers twice the momentum transfer per photon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The mechanical pressure exerted by light upon a surface is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Thermal pressure",
          "Radiation pressure",
          "Quantum tension",
          "Atmospheric light force"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Radiation pressure = momentum transfer rate per unit area. For sunlight at Earth: ~$4.5\\times 10^{-6}$ Pa (tiny). Important for solar sails, stellar interiors, and laser manipulation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which color of visible light photon carries the highest momentum?",
        "options": [
          "Red",
          "Green",
          "Yellow",
          "Violet"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$p = h/\\lambda$. Violet has shortest wavelength (~400 nm) → highest momentum. Red (~700 nm) has ~0.57× violet's momentum. Order: violet > blue > green > yellow > orange > red."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "\"Solar sails\" are a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion that relies on:",
        "options": [
          "Solar wind (charged particles) only.",
          "The thermal expansion of gases.",
          "Momentum transfer from reflected sunlight.",
          "Magnetic repulsion from the sun."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Solar sails use large reflective sheets. Photons bounce off, transferring $\\Delta p = 2p$ per photon. Continuous thrust builds over time, enabling interstellar travel without fuel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a photon has a wavelength of $400 \\text{ nm}$ and another has $800 \\text{ nm}$, the momentum of the $400 \\text{ nm}$ photon is:",
        "options": [
          "Half that of the $800 \\text{ nm}$ photon.",
          "The same as the $800 \\text{ nm}$ photon.",
          "Twice that of the $800 \\text{ nm}$ photon.",
          "Four times that of the $800 \\text{ nm}$ photon."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$p_1/p_2 = \\lambda_2/\\lambda_1 = 800/400 = 2$. 400 nm photon has double the momentum. Example: $p_{400} \\approx 1.66\\times 10^{-27}$ kg·m/s, $p_{800} \\approx 8.28\\times 10^{-28}$ kg·m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the wavelength of a photon after it collides with and transfers momentum to a stationary electron (Compton Scattering)?",
        "options": [
          "The wavelength decreases.",
          "The wavelength stays the same.",
          "The wavelength increases.",
          "The photon disappears."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Compton shift: $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda' - \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_e c}(1-\\cos\\theta)$. Photon loses energy to electron → lower frequency → longer wavelength. Proves particle nature of light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the momentum of a single visible light photon not noticeable when it hits your skin?",
        "options": [
          "Because human skin is a perfect conductor.",
          "Because the value of Planck's constant is extremely small ($10^{-34}$).",
          "Because photons only have momentum in a vacuum.",
          "Because the skin reflects all momentum perfectly."
        ],
        "explanation": "$h = 6.63\\times 10^{-34}$ J·s → tiny momentum per photon. For green light (550 nm): $p \\approx 1.2\\times 10^{-27}$ kg·m/s. Need ~$10^{18}$ photons/s to feel ~nanonewton force.",

        "90": "Excellent! Mastery of photon momentum concepts including relativistic energy-momentum relation, radiation pressure, solar sail physics, Compton scattering, and quantitative wavelength/momentum relationships.",

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) Photon momentum formula $p = h/\\lambda$, 2) Relationship $E = pc$ for massless particles, 3) How momentum transfer causes radiation pressure, 4) Wavelength-momentum inverse proportionality, 5) Compton scattering as momentum transfer evidence.",
        "0": "Start with fundamentals: Review photon as particle with momentum, de Broglie relation, why $p = h/\\lambda$ differs from classical $p = mv$, and how tiny $h$ makes photon momentum imperceptible in daily life but measurable in experiments."
