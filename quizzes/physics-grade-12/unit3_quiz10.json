      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle executes SHM with an amplitude $A$. At what displacement from the mean position is the kinetic energy equal to the potential energy?",
        "options": [
          "$A/2$",
          "$A/\\sqrt{2}$",
          "$A/3$",
          "$A/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Setting $K = U$: $\\frac{1}{2}k(A^2 - x^2) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. This simplifies to $A^2 = 2x^2$, giving $x = \\pm A/\\sqrt{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two particles execute SHM of same amplitude and frequency along the same straight line. They pass one another moving in opposite directions each time their displacement is half their amplitude. What is the phase difference between them?",
        "options": [
          "$30^\\circ$",
          "$60^\\circ$",
          "$120^\\circ$",
          "$150^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Displacement $x = A/2$ corresponds to phases $\\pi/6$ ($30^\\circ$) and $5\\pi/6$ ($150^\\circ$) from the phasor circle. For opposite velocity directions, one particle is at $30^\\circ$ and the other at $150^\\circ$, giving a difference of $120^\\circ$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass $M$ is suspended from a spring of negligible mass. The spring is pulled a little and then released so that the mass executes SHM of time period $T$. If the mass is increased by $m$, the time period becomes $\\frac{5}{3}T$. What is the ratio $m/M$?",
        "options": [
          "$3/5$",
          "$25/9$",
          "$16/9$",
          "$5/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $T \\propto \\sqrt{M}$, we have $\\frac{5}{3} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M+m}{M}}$. Squaring both sides: $\\frac{25}{9} = 1 + \\frac{m}{M}$, so $\\frac{m}{M} = \\frac{25}{9} - 1 = \\frac{16}{9}$."

          "$0.63\\text{ s}$",
          "$2\\pi\\text{ s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expand: $U = 5x^2 - 20x$. Force $F = -dU/dx = -10x + 20 = -10(x-2)$. This is Hooke's Law about $x=2$ with $k=10$. Mass $m=0.1\\text{ kg}$, so $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{0.1/10} = 0.2\\pi\\text{ s}$."

        "type": "mcq",

          "1",
          "$\\sqrt{2}$",
          "4",
          "2"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Gravity at surface: $g_1 = GM/R^2$. At height $R$: distance $= 2R$, so $g_2 = GM/(2R)^2 = g_1/4$. Since $T \\propto 1/\\sqrt{g}$, $T_2/T_1 = \\sqrt{g_1/g_2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The displacement of a particle in SHM is $x = A\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. At $t=0$, the displacement is $x = A/2$ and it is moving towards the negative x-direction. The phase constant $\\phi$ is:",

          "$5\\pi/6$",
          "$2\\pi/3$",
          "$\\pi/3$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At $t=0$: $A/2 = A\\sin\\phi \\Rightarrow \\sin\\phi = 1/2 \\Rightarrow \\phi = \\pi/6$ or $5\\pi/6$. Velocity $v = A\\omega\\cos\\phi$. For motion toward negative $x$, $v < 0$, requiring $\\cos\\phi < 0$, which happens for $\\phi$ in second quadrant ($5\\pi/6$)."

          "$A = x_0, \\delta = -\\pi/4$",
          "$A = x_0\\omega^2, \\delta = -\\pi/4$",
          "$A = x_0\\omega^2, \\delta = \\pi/4$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acceleration $a = -\\omega^2 x = -\\omega^2 x_0\\cos(\\omega t - \\pi/4) = x_0\\omega^2\\cos(\\omega t - \\pi/4 + \\pi) = x_0\\omega^2\\cos(\\omega t + 3\\pi/4)$. Thus $A = x_0\\omega^2$ and $\\delta = 3\\pi/4$."

          "$\\sqrt{2}A$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Total energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$. New spring constant $k' = 2k$, new mass $m' = m/2$. For same $E$: $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(2k)A'^2 \\Rightarrow A'^2 = A^2/2 \\Rightarrow A' = A/\\sqrt{2}$."

          "Ellipse",
          "Straight Line",
          "Hyperbola"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $v = \\omega\\sqrt{A^2 - x^2}$, square both sides: $v^2 = \\omega^2(A^2 - x^2) \\Rightarrow \\frac{x^2}{A^2} + \\frac{v^2}{\\omega^2 A^2} = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse."
