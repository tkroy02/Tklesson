    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the shape of the magnetic field lines around a long, straight current-carrying wire?",
        "options": [
          "Radial lines pointing away from the wire.",
          "Parallel lines along the length of the wire.",
          "Concentric circles centered on the wire.",
          "Ellipses extending toward the poles."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The magnetic field forms concentric circles around the wire, with direction given by the right-hand rule. The field strength decreases with distance: $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which rule is used to find the direction of the magnetic field around a straight wire?",
        "options": [
          "Right-Hand Rule (Thumb = Force, Fingers = Field).",
          "Right-Hand Rule (Thumb = Current, Fingers curl = Field).",
          "Left-Hand Rule (Thumb = Current, Fingers = Field).",
          "The Lenz Rule."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Right-hand rule: point thumb in direction of conventional current (+ to -), and fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field circles around the wire."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The magnetic field strength ($B$) at a distance $r$ from a long straight wire is:",
        "options": [
          "Directly proportional to $r$.",
          "Inversely proportional to $r$.",
          "Inversely proportional to $r^2$.",
          "Independent of distance."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From the Biot-Savart law: $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$, so $B \\propto 1/r$. This is unlike electric fields from point charges, which follow $1/r^2$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop if the number of turns in the loop is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "It remains the same.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Field at center of a circular loop: $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R}$ per turn. For $N$ turns: $B = \\frac{N\\mu_0 I}{2R}$. Doubling $N$ doubles $B$, as fields from each turn add constructively."

        "question": "A \"Solenoid\" is a long coil of wire. The magnetic field inside an ideal solenoid is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero.",
          "Uniform and parallel to the axis.",
          "Strongest at the edges.",
          "Circular around the wires only."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inside a long, tightly wound solenoid, the magnetic field is uniform (constant in strength and direction) and parallel to the solenoid axis: $B = \\mu_0 n I$, where $n$ is turns per meter."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To increase the strength of an electromagnet (solenoid), one should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase the current and number of turns.",
          "Insert a ferromagnetic core (like iron).",
          "Both A and B.",
          "Use a plastic core."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Strength increases with: (1) more current $I$, (2) more turns $N$ per length, and (3) inserting a ferromagnetic core which amplifies the field by a factor $\\mu_r$ (relative permeability)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The constant $\\mu_0$ (permeability of free space) has a value of approximately:",

          "$8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ C}^2/\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$",
          "$4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ T}\\cdot\\text{m}/\\text{A}$",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ T}\\cdot\\text{m}/\\text{A}$. Option A is $\\epsilon_0$ (permittivity), C is Coulomb's constant, D is Planck's constant."

          "The total voltage.",
          "The enclosed net current.",
          "The resistance of the loop.",
          "The change in electric flux."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ampere's Law: $\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{\\ell} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$. The circulation of $\\vec{B}$ around any closed loop equals $\\mu_0$ times the net current passing through the loop."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If current flows into the page through a wire, the magnetic field lines (from your perspective) will be:",
        "options": [
          "Clockwise.",
          "Counter-clockwise.",
          "Pointing toward the top of the page.",
          "Pointing toward the bottom."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Right-hand rule: point thumb into page (current direction), fingers curl clockwise around the wire. Thus magnetic field circles clockwise as viewed from above."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The magnetic field outside a very long, tightly wound solenoid is approximately:",

          "Equal to the field inside.",
          "Zero.",
          "Twice the field inside.",
