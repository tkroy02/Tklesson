      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is thrown horizontally from a height. Neglecting air resistance, its horizontal velocity ($v_x$) during the fall:",
        "options": [
          "Increases at $9.8\\ \\text{m/s}^2$",
          "Decreases to zero",
          "Remains constant",
          "Depends on the mass"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In projectile motion with no air resistance, the horizontal velocity remains constant because there is no horizontal force (Newton's First Law). Only vertical velocity changes due to gravity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A crate is pushed across a floor at a constant velocity. If the friction force is $40\\ \\text{N}$, the applied force must be:",
        "options": [
          "$0\\ \\text{N}$",
          "Less than $40\\ \\text{N}$",
          "Exactly $40\\ \\text{N}$",
          "More than $40\\ \\text{N}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Constant velocity means zero net force ($F_{net} = 0$). Therefore, the applied force must exactly balance the friction force: $F_{applied} = 40\\ \\text{N}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $5.0\\ \\text{kg}$ bowling ball is lifted $2.0\\ \\text{m}$. The work done against gravity is approximately:",
        "options": [
          "$10\\ \\text{J}$",
          "$49\\ \\text{J}$",
          "$98\\ \\text{J}$",
          "$200\\ \\text{J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Work against gravity: $W = mgh = (5.0)(9.8)(2.0) = 98\\ \\text{J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $0.1\\ \\text{kg}$ egg hits a wall and stops. To decrease the force of impact, you should:",
        "options": [
          "Increase the change in momentum",
          "Increase the time of contact",
          "Decrease the time of contact",
          "Increase the mass of the egg"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Impulse-momentum theorem: $F \\Delta t = \\Delta p$. For a fixed momentum change $\\Delta p$, increasing the contact time $\\Delta t$ reduces the average force $F$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite orbits Earth at a constant speed. The net force on the satellite is directed:",
        "options": [
          "Tangent to the orbit",
          "Away from Earth",
          "Toward the center of Earth",
          "Opposite to the direction of motion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Uniform circular motion requires a centripetal (center-seeking) force. For a satellite, this is the gravitational force directed toward Earth's center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the distance between two charges is halved, the electric force between them:",
        "options": [
          "Halves",
          "Doubles",
          "Triples",
          "Quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Coulomb's Law: $F \\propto 1/r^2$. If $r$ is halved ($r \\to r/2$), force becomes $F \\propto 1/(r/2)^2 = 4/r^2$, increasing by a factor of 4."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wire carries current into the page. A magnetic field points upward. The magnetic force on the wire points:",
        "options": [
          "Left",
          "Right",
          "Up",
          "Down"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Right-hand rule: Point fingers in field direction (up), thumb in current direction (into page), palm gives force direction (right)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two events are simultaneous for a stationary observer. For an observer moving at $0.5c$:",
        "options": [
          "They are still simultaneous",
          "They may not be simultaneous",
          "The time between them is infinite",
          "They occur in the past"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Relativity of simultaneity: Events simultaneous in one inertial frame are generally not simultaneous in another frame moving relative to the first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As an object's speed approaches $c$, its momentum:",
        "options": [
          "Approaches $mc$",
          "Levels off",
          "Approaches infinity",
          "Becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Relativistic momentum $p = \\gamma mv$. As $v \\to c$, $\\gamma \\to \\infty$, so $p \\to \\infty$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the photoelectric effect, the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons depends on:",
        "options": [
          "Light intensity",
          "Light frequency",
          "Surface area",
          "Time of exposure"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Maximum kinetic energy is $K_{max} = hf - \\phi$, where $f$ is light frequency. Intensity affects electron count, not individual energy."
