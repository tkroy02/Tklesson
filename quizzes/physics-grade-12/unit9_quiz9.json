        "question": "A proton (rest mass $\\approx 1.67 \\times 10^{-27}\\text{ kg}$) is accelerated to $v = 0.6c$. What is its relativistic momentum?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Step 1: $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - 0.6^2} = 1/0.8 = 1.25$.\nStep 2: $p = \\gamma m v$.\n$p = 1.25 \\times (1.67 \\times 10^{-27}\\text{ kg}) \\times (0.6 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^8\\text{ m/s})$.\n$p \\approx 1.25 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^{-19} \\approx 3.75 \\times 10^{-19}\\text{ kg·m/s}$."

          "$0.500c$",
          "$0.707c$",
          "$0.866c$",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If $p_{rel} = 2mv$, then $\\gamma m v = 2 m v$, which simplifies to $\\gamma = 2$ (assuming $v>0$). Solve $2 = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$:\n$\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = 0.5$ → $1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.25$ → $v^2/c^2 = 0.75$ → $v = \\sqrt{0.75}c = 0.866c$."

          "Equal.",
          "49 times larger ($7.1^2$)."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Classical momentum is $p_{class} = m v$. Relativistic momentum is $p_{rel} = \\gamma m v$. Therefore, the relationship is $p_{rel} = \\gamma \\times p_{class}$. For $\\gamma \\approx 7.1$, the relativistic momentum is about 7.1 times larger."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Increases by less than double.",
          "Stays the same."
        ],
        "explanation": "At low speeds ($v \\ll c$), $\\gamma \\approx 1$, so $p \\approx m v$ and momentum scales linearly with speed. At high speeds, $\\gamma$ becomes significant and changes rapidly. $\\gamma$ at $0.8c$ is 1.67, and at $0.9c$ is 2.29. The momentum ratio is $(2.29 \\times 0.9) / (1.67 \\times 0.8) \\approx 2.06 / 1.34 \\approx 1.54$. While not double, it's a >50% increase from a smaller speed increment, showing the non-linear scaling.",

          "$p = E/c$",
          "$p = \\gamma mc$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Photons have zero rest mass ($m=0$), so the formula $p = \\gamma m v$ is not directly applicable (it gives $0 \\cdot \\infty$). Instead, we use the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. For $m=0$, this simplifies to $E = pc$, or $p = E/c$."

        "options": [
          "The force required decreases.",
          "The force required stays constant.",
          "The force required approaches infinity.",
          "No force is required once it reaches $0.9c$."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Force is the rate of change of momentum ($F = dp/dt$). As $v \\to c$, $p \\to \\infty$, so even a tiny increase in speed requires a huge change in momentum. Therefore, the force needed to sustain constant acceleration (to keep adding momentum) approaches infinity."

          "$22.4 m$",
          "$m \\times c^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Momentum $p = \\gamma m v$. With $\\gamma \\approx 22.4$ and $v \\approx 0.999c \\approx c$, we get $p \\approx 22.4 m c$. While $v$ is slightly less than $c$, 0.999c is often approximated as $c$ in such expressions when $\\gamma$ is large."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the formula $p = \\gamma mv$, which variable is considered 'invariant' (the same for all observers)?",

          "$p$",
          "$v$",
          "$\\gamma$",
          "$m$ (Rest Mass)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "An invariant quantity has the same numerical value in all inertial frames. Rest mass $m$ is such an invariant—it is a fundamental property of the object. Momentum ($p$), velocity ($v$), and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) all depend on the observer's frame of reference."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it physically impossible for a massive particle to have a momentum of $p = \\infty$?",
        "options": [
          "Because there isn't enough matter in the universe.",
          "Because it would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it to $v = c$.",
          "Because the particle would turn into a black hole first.",
          "Because time would stop."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To achieve $p = \\infty$, the particle's velocity must be exactly $c$. However, as $v$ approaches $c$, $\\gamma \\to \\infty$, meaning the kinetic energy required ($K = (\\gamma - 1) m c^2$) also approaches infinity. Since infinite energy is unobtainable, reaching $v = c$ (and thus $p = \\infty$) is impossible for any object with mass."
