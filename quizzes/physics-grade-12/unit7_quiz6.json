    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Compton scattering event, when a photon strikes a stationary electron, the scattered photon will always have:",
        "options": [
          "More energy than the incident photon.",
          "The same frequency as the incident photon.",
          "A longer wavelength than the incident photon.",
          "A higher velocity than the incident photon."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Energy conservation: photon loses energy to electron → lower frequency → longer wavelength ($E = hf = hc/\\lambda$). Speed remains $c$, wavelength always increases (except forward scattering at 0°)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'recoil electron' in the context of photon-electron collisions?",
        "options": [
          "An electron that absorbs the photon and moves to a higher orbit.",
          "The electron that is ejected from the atom after being hit by a photon.",
          "An electron that emits a photon to lose energy.",
          "An electron that stays stationary during the collision."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Compton scattering, the electron gains energy/momentum from photon and recoils. It's ejected from atom (though loosely bound electrons are effectively free). Distinguished from photoelectric effect where electron is also ejected but photon disappears."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The maximum change in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) during Compton scattering occurs when the photon is scattered at an angle of:",
        "options": [
          "$0^\\circ$ (Forward scattering)",
          "$45^\\circ$",
          "$90^\\circ$",
          "$180^\\circ$ (Backscattering)"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Compton formula: $\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\\cos\\theta)$. Maximum at $\\theta=180^\\circ$: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max} = 2h/(m_ec) = 0.00486\\ \\text{nm}$ (twice Compton wavelength). Minimum ($\\Delta\\lambda=0$) at $\\theta=0^\\circ$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Compton Wavelength' ($\\lambda_C = h/m_e c$) is a constant that depends only on:",
        "options": [
          "The frequency of the incident light.",
          "The mass of the electron.",
          "The intensity of the light beam.",
          "The temperature of the metal target."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda_C = h/(m_ec) \\approx 2.43\\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{m}$. Fundamental constant combining $h$, $m_e$, $c$. Appears in Compton formula: $\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda_C(1-\\cos\\theta)$. Different for protons: $\\lambda_{C,p} \\approx 1.32\\times 10^{-15}\\ \\text{m}$ (much smaller)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is conserved during a photon-electron collision in a vacuum?",
        "options": [
          "Total energy only.",
          "Momentum only.",
          "Both total energy and momentum.",
          "Neither, as energy is converted into mass."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Treated as elastic collision between two particles. Relativistic energy conservation: $E_{\\gamma} + m_ec^2 = E_{\\gamma}' + E_e'$. Momentum conservation: $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} = \\vec{p}_{\\gamma}' + \\vec{p}_e'$. These give Compton formula."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a photon has enough energy to create an electron and a positron upon passing near a nucleus, the process is called:",
        "options": [
          "The Photoelectric Effect.",
          "Compton Scattering.",
          "Pair Production.",
          "Thermionic Emission."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pair production: $\\gamma \\rightarrow e^- + e^+$. Minimum photon energy: $2m_ec^2 = 1.022\\ \\text{MeV}$ (gamma rays). Requires nucleus to conserve momentum. Inverse process: annihilation $e^- + e^+ \\rightarrow 2\\gamma$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is Compton scattering more easily observed with X-rays than with visible light?",
        "options": [
          "Visible light photons are too large to hit electrons.",
          "X-ray photons have much higher momentum, making the wavelength shift measurable.",
          "Visible light only interacts with protons.",
          "X-rays travel faster than visible light."
        ],
        "explanation": "$\\Delta\\lambda \\approx 0.0024\\ \\text{nm}$ (for 90° scattering). For visible light ($\\lambda \\approx 500\\ \\text{nm}$), shift is ~0.0005% → negligible. For X-rays ($\\lambda \\approx 0.1\\ \\text{nm}$), shift is ~2.4% → easily measurable.",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Photoelectric effect, the photon is ________; in Compton scattering, the photon is ________.",

          "Absorbed; Scattered",
          "Doubled; Halved"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Photoelectric: photon completely absorbed, disappears, transfers all energy to electron. Compton: photon scatters with reduced energy, continues with longer wavelength. Both demonstrate particle nature but different interaction types."
      },

        "type": "mcq",

          "Have no mass at high speeds.",
          "Behave like a wave.",
          "Disappear when it stops moving.",
          "Only exist inside a nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "De Broglie (1924): Wave-particle duality applies to all matter. Electron wavelength $\\lambda = h/p$. Confirmed by Davisson-Germer experiment (electron diffraction). Macroscopic objects have negligible $\\lambda$ (tiny $h$, large $p$)."

          "Momentum.",
          "Velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "De Broglie: $p = h/\\lambda$ applies to both photons and electrons. Same $\\lambda$ → same $p$. Different energies: Photon $E = pc$, electron $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_ec^2)^2}$. Different velocities: photon $v=c$, electron $v<c$."

Focus on: 1) Compton scattering basics (wavelength increase, angle dependence), 2) Distinguishing photoelectric absorption vs. Compton scattering, 3) Compton wavelength constant meaning, 4) de Broglie relation $\\lambda = h/p$ for all particles, 5) Conservation laws in collisions.",
