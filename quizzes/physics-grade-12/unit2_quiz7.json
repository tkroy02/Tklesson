    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a satellite in a stable circular orbit around a planet, what is the mathematical relationship between the gravitational force ($F_g$) and the centripetal force ($F_c$)?",
        "options": [
          "F_g = F_c",
          "F_g = 2F_c",
          "F_g = 0.5F_c",
          "F_g = F_c²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a stable orbit, gravity is the sole force providing the centripetal acceleration required to keep the satellite moving in a circle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the mass of a satellite is doubled while keeping it in the same circular orbit, how does its required orbital speed change?",
        "options": [
          "It remains the same.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It increases by √2.",
          "It is reduced by half."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Setting $GmM/r^2 = mv^2/r$ allows the mass of the satellite ($m$) to cancel out. Orbital speed $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$ depends only on the central mass and the radius."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two satellites, A and B, orbit Earth. Satellite A is at a distance $r$ and Satellite B is at a distance $4r$ from the center of Earth. What is the ratio of their orbital speeds ($v_A / v_B$)?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "4",
          "0.5",
          "√2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $v \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r}$, Satellite B (at $4r$) moves at $1/\\sqrt{4} = 1/2$ the speed of Satellite A. Thus, $v_A$ is 2 times $v_B$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A geostationary satellite remains over the same spot on Earth's equator. What is its orbital period ($T$)?",
        "options": [
          "24 hours",
          "12 hours",
          "90 minutes",
          "365 days"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To remain over the same spot, the satellite's orbital period must exactly match the Earth's rotational period of approximately 24 hours."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the orbital speed of a satellite if it is moved to a higher altitude?",
        "options": [
          "The orbital speed decreases.",
          "The orbital speed increases.",
          "The orbital speed remains constant.",
          "The orbital speed becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the radius $r$ increases, the gravitational pull weakens. A lower centripetal force is needed, which corresponds to a lower orbital velocity ($v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The International Space Station (ISS) orbits at an altitude of approximately 400 km. Why do the astronauts inside feel weightless?",
        "options": [
          "They are in a state of continuous free-fall along with the station.",
          "The Earth's gravity is zero at that altitude.",
          "The centrifugal force perfectly cancels the Earth's gravity.",
          "The station is outside the Earth's atmosphere."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity still acts on them (at about 90% of surface value), but because they and the station are falling at the same rate, there is no normal force, creating the sensation of weightlessness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula correctly represents the orbital period $T$ of a satellite in terms of the orbital radius $r$ and the central mass $M$?",
        "options": [
          "T = 2π√(r³/GM)",
          "T = 2π√(GM/r)",
          "T = 2πr/GM",
          "T = √(GM/r³)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Starting from $v = 2\\pi r / T$ and $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$, squaring and rearranging yields $T^2 = (4\\pi^2 / GM)r^3$, or $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{r^3/GM}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a planet's mass were quadrupled but the orbital radius of its moon remained the same, the moon's orbital speed would:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Quadruple.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Be reduced to half."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$, quadrupling $M$ results in a factor of $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ increase in velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a circular orbit, the velocity vector and the gravitational force vector are always:",
        "options": [
          "Perpendicular to each other.",
          "Parallel to each other.",
          "At a 45° angle to each other.",
          "In opposite directions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Velocity is tangent to the circle, while the gravitational force (the centripetal force) is radial (toward the center). Tangent and radius are always perpendicular."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite in a very low Earth orbit (just above the atmosphere) has an orbital speed of approximately 8 km/s. What would happen if its speed were increased to 12 km/s?",
        "options": [
          "It would leave Earth's orbit on a hyperbolic path.",
          "It would move into a higher circular orbit.",
          "It would crash into the Earth.",
          "It would simply spin faster in its current path."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Earth's escape velocity is $\\approx 11.2$ km/s. Since 12 km/s exceeds this, the satellite would break free of Earth's gravity entirely."
