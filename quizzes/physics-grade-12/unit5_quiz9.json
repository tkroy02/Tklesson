      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A circular loop of wire is placed near a long straight wire carrying a current $I$. If the current $I$ is suddenly increased, what is the direction of the induced current in the loop?",
        "options": [
          "Same direction as the current $I$",
          "Opposite direction to the current $I$",
          "Clockwise or Counter-clockwise depending on the loop's position",
          "No current is induced"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The field through the loop depends on its position relative to the wire. For a wire with current upward: field into page on right side, out of page on left. Increasing $I$ increases this field. If loop is on right: increasing flux into page → induced field out of page → CCW current. If loop is on left: increasing flux out of page → induced field into page → CW current."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metal ring is held horizontally and a bar magnet is dropped through it. During the entire fall, the acceleration of the magnet is:",
        "options": [
          "Equal to $g$",
          "Greater than $g$",
          "Less than $g$ while entering and leaving the ring",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When magnet enters: increasing flux induces current that repels magnet (slows descent). When magnet is completely inside: no flux change (constant flux), no induced current, acceleration = $g$. When magnet leaves: decreasing flux induces current that attracts magnet (slows descent). Net effect: acceleration < $g$ during entry and exit phases only."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical coaxial circular loops carry equal currents in the same direction. If the loops are moved further apart, the current in each will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Stay the same",
          "Drop to zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moving loops apart decreases the mutual flux through each loop. By Lenz's Law, each loop induces an additional current in the same direction as the original to oppose this decrease in flux. This temporarily increases the total current in each loop while they're being moved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rectangular loop moves with constant velocity $v$ into a region of uniform magnetic field. While it is partially inside the field, the induced EMF is:",
        "options": [
          "Increasing",
          "Decreasing",
          "Constant",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "While entering: area in field increases linearly with time: $A(t) = L \\times (vt)$. Flux $\\Phi = BA = BLvt$. EMF $\\varepsilon = -d\\Phi/dt = -BLv$, constant since $B$, $L$, and $v$ are constant. Similar constant EMF (with opposite sign) while exiting."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solenoid is connected to a battery. When a core of soft iron is inserted into the solenoid, the current in the circuit temporarily:",
        "options": [
          "Increases",
          "Decreases",
          "Stays the same",
          "Reverses"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inserting iron increases permeability $\\mu$, increasing magnetic flux $\\Phi$. By Lenz's Law, an opposing EMF (back-EMF) is induced to oppose this increase in flux. This back-EMF opposes the battery voltage, temporarily reducing the current until the system reaches steady state."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A copper disc is rotated in a magnetic field directed perpendicular to its plane. The induced EMF is produced between:",
        "options": [
          "Two points on the rim",
          "The center and the rim",
          "Two points on the axis",
          "No EMF is induced"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is Faraday's disc generator. Each radial element acts as a conductor moving through magnetic field. EMF accumulates along radius: $\\varepsilon = \\int_0^R B\\omega r \\, dr = \\frac{1}{2}B\\omega R^2$. Maximum potential difference is between center (low speed) and rim (high speed)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A square loop of wire is being pulled through a magnetic field at constant speed. If the resistance of the loop is doubled, the force required to pull it is:",
        "options": [
          "Doubled",
          "Halved",
          "Quadrupled",
          "Unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Motional EMF $\\varepsilon = BLv$ is constant. Current $I = \\varepsilon/R$. Doubling $R$ halves $I$. Magnetic braking force $F_{mag} = ILB$. Thus $F_{mag}$ is halved. To maintain constant speed, pulling force $F_{pull} = F_{mag}$, so pulling force is also halved."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the case of \"Mutual Induction,\" if the current in the primary coil is $I = I_0\\sin(\\omega t)$, the induced EMF in the secondary coil will follow a:",
        "options": [
          "Sine wave",
          "Cosine wave",
          "Constant DC value",
          "Logarithmic curve"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "EMF $\\varepsilon_2 = -M \\frac{dI_1}{dt}$, where $M$ is mutual inductance. $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin\\omega t) = \\omega\\cos\\omega t$. Thus $\\varepsilon_2 = -M\\omega I_0\\cos(\\omega t)$, a cosine wave lagging the current by 90°."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A superconducting ring is placed in a magnetic field. If the field is turned off, the current induced in the ring will:",
        "options": [
          "Decay immediately",
          "Flow forever",
          "Not be induced at all",
          "Oscillate"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Superconductors have zero resistance ($R=0$). When external field is removed, induced current flows to maintain the original flux (Lenz's Law). With no resistance, there's no energy dissipation ($I^2R = 0$), so current persists indefinitely—this is \"persistent current.\""

        "question": "An airplane with a wingspan $L$ flies horizontally at speed $v$ in a region where the Earth's magnetic field has a vertical component $B_v$. The potential difference between the wingtips is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "$B_v Lv$",
          "$B_v L/v$",
          "$mgh$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Wings act as conductor moving perpendicular to vertical field component. Motional EMF: $\\varepsilon = BLv = B_v Lv$ (assuming wings are perpendicular to velocity and field). This is actually measurable and can affect aircraft instrumentation."
