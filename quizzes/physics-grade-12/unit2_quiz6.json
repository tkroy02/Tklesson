    "subject": "Physics",
    "topic": "Gravitation and Satellites",
    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which condition must be met for an object to be considered 'escaped' from a gravitational field in an ideal system?",
        "options": [
          "Its total mechanical energy must be greater than or equal to zero.",
          "Its kinetic energy must be exactly double its potential energy.",
          "Its velocity must be greater than the speed of light.",
          "It must be far enough away that the force of gravity becomes exactly zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Escape occurs when an object has enough kinetic energy to reach infinity ($E_g = 0$) with at least zero velocity remaining ($E_k \\ge 0$). Thus, $E_T \\ge 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the mass of the escaping object ($m$) affect the required escape velocity from a planet of mass $M$?",
        "options": [
          "The escape velocity is independent of the mass of the escaping object.",
          "Heavier objects require a significantly higher escape velocity.",
          "Lighter objects require a higher escape velocity due to lower momentum.",
          "The mass only matters if the object is larger than the planet."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the derivation $0.5mv^2 - GMm/r = 0$, the mass of the object ($m$) cancels out, leaving $v_e = \\sqrt{2GM/r}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Planet Alpha has the same radius as Earth but twice the mass, how does its escape velocity compare to Earth's?",
        "options": [
          "It is $\\sqrt{2}$ times greater.",
          "It is 2 times greater.",
          "It is 4 times greater.",
          "It is the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $v_e \\propto \\sqrt{M}$, doubling the mass while keeping $r$ constant increases the escape velocity by a factor of $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the escape velocity from the surface of Mars ($M = 6.42 \\times 10^{23}$ kg, $R = 3.39 \\times 10^6$ m).",
        "options": [
          "5.03 km/s",
          "11.2 km/s",
          "2.38 km/s",
          "7.55 km/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$v_e = \\sqrt{2 \\times 6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 6.42 \\times 10^{23} / 3.39 \\times 10^6} \\approx 5027$ m/s or 5.03 km/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A rocket is at an altitude equal to the radius of the Earth ($h=R$). How does its escape velocity from this position compare to the escape velocity from the surface?",
        "options": [
          "It is $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of the surface escape velocity.",
          "It is $1/2$ of the surface escape velocity.",
          "It is the same as the surface escape velocity.",
          "It is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the surface escape velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At $h=R$, the distance from the center is $2R$. Since $v_e \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r}$, the velocity is $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of the surface value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it easier to launch a spacecraft into orbit from a high-altitude mountain than from sea level?",
        "options": [
          "The starting distance $r$ is larger, which slightly reduces the required escape velocity.",
          "There is more kinetic energy stored in the mountain.",
          "The value of $G$ is lower at high altitudes.",
          "The mountain's mass pulls the rocket upward."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Escape velocity depends inversely on the square root of the distance from the center. Increasing the starting height decreases the energy 'debt' needed to reach infinity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Planet X and Planet Y have the same mass, but Planet X is much denser (and therefore smaller). Which planet has a higher surface escape velocity?",
        "options": [
          "Planet X",
          "Planet Y",
          "They have the same escape velocity.",
          "It depends on the atmospheric pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A denser planet of the same mass has a smaller radius ($r$). Since $v_e = \\sqrt{2GM/r}$, a smaller $r$ in the denominator results in a higher escape velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the escape velocity ($v_e$) and the circular orbital velocity ($v_o$) at the same distance $r$?",
        "options": [
          "$v_e = \\sqrt{2} \\times v_o$",
          "$v_e = 2 \\times v_o$",
          "$v_e = v_o / \\sqrt{2}$",
          "$v_e = v_o^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$v_o = \\sqrt{GM/r}$ and $v_e = \\sqrt{2GM/r}$. Therefore, $v_e$ is always $\\sqrt{2}$ (about 1.41 times) greater than the speed needed for a circular orbit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object is launched with a velocity significantly higher than $v_e$, what happens to the 'excess' energy?",
        "options": [
          "It remains as kinetic energy when the object is at infinity.",
          "It is converted into gravitational potential energy at infinity.",
          "It is lost to heat due to the vacuum of space.",
          "The object is forced back into a highly elliptical orbit."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At infinity, $E_g = 0$. By conservation of energy, $E_{total, initial} = E_{k, final}$. The object will continue to move away forever with a constant 'hyperbolic excess speed'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which celestial body has the lowest escape velocity?",
        "options": [
          "An asteroid with a radius of 10 km.",
          "The Moon.",
          "Mars.",
          "Earth."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Escape velocity is a function of $\\sqrt{M/r}$. Small asteroids have very little mass compared to their radius, resulting in escape velocities often low enough to be achieved by a human jumping."
