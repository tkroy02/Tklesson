    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical uniform spheres of mass M are separated by a distance d. What is the magnitude of the gravitational field strength at the exact midpoint between the two spheres?",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "2GM/d²",
          "8GM/d²",
          "4GM/d²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the midpoint, the gravitational field vectors from each sphere are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net field of zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Planet X has twice the mass of Earth and twice the radius of Earth, how does the gravitational acceleration (gx) on its surface compare to Earth's surface gravity (g)?",
        "options": [
          "gx = 0.5g",
          "gx = g",
          "gx = 2g",
          "gx = 0.25g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using g = GM/r², we get G(2M)/(2R)² = 2GM/4R² = 0.5g."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Shell Theorem, if a person could stand at the center of a hollowed-out Earth (uniform shell), what would be their weight?",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Infinite",
          "The same as their weight on the surface",
          "Half of their surface weight"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inside a uniform spherical shell, the gravitational forces from all directions cancel out perfectly at every interior point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite orbits a planet at a constant speed. What provides the centripetal force required to keep the satellite in its circular path?",
        "options": [
          "The gravitational force between the satellite and the planet.",
          "The engine thrust of the satellite.",
          "The atmospheric pressure at high altitudes.",
          "The magnetic field of the planet."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity acts as the center-seeking force that changes the satellite's direction (velocity vector) without necessarily changing its speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following graphs correctly represents the relationship between gravitational force (Fg) and the distance between centers (r)?",
        "options": [
          "An inverse curve where Fg approaches zero as r increases.",
          "A straight line with a negative slope.",
          "A straight line with a positive slope.",
          "A horizontal line."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The relationship Fg ∝ 1/r² creates a curve (hyperbola-like) that drops sharply and asymptotically approaches the x-axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you move from the surface of a planet to a height equal to the planet's radius above the surface, how does the gravitational field strength change?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes one-fourth of the surface value.",
          "It becomes one-half of the surface value.",
          "It becomes zero.",
          "It doubles."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Height h = R means the total distance from the center is r = 2R. Since g ∝ 1/r², the field is 1/2² = 1/4 the surface value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two planets have the same radius, but Planet A is three times as dense as Planet B. How does the surface gravity of Planet A compare to Planet B?",
        "options": [
          "It is three times greater.",
          "It is nine times greater.",
          "It is the same.",
          "It is one-third as strong."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass = Density × Volume. If radius is constant, mass is proportional to density. Since g ∝ M, tripling the density triples the mass and thus the gravity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the formula F = Gm₁m₂/r², what does the 'r' represent?",
        "options": [
          "The distance between the centers of mass of the two objects.",
          "The distance between the surfaces of the two objects.",
          "The radius of the larger object.",
          "The average of the radii of the two objects."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newton's law applies to point masses; for uniform spheres, gravity acts as if all mass is concentrated at the geometric center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements about the Universal Gravitational Constant (G) is true?",
        "options": [
          "It is an extremely small number.",
          "It changes depending on which solar system you are in.",
          "It was first calculated by Isaac Newton.",
          "It is the same thing as the acceleration due to gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "G ≈ 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ is very small, which explains why gravity is only noticeable when at least one object has planetary mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the sun were replaced by a black hole of the exact same mass, what would happen to the Earth's orbit?",
        "options": [
          "The Earth's orbit would remain exactly the same.",
          "The Earth would be immediately sucked into the black hole.",
          "The Earth would fly off into space.",
          "The Earth's orbit would become much tighter and faster."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the mass of the central body and the distance remain the same, the gravitational force—and thus the orbital path—remains unchanged."
