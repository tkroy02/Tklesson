    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following represents the correct vector form of Coulomb's Law for the force exerted by $q_1$ on $q_2$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}\\hat{r}_{12}$",
          "$\\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^3}\\hat{r}_{12}$",
          "$\\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac{k|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$",
          "$\\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}\\hat{r}_{12}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The vector force is the scalar magnitude multiplied by a unit vector $\\hat{r}$ that defines the line of action between the two charges."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a displacement vector is $\\vec{r} = 3\\hat{i} + 4\\hat{j}$, what is the corresponding unit vector $\\hat{r}$ used in force calculations?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Magnitude is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$. The unit vector is $\\vec{r}/|r|$, which is $3/5\\hat{i} + 4/5\\hat{j}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a negative value for the product $q_1q_2$ imply about the force vector between two charges?",
        "options": [
          "The force is attractive.",
          "The force is repulsive.",
          "The force is zero.",
          "The force acts perpendicular to the displacement."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative product means the charges have opposite signs, resulting in an attractive force pointing toward the source charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two charges $q$ and $4q$ are separated by distance $r$. How does the magnitude of the force on $q$ compare to the magnitude of the force on $4q$?",
        "options": [
          "They are exactly equal.",
          "The force on $4q$ is four times larger.",
          "The force on $q$ is four times larger.",
          "The forces are unrelated."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law applies: the electrostatic interaction is a mutual force pair of equal magnitude and opposite direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The constant $k$ can be expressed as $1/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)$. What is the effect on the force if the permittivity of the medium increases?",
        "options": [
          "The force decreases.",
          "The force increases.",
          "The force remains constant.",
          "The force direction reverses."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Permittivity is in the denominator. A higher permittivity (like in water or oil) reduces the effective electrostatic force compared to a vacuum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When using the notation $\\vec{F} = \\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^3}\\vec{r}$, the denominator is cubed because:",
        "options": [
          "$\\vec{r}$ contains its own magnitude factor of $r$.",
          "Space is three-dimensional.",
          "Gravity interferes with the calculation.",
          "The inverse-square law is being violated."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\hat{r} = \\vec{r}/r$, substituting this into the $1/r^2$ formula mathematically results in $\\vec{r}/r^3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Three identical $+q$ charges are at the corners of an equilateral triangle. What is the direction of the net force on a $-Q$ charge at the center?",

          "Zero",
          "Toward the top vertex.",
          "Away from the center.",
          "Parallel to the base."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to the perfect 120-degree symmetry, the three force vectors of equal magnitude cancel out exactly at the geometric center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the distance between two charges is tripled, the magnitude of the electrostatic force becomes:",
        "options": [
          "1/9 of the original.",
          "1/3 of the original.",
          "3 times the original.",
          "9 times the original."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Coulomb's Law is an inverse-square law ($1/r^2$). Tripling the distance ($3r$) results in a factor of $1/3^2 = 1/9$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Scalar sum",
          "Algebraic product",
          "Arithmetic average"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because forces are vectors, you must add their components (i and j) independently, not just their magnitudes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A charge $+q$ is at $(0,d)$ and $-q$ is at $(0,-d)$. What is the direction of the force on a $+Q$ charge at $(x,0)$?",
        "options": [
          "Purely in the $-y$ direction.",

          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The horizontal (x) components cancel out due to symmetry, while both vertical (y) components point downward toward the negative charge."
