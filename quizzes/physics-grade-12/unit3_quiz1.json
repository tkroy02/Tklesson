    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a required condition for an object to be in Simple Harmonic Motion?",
        "options": [
          "The acceleration must be constant.",
          "The restoring force must be proportional to the displacement.",
          "The velocity must be proportional to the displacement.",
          "The frequency must increase as the amplitude increases."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$) defines SHM: the restoring force is directly proportional and opposite to displacement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In SHM, at which point in the oscillation is the magnitude of the object's acceleration at its maximum?",
        "options": [
          "At the equilibrium position.",
          "At the points of maximum displacement (amplitude).",
          "At the points where kinetic energy equals potential energy.",
          "Acceleration is constant throughout the motion."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is given by $a = -\\omega^2 x$, so it reaches maximum magnitude when displacement $x$ is maximum (at the amplitude)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass-spring system oscillates with a period $T$. If the mass is quadrupled, what is the new period?",
        "options": [
          "$T/2$",
          "$T$",
          "$2T$",
          "$4T$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Period $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k}$. Quadrupling mass ($m \\to 4m$) gives new period $T' = 2\\pi\\sqrt{4m/k} = 2T$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the total mechanical energy of an undamped SHM system if the amplitude of oscillation is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "It remains the same.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It quadruples.",
          "It increases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total energy $E_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$ is proportional to the square of amplitude. Doubling amplitude ($A \\to 2A$) gives $E' = \\frac{1}{2}k(2A)^2 = 4E$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the equilibrium position ($x=0$) of a horizontal mass-spring oscillator:",
        "options": [
          "Kinetic energy is zero and potential energy is maximum.",
          "Kinetic energy is maximum and potential energy is zero.",
          "Both kinetic and potential energy are zero.",
          "Both kinetic and potential energy are at their maximum."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, spring potential energy ($\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$) is zero (since $x=0$), and kinetic energy is maximum because velocity is maximum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The phase constant $\\phi$ in the equation $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$ primarily determines:",
        "options": [
          "The frequency of the oscillation.",
          "The maximum velocity of the object.",
          "The starting position of the object at $t=0$.",
          "The rate at which energy is dissipated."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At $t=0$, the equation becomes $x(0) = A\\cos(\\phi)$. Thus, $\\phi$ sets the initial position of the oscillation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following graphs correctly represents the relationship between the restoring force ($F$) and displacement ($x$) for an ideal SHM system?",
        "options": [
          "A horizontal line.",
          "A parabola opening upward.",
          "A straight line with a negative slope passing through the origin.",
          "A sine wave."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For SHM, $F = -kx$, which graphs as a straight line through the origin with negative slope $-k$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a simple pendulum is moved from the Earth to the Moon (where gravity is weaker), its period of oscillation will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase.",
          "Decrease.",
          "Stay the same.",
          "Become zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period of a simple pendulum is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$. Weaker gravity (smaller $g$) results in a larger period."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The frequency of an oscillator is $5\\text{ Hz}$. What is the angular frequency ($\\omega$)?",
        "options": [
          "$5\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$10\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$2.5\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$0.2\\text{ rad/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi \\times 5 = 10\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an object in SHM, the velocity vector and the displacement vector are:",
        "options": [
          "Always in the same direction.",
          "Always in opposite directions.",
          "$\\pi/2$ ($90^\\circ$) out of phase.",
          "$\\pi$ ($180^\\circ$) out of phase."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Velocity is the derivative of displacement: if $x = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, then $v = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. The sine function is $\\pi/2$ out of phase with the cosine function."

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) The defining condition of SHM ($F = -kx$), 2) Energy transformation during oscillation, 3) How mass, spring constant, and gravity affect the period, 4) The meaning of phase constant.",
