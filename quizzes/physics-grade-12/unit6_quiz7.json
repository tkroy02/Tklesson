    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct formula for Inductive Reactance?",
        "options": [
          "$X_L = \\frac{1}{2\\pi fL}$",
          "$X_L = 2\\pi fL$",
          "$X_L = \\frac{2\\pi L}{f}$",
          "$X_L = \\frac{f}{2\\pi L}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inductive reactance: $X_L = 2\\pi fL$, where $f$ is frequency (Hz) and $L$ is inductance (H). Derived from inductor impedance: $Z_L = j\\omega L$ where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of the AC source increases, what happens to the inductive reactance?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It increases.",
          "It drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_L = 2\\pi fL$ is directly proportional to frequency $f$. Doubling frequency doubles $X_L$. Inductors oppose high-frequency signals more than low-frequency ones."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a purely inductive circuit, what is the phase relationship between voltage ($V$) and current ($I$)?",
        "options": [
          "Current leads voltage by $90^\\circ$.",
          "Voltage leads current by $90^\\circ$.",
          "They are perfectly in phase.",
          "Voltage leads current by $180^\\circ$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inductors oppose current changes: $V_L = L(di/dt)$. For sinusoidal AC, this causes voltage to lead current by 90°. Mnemonic: ELI (Voltage/Emf leads Current in Inductor)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an ideal inductor behave in a steady DC circuit (after the initial setup)?",
        "options": [
          "As an infinite resistance (open circuit).",
          "As a perfect insulator.",
          "As a short circuit (zero reactance).",
          "As a constant current source."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "DC = zero frequency → $X_L = 2\\pi × 0 × L = 0\\ \\Omega$. Once DC current stabilizes (no change), inductor acts as short circuit (wire). Only resistance of wire remains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the unit of Inductive Reactance?",
        "options": [
          "Henry (H)",
          "Farad (F)",
          "Ohm ($\\Omega$)",
          "Weber (Wb)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inductive reactance $X_L$, like capacitive reactance and resistance, is measured in ohms ($\\Omega$). $[X_L] = [2\\pi fL] = [\\text{s}^{-1}] × [\\text{V·s/A}] = [\\text{V/A}] = [\\Omega]$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors would increase the reactance of a coil?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing the number of turns in the coil.",
          "Removing the iron core from the coil.",
          "Increasing the frequency of the AC signal.",
          "Using a thicker wire for the coil."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_L = 2\\pi fL$. Increasing $f$ directly increases $X_L$. Decreasing turns or removing iron core decreases $L$, thus decreasing $X_L$. Wire thickness affects resistance, not reactance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does an inductor oppose AC more than DC?",
        "options": [
          "Because the wire is longer in an inductor.",
          "Because the changing current creates a changing magnetic field, which induces a \"back-EMF.\"",
          "Because the electrons collide with the iron core.",
          "Because the inductor acts as a capacitor at high frequencies."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Faraday's Law: changing current → changing magnetic flux → induced EMF opposing change ($V_L = -L(di/dt)$). AC continuously changes, creating continuous opposition; DC (steady) has $di/dt = 0$ after initial transient."
      },

        "question": "If an inductor has a reactance of $50\\ \\Omega$ at $60\\ \\text{Hz}$, what will its reactance be at $120\\ \\text{Hz}$?",
        "options": [
          "$25\\ \\Omega$",
          "$50\\ \\Omega$",
          "$100\\ \\Omega$",
          "$200\\ \\Omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_L \\propto f$. Doubling frequency from 60 Hz to 120 Hz doubles reactance: $X_L(120\\ \\text{Hz}) = 50 × (120/60) = 100\\ \\Omega$. Assuming constant inductance $L$."

        "question": "In an AC circuit containing only an inductor, the average power dissipated is:",
        "options": [
          "$V \\times I$",
          "$I^2 R$",
          "Zero",
          "$1/2 LI^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average power $P_{avg} = V_{rms}I_{rms}\\cos\\phi$, where $\\phi = 90^\\circ$ for pure inductor ($\\cos 90^\\circ = 0$). Energy is stored in magnetic field and returned to source each cycle."

          "$157\\ \\Omega$",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_L = 2\\pi fL = 2 × 3.14 × 50 × 0.5 = 157\\ \\Omega$.\nExact: $X_L = 2\\pi × 50 × 0.5 = 50\\pi \\approx 157.1\\ \\Omega$.\nAt 60 Hz: $X_L = 2\\pi × 60 × 0.5 = 60\\pi \\approx 188.5\\ \\Omega$."
