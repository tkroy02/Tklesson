    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As an electric motor spins, it also acts like a generator, creating a voltage that opposes the input voltage. This is called:",
        "options": [
          "Forward EMF.",
          "Back EMF.",
          "Eddy current.",
          "Self-inductance."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Back EMF (counter-electromotive force) is induced as the motor's armature coils rotate through the magnetic field. By Lenz's Law, it opposes the applied voltage, limiting current and preventing infinite acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a motor is physically prevented from turning while the power is on (stalled), what happens to the current?",
        "options": [
          "It drops to zero.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It increases significantly, potentially burning out the motor.",
          "It becomes AC instead of DC."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With no rotation, no back EMF is generated. The full source voltage appears across the coil resistance, causing dangerously high current $I = V/R$, which can overheat and damage the motor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a DC motor, the \"split-ring commutator\" is essential because it:",
        "options": [
          "Increases the resistance.",
          "Reverses the current every half-cycle to maintain continuous rotation in one direction.",
          "Protects the user from electric shock.",
          "Slows down the motor."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The commutator reverses current direction in the armature coil each half-rotation, ensuring the magnetic torque always acts in the same rotational direction rather than causing oscillation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The torque produced by a motor is maximum when the plane of the coil is:",
        "options": [
          "Parallel to the magnetic field.",
          "Perpendicular to the magnetic field.",
          "At a 45° angle.",
          "Torque is always constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maximum torque occurs when the coil sides are perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, which happens when the coil plane is parallel to the field. At this orientation, $\\tau = NIAB$ (for N turns)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an application of electromagnetic energy conversion?",
        "options": [
          "Regenerative braking in electric cars.",
          "Hydroelectric dams.",
          "Wind turbines.",
          "All of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "All involve conversion between mechanical and electrical energy via electromagnetic induction: regenerative braking (kinetic → electrical), hydroelectric (gravitational → electrical), wind turbines (wind → electrical)."

        "70": "Very good! Solid grasp of motor/generator fundamentals. Review the relationship between back EMF and motor speed, and how commutators enable continuous DC motor rotation.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) The concept of back EMF and its effect on motor current, 2) The purpose of the split-ring commutator, 3) Conditions for maximum torque, 4) Real-world applications of electromagnetic energy conversion.",
        "0": "Start with the fundamentals: Review how motors use magnetic forces to produce rotation, how generators use motion to produce electricity, and the relationship between these two complementary devices."
