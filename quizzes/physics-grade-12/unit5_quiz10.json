    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A transformer works on the principle of:",
        "options": [
          "Self-induction",
          "Mutual induction",
          "Electrostatic attraction",
          "The Photoelectric effect"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transformers use mutual induction: a changing current in the primary coil creates a changing magnetic flux in the core, which induces a voltage in the secondary coil via Faraday's Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transformers can only operate with:",
        "options": [
          "Direct Current (DC)",
          "Alternating Current (AC)",
          "Both AC and DC",
          "High-voltage batteries"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transformers require a changing magnetic flux to induce voltage. AC provides continuous change, while DC creates a constant field ($d\\Phi/dt = 0$) once steady state is reached, producing no induced EMF."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a \"Step-Up\" transformer, which of the following occurs?",
        "options": [
          "Voltage increases and current increases.",
          "Voltage increases and current decreases.",
          "Voltage decreases and current increases.",
          "Total power is increased."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For ideal transformers: $V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p$ and $I_s/I_p = N_p/N_s$. Step-up means $N_s > N_p$, so $V_s > V_p$ and $I_s < I_p$. Power conservation: $P_p = P_s$ (ignoring losses)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is electricity transmitted over long distances at very high voltages?",
        "options": [
          "To make the electrons travel faster.",
          "To reduce power loss due to heat in the wires ($P_{loss} = I^2R$).",
          "Because high voltage is safer for the environment.",
          "To prevent birds from sitting on the wires."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transmission loss $P_{loss} = I^2R$. For constant power $P = VI$, increasing $V$ decreases $I$, dramatically reducing $I^2R$ losses. High voltage allows efficient long-distance power transmission."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A transformer has 100 turns in the primary and 500 in the secondary. If the input voltage is 120 V, what is the output?",
        "options": [
          "24 V",
          "120 V",
          "600 V",
          "1200 V"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using transformer equation: $\\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \\frac{N_s}{N_p}$. $\\frac{V_s}{120} = \\frac{500}{100} = 5$. Therefore $V_s = 5 \\times 120 = 600\\text{ V}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an ideal transformer (100% efficiency), the power in the primary coil ($P_p$) is:",
        "options": [
          "Greater than the power in the secondary ($P_s$).",
          "Less than the power in the secondary ($P_s$).",
          "Exactly equal to the power in the secondary ($P_s$).",
          "Proportional to the number of turns."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ideal transformers conserve energy: $P_p = P_s$ or $V_p I_p = V_s I_s$. Real transformers have <100% efficiency due to core losses, copper losses, and flux leakage."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a major cause of energy loss in a real-world transformer?",
        "options": [
          "Magnetic flux leakage.",
          "Eddy currents in the iron core.",
          "Resistance (Joule heating) in the copper coils.",
          "All of the above."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Real transformer losses include: (1) Copper losses ($I^2R$ heating in windings), (2) Core losses (eddy currents and hysteresis in iron), (3) Flux leakage (magnetic field not linking both coils)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To minimize energy loss due to eddy currents, the iron core of a transformer is usually:",
        "options": [
          "Made of a single solid block of iron.",
          "Laminated (made of thin, insulated sheets).",
          "Painted with conductive silver paint.",
          "Hollowed out to reduce mass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Laminated cores use thin sheets insulated from each other. This increases resistance to circulating eddy currents, reducing $I^2R$ heating losses while maintaining good magnetic permeability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A transformer has $V_p = 240\\text{ V}$ and $V_s = 12\\text{ V}$. If the secondary current is $2\\text{ A}$, what is the primary current (if ideal)?",
        "options": [
          "0.1 A",
          "40 A",
          "0.05 A",
          "10 A"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Power conservation: $V_p I_p = V_s I_s$. $240 \\times I_p = 12 \\times 2 = 24$. $I_p = 24/240 = 0.1\\text{ A}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The low-frequency \"hum\" heard near large transformers is primarily caused by:",
        "options": [
          "Electrons hitting the air.",
          "Magnetostriction (core expansion/contraction).",
          "The movement of the cooling fan.",
          "Arcing between the high-voltage coils."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Magnetostriction: the iron core physically expands and contracts slightly with the alternating magnetic field at twice the AC frequency (120 Hz for 60 Hz AC). This mechanical vibration produces the characteristic hum."
