      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle is executing SHM. When its displacement is half of its amplitude ($x = A/2$), what is the ratio of its kinetic energy to its total energy?",
        "options": [
          "1:2",
          "1:4",
          "3:4",
          "2:3"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At $x = A/2$, potential energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(A/2)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{4}E_{total}$. Since $K + U = E$, kinetic energy $K = E - \\frac{1}{4}E = \\frac{3}{4}E$, giving ratio $K:E = 3:4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two springs of force constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ are connected in series. What is the effective spring constant ($k_{eq}$) of the system?",
        "options": [
          "$k_1 + k_2$",
          "$\\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}$",
          "$\\sqrt{k_1 k_2}$",
          "$\\frac{k_1 + k_2}{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For springs in series, the effective spring constant is given by $\\frac{1}{k_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\frac{1}{k_2}$, which rearranges to $k_{eq} = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the phase difference between the instantaneous velocity and acceleration of a particle executing SHM?",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "$\\pi/2$ rad ($90^\\circ$)",
          "$\\pi$ rad ($180^\\circ$)",
          "$3\\pi/2$ rad ($270^\\circ$)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If displacement $x = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, then velocity $v = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$ and acceleration $a = -A\\omega^2\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) = -\\omega^2 x$. The sine and cosine functions are $\\pi/2$ out of phase."

          "4",
          "$\\sqrt{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gravity at Earth's surface: $g_1 = GM/R^2$. At height $R$: $g_2 = GM/(2R)^2 = g_1/4$. Since $T \\propto 1/\\sqrt{g}$, $T_2/T_1 = \\sqrt{g_1/g_2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "7 units"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The expression can be rewritten as a single sine/cosine function: $x = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} \\sin(2t + \\delta) = 5\\sin(2t + \\delta)$, where $\\delta = \\tan^{-1}(4/3)$. The amplitude is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$ units."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the length of a simple pendulum is increased by $44\\%$, what is the percentage increase in its time period?",

          "$20\\%$",
          "$22\\%$",
          "$44\\%$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Period $T \\propto \\sqrt{L}$. New length $L' = 1.44L$, so new period $T' = \\sqrt{1.44} \\times T = 1.2T$. Percentage increase = $\\frac{1.2T - T}{T} \\times 100\\% = 20\\%$."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $a = -\\omega^2 x$, acceleration is directly proportional to displacement. At equilibrium position ($x=0$), acceleration is zero. Velocity is maximum at this point."

        "options": [
          "$f/2$",
          "$2f$",
          "$f/4$",
          "$4f$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Frequency $f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{k/m}$. Quadrupling mass gives $f' = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{k/(4m)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{k/m} = f/2$."

        "explanation": "The SHM relation $a = -\\omega^2 x$ represents a linear equation of the form $y = mx$ with $m = -\\omega^2 < 0$, yielding a straight line through the origin with negative slope."
