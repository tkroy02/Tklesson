      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1,500,000 kg railcar fires a 150 kg shell at 256 m/s at an angle of 33° above the horizontal. Calculate the horizontal recoil speed of the railcar.",
        "options": [
          "0.021 m/s",
          "0.025 m/s",
          "3.24 m/s",
          "0.014 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conserve horizontal momentum ($p_x$): $0 = Mv_{car} + m(v_{shell} \\cos 33^\\circ)$. $v_{car} = (150 \\times 256 \\times \\cos 33^\\circ) / 1,500,000 \\approx 0.0215$ m/s."

        "question": "A 2.3 kg ball moving East hits a stationary 4.5 kg ball. After the collision, the 4.5 kg ball moves at 2.87 m/s at 21° North of East and the 2.3 kg ball moves South of East. What is the mathematical requirement for the initial velocity of the 2.3 kg ball?",
        "image": "images/12grademom1.png",
        "options": [
          "It must equal the sum of the final x-momentum components divided by 2.3 kg.",
          "It must equal the magnitude of the 4.5 kg ball's final momentum.",
          "It is determined solely by the final North-South velocity components.",
          "It is calculated using only the sine components of the final velocities."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since initial momentum was purely Eastward, $m_1v_{1i} = m_1v_{1f,x} + m_2v_{2f,x}$. Dividing by $m_1$ yields the initial velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object with initial momentum $\\vec{p}_i$ is hit with an impulse $\\vec{J}$ at an angle. Which mathematical approach is required to find the magnitude of the final momentum $\\vec{p}_f$?",
        "options": [
          "Vector component addition or the Law of Cosines.",
          "Scalar addition of the magnitudes $|p_i| + |J|$.",
          "Dividing the impulse by the time of contact.",
          "Multiplying the initial momentum by the sine of the impulse angle."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Momentum and Impulse are vectors. $\\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_i + \\vec{J}$ requires vector addition rules, not simple arithmetic."

        "question": "A 3.7 kg steel ball traveling at 4.5 m/s East collides with a stationary 8.4 kg aluminum ball. The steel ball rebounds at 1.4 m/s at 34° South of East. What is the magnitude of the velocity of the aluminum ball?",

          "2.05 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Al x-momentum: $16.65 - (3.7 \\times 1.4 \\cos 34^\\circ) = 12.36$. Al y-momentum: $2.89$. Total Al momentum: $\\sqrt{12.36^2 + 2.89^2} = 12.69$. $v = 12.69 / 8.4 = 1.51$ m/s."

          "21.5° North of East"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The y-component of the 8.4 kg ball must be North to cancel the steel ball's Southward momentum. $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2.89 / 12.36) = 13.2^\circ$."

          "East of North",
          "Due North",
          "West of South"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initial East-West momentum was zero. If car 1 moves East, car 2 must move West. Since there is still total Northward momentum, the resultant must be West of North."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object receives an impulse of 12 N·s due East. As a result, its final momentum is 42 kg·m/s at 43° North of East. What was the magnitude of the object's momentum before the impulse?",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When firing a projectile from a mobile platform (like a railcar), why is horizontal momentum conserved for the car's recoil while vertical momentum is often ignored?",
        "options": [
          "Vertical impulse is countered by an external normal force from the ground.",
          "Vertical momentum is not a vector quantity.",
          "The platform's mass increases when firing vertically.",
          "The horizontal tracks eliminate the effect of gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ground acts as an external agent providing a normal force. This prevents vertical recoil motion, whereas horizontal motion on tracks is (relatively) unconstrained."
