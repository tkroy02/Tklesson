        "question": "Regarding the Railcar Cannon problem: A 1,500,000 kg car fires a 150 kg shell at 256 m/s at 33° above the horizontal. What is the recoil speed of the railcar?",
        "options": [
          "0.021 m/s",
          "0.025 m/s",
          "3.24 m/s",
          "0.014 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Conserve horizontal momentum ($p_x$): $0 = Mv_{car} + m(v_{shell} \\cos 33^\\circ)$. Thus, $v_{car} = (150 \\times 256 \\times \\cos 33^\\circ) / 1,500,000 \\approx 0.0215$ m/s."

        "question": "In the image provided, a 2.3 kg ball hits a stationary 4.5 kg ball. After the collision, the 4.5 kg ball moves at 2.87 m/s at 21° North of East. What must be true about the initial velocity of the 2.3 kg ball?",
        "image": "images/12grademom1.png",
        "options": [
          "It is the sum of the final x-components divided by the mass 2.3 kg.",
          "It is equal to the total momentum of the 4.5 kg ball.",
          "It is determined solely by the y-component of the 2.3 kg ball's final motion.",
          "It is zero because momentum is only created during impact."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the 2.3 kg ball was moving horizontally (East), the total initial momentum ($m_1v_1$) must equal the sum of the final x-components ($m_1v_{1x}' + m_2v_{2x}'$)."

        "question": "When an object is hit by an impulse J at an angle to its original motion, the magnitude of the final momentum is found by:",
        "options": [
          "The law of cosines or vector component addition.",
          "Adding the magnitudes |p| + |J|.",
          "Subtracting the work done from the kinetic energy.",
          "Dividing the impulse by the time of contact."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_i + \\vec{J}$, vector addition rules apply. For non-parallel vectors, components or the law of cosines must be used."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Final $p_x$ of Al = $16.65 - (3.7 \\times 1.4 \\cos 34^\\circ) = 12.36$. Final $p_y$ of Al = $2.89$. Resultant $p = \\sqrt{12.36^2 + 2.89^2} = 12.69$. Velocity $v = 12.69 / 8.4 = 1.51$ m/s."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using components: $p_{Al,x} = 12.36$ and $p_{Al,y} = 2.89$ (North). $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(2.89 / 12.36) = 13.2^\circ$ North of East."

        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "External forces from the tracks and ground prevent vertical recoil.",
          "Vertical momentum is not conserved in projectile systems.",

          "The launching force only acts horizontally."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The car is constrained by tracks. The vertical impulse from the cannon is balanced by the upward normal force from the ground, so the car only moves horizontally."
