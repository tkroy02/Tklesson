      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What was Bohr's primary 'postulate' regarding the motion of electrons?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons move in random paths around the nucleus.",
          "Electrons can only exist in specific, discrete orbits where they do not radiate energy.",
          "Electrons are embedded in a positive 'soup.'",
          "Electrons move in straight lines until they hit the nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bohr's postulates (1913): 1) Electrons orbit in stationary states without radiation, 2) Angular momentum quantized: $L = n\\hbar$, 3) Radiation emitted/absorbed during transitions: $hf = E_i - E_f$. Solved Rutherford's stability problem."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an electron jumps from a higher energy level ($n=3$) to a lower energy level ($n=2$), the atom:",
        "options": [
          "Absorbs a photon.",
          "Emits a photon.",
          "Becomes a different element.",
          "Loses its nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Emission: electron drops to lower level → releases photon with $E = E_3 - E_2$. Example: Hα line (red, 656 nm) from $n=3→2$. Absorption: electron jumps up by absorbing photon of matching energy."

          "Dependent on the intensity of light hitting the atom."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular momentum quantization: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$, where $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi) = 1.055\\times 10^{-34}\\ \\text{J·s}$. $n = 1,2,3,...$ (principal quantum number). Ground state ($n=1$): $L = \\hbar$, not zero."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ground state: $n=1$, most tightly bound, $E_1 = -13.6\\ \\text{eV}$ for hydrogen. Lowest possible energy. Excited states: $n>1$, higher energy. Ionized: $E \\geq 0$ ($n=\\infty$)."

          "Light travels in a straight line.",
          "Atoms are solid spheres."
        ],

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$E_n \\propto -1/n^2$ → spacing decreases as $n$ increases. $E_2 - E_1 = 10.2\\ \\text{eV}$, $E_3 - E_2 = 1.89\\ \\text{eV}$, $E_4 - E_3 = 0.66\\ \\text{eV}$. Converges to $E_\\infty = 0$ (ionization)."

          "Change a neutron into a proton."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Ionization energy = $|E_1| = 13.6\\ \\text{eV}$ for hydrogen (ground state). $E_\\infty - E_1 = 0 - (-13.6) = 13.6\\ \\text{eV}$. For excited states: $|E_n| = 13.6/n^2$ eV (less energy needed)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
