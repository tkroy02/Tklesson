    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary effect of damping on an oscillating system?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the frequency of oscillation.",
          "It causes the amplitude to decrease over time.",
          "It keeps the total mechanical energy constant.",
          "It increases the maximum velocity of the mass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Damping involves dissipative forces (friction, air resistance) that do work on the system, converting mechanical energy to thermal energy and causing amplitude to decay over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which type of damping does the system return to equilibrium in the shortest possible time without oscillating?",
        "options": [
          "Underdamping",
          "Overdamping",
          "Critical damping",
          "Zero damping"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Critical damping represents the boundary condition where the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating past it. This is optimal for many engineering applications."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system that continues to oscillate but with a gradually decreasing amplitude is described as:",
        "options": [
          "Underdamped",
          "Overdamped",
          "Critically damped",
          "Resonant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In underdamped systems, the damping force is small enough that the system still oscillates, but the amplitude decays exponentially over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the total mechanical energy of a damped oscillator?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant.",
          "It increases over time.",
          "It decreases exponentially over time.",
          "It oscillates between kinetic and potential energy indefinitely."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Due to work done against dissipative forces, mechanical energy is continuously converted to thermal energy, resulting in exponential decay of total energy: $E(t) = E_0 e^{-(b/m)t}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "'Overdamping' occurs when the dissipative forces are so strong that:",
        "options": [
          "The system oscillates faster than normal.",
          "The system takes a long time to return to equilibrium without oscillating.",
          "The amplitude increases indefinitely.",
          "The spring constant $k$ effectively becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In overdamped systems, the damping is so strong that the system returns to equilibrium very slowly without crossing it. The motion is non-oscillatory."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The envelope of the displacement-time graph for an underdamped oscillator follows which mathematical function?",
        "options": [
          "Linear decay ($y = -mx + b$)",
          "Exponential decay ($y = e^{-bt}$)",
          "Sinusoidal ($y = \\sin t$)",
          "Power law ($y = 1/x^2$)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The amplitude of an underdamped oscillator decays exponentially: $A(t) = A_0 e^{-(b/2m)t}$, so the envelope of the oscillation follows $\\pm A_0 e^{-(b/2m)t}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does light damping affect the period of an oscillation compared to an undamped system?",
        "options": [
          "It slightly increases the period.",
          "It slightly decreases the period.",
          "The period remains exactly the same.",
          "The period becomes infinite."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For light damping, the period $T_d = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - (b/2m)^2}}$ is slightly longer than the undamped period $T_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_0}$, where $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k/m}$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a practical application of critical damping?",
        "options": [
          "A clock pendulum.",
          "Shock absorbers in a vehicle.",
          "A child swinging on a swing.",
          "A guitar string vibrating."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Shock absorbers are designed for critical or near-critical damping to prevent prolonged bouncing after hitting a bump, allowing the vehicle to return to equilibrium quickly without oscillation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the damping constant $b$ is increased in an underdamped system, the rate of energy loss will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase.",
          "Decrease.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Oscillation frequency will increase."
        ],
        "explanation": "The energy decay rate is proportional to the damping constant. Increasing $b$ means more energy is dissipated per cycle, so the amplitude decays faster.",
        "answer": "A"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a displacement-time graph for an overdamped system, the curve:",
        "options": [
          "Crosses the equilibrium axis multiple times.",
          "Never crosses the equilibrium axis after the initial release.",
          "Is a perfect horizontal line.",
          "Increases toward a maximum value."
        ],
        "explanation": "Overdamped systems do not oscillate; they approach equilibrium asymptotically without crossing it. If released from a displacement, they slowly return to zero without overshooting.",
        "answer": "B"
