    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transformers operate based on which physical principle?",
        "options": [
          "Electrostatic discharge",
          "Mutual induction",
          "Thermionic emission",
          "The Photoelectric effect"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transformers use mutual induction: changing current in primary coil creates changing magnetic flux in core, which induces voltage in secondary coil via Faraday's Law ($\\varepsilon = -d\\Phi/dt$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following will happen if a transformer is connected to a steady DC source?",
        "options": [
          "The output voltage will be doubled.",
          "The output voltage will be zero.",
          "The transformer will explode.",
          "The output voltage will be the same as the input."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transformers require changing magnetic flux ($d\\Phi/dt \\neq 0$). Steady DC produces constant flux ($d\\Phi/dt = 0$), inducing zero voltage in secondary. Only transient during switch-on/off produces brief output."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a \"Step-Up\" transformer, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "$N_{secondary} < N_{primary}$",
          "$V_{secondary} > V_{primary}$",
          "$I_{secondary} > I_{primary}$",
          "Power is increased."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Step-up: $N_s > N_p$, so $V_s > V_p$ (voltage increases). By power conservation ($P_p = P_s$), current decreases: $I_s = I_p × (N_p/N_s)$. Power is transferred, not increased."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the transformer equation, the ratio of voltages is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "The ratio of the resistances of the coils.",
          "The inverse ratio of the number of turns.",
          "The ratio of the number of turns ($\\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \\frac{N_s}{N_p}$).",
          "The square of the current ratio."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ideal transformer equation: $\\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \\frac{N_s}{N_p}$. Assumes perfect flux linkage (all primary flux links secondary). For real transformers: $\\frac{V_s}{V_p} \\approx \\frac{N_s}{N_p}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an ideal transformer (100% efficient), the relationship between power in the primary and secondary is:",
        "options": [
          "$P_{primary} > P_{secondary}$",
          "$P_{primary} < P_{secondary}$",
          "$P_{primary} = P_{secondary}$",
          "Power is doubled."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Energy conservation: $P_p = P_s$ or $V_p I_p = V_s I_s$. Real transformers have efficiency 95-99% due to losses (copper, core, flux leakage)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a transformer increases the voltage by a factor of 10, what happens to the current in the secondary coil?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of 10.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It decreases by a factor of 10.",
          "It decreases by a factor of 100."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From $P_p = P_s$: $V_p I_p = V_s I_s$. If $V_s = 10V_p$, then $I_s = I_p/10$. Step-up transformers step down current proportionally, and vice versa."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the core of a transformer usually \"laminated\" (made of thin sheets of iron)?",
        "options": [
          "To make the transformer lighter.",
          "To reduce energy loss due to eddy currents.",
          "To increase the magnetic field strength.",
          "To prevent the wires from touching the core."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Laminations (thin insulated sheets) increase electrical resistance perpendicular to flux, reducing circulating eddy currents. This minimizes $I^2R$ heating losses while maintaining high magnetic permeability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A transformer has 100 turns on the primary and 500 turns on the secondary. If the input voltage is 120V, what is the output voltage?",
        "options": [
          "24V",
          "120V",
          "600V",
          "1200V"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Using $\\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \\frac{N_s}{N_p}$: $V_s = 120 × (500/100) = 120 × 5 = 600\\text{ V}$.\nCurrent ratio: $I_s/I_p = N_p/N_s = 100/500 = 0.2$ (secondary current is 1/5 primary current)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of energy loss in a transformer is caused by the repeated reversal of the magnetic domains in the core?",
        "options": [
          "Copper loss (Resistance)",
          "Hysteresis loss",
          "Eddy current loss",
          "Flux leakage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Hysteresis loss: energy required to realign magnetic domains each AC cycle. Depends on core material; minimized using soft magnetic materials with narrow hysteresis loops."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At a power plant, transformers are used to step up voltage to extremely high levels for long-distance transmission primarily to:",
        "options": [
          "Increase the speed of electricity.",
          "Minimize $I^2 R$ power loss in the wires.",
          "Make the electricity safer for birds on the wires.",
          "Change the frequency from 60 Hz to 1000 Hz."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transmission loss $P_{loss} = I^2R$. For constant power $P = VI$, increasing $V$ decreases $I$, dramatically reducing $I^2R$ losses. Example: 10× voltage → 100× lower losses."
