    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a phasor diagram, in which direction do the phasors traditionally rotate?",
        "options": [
          "Clockwise",
          "Counter-clockwise",
          "They do not rotate; they are stationary",
          "Vertically only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Phasors rotate counter-clockwise at angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. This convention comes from the mathematical representation using complex numbers where positive angles are counter-clockwise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The length of a phasor vector represents which value of the AC quantity?",
        "options": [
          "The RMS value",
          "The average value",
          "The peak (amplitude) value",
          "The instantaneous value at $t=0$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Phasor length represents peak amplitude. For voltage: length = $V_{peak}$; for current: length = $I_{peak}$. RMS values are $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of peak values for sinusoidal waves."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the current phasor is at $0^\\circ$ (horizontal) and the voltage phasor is at $90^\\circ$ (pointing up), the circuit is:",
        "options": [
          "Purely resistive",
          "Purely capacitive",
          "Purely inductive",
          "A DC circuit"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Voltage at $+90^\\circ$ relative to current means voltage leads current by $90^\\circ$. This is characteristic of pure inductor (ELI: Voltage leads Current)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a phasor diagram for a purely resistive circuit, what is the angle between the voltage and current phasors?",
        "options": [
          "$0^\\circ$",
          "$90^\\circ$",
          "$180^\\circ$",
          "$270^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Resistors: voltage and current are in phase ($\\phi = 0^\\circ$). Both phasors point in same direction, rotating together. They align on same angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a purely capacitive circuit, if the current phasor is drawn at $0^\\circ$, where is the voltage phasor?",
        "options": [
          "$90^\\circ$ (pointing up)",
          "$180^\\circ$ (pointing left)",
          "$270^\\circ$ or $-90^\\circ$ (pointing down)",
          "$0^\\circ$ (horizontal)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Capacitors: current leads voltage by $90^\\circ$. If current at $0^\\circ$, voltage lags at $-90^\\circ$ ($270^\\circ$). Mnemonic: ICE (Current leads EMF)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When combining phasors in a series RLC circuit, which quantity is used as the reference phasor (drawn at $0^\\circ$) because it is the same for all components?",
        "options": [
          "Total Voltage ($V_T$)",
          "Resistance ($R$)",
          "Current ($I$)",
          "Frequency ($f$)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In series circuits, current is common to all components. Current phasor is typically reference ($0^\\circ$). Voltage phasors for R, L, C are then drawn relative to current."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a series RLC phasor diagram, the voltage phasors for the inductor ($V_L$) and the capacitor ($V_C$) are separated by how many degrees?",
        "options": [
          "$0^\\circ$",
          "$45^\\circ$",
          "$90^\\circ$",
          "$180^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$V_L$ leads current by $90^\\circ$ (up), $V_C$ lags current by $90^\\circ$ (down). Relative angle between $V_L$ and $V_C$ is $180^\\circ$. They oppose each other, allowing cancellation at resonance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To find the total source voltage ($V_S$) in a series RLC circuit phasor diagram, you must use:",
        "options": [
          "Simple algebraic addition ($V_R + V_L + V_C$)",
          "Vector addition (Pythagorean theorem)",
          "The average of all voltages",
          "The highest individual voltage"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Voltages are out of phase; cannot add algebraically. Phasor addition: $V_S = \\sqrt{V_R^2 + (V_L - V_C)^2}$. Graphically: place $V_L$ and $V_C$ head-to-tail (accounting for 180° phase), then add $V_R$ at right angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the voltage phasor for an inductor is longer than the voltage phasor for a capacitor in a series circuit, the circuit is said to be:",
        "options": [
          "Resonant",
          "Inductive",
          "Capacitive",
          "Purely resistive"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$|V_L| > |V_C|$ implies $X_L > X_C$, meaning net inductive reactance. Phase angle $\\phi > 0$ (voltage leads current). Opposite would be capacitive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the vertical projection (y-axis component) of a rotating phasor represent?",
        "options": [
          "The RMS value",
          "The instantaneous value",
          "The power factor",
          "The impedance"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For phasor $A\\angle\\theta$ rotating at $\\omega$: $A\\sin(\\omega t + \\theta)$. Vertical projection gives instantaneous value at time $t$. Horizontal projection would give cosine component."
