    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Einstein's photon theory, the energy of an individual photon is determined solely by its:",
        "options": [
          "Intensity",
          "Amplitude",
          "Frequency",
          "Velocity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Energy is given by $E = hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is frequency. This is fundamental to the particle nature of light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The minimum energy required to liberate an electron from the surface of a metal is known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Threshold Frequency",
          "Work Function ($\\Phi$)",
          "Stopping Potential",
          "Kinetic Energy"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work function ($\\Phi$) is the metal-specific minimum energy needed to eject an electron. Threshold frequency $f_0$ is related by $\\Phi = hf_0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of incident light is increased while keeping the intensity constant, what happens to the emitted photoelectrons?",
        "options": [
          "More electrons are emitted per second.",
          "The maximum kinetic energy of the electrons increases.",
          "The speed of the electrons decreases.",
          "No change occurs."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $K_{max} = hf - \\Phi$, kinetic energy depends on frequency, not intensity. Intensity affects number of electrons, not their individual energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Increasing the intensity (brightness) of the light source above the threshold frequency results in:",
        "options": [
          "Faster moving electrons.",
          "A higher number of electrons emitted per second (higher current).",
          "Electrons with more energy.",
          "A change in the work function of the metal."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Intensity = photons per second. More photons → more electron ejections → higher photocurrent. Individual electron energy depends only on frequency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What occurs if the incident light frequency is below the threshold frequency ($f_0$)?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons are emitted very slowly.",
          "Electrons are emitted only if the light is very bright.",
          "No electrons are emitted at all.",
          "The metal becomes positively charged without losing electrons."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If $f < f_0$, then $hf < \\Phi$. Each photon has insufficient energy to overcome work function, regardless of intensity or exposure time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following equations correctly represents the conservation of energy in the photoelectric effect?",
        "options": [
          "$hf = K_{max} + \\Phi$",
          "$K_{max} = hf + \\Phi$",
          "$\\Phi = hf + K_{max}$",
          "$hf = K_{max} - \\Phi$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Einstein's photoelectric equation: Photon energy ($hf$) = Maximum electron kinetic energy ($K_{max}$) + Work function ($\\Phi$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a graph of maximum kinetic energy ($K_{max}$) versus frequency ($f$), what does the x-intercept represent?",
        "options": [
          "Planck's constant",
          "The Work Function",
          "The Threshold Frequency ($f_0$)",
          "The Speed of Light"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At $K_{max} = 0$, $hf_0 = \\Phi$. The x-intercept is $f_0$, the minimum frequency needed for emission. Slope is $h$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The \"Stopping Potential\" ($V_s$) is the voltage required to reduce the photoelectric current to zero. It is a measure of:",
        "options": [
          "The total number of photons.",
          "The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons.",
          "The resistance of the metal.",
          "The intensity of the light wave."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$K_{max} = eV_s$, where $e$ is electron charge. Stopping potential directly measures the fastest electrons' kinetic energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why did the \"instantaneous\" emission of electrons surprise classical physicists?",
        "options": [
          "They expected a time lag for the wave's energy to accumulate on a single electron.",
          "They thought electrons were too heavy to move quickly.",
          "They believed light carried no energy.",
          "They expected electrons to be emitted only in the dark."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Classical wave theory predicted electrons would gradually absorb energy from the wave field. Instantaneous emission (<1 ns) supported the particle (photon) model."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the wavelength of light is halved, what happens to the energy of the photons?",
        "options": [
          "It is halved.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It quadruples."
        ],
        "explanation": "Since $E = hc/\\lambda$, energy is inversely proportional to wavelength. Halving wavelength doubles photon energy.",
        "answer": "C"
