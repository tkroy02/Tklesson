    "topic": "Magnetism and Electromagnetism",
    "duration": 25,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a charged particle enters a uniform magnetic field exactly perpendicular ($90^\\circ$) to the field lines, what is the shape of its trajectory?",
        "options": [
          "Linear",
          "Parabolic",
          "Circular",
          "Elliptical"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With $\\vec{v} \\perp \\vec{B}$, the magnetic force $F = qvB$ is constant in magnitude and always perpendicular to velocity, providing the centripetal force for uniform circular motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The radius of curvature ($r$) of a charged particle in a magnetic field is directly proportional to which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Magnetic field strength ($B$)",
          "The charge ($q$)",
          "The momentum ($mv$)",
          "The square of the velocity ($v^2$)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From $qvB = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$, we get $r = \\frac{mv}{qB}$. Thus $r \\propto mv$ (momentum) when $q$ and $B$ are constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A particle enters a magnetic field at an angle of $30^\\circ$. What type of path will it follow?",
        "options": [
          "A perfect circle",
          "A straight line",
          "A helix (spiral)",
          "It will come to a stop"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The velocity has components both parallel ($v_{\\parallel} = v\\cos30^\\circ$) and perpendicular ($v_{\\perp} = v\\sin30^\\circ$) to $\\vec{B}$. The perpendicular component causes circular motion, while the parallel component causes linear translation along the field, resulting in helical motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the kinetic energy of a proton as it moves through a uniform magnetic field?",
        "options": [
          "It increases linearly.",
          "It decreases as the particle curves.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It oscillates between maximum and minimum."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Magnetic force $\\vec{F} = q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$ is always perpendicular to velocity, so $\\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0$. No work is done, and by the work-energy theorem, kinetic energy remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the strength of the magnetic field is doubled, what happens to the radius of the particle's circular path?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It quadruples.",
          "It remains unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $r = \\frac{mv}{qB}$, radius is inversely proportional to $B$. Doubling $B$ halves the radius: $r' = \\frac{mv}{q(2B)} = \\frac{1}{2}r$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The time taken for a particle to complete one full revolution in a magnetic field (the cyclotron period) is independent of:",
        "options": [
          "The mass of the particle.",
          "The velocity of the particle.",
          "The magnetic field strength.",
          "The charge of the particle."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Period $T = \\frac{2\\pi m}{qB}$ depends on $m$, $q$, and $B$, but not on $v$. As $v$ increases, the radius increases proportionally, keeping the period constant. This is the principle behind cyclotrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A \"Bubble Chamber\" uses the trajectories of particles in a magnetic field to identify them. If two particles have the same $v$ and $B$, but curve in opposite directions, they must have:",
        "options": [
          "Different masses.",
          "Opposite charges.",
          "Different speeds.",
          "The same charge."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Force direction is given by $\\vec{F} = q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$. For the same $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{B}$, opposite curvatures indicate opposite signs of $q$, since the cross product changes direction with charge sign."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a cyclotron, what is the primary purpose of the magnetic field?",
        "options": [
          "To increase the speed of the particles.",
          "To keep the particles moving in a circular path.",
          "To provide the potential difference for acceleration.",
          "To cancel out gravity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The magnetic field provides the centripetal force to keep particles in circular orbits, while the alternating electric field between the dees accelerates them each time they cross the gap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which component of velocity is responsible for the \"pitch\" (distance between loops) of a helical path?",
        "options": [
          "The component perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$.",
          "The component parallel to $\\vec{B}$.",
          "The total resultant velocity.",
          "The angular velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Pitch $p = v_{\\parallel} \\times T$, where $v_{\\parallel}$ is the velocity component parallel to $\\vec{B}$ and $T$ is the cyclotron period. This is the distance advanced along the field per revolution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a particle's mass is doubled but all other factors remain constant, the frequency of its circular motion (cyclotron frequency) will:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Be halved.",
          "Stay the same.",
          "Increase by $\\sqrt{2}$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cyclotron frequency $f = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi m}$ is inversely proportional to mass. Doubling mass halves the frequency: $f' = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi (2m)} = \\frac{1}{2}f$."

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) The radius formula $r = mv/qB$, 2) Why kinetic energy is conserved, 3) How the period $T = 2\\pi m/qB$ is velocity-independent, 4) Helical motion from velocity components.",
