        "question": "Which of the following best defines gravitational field intensity at a point in space?",
        "options": [
          "The gravitational force per unit mass exerted on a small test mass at that point.",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point P is located at a distance r from a mass M. If the mass M is doubled and the distance r is doubled, what happens to the gravitational field intensity at P?",

          "It is reduced to half its original value.",
          "It remains the same.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using $\\sqrt{M_1}/x = \\sqrt{M_2}/(d-x)$, we get $\\sqrt{100}/x = \\sqrt{400}/(10-x) \\rightarrow 10/x = 20/(10-x) \\rightarrow 100 - 10x = 20x \\rightarrow 100 = 30x \\rightarrow x = 3.33$ m."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the direction of the gravitational field intensity vector at any point in space around a lone spherical mass?",

          "It has no direction as it is a scalar quantity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity is always attractive; therefore, the field lines and the resulting acceleration vector always point toward the center of the source mass."

        "question": "Calculate the gravitational field intensity on the surface of the Moon ($M = 7.35 \\times 10^{22}$ kg, $R = 1.74 \\times 10^6$ m).",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Total distance from center $r = R + 2R = 3R$. Since $g \\propto 1/r^2$, the field is $g/3^2 = g/9$."

          "It remains constant throughout the interior."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inside a uniform sphere, only the mass within the radius $r$ contributes to gravity. Mass $M \\propto r^3$ and $g \\propto M/r^2$, so $g \\propto r^3/r^2 = r$."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $g_A = g_B$, then $GM_A/R_A^2 = GM_B/R_B^2$. Substituting $M_A = 2M_B$ gives $2M_B/R_A^2 = M_B/R_B^2 \\rightarrow R_A^2 = 2R_B^2 \\rightarrow R_A = R_B\\sqrt{2}$."
