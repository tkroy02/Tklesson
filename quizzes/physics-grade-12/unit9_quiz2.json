      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following was the 'Surprising Result' of the Michelson-Morley experiment?",
        "options": [
          "They found the speed of the 'Aether wind.'",
          "The speed of light was different depending on the Earth's orbit.",
          "The speed of light was constant in all directions, regardless of the Earth's motion.",
          "Light cannot travel through a vacuum."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Michelson-Morley (1887): Expected ~30 km/s aether wind from Earth's orbit. Null result: light speed same in all directions. Disproved luminiferous aether. Key evidence for Einstein's constant $c$ postulate. Precision: $\\Delta v/c < 10^{-8}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Einstein’s First Postulate of Special Relativity states that:",
        "options": [
          "Light travels faster in a vacuum than in glass.",
          "The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.",
          "Gravity is a curvature of spacetime.",
          "Nothing can travel faster than $3.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First postulate (principle of relativity): All inertial frames equivalent for all physical laws. Extended Galilean relativity (mechanics) to include electromagnetism and optics. Fundamental symmetry of nature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Einstein’s Second Postulate states that the speed of light in a vacuum ($c$):",
        "options": [
          "Depends on the speed of the source.",
          "Changes based on the observer's velocity.",
          "Is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion.",
          "Is only constant if the observer is at rest."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Second postulate: $c = 299,792,458\\ \\text{m/s}$ (exact) in vacuum, independent of source/observer motion. From Maxwell's equations. Incompatible with Galilean relativity → requires new transformation (Lorentz)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a spaceship travels past you at $0.5c$ and turns on a flashlight pointing forward, what speed do you measure for the light beam?",
        "options": [
          "$0.5c$",
          "$c$",
          "$1.5c$",
          "$2.0c$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Galilean: $1.5c$. Actual: still $c$. Verified by experiments with binary stars, particle accelerators, GPS. Lorentz transformation: $v' = (u+v)/(1+uv/c^2)$. For $u=c$: $v' = (c+v)/(1+vc/c^2) = c$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In classical physics, time is 'absolute.' In Special Relativity, time is:",
        "options": [
          "Also absolute.",
          "Irrelevant.",
          "Relative (it depends on the observer's frame of reference).",
          "Faster for people moving at high speeds."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Time dilation: moving clocks run slow. $\\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_0$, where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. Not psychological but physical effect verified by atomic clocks on airplanes, particle lifetimes, GPS timing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why don't we notice the effects of Special Relativity (like time slowing down) in everyday life?",
        "options": [
          "Because the Earth's gravity cancels it out.",
          "Because we are always at rest.",
          "Because everyday speeds are extremely small compared to the speed of light.",
          "Because our clocks aren't accurate enough."
        ],
        "explanation": "$\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. For $v=30\\ \\text{m/s}$ (108 km/h): $\\gamma ≈ 1 + 5\\times 10^{-15}$. Too small to notice. For $v=0.1c$: $\\gamma=1.005$, $0.5c$: $\\gamma=1.155$, $0.99c$: $\\gamma=7.09$.",
        "answer": "C"

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "'Simultaneity' in Special Relativity means that:",
        "options": [
          "Two events that are simultaneous for one observer are always simultaneous for all others.",
          "Two events that are simultaneous for one observer may NOT be simultaneous for an observer in a different frame.",
          "All events in the universe happen at the same time.",
          "Time has no beginning or end."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Relativity of simultaneity: events simultaneous in one frame may not be in another moving frame. Reason: light speed constant → different observers disagree on timing of distant events. Fundamental to resolving paradoxes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an 'Inertial Frame'?",
        "options": [
          "A car turning a sharp corner at $20 \\text{ mph}$.",
          "A rocket ship accelerating at $9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$.",
          "A probe drifting through space at a constant $5000 \\text{ m/s}$.",
          "A person jumping off a diving board."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inertial frame = constant velocity (including zero). Cornering: centripetal acceleration. Rocket: accelerating. Jumping: gravitational acceleration. Deep space probe with engines off: approximately inertial."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the speed of light were not constant, what would happen to Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetism?",
        "options": [
          "They would stay the same.",
          "They would give different results depending on how fast you were moving.",
          "They would only work for magnets.",
          "They would predict that light is a sound wave."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Maxwell's equations contain $c = 1/\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0}$. If $c$ varied with frame, equations would change form in different frames → violate first postulate. Einstein chose to keep Maxwell's equations universal → constant $c$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Special Relativity applies to frames of reference that are:",
        "options": [
          "Accelerating.",
          "Rotating.",
          "Non-accelerating (Inertial).",
          "Only at rest."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Special relativity: inertial frames only. General relativity (1915) extends to accelerating frames and gravity via equivalence principle. Special relativity foundation: postulates only valid in absence of acceleration/gravity."

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) Einstein's two postulates, 2) Constant $c$ meaning (no addition with source speed), 3) Why Michelson-Morley was important, 4) Relativity of simultaneity concept, 5) Distinguishing inertial vs. non-inertial frames.",
        "0": "Start with basics: Review how Einstein's two simple postulates (physics same in all inertial frames, light speed constant) revolutionized our understanding of space and time, replacing Galilean relativity."
