      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block of mass $m$ is placed on a wedge of mass $M$ with a frictionless inclined surface. If the wedge is accelerated horizontally to the right at exactly $a = g \\tan\\theta$, the block will:",
        "options": [
          "Slide down the incline.",
          "Slide up the incline.",
          "Remain stationary relative to the wedge.",
          "Fall vertically."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This is a classic 'non-inertial frame' problem. When the wedge accelerates at $a = g\\tan\\theta$, the pseudo-force on the block ($ma$ to the left) exactly balances the component of gravity down the incline ($mg\\sin\\theta$). This results in zero net force along the incline, so the block remains stationary relative to the wedge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an object's position is given by $x(t) = At^3 + Bt$, the object's acceleration is:",
        "options": [
          "Constant.",
          "Proportional to $t^2$.",
          "Proportional to $t$.",
          "Zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Velocity $v(t) = dx/dt = 3At^2 + B$. Acceleration $a(t) = dv/dt = 6At$. Therefore, acceleration is proportional to time ($a \\propto t$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car engine delivers constant power $P$. Neglecting friction, the velocity of the car starting from rest depends on time $t$ as:",
        "options": [
          "$v \\propto t$",
          "$v \\propto t^2$",
          "$v \\propto \\sqrt{t}$",
          "$v \\propto 1/t$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Constant power $P = \\frac{dW}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2) = mv\\frac{dv}{dt}$. Solving this differential equation gives $v^2 = \\frac{2P}{m}t$, so $v \\propto \\sqrt{t}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass $m$ swings in a horizontal circle at the end of a string of length $L$ (conical pendulum). If the speed of the mass is increased, the time taken for one revolution (period):",
        "options": [
          "Increases.",
          "Decreases.",
          "Stays the same.",
          "Depends only on $L$."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For a conical pendulum, $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L\\cos\\theta}{g}}$. Increasing speed increases the angle $\\theta$, decreasing $\\cos\\theta$, thus decreasing the period $T$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a collision where the 'Relative Velocity of Approach' is $10\\text{ m/s}$ and the 'Relative Velocity of Separation' is $7\\text{ m/s}$, the collision is:",
        "options": [
          "Perfectly elastic.",
          "Perfectly inelastic.",
          "Partially inelastic.",
          "An explosion."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Coefficient of restitution $e = \\frac{\\text{Separation Speed}}{\\text{Approach Speed}} = 7/10 = 0.7$. For elastic: $e=1$; inelastic (stick together): $e=0$. Here $0<e<1$, so it is partially inelastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid conducting sphere of radius $R$ has a total charge $Q$. The potential $V$ at a distance $r < R$ (inside the sphere) is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero.",
          "$kQ/r$",
          "$kQ/R$",
          "$kQ/R^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a solid conductor in equilibrium, charge resides on the surface, and the electric field inside is zero. Since $E = -dV/dr = 0$, the potential is constant throughout the interior and equal to the potential at the surface: $V = kQ/R$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two long parallel wires carry currents in opposite directions. The wires will:",
        "options": [
          "Attract each other.",
          "Repel each other.",
          "Rotate clockwise.",
          "Exert no force on each other."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The magnetic field created by one wire at the location of the other is perpendicular to the current direction. Using the right-hand rule for force ($F = I\\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B}$), opposite currents produce magnetic forces that push the wires apart."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds, its velocity will:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Quadruple.",
          "Increase, but stay below $c$.",
          "Decrease."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Total energy $E = \\gamma mc^2$. Doubling $E$ doubles $\\gamma$. Since $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$, a larger $\\gamma$ means $v$ is closer to $c$, but $v$ remains strictly less than $c$ for any massive particle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two identical waves from coherent sources arrive at a point with a phase difference of $\\pi$ (180°), the resulting intensity is:",
        "options": [
          "Double the original.",
          "Four times the original.",
          "Zero.",
          "Half the original."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For coherent sources, total amplitude $A_{tot} = |A_1 - A_2|$. With equal amplitudes and a $\\pi$ phase difference (crest meets trough), destructive interference gives $A_{tot} = 0$, so intensity $I \\propto A_{tot}^2 = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Binding Energy per Nucleon curve, the most stable nucleus in the universe is:",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen-1",
          "Helium-4",
          "Iron-56",
          "Uranium-238"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Iron-56 (specifically, Fe-56 or Ni-62 nearby) sits at the peak of the binding energy per nucleon curve. Nuclei lighter than iron release energy via fusion; those heavier than iron release energy via fission, both moving toward the iron peak—the most stable configuration."
