    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which experiment provided the first definitive evidence that light behaves like a particle?",
        "options": [
          "Young's Double-Slit Experiment",
          "The Photoelectric Effect",
          "Michelson-Morley Experiment",
          "Faraday's Induction Experiment"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Einstein's 1905 photoelectric effect explanation: light as discrete photons with $E = hf$. Explained threshold frequency, instantaneous emission, and $K_{max}$ dependence on $f$ not intensity. Direct evidence for particle nature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which phenomenon is best explained by treating light as a wave?",
        "options": [
          "Compton Scattering",
          "Blackbody Radiation",
          "Interference and Diffraction",
          "The Emission Spectrum of Hydrogen"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Interference (Young's slits) and diffraction (single slit, gratings) require wave superposition. Particle model fails here. Compton scattering shows particle nature, blackbody radiation requires quantization, hydrogen spectrum needs quantum mechanics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Louis de Broglie proposed that if light has a particle nature, then matter (like electrons) must have a:",
        "options": [
          "Magnetic nature",
          "Wave nature",
          "Higher speed than light",
          "Neutral charge"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "De Broglie's 1924 hypothesis: Wave-particle duality symmetry. If waves (light) act as particles, then particles (electrons) should act as waves. Matter waves: $\\lambda = h/p$. Won 1929 Nobel Prize."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The de Broglie wavelength ($\\lambda$) of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by:",
        "options": [
          "$\\lambda = \\frac{mv}{h}$",
          "$\\lambda = hmv$",
          "$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}$",
          "$\\lambda = \\frac{v}{h}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda = h/p$, where $p = mv$ (non-relativistic). For photons: $\\lambda = h/p = hc/E$. Example: electron at 1 eV: $\\lambda \\approx 1.23\\ \\text{nm}$. Compare to visible light: 400-700 nm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why don't we observe the wave nature of macroscopic objects, like a moving baseball?",
        "options": [
          "Because they are too fast.",
          "Because their mass is so large that their de Broglie wavelength is impossibly small.",
          "Because gravity cancels out the waves.",
          "Because waves only exist in a vacuum."
        ],
        "explanation": "Baseball (0.145 kg, 40 m/s): $\\lambda = h/(mv) \\approx 1.1\\times 10^{-34}\\ \\text{m}$. Atomic nucleus ~$10^{-15}$ m → wavelength $\\sim 10^{19}$ times smaller! Wave effects negligible. Need small mass (electron) or ultra-cold atoms.",
        "answer": "B"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The wave nature of electrons was experimentally confirmed by observing which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons heating up a wire.",
          "Electron diffraction through a crystal lattice.",
          "Electrons orbiting a nucleus in circles.",
          "Electrons being attracted to a positive plate."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Davisson-Germer experiment (1927): electrons diffracted by nickel crystal, showing interference pattern. G.P. Thomson independently observed electron diffraction. Shared 1937 Nobel Prize. Direct proof of de Broglie hypothesis."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to wave-particle duality, a 'photon' is best described as:",
        "options": [
          "A pure wave of infinite length.",
          "A solid marble of energy.",
          "A 'wave packet' or 'quantum' that has properties of both.",
          "A particle that only turns into a wave when it hits water."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Photon exhibits both: particle-like in photoelectric/Compton effects (localized energy/momentum transfer), wave-like in interference/diffraction (superposition). Quantum object: neither pure wave nor pure particle. Complementarity principle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the velocity of an electron is doubled, its de Broglie wavelength will:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Be cut in half.",
          "Quadruple.",
          "Remain the same."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\lambda = h/p = h/(mv) \\propto 1/v$. Doubling $v$ halves $\\lambda$ (non-relativistic). For relativistic speeds: $p = \\gamma mv$, $\\lambda = h/(\\gamma mv)$ decreases faster than $1/v$."

          "Mass and Charge of a particle.",
          "Color and Temperature of a photon.",
          "Position and Momentum of a particle.",
          "Velocity and Time of an electron."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\hbar/2$. Wave packet localization (position) vs. wavelength spread (momentum). More localized wave → broader wavelength range → larger momentum uncertainty. Not measurement limitation but fundamental property."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an application of the wave nature of electrons?",
        "options": [
          "A standard light bulb.",
          "The Electron Microscope.",
          "An internal combustion engine.",
          "A compass."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Electron microscope uses electron waves ($\\lambda \\sim 0.005\\ \\text{nm}$ at 50 kV) vs. visible light ($\\lambda \\sim 500\\ \\text{nm}$). Smaller wavelength → better resolution (~1000× light microscope). TEM/SEM use this principle."

        "0": "Start with basics: Review how light shows both wave and particle properties, de Broglie's idea that matter can also be waves, and why this changes our understanding of reality at quantum scales."
