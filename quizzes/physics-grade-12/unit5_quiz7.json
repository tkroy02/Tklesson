      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A flat circular loop of radius 0.10 m is rotating in a uniform magnetic field of 0.20 T. What is the maximum flux ($\\Phi$) through the loop?",
        "options": [
          "0.0063 Wb",
          "0.020 Wb",
          "0.063 Wb",
          "2.0 Wb"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maximum flux occurs when the loop's plane is perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$: $\\Phi_{max} = BA = B(\\pi r^2) = 0.20 \\times \\pi \\times (0.10)^2 = 0.20 \\times 0.0314 \\approx 0.00628\\text{ Wb}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A magnet is dropped through a copper pipe. It falls slower than a non-magnetic object because:",
        "options": [
          "The air resistance is higher for magnets.",
          "Induced eddy currents create a magnetic field that opposes the motion.",
          "Copper is a ferromagnetic material that sticks to the magnet.",
          "The magnet becomes heavier as it falls."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As the magnet falls, its changing magnetic field induces eddy currents in the conducting pipe. By Lenz's Law, these currents create magnetic fields that oppose the magnet's motion, causing magnetic damping."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A square loop (10 cm × 10 cm) is pulled out of a 0.5 T field at a constant speed of 2.0 m/s. If the loop resistance is 0.2 Ω, the induced current is:",
        "options": [
          "0.1 A",
          "0.5 A",
          "1.0 A",
          "5.0 A"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Motional EMF: $\\varepsilon = BLv = 0.5 \\times 0.1 \\times 2.0 = 0.1\\text{ V}$ (L = 0.1 m, one side length). Current: $I = \\varepsilon/R = 0.1/0.2 = 0.5\\text{ A}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the formula $\\varepsilon = -N \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{\\Delta t}$, what happens to the EMF if the time interval for the flux change is cut in half?",
        "options": [
          "EMF is halved.",
          "EMF stays the same.",
          "EMF doubles.",
          "EMF quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $\\varepsilon \\propto 1/\\Delta t$ (for constant $\\Delta\\Phi$), halving $\\Delta t$ doubles the EMF. This shows faster flux changes produce larger induced voltages."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A loop of wire is moving into a magnetic field directed into the page. What is the direction of the induced current?",
        "options": [
          "Clockwise",
          "Counter-clockwise",
          "No current is induced",
          "Toward the center of the field"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As the loop enters, flux into the page increases. By Lenz's Law, the induced current creates a field out of the page to oppose this increase. Using right-hand rule for loops: field out of page requires counter-clockwise current."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would result in a \"back-EMF\" in an electric motor?",
        "options": [
          "The friction of the axle.",
          "The rotation of the armature in the magnetic field.",
          "The heat in the wires.",
          "The resistance of the brushes."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As a motor spins, its coils cut magnetic field lines, generating an induced EMF opposite to the applied voltage (back-EMF). This is why motors draw less current as they speed up."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A transformer works on the principle of:",
        "options": [
          "Self-induction",
          "Mutual induction",
          "Electrostatic discharge",
          "Thermionic emission"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transformers use mutual induction: a changing current in the primary coil creates changing flux in the core, which induces a voltage in the secondary coil via Faraday's Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the magnetic field $B$ through a loop is constant, but the area $A$ of the loop is shrinking at a rate of 0.05 m²/s, is an EMF induced?",
        "options": [
          "No, because $B$ is constant.",
          "Yes, because the flux $\\Phi = BA$ is changing.",
          "No, because area is a scalar.",
          "Yes, but only if the wire is iron."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Flux $\\Phi = BA$. Even with constant $B$, if $A$ changes, $\\Phi$ changes, inducing an EMF. Rate of change: $d\\Phi/dt = B(dA/dt)$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bar magnet is held vertically and dropped through a horizontal loop of wire. As the magnet leaves the loop (South pole pointing up), the induced current direction is:",
        "options": [
          "The same as when it entered.",
          "Opposite to when it entered.",
          "Zero throughout.",
          "Clockwise only."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When entering (North pole down), flux downward increases → induced current creates upward field (CCW from above). When leaving (South pole up), flux downward decreases → induced current creates downward field (CW from above). Directions are opposite."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The peak EMF produced by an AC generator is 120 V. If the rotation speed of the coil is doubled, the new peak EMF will be:",
        "options": [
          "60 V",
          "120 V",
          "240 V",
          "480 V"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Peak EMF $\\varepsilon_{max} = NBA\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is angular speed. Doubling $\\omega$ doubles $\\varepsilon_{max}$: $\\varepsilon_{max}' = NBA(2\\omega) = 2\\varepsilon_{max} = 240\\text{ V}$."
