    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of a resistor in an RC circuit during the charging process?",
        "options": [
          "To store electrical energy.",
          "To increase the maximum voltage of the capacitor.",
          "To control the rate at which the capacitor charges.",
          "To provide a vacuum for electrons to flow."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The resistor limits current flow, controlling the charging/discharging rate. Without it, capacitors would charge/discharge instantly (in theory), causing potentially damaging current spikes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The time constant ($\\tau$) of an RC circuit is defined by which formula?",
        "options": [
          "$\\tau = \\frac{R}{C}$",
          "$\\tau = R \\times C$",
          "$\\tau = \\frac{V}{R}$",
          "$\\tau = \\frac{C}{R}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Time constant $\\tau = RC$, where $R$ is resistance in ohms ($\\Omega$) and $C$ is capacitance in farads (F). Units: $\\Omega \\times F = \\text{s}$ (seconds)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After a time interval equal to one time constant ($\\tau$) during charging, what percentage of the maximum charge has the capacitor reached?",
        "options": [
          "37%",
          "50%",
          "63%",
          "100%"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For charging: $Q(t) = Q_{max}(1 - e^{-t/\\tau})$. At $t = \\tau$: $Q(\\tau) = Q_{max}(1 - e^{-1}) \\approx Q_{max}(1 - 0.3679) = 0.632Q_{max}$ ≈ 63%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a capacitor is fully charged in a DC circuit, the current in the circuit is:",
        "options": [
          "At its maximum value.",
          "Equal to $V/R$.",
          "Zero.",
          "Constantly oscillating."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When capacitor voltage equals source voltage, potential difference across resistor is zero. By Ohm's Law ($V = IR$), if $V = 0$, then $I = 0$. No net current flows in steady state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the resistance in an RC circuit, what happens to the time it takes to discharge the capacitor?",
        "options": [
          "It stays the same.",
          "It is cut in half.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Discharge time is proportional to $\\tau = RC$. Doubling $R$ doubles $\\tau$, so discharge takes twice as long. For full discharge (to ~1%): $t \\approx 5\\tau$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the discharging process, what happens to the voltage across the resistor?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant.",
          "It increases exponentially.",
          "It decreases exponentially.",
          "It immediately drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "During discharge: $V_R(t) = V_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $V_0$ is initial capacitor voltage. Both capacitor voltage and resistor voltage decay exponentially with time constant $\\tau$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following units is equivalent to the time constant $\\tau$?",
        "options": [
          "Volts",
          "Ohms per Farad",
          "Seconds",
          "Amperes"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\tau = RC$ has units: $\\Omega \\times F = (\\text{V/A}) \\times (\\text{C/V}) = \\text{C/A} = \\text{s}$, since $\\text{C} = \\text{A} \\cdot \\text{s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a charging RC circuit, what is the voltage across the capacitor at $t = 0$ (the moment the switch is closed)?",
        "options": [
          "$V_{source}$",
          "$0.63 \\times V_{source}$",
          "Zero",
          "$V/R$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Initially uncharged capacitor acts as short circuit: $V_C(0) = 0$. All source voltage appears across resistor, giving maximum initial current $I_0 = V/R$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "0.2 seconds",
          "2 seconds",
          "20 seconds",
          "200 seconds"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$\\tau = RC = (2 \\times 10^6\\ \\Omega) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{F}) = 20\\ \\text{s}$.\n$10\\mu\\text{F} = 10^{-5}\\ \\text{F}$, $2\\text{ M}\\Omega = 2 \\times 10^6\\ \\Omega$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "1",
          "2",
          "5",
          "10"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At $t = 5\\tau$: $Q(5\\tau) = Q_{max}(1 - e^{-5}) \\approx 0.993Q_{max}$ (99.3% charged). Similarly for discharge: $e^{-5} \\approx 0.0067$ (0.67% remaining)."
