      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is thrown downward with an initial velocity. Its acceleration (ignoring air resistance) is:",
        "options": [
          "Greater than $g$",
          "Less than $g$",
          "Exactly $g$",
          "Increasing as it falls"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In free fall, all objects experience the same constant gravitational acceleration $g$, independent of their initial velocity or mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The coefficient of static friction ($\\mu_s$) for a surface is usually:",
        "options": [
          "Less than the kinetic coefficient ($\\mu_k$)",
          "Greater than the kinetic coefficient ($\\mu_k$)",
          "Equal to the kinetic coefficient ($\\mu_k$)",
          "Independent of the materials"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$\\mu_s > \\mu_k$ for most material pairs. It requires more force to start an object moving (overcome static friction) than to keep it sliding at constant speed (overcome kinetic friction)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A block slides down a ramp. If friction does $-20\\text{ J}$ of work and gravity does $+50\\text{ J}$ of work, the change in Kinetic Energy is:",
        "options": [
          "$+70\\text{ J}$",
          "$+30\\text{ J}$",
          "$+50\\text{ J}$",
          "$-20\\text{ J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Work-Energy Theorem: $\\Delta K = W_{net} = W_{gravity} + W_{friction} = +50\\text{ J} + (-20\\text{ J}) = +30\\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two points, A and B, are on a rotating disk. Point B is twice as far from the center as Point A. Their angular velocity ($\\omega$) is:",
        "options": [
          "Higher for Point B",
          "Higher for Point A",
          "The same for both",
          "Zero for both"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "All points on a rigid rotating body complete one revolution in the same time, so they have the same angular velocity ($\\omega$). Their linear velocities differ: $v = r\\omega$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 2D collision, momentum is conserved:",
        "options": [
          "Only in the $x$-direction",
          "Only in the $y$-direction",
          "Independently in both $x$ and $y$ directions",
          "Only if the collision is elastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Momentum is a vector quantity. In the absence of external forces, the total momentum is conserved. This means its $x$ and $y$ components are each independently conserved."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The electric potential ($V$) at a distance $r$ from a point charge $Q$ is proportional to:",
        "options": [
          "$1/r$",
          "$1/r^2$",
          "$r$",
          "$r^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electric potential: $V = kQ/r$, inversely proportional to $r$ (a $1/r$ dependence). Electric field strength has a $1/r^2$ dependence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The magnetic field inside an ideal current-carrying solenoid is:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Uniform and parallel to the axis",
          "Circular around the wires",
          "Strongest at the ends"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Inside a long, tightly-wound solenoid with current flowing, the magnetic field is remarkably uniform, strong, and directed parallel to the solenoid's axis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'stay-at-home' twin ages more because the traveling twin:",
        "options": [
          "Traveled a greater distance",
          "Moved at a constant velocity",
          "Underwent acceleration (non-inertial frame)",
          "Was in a different galaxy"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The resolution of the Twin Paradox lies in the asymmetry: the traveling twin must accelerate to turn around and return. Special relativity's time dilation formulas apply differently to accelerating frames, leading to less proper time for the traveler."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The index of refraction ($n$) for a medium is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "$v/c$",
          "$c/v$",
          "$\\lambda/f$",
          "$f/\\lambda$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$n = c/v$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $v$ is the speed of light in the medium. Since $v \\leq c$, $n \\geq 1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Bohr model improved upon the Rutherford model by proposing that:",
        "options": [
          "Atoms have a nucleus.",
          "Electrons orbit in quantized energy levels.",
          "Protons are positive.",
          "Atoms are mostly empty space."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rutherford established the nuclear atom. Bohr's key contribution was postulating that electrons occupy specific, stable orbits (energy levels) and only emit/absorb light when jumping between these quantized levels."

        "90": "Excellent comprehensive mastery! You demonstrate a clear, deep understanding of concepts from kinematics through modern atomic theory, including nuanced topics like friction coefficients and relativity.",
        "70": "Very good cumulative review. Strengthen: constant $g$ in free fall, static vs. kinetic friction, work-energy theorem with non-conservative forces, angular vs. linear velocity, and the resolution of the Twin Paradox.",
        "50": "Fair overall. Focus on: gravitational acceleration independence, $\\mu_s > \\mu_k$, $\\Delta K = W_{net}$, same $\\omega$ for rigid rotation, momentum conservation in 2D, and $n = c/v$.",
        "0": "Start with fundamental definitions: free-fall acceleration $g$, friction coefficients, net work equals change in kinetic energy, angular velocity on a disk, and the basic definition of refractive index."
