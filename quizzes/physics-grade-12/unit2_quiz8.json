    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite is in a circular orbit around a planet. If it loses energy due to atmospheric drag, what happens to its orbital radius and its speed?",
        "options": [
          "The radius decreases and the speed increases.",
          "The radius decreases and the speed decreases.",
          "The radius increases and the speed decreases.",
          "The radius increases and the speed increases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is known as the 'satellite paradox.' Drag reduces total energy, causing the satellite to drop to a lower orbit (smaller $r$). In a lower orbit, the required speed ($v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$) is actually higher, so the satellite speeds up as it falls."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the ratio of Kinetic Energy to the magnitude of Gravitational Potential Energy ($E_k / |E_g|$) for any satellite in a stable circular orbit?",
        "options": [
          "0.5",
          "1.0",
          "2.0",
          "0.25"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $E_k = GMm/2r$ and $E_g = -GMm/r$, the magnitude of $E_k$ is exactly half the magnitude of $E_g$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A planet has two moons, Moon 1 and Moon 2, in circular orbits. Moon 1 has an orbital radius $R$ and Moon 2 has an orbital radius $9R$. What is the ratio of their orbital periods ($T_2 / T_1$)?",
        "options": [
          "27",
          "3",
          "9",
          "81"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By Kepler's Third Law ($T^2 \\propto r^3$), if $r$ increases by a factor of 9, $T^2$ increases by $9^3 = 729$. Taking the square root, $T$ increases by $\\sqrt{729} = 27$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object of mass $m$ is in a circular orbit of radius $r$ around a planet of mass $M$. What is the total mechanical energy of the object?",
        "options": [
          "-GMm / 2r",
          "-GMm / r",
          "GMm / 2r",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$E_T = E_k + E_g = (GMm/2r) + (-GMm/r) = -GMm/2r$. The total energy is half the potential energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a satellite's speed is suddenly increased by a small amount while in a circular orbit, what will be the shape of its new path?",
        "options": [
          "Elliptical",
          "A larger circle",
          "A smaller circle",
          "Hyperbolic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A circular orbit requires an exact velocity. Increasing the speed means the gravitational pull is no longer sufficient to maintain a circle, causing the satellite to swing outward into an ellipse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite orbits Earth at a distance $r$ from the center. If it is moved to a new orbit where the gravitational force is only one-ninth as strong, what is the new orbital speed compared to the original ($v$)?",
        "options": [
          "v/3",
          "v/9",
          "3v",
          "v"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $F_g$ is $1/9$, the radius must have tripled ($r_{new} = 3r$) due to the inverse-square law. Since $v \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r}$, the new speed is $v/\\sqrt{3}$. Wait, $v \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r}$. If $r$ is $3r$, $v$ becomes $v/\\sqrt{3}$. Let's re-evaluate: If $F \\propto 1/r^2$ becomes $1/9$, $r$ became $3r$. Orbital $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$, so $v_{new} = v/\\sqrt{3}$."
      },

          "Orbital Velocity",
          "Kinetic Energy",
          "Potential Energy",
          "Centripetal Force"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Orbital velocity $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$ depends only on the central mass and distance. Energy and Force formulas all include the satellite's mass ($m$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the period $T$ of a satellite in a circular orbit change if the mass of the central planet is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases by a factor of √2.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It increases by a factor of √2."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{r^3/GM}$. If $M$ is doubled in the denominator, $T$ becomes $T/\\sqrt{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Work' required to move a satellite from a circular orbit $R$ to a circular orbit $2R$ is equal to:",
        "options": [
          "GMm / 4R",
          "GMm / 2R",
          "GMm / R",
          "3GMm / 4R"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work = $\\Delta E_T = E_{T,final} - E_{T,initial} = (-GMm/4R) - (-GMm/2R) = GMm/4R$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a satellite in circular orbit, if the orbital radius is halved, the centripetal acceleration becomes:",
        "options": [
          "4 times greater.",
          "2 times greater.",
          "Half as great.",
          "16 times greater."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Centripetal acceleration is provided by gravity ($a_c = GM/r^2$). If $r$ is halved, $a_c \\propto 1/(0.5)^2 = 4$ times greater."
