    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A magnetic field is best described as a region in space where:",
        "options": [
          "Stationary charges experience a force.",
          "A moving charge or a magnetic pole experiences a force.",
          "The gravitational pull is neutralized.",
          "Only permanent magnets can exist."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Magnetic fields interact with moving charges (current) and other magnetic poles. Stationary charges experience no magnetic force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Magnetic field lines are used to represent the strength and direction of a field. Where is the field the strongest?",
        "options": [
          "Where the lines are furthest apart.",
          "Exactly in the middle of two poles.",
          "Where the lines are most densely packed.",
          "At the geographical North pole only."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The density of magnetic field lines (flux density) is proportional to the magnetic field strength. Closer lines indicate stronger fields."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you were to break a bar magnet exactly in half, the result would be:",
        "options": [
          "One piece with only a North pole and one with only a South pole.",
          "Two weaker magnets, each with a North and South pole.",
          "Two pieces of unmagnetized metal.",
          "A single magnetic monopole."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Magnetism is inherently dipolar. Breaking a magnet creates two smaller magnets, each with both north and south poles; magnetic monopoles do not exist in isolation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the direction of magnetic field lines outside of a bar magnet?",
        "options": [
          "From South to North.",
          "Circularly around the center.",
          "From North to South.",
          "Radially outward in all directions."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "By convention, magnetic field lines emerge from the North pole and curve around to enter the South pole, forming closed loops."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Earth's magnetic field is similar to that of a giant bar magnet. The \"Magnetic North Pole\" is actually located near the Earth's:",
        "options": [
          "Geographic North Pole and acts as a South magnetic pole.",
          "Geographic South Pole and acts as a North magnetic pole.",
          "Equator.",
          "Core and does not affect compasses."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The magnetic pole near the geographic North Pole is actually a south magnetic pole because it attracts the north-seeking end of a compass needle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following materials is \"Ferromagnetic\" and can be easily magnetized?",
        "options": [
          "Aluminum",
          "Copper",
          "Iron",
          "Plastic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Iron, along with nickel and cobalt, is ferromagnetic. Its magnetic domains can be aligned by an external field to create a strong, permanent magnet."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a magnetic material if it is heated above its \"Curie Temperature\"?",
        "options": [
          "Its magnetic field strength doubles.",
          "It becomes a superconductor.",
          "It loses its permanent magnetic properties.",
          "It changes its polarity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Above the Curie temperature, thermal energy disrupts the alignment of magnetic domains, causing the material to lose its permanent magnetism and become paramagnetic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Magnetic flux density is another term for:",
        "options": [
          "Magnetic Field Strength (B)",
          "Total Magnetic Flux (Φ)",
          "Electric Current (I)",
          "Permeability (μ)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Magnetic flux density (B) measures the strength of the magnetic field per unit area, in teslas (T). Total magnetic flux (Φ) is B times area."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Magnetic field lines never cross each other because:",
        "options": [
          "They are made of the same charge.",
          "The field has only one unique direction at any given point.",
          "They are insulators.",
          "They are under too much tension."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At any point in space, the magnetic field has a single, well-defined direction. Crossing lines would imply two different directions at the same point, which is impossible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A \"Uniform Magnetic Field\" is represented by field lines that are:",
        "options": [
          "Converging to a single point.",
          "Diverging from a single point.",
          "Parallel and equally spaced.",
          "Randomly distributed."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Parallel, equally spaced lines indicate that the magnetic field strength and direction are constant throughout the region, defining a uniform field."
