    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a graph of Maximum Kinetic Energy ($K_{max}$) vs. Frequency ($f$), the slope of the line is the same for all metals. What does this slope represent?",
        "options": [
          "The charge of an electron ($e$)",
          "The work function ($\\Phi$)",
          "Planck's constant ($h$)",
          "The speed of light ($c$)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "From $K_{max} = hf - \\Phi$, the equation is linear: $y = mx + b$ where $m = h$ (slope) and $b = -\\Phi$ (y-intercept). Slope $h$ is universal, while intercept varies with metal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the stopping potential ($V_s$) for a particular metal is 3.0 V, what is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons?",
        "options": [
          "3.0 J",
          "$3.0 \\text{ eV}$",
          "$1.5 \\text{ eV}$",
          "$4.8 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$K_{max} = eV_s$, where $e = 1.602\\times 10^{-19}$ C. In electronvolts: $K_{max} = (1 \\text{ eV/V}) \\times 3.0 \\text{ V} = 3.0 \\text{ eV}$. Also $\\approx 4.8\\times 10^{-19}$ J, but eV is the direct unit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the photoelectric effect experiment, what happens to the 'saturation current' if the intensity of light is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "It stays the same.",
          "It is halved.",
          "It doubles.",
          "It quadruples."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Saturation current = maximum photocurrent when all ejected electrons reach collector. Doubling intensity → double photons/second → double electrons/second → double current. This holds if frequency > $f_0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to classical wave theory, what should have happened to the kinetic energy of electrons if light intensity was increased?",
        "options": [
          "It should have decreased.",
          "It should have remained constant.",
          "It should have increased.",
          "It should have dropped to zero."
        ],
        "explanation": "Classical: light energy spreads continuously over wavefront. Brighter light = higher amplitude = more energy delivered to electrons per time → higher $K_{max}$. Experiment shows $K_{max}$ depends only on $f$, not intensity.",
        "answer": "C"
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the y-intercept of a $K_{max}$ versus Frequency graph?",
        "options": [
          "The threshold frequency ($f_0$)",
          "The negative of the work function ($-\\Phi$)",
          "The stopping potential ($V_s$)",
          "Planck's constant ($h$)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $K_{max} = hf - \\Phi$: at $f = 0$, $K_{max} = -\\Phi$. The y-intercept is negative work function. Extrapolating to $K_{max}=0$ gives $f_0 = \\Phi/h$ (x-intercept)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a metal has a work function of $4.0 \\text{ eV}$ and is struck by photons with $3.5 \\text{ eV}$ of energy, what is the resulting current?",
        "options": [
          "$0.5 \\text{ A}$",
          "$7.5 \\text{ A}$",
          "Zero",
          "$1.14 \\text{ A}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Photon energy ($3.5 \\text{ eV}$) < work function ($4.0 \\text{ eV}$). No electrons are ejected, regardless of intensity or exposure time. Current = 0."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'cutoff wavelength'?",
        "options": [
          "The shortest wavelength that can eject an electron.",
          "The longest wavelength that can eject an electron.",
          "The wavelength at which the current is maximum.",
          "The wavelength of the emitted electron."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Cutoff wavelength $\\lambda_c = c/f_0 = hc/\\Phi$. Longer λ → lower $f$ → lower energy. For $λ > λ_c$, $E_{photon} < \\Phi$ → no emission. 'Cutoff' = maximum λ (minimum $f$) that still works."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a stopping potential experiment, if you switch from blue light to UV light (higher frequency), what happens to the stopping voltage?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "UV has higher $f$ → higher $K_{max}$ → higher $V_s$ needed to stop electrons. $V_s = (hf - \\Phi)/e$. Example: Blue (~450 nm, ~2.75 eV) → UV (~300 nm, ~4.13 eV) gives ~1.38 eV more energy (if $\\Phi = 2.0$ eV)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The existence of a 'threshold frequency' specifically contradicts which classical idea?",
        "options": [
          "That light is a particle.",
          "That energy is quantized.",
          "That any frequency of light should eventually eject an electron if given enough time/intensity.",
          "That electrons are bound to the nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Classical: energy accumulates continuously in electron from wave. Low-frequency light should still eject electrons if intense enough or exposed long enough. Threshold frequency shows this is false: if $f < f_0$, no electrons ever, regardless of intensity/time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the work function of a metal is $2.0 \\text{ eV}$, what is the threshold frequency? (Use $h = 4.14 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ eV}·\\text{s}$)",
        "options": [
          "$2.07 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz}$",
          "$4.83 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz}$",
          "$8.28 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz}$",
          "$1.21 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ Hz}$"
        ],
        "explanation": "$f_0 = \\Phi / h = 2.0 \\text{ eV} / (4.14 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ eV·s}) = 4.83 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz}$.\nCorresponds to $λ_c = c/f_0 ≈ 621 \\text{ nm}$ (orange-red light).",

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) Einstein's equation $K_{max} = hf - \\Phi$, 2) Graphical slope/intercepts, 3) Stopping potential $V_s = K_{max}/e$, 4) Threshold frequency/wavelength calculations, 5) Why classical predictions failed each aspect.",
        "0": "Start with core concepts: Review photon energy quantization, work function definition, and how each experimental result (threshold, instantaneous emission, $K_{max}$ independence from intensity) contradicts classical waves."
