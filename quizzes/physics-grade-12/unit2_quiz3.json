    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An astronaut weighs 600 N on Earth. What would be the astronaut's weight on a planet that has the same mass as Earth but twice the radius?",
        "options": [
          "150 N",
          "300 N",
          "1200 N",
          "600 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $F_g \\propto 1/r^2$, doubling the distance ($2r$) results in a force of $1/2^2 = 1/4$ the original weight. $600 / 4 = 150$ N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two masses, M and 4M, are separated by a distance L. At what distance from the smaller mass M is the net gravitational field zero?",
        "options": [
          "L/3",
          "L/2",
          "L/4",
          "L/5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Set fields equal: $GM/x^2 = G(4M)/(L-x)^2$. Taking the square root: $1/x = 2/(L-x) \\rightarrow L-x = 2x \\rightarrow L = 3x \\rightarrow x = L/3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Planet Z has 4 times the mass of Earth and 2 times the radius of Earth. If Earth's surface gravity is g, what is the surface gravity on Planet Z?",
        "options": [
          "g",
          "2g",
          "0.5g",
          "4g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$g_{new} = G(4M)/(2R)^2 = 4GM/4R^2 = g$. The increase in mass is perfectly offset by the increase in radius squared."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the distance between two objects is reduced to one-third of its original value, what happens to the gravitational force between them?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by a factor of 9.",
          "It increases by a factor of 3.",
          "It decreases by a factor of 9.",
          "It remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By the inverse-square law, $F \\propto 1/(1/3)^2 = 1/(1/9) = 9$ times the original force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two planets, A and B, have the same average density, but Planet A has twice the radius of Planet B. What is the ratio of their surface gravities (gA / gB)?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "4",
          "8",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass $M \\propto R^3$. Since $g = GM/R^2$, then $g \\propto R^3/R^2$, so $g \\propto R$. If radius doubles, $g$ doubles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause the greatest increase in the gravitational force between two objects?",
        "options": [
          "Halving the distance between them.",
          "Doubling the mass of both objects.",
          "Doubling the mass of one object.",
          "Tripling the distance between them."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Halving distance increases force by 4x. Doubling both masses also increases force by 4x. In standardized testing, distance changes are emphasized due to the squared relationship."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A point mass m is at the center of a thin uniform ring of mass M and radius R. What is the net gravitational force on the point mass m?",

          "Zero",
          "GmM/R²",
          "Infinite",
          "GmM/2πR²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Symmetry dictates that the gravitational pull from one side of the ring is perfectly cancelled by the pull from the opposite side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is released from a height h above the surface of a planet with radius R. If h = R, what is its acceleration upon release?",

          "g/2",
          "g",
          "Zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distance from center is $R + h = 2R$. Field strength $g_{local} = GM/(2R)^2 = g/4$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "20 N/kg",
          "0.2 N/kg",
          "9.8 N/kg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Field strength $g$ is force per unit mass: $g = F/m = 10\\text{ N} / 2.0\\text{ kg} = 5.0\\text{ N/kg}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A uniform lead sphere has surface gravity g. If it is reshaped into a single sphere with half the original volume, what is the new surface gravity?",
        "options": [
          "Approximately 0.79g",
          "0.5g",
          "1.26g",
          "0.25g"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Volume halved means Mass is $M/2$. Radius becomes $R/2^{1/3}$. $g_{new} = G(M/2) / (R/2^{1/3})^2 = (1/2) / (1/2^{2/3}) g = 2^{-1/3} g \\approx 0.79g$."
