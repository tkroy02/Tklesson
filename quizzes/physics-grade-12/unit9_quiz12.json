    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the Twin Paradox considered a 'paradox' in the first place?",
        "options": [
          "It seems to allow travel backwards in time.",
          "Both twins see the other's clock as slower.",
          "It suggests that motion can alter genetic makeup.",
          "It appears to violate energy conservation principles."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The paradox arises from symmetry: during constant-velocity segments, each twin observes the other's clock running slow due to time dilation. This suggests each should be younger than the other when reunited, which seems contradictory."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the key asymmetry that resolves the paradox?",
        "options": [
          "The rocket's speed exceeds light speed briefly.",
          "The star's gravitational field affects time.",
          "Only the traveling twin experiences acceleration.",
          "Earth's rotation causes additional dilation."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The traveling twin must accelerate to turn around and return home. Acceleration breaks the symmetry between frames. Special relativity applies fully only to inertial (non-accelerating) frames."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the twins reunite on Earth, what is their age relationship?",
        "options": [
          "The traveling twin is younger.",
          "The Earth-bound twin is younger.",
          "They are the same biological age.",
          "Aging stopped for both during separation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The twin who underwent acceleration (the traveler) experiences less elapsed proper time. This results in the traveler being biologically younger upon return."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If γ = 5 for the traveling twin's speed, and her trip takes 2 years by her clock, how many years pass on Earth?",
        "options": [
          "0.4 years",
          "2 years",
          "7 years",
          "10 years"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Earth time is dilated: Δt = γΔt₀ = 5 × 2 years = 10 years. The Earth twin ages 10 years during the 2-year traveler's journey."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the constant-speed outbound leg, what does the traveling twin observe about Earth clocks?",
        "options": [
          "They run faster than her clock.",
          "They run slower than her clock.",
          "They keep perfect time with hers.",
          "They stop completely."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "During inertial motion, time dilation is symmetric. From the traveler's frame, Earth is moving away, so Earth clocks appear to run slow—just as Earth sees the traveler's clock running slow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the turn-around acceleration, what happens to the traveler's view of Earth time?",
        "options": [
          "Earth clocks appear to jump forward.",
          "Earth clocks reverse direction.",
          "Earth time appears to freeze.",
          "The speed of light changes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the traveler accelerates to return, her frame of simultaneity shifts dramatically. She must recalculate what time it is 'now' on Earth, resulting in Earth's clock appearing to jump forward by years."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Has this relativistic age difference been experimentally verified?",
        "options": [
          "No, it remains purely theoretical.",
          "Yes, with atomic clocks on aircraft.",
          "Only in computer simulations.",
          "Only with subatomic particles."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Hafele-Keating experiment (1971) flew atomic clocks around the world on commercial jets. The eastward-flying clocks lost time relative to stationary ones, while westward-flying clocks gained time, confirming both special and general relativistic effects."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the twins never reunite, which is truly younger?",
        "options": [
          "The traveling twin.",
          "The Earth twin.",
          "There is no absolute answer.",
          "They remain the same age."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Without bringing clocks together at the same location, 'which is younger' has no absolute meaning. Each can legitimately claim the other's clock runs slow without contradiction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a spacetime diagram, the straight worldline between two events represents:",
        "options": [
          "The path with maximum speed.",
          "The path with maximum proper time.",
          "The path with minimum proper time.",
          "A photon's trajectory."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Minkowski spacetime, the geodesic (straight line) between two timelike-separated events maximizes proper time. The stay-at-home twin follows this path and ages the most."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Twin Paradox demonstrates that elapsed time in relativity is:",
        "options": [
          "Absolute and universal.",
          "Path-dependent through spacetime.",
          "An illusion without physical reality.",
          "Determined solely by velocity magnitude."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Elapsed proper time depends on the worldline (path) through spacetime between two events. Different paths yield different amounts of aging, similar to how different routes between cities have different distances."

        "50": "Fair. Focus on: the traveling twin ages less, acceleration breaks symmetry, and γ relates proper and Earth times.",
        "0": "Start with basics: The traveling twin returns younger. The paradox is that each sees the other's clock as slow. Acceleration during turn-around resolves it."
