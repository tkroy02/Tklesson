      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A system consists of two 2.0 kg point masses attached to the ends of a 4.0 m long light rod of negligible mass. Calculate the moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the rod passing through its center.",
        "options": [
          "16.0 kg·m²",
          "32.0 kg·m²",
          "8.0 kg·m²",
          "64.0 kg·m²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each mass is at a distance $r = 2.0$ m from the center. $I = \\sum mr^2 = 2.0(2.0^2) + 2.0(2.0^2) = 8 + 8 = 16$ kg·m²."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The moment of inertia of a solid cylinder of mass M and radius R about its central axis is ½MR². Using the Parallel Axis Theorem, what is its moment of inertia about an axis along the surface of the cylinder, parallel to the central axis?",

          "1.0 MR²",
          "2.0 MR²",
          "0.5 MR²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$I = I_{cm} + Md^2$. Here $d = R$, so $I = 0.5MR^2 + M(R)^2 = 1.5MR^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Four identical 1.0 kg spheres are placed at the corners of a square with side length 2.0 m. Find the moment of inertia about an axis through the center of the square, perpendicular to its plane.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The distance from the center to a corner is $r = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$ m. $I = 4 \\times (1.0 \\times (\\sqrt{2})^2) = 8.0$ kg·m²."

          "The solid disk, by a factor of 2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hoop $I = MR^2$; Disk $I = 0.5MR^2$. The hoop has all mass at the maximum radius, resulting in higher rotational inertia."

        "type": "mcq",

          "The solid sphere",
          "Both require the same torque",
          "The solid sphere, because it is denser"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hollow sphere $I = (2/3)MR^2 \\approx 0.67MR^2$. Solid sphere $I = (2/5)MR^2 = 0.4MR^2$. Higher $I$ requires more torque ($\\tau = I\\alpha$)."
