    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following defines the relationship between inductive reactance ($X_L$) and frequency ($f$)?",
        "options": [
          "$X_L$ is inversely proportional to $f$",
          "$X_L$ is directly proportional to $f$",
          "$X_L$ is independent of $f$",
          "$X_L$ is proportional to the square root of $f$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "From $X_L = 2\\pi fL$, reactance is directly proportional to frequency: $X_L \\propto f$. Doubling frequency doubles reactance. This is opposite to capacitors where $X_C \\propto 1/f$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an AC circuit with a pure inductor, the phase angle between the voltage and the current is:",
        "options": [
          "$0^\\circ$",
          "$45^\\circ$",
          "$90^\\circ$",
          "$180^\\circ$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pure inductor: voltage leads current by exactly $90^\\circ$ ($\\pi/2$ radians). Phase angle $\\phi = +90^\\circ$ (voltage leads) or $-90^\\circ$ (current lags)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the inductance ($L$) of a coil is doubled and the frequency of the AC source is halved, the inductive reactance will:",
        "options": [
          "Double",
          "Quadruple",
          "Remain the same",
          "Be cut in half"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_L = 2\\pi fL$. Doubling $L$ (×2) and halving $f$ (×0.5) gives: $X_L' = 2\\pi (0.5f) (2L) = 2\\pi fL = X_L$. Changes cancel exactly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the frequency of an AC supply is very high, an inductor acts as:",
        "options": [
          "A short circuit",
          "An open circuit",
          "A battery",
          "A perfect conductor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "As $f \\to \\infty$, $X_L = 2\\pi fL \\to \\infty$ (infinite reactance). High-frequency signals are blocked; inductor acts as open circuit. Opposite of capacitor behavior."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mnemonic helps remember that Voltage (E) leads Current (I) in an Inductor (L)?",
        "options": [
          "ICE",
          "ELI",
          "RLC",
          "V=IR"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "ELI: E (voltage/EMF) leads I (current) in L (inductor). Complementary mnemonic for capacitors: ICE (I leads E in C)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The voltage across an inductor is maximum when the current is:",
        "options": [
          "At its maximum peak",
          "At its minimum peak",
          "Zero",
          "Changing at its slowest rate"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$V_L = L(di/dt)$. For sinusoidal current $i = I_{peak}\\sin(\\omega t)$, $di/dt = \\omega I_{peak}\\cos(\\omega t)$. Maximum $di/dt$ (and thus $V_L$) occurs when $\\cos(\\omega t) = \\pm1$, which happens when $\\sin(\\omega t) = 0$ (current zero)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a pure inductor is connected across an AC source, what is the power dissipated by the inductor over one full cycle?",
        "options": [
          "$V_{rms} \\times I_{rms}$",
          "$I_{peak}^2 \\times L$",
          "Zero",
          "$0.707 \\times V_{peak}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average power $P_{avg} = 0$. Energy is stored in magnetic field during half-cycle and returned to source during other half. No net energy dissipation in ideal inductor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An inductor has a reactance of $100\\ \\Omega$ at a certain frequency. If the frequency is doubled, what is the new reactance?",

          "$50\\ \\Omega$",
          "$100\\ \\Omega$",
          "$200\\ \\Omega$",
          "$400\\ \\Omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_L \\propto f$. Doubling frequency doubles reactance: $X_L' = 100 × 2 = 200\\ \\Omega$. Assuming constant inductance $L$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a phasor diagram for an inductor, if the current phasor is on the horizontal axis ($0^\\circ$), the voltage phasor points:",
        "options": [
          "Vertically upward ($90^\\circ$)",
          "Vertically downward ($-90^\\circ$)",
          "To the left ($180^\\circ$)",
          "To the right ($0^\\circ$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Voltage leads current by $90^\\circ$. If current phasor at $0^\\circ$ (reference), voltage phasor at $+90^\\circ$ (vertical upward). Standard convention: positive angles counterclockwise."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the reactance of a $10\\ \\text{mH}$ inductor at a frequency of $1\\ \\text{kHz}$? (Use $\\pi \\approx 3.14$)",
        "options": [
          "$6.28\\ \\Omega$",

          "$62.8\\ \\Omega$",
          "$314\\ \\Omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_L = 2\\pi fL = 2 × 3.14 × 1000 × 0.010 = 62.8\\ \\Omega$.\nExact: $X_L = 2\\pi × 1000 × 0.010 = 20\\pi \\approx 62.83\\ \\Omega$.\nNote: $10\\ \\text{mH} = 0.010\\ \\text{H}$, $1\\ \\text{kHz} = 1000\\ \\text{Hz}$."
