    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The ratio of maximum acceleration to maximum velocity in SHM is $10\\text{ s}^{-1}$. At $t=0$ the displacement is $5\\text{ m}$ and the initial phase is $\\pi/4$. What is the maximum acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "$500\\sqrt{2}\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "$500\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "$750\\sqrt{2}\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "$750\\text{ m/s}^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$a_{max}/v_{max} = \\omega^2 A / (\\omega A) = \\omega = 10\\text{ rad/s}$. At $t=0$: $x = A\\sin\\phi \\Rightarrow 5 = A\\sin(\\pi/4) \\Rightarrow A = 5\\sqrt{2}\\text{ m}$. $a_{max} = \\omega^2 A = 100 \\times 5\\sqrt{2} = 500\\sqrt{2}\\text{ m/s}^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A child swinging on a swing in a sitting position stands up. How will the time period of the swing change?",
        "options": [
          "Increase",
          "Decrease",
          "Remains the same",
          "Depends on the child's height"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When standing, the child's center of mass rises, effectively shortening the pendulum length $L$. Since $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$, shorter length means smaller period."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The length of a simple pendulum is increased by 21%. What is the percentage increase in the time period?",
        "options": [
          "11%",
          "21%",
          "42%",
          "10%"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "$T \\propto \\sqrt{L}$. New length $L' = 1.21L$, so $T' = \\sqrt{1.21}T = 1.1T$. Percentage increase = $(1.1 - 1) \\times 100\\% = 10\\%$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a simple harmonic oscillator, which of the following is true at the mean position ($x=0$)?",
        "options": [
          "$K$ is minimum, $U$ is maximum",
          "Both $K$ and $U$ are maximum",
          "$K$ is maximum, $U$ is minimum",
          "Both $K$ and $U$ are minimum"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium: displacement $x=0$, so potential energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = 0$ (minimum). Velocity is maximum, so kinetic energy $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2$ is maximum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass $m$ is attached to two springs of constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ in parallel. If the frequency of oscillation is $f$, what is the new frequency if they are connected in series?",
        "options": [
          "$f\\sqrt{\\frac{k_1k_2}{(k_1+k_2)^2}}$",
          "$f\\sqrt{\\frac{k_1+k_2}{k_1k_2}}$",
          "$f\\sqrt{k_1/k_2}$",
          "$f/2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel: $k_p = k_1 + k_2$, $f \\propto \\sqrt{k_p}$. Series: $k_s = \\frac{k_1k_2}{k_1+k_2}$, $f_s \\propto \\sqrt{k_s}$. Ratio $f_s/f = \\sqrt{k_s/k_p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1k_2}{(k_1+k_2)^2}}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The average velocity of a particle executing SHM in one complete vibration is:",
        "options": [
          "$A\\omega$",
          "$A\\omega/2$",
          "Zero",
          "$A\\omega^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Average velocity = total displacement / total time. In one complete cycle, the particle returns to its starting point, so net displacement = 0, making average velocity zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a tunnel is bored along the diameter of the Earth and a stone is dropped into it, the stone will:",
        "options": [
          "Come to rest at the center",
          "Pass through to the other side and escape",
          "Execute SHM with a period of ~84.6 min",
          "Reach the center and stop due to gravity"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Inside Earth, gravitational force is proportional to distance from center: $F = -\\frac{GMm}{R^3}r = -kr$. This linear restoring force produces SHM with period $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{R/g} \\approx 84.6$ minutes."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A second's pendulum is placed in a lift falling freely under gravity. Its period of oscillation will be:",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "$2\\text{ s}$",
          "Infinite",
          "$1\\text{ s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In free fall, effective gravity $g_{eff} = g - g = 0$. Period $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g_{eff}}$ becomes infinite (pendulum stops oscillating as there's no restoring torque)."
      },
      {

        "question": "The equation of a wave is $y = 5\\sin(10\\pi t - 0.01\\pi x)$. The velocity of the wave is:",
        "options": [
          "$10\\text{ m/s}$",

          "$0.01\\text{ m/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Standard form: $y = A\\sin(\\omega t - kx)$. Here $\\omega = 10\\pi$, $k = 0.01\\pi$. Wave speed $v = \\omega/k = 10\\pi / 0.01\\pi = 1000\\text{ m/s}$."

        "options": [
          "Total Energy",
          "Time Period",
          "Acceleration",
          "Amplitude"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Acceleration $a = -\\omega^2 x$ varies with displacement $x$. Total energy, time period, and amplitude remain constant in undamped SHM."
