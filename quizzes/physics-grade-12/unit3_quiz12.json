    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the electric potential is given by the function $V(x) = 5x^2$, what is the expression for the electric field $E$ along the x-axis?",
        "options": [
          "$-10x$",
          "$10x$",
          "$\\frac{5}{3} x^3$",
          "zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential ($E_x = -dV/dx$). The derivative of $5x^2$ is $10x$, so $E_x = -10x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solid conducting sphere of radius $R$ carries a total charge $Q$. What is the electric field $E$ at a distance $r < R$ (inside the sphere)?",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "$kQ / r^2$",
          "$kQ / R^2$",
          "$kQr / R^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In electrostatic equilibrium, all excess charge resides on the surface of a conductor. By Gauss's Law, the enclosed charge for $r < R$ is zero, so the internal electric field is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the electric potential $V$ inside the same solid conducting sphere ($r < R$)?",
        "options": [
          "$kQ / R$",
          "Zero",
          "$kQ / r$",
          "$kQ / R^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the electric field inside is zero, no work is done moving a charge within the sphere. The potential must therefore be constant and equal to the value at the surface: $V = kQ/R$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the flux $\\Phi_E$ through a closed surface according to Gauss's Law?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Phi_E = Q_{enclosed} / \\epsilon_0$",
          "$\\Phi_E = EA$",
          "$\\Phi_E = kQ / r$",
          "$\\Phi_E = Vd$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gauss's Law states the total electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the net enclosed charge: $\\Phi_E = \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{enc} / \\epsilon_0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a non-uniform electric field, the work done to move a test charge $q$ from point $A$ to $B$ is calculated as:",
        "options": [
          "$-q \\int_A^B \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{\\ell}$",
          "$qEd$",
          "$\\frac{k q_1 q_2}{r}$",
          "$\\frac{1}{2}CV^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a non-uniform field, the work done by an external agent is $W = -q \\int_A^B \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{\\ell}$, which equals the change in potential energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Faraday Cage' works on the principle that the electric field inside a closed conductor is zero. This is a direct consequence of:",
        "options": [
          "Electrostatic equilibrium and Gauss's Law.",
          "The inverse-square law of gravity.",
          "The electrical resistance of the metal.",
          "The magnetic shielding properties of the material."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In electrostatic equilibrium, charges on a conductor redistribute to exactly cancel any external electric field within its interior, as dictated by Gauss's Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The electric potential at the center of a square with four identical $+q$ charges at the corners is:",
        "options": [
          "$4kq / r$",
          "Zero",
          "$kq / r^2$",
          "$4kq / r^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Potential is a scalar additive quantity. Since all four charges are positive and equidistant ($r$) from the center, the total potential is $V = 4 \\times (kq/r) = 4kq/r$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical quantity is represented by the area under an Electric Field vs. Distance ($E$ vs. $r$) graph?",
        "options": [
          "Change in electric potential ($\\Delta V$)",
          "Electrostatic force ($F$)",
          "Stored energy ($U$)",
          "Total charge ($Q$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\Delta V = -\\int E \\, dr$, the (negative of the) area under the $E$ vs. $r$ curve represents the potential difference between the limits of integration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an infinite line of charge with linear charge density $\\lambda$, how does the electric field $E$ scale with perpendicular distance $r$?",
        "options": [
          "$1/r$",
          "$1/r^2$",
          "Constant",
          "$1/r^3$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Applying Gauss's Law to a cylindrical surface coaxial with the line charge yields $E = \\lambda / (2\\pi\\epsilon_0 r)$, showing a $1/r$ dependence."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The magnitude of the dipole moment $\\vec{p}$ of two charges $+q$ and $-q$ separated by distance $d$ is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "$qd$",
          "$q / d$",
          "$kq / d^2$",
          "zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electric dipole moment is a vector pointing from the negative to the positive charge. Its magnitude is the product of the charge magnitude and the separation: $p = qd$."
