    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of an AC circuit is tripled while the capacitance remains constant, what happens to the capacitive reactance ($X_C$)?",
        "options": [
          "It triples.",
          "It stays the same.",
          "It is reduced to one-third of its original value.",
          "It increases by a factor of nine."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$X_C = 1/(2\\pi fC) \\propto 1/f$. Tripling $f$ reduces $X_C$ to 1/3: $X_C' = 1/(2\\pi × 3f × C) = (1/3)X_C$. This shows capacitors are more conductive at higher frequencies."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a phasor diagram, what is the angle between the voltage across a capacitor and the current through it?",
        "options": [
          "0°",
          "45°",
          "90°",
          "180°"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Current leads voltage by 90° in ideal capacitor. Phasor representation: if voltage phasor at 0°, current phasor at +90°. Phase difference $\\phi = -90°$ (voltage lags current)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct unit for the product $2\\pi f C$?",
        "options": [
          "Ohms ($\\Omega$)",
          "Siemens (S) or $\\Omega^{-1}$",
          "Farads (F)",
          "Seconds (s)"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$2\\pi f C$ has units: $(\\text{s}^{-1}) × (\\text{C/V}) = \\text{C/(V·s)} = \\text{A/V} = \\text{S}$ (siemens). Since $X_C = 1/(2\\pi f C)$, the product is the reciprocal of ohms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A capacitor is said to be a \"frequency-dependent resistor.\" For which type of signal does it offer the least opposition?",
        "options": [
          "Low-frequency AC",
          "High-frequency AC",
          "Steady DC",
          "It offers the same opposition to all."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$X_C = 1/(2\\pi f C) → 0$ as $f → \\infty$. High frequencies pass easily through capacitors (low reactance). DC ($f = 0$) encounters infinite reactance (blocks DC)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the power factor of a circuit containing only an ideal capacitor?",
        "options": [
          "1.0",
          "0.707",
          "0.5",
          "0.0"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Power factor = $\\cos\\phi$, where $\\phi = -90°$ (voltage lags current by 90°). $\\cos(-90°) = 0$. Zero power factor means no average power dissipation—all energy is stored and returned."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you connect two identical capacitors in parallel in an AC circuit, the total capacitive reactance will:",
        "options": [
          "Double.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Be cut in half.",
          "Be quadrupled."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Parallel capacitors: $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 2C$ (if identical). $X_C \\propto 1/C$, so $X_C' = 1/(2C) = (1/2)X_C$. Halving reactance doubles current for same voltage."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation represents the instantaneous current ($i$) in a capacitive circuit if $v = V_{peak} \\sin(\\omega t)$?",
        "options": [
          "$i = I_{peak} \\sin(\\omega t)$",
          "$i = I_{peak} \\sin(\\omega t - 90^\\circ)$",
          "$i = I_{peak} \\sin(\\omega t + 90^\\circ)$",
          "$i = I_{peak} \\cos(\\omega t + 90^\\circ)$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the energy stored in a capacitor during the quarter-cycle when the AC voltage is dropping from its peak to zero?",
        "options": [
          "It is dissipated as heat in the dielectric.",
          "It is returned to the AC source.",
          "It remains stored in the electric field.",
          "It is converted into a magnetic field."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$. As $V$ decreases from peak to zero, stored energy decreases. This energy flows back to source (current flows opposite to voltage). Capacitors exchange energy with source, not dissipate it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an AC circuit, the \"opposition\" provided by a capacitor is called reactance rather than resistance because:",
        "options": [
          "It does not obey Ohm's Law.",
          "It does not convert electrical energy into thermal energy.",
          "It only works with DC.",
          "It depends on the material of the wires."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Reactance ($X$) stores and returns energy; resistance ($R$) dissipates energy as heat. Both obey AC Ohm's Law ($V = IZ$ where $Z$ is impedance), but differ in energy handling."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an AC source has an angular frequency ($\\omega$) of $100\\ \\text{rad/s}$ and is connected to a $50\\mu\\text{F}$ capacitor, what is the reactance?",
        "options": [
          "$20\\ \\Omega$",
          "$200\\ \\Omega$",
          "$500\\ \\Omega$",
          "$2000\\ \\Omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$X_C = 1/(\\omega C) = 1/(100 × 50 × 10^{-6}) = 1/(0.005) = 200\\ \\Omega$.\nAlternative using $f$: $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, so $f = 100/(2\\pi) ≈ 15.92\\ \\text{Hz}$, $X_C = 1/(2\\pi f C) = 1/(2\\pi × 15.92 × 50×10^{-6}) ≈ 200\\ \\Omega$."
