    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object in SHM has an angular frequency $\\omega$. What is the relationship between its maximum velocity ($v_{max}$) and its amplitude ($A$)?",
        "options": [
          "$v_{max} = A\\omega$",
          "$v_{max} = A\\omega^2$",
          "$v_{max} = A^2\\omega$",
          "$v_{max} = \\omega/A$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The velocity function is $v(t) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. Its maximum magnitude occurs when $|\\sin(\\cdot)| = 1$, giving $v_{max} = A\\omega$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the position of an oscillator is given by $x(t) = 4.0\\cos(2\\pi t)$, what is the maximum acceleration of the object?",
        "options": [
          "$4.0\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "$8\\pi\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "$16\\pi^2\\text{ m/s}^2$",
          "$2\\pi\\text{ m/s}^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Comparing to $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$, we have $A = 4.0$ and $\\omega = 2\\pi$. Maximum acceleration is $a_{max} = A\\omega^2 = 4.0 \\times (2\\pi)^2 = 16\\pi^2\\text{ m/s}^2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what point in the cycle is the velocity of an oscillator equal to zero?",
        "options": [
          "At the equilibrium position ($x=0$).",
          "At the turning points ($x = \\pm A$).",
          "Halfway between equilibrium and amplitude.",
          "Velocity is never zero in SHM."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Velocity is zero when the object momentarily stops to change direction, which occurs at the maximum displacement points (turning points/amplitude)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the phase difference between the position $x(t)$ and the acceleration $a(t)$ of an object in SHM?",
        "options": [
          "$0$",
          "$\\pi/2$ rad ($90^\\circ$)",
          "$\\pi$ rad ($180^\\circ$)",
          "$2\\pi$ rad ($360^\\circ$)"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Since $a(t) = -\\omega^2 x(t)$, acceleration is directly opposite to displacement. This corresponds to a phase difference of $\\pi$ radians or $180^\\circ$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass oscillates with a period of $4.0\\text{ s}$. What is its angular frequency $\\omega$?",
        "options": [
          "$0.25\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$0.5\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$2\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$4\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Angular frequency is related to period by $\\omega = 2\\pi/T$. Substituting $T = 4.0\\text{ s}$ gives $\\omega = 2\\pi/4.0 = 0.5\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For an object starting at the positive amplitude ($x = +A$) at $t = 0$, the correct position equation is:",
        "options": [
          "$x(t) = A\\sin(\\omega t)$",
          "$x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$",
          "$x(t) = -A\\cos(\\omega t)$",
          "$x(t) = A\\tan(\\omega t)$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The cosine function has its maximum value of 1 at $t=0$. Therefore, $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$ gives $x(0) = A$, matching the initial condition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the amplitude of an oscillator is doubled while the frequency remains constant, the maximum velocity will:",
        "options": [
          "Remain the same.",
          "Double.",
          "Quadruple.",
          "Be halved."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Maximum velocity is $v_{max} = A\\omega$. Since $\\omega$ is constant (frequency unchanged), $v_{max}$ is directly proportional to amplitude $A$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The acceleration of a particle in SHM is given by $a = -16x$. What is the angular frequency $\\omega$ of this motion?",
        "options": [
          "$4\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$16\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$2\\pi\\text{ rad/s}$",
          "$256\\text{ rad/s}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The standard SHM acceleration equation is $a = -\\omega^2 x$. Comparing to $a = -16x$, we have $\\omega^2 = 16$, so $\\omega = 4\\text{ rad/s}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an object in SHM passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$), its acceleration is:",
        "options": [
          "Maximum and positive.",
          "Maximum and negative.",
          "Zero.",
          "Constant and non-zero."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is proportional to displacement ($a = -\\omega^2 x$). At $x=0$, the restoring force is zero, resulting in zero acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The velocity of an oscillator is maximum when:",
        "options": [
          "Displacement is maximum.",
          "Acceleration is maximum.",
          "Potential energy is maximum.",
          "Displacement is zero."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Maximum velocity occurs when kinetic energy is maximum and potential energy is minimum. This happens at the equilibrium position where displacement is zero."

        "70": "Very good! Solid understanding of SHM kinematics. Review the specific phase relationships and how to extract parameters from equations of motion.",
        "50": "Fair. Focus on: 1) The connections $v_{max} = A\\omega$, $a_{max} = A\\omega^2$, 2) Phase differences between $x$, $v$, and $a$, 3) Finding $\\omega$ from period or acceleration equation, 4) Where velocity and acceleration are zero/maximum.",
