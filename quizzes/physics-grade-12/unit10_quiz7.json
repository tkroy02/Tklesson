      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object moves along a straight line. If its velocity-time graph is a horizontal line (not at zero), the object’s acceleration is:",
        "options": [
          "Constant and non-zero",
          "Increasing",
          "Zero",
          "Decreasing"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is the slope of the velocity-time graph. A horizontal line has zero slope, indicating constant velocity and therefore zero acceleration."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A large truck collides head-on with a small car. During the collision:",
        "options": [
          "The truck exerts a greater force on the car.",
          "The car exerts a greater force on the truck.",
          "The forces are equal in magnitude.",
          "The truck exerts a force, but the car does not."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law: The force of the truck on the car is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force of the car on the truck, regardless of their masses."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A $2.0\\text{ kg}$ object is moving at $3.0\\text{ m/s}$. To stop it, the total work done on the object must be:",
        "options": [
          "$-3.0\\text{ J}$",
          "$-6.0\\text{ J}$",
          "$-9.0\\text{ J}$",
          "$-18.0\\text{ J}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Work-Energy Theorem: $W = \\Delta K = 0 - \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}(2.0)(3.0)^2 = -9.0\\text{ J}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To keep a satellite in a stable circular orbit at a specific radius, its speed must:",
        "options": [
          "Depend on the satellite's mass.",
          "Decrease if the planet's mass increases.",
          "Be exactly $\\sqrt{GM/r}$.",
          "Be equal to the escape velocity."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Orbital velocity: $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$, where $M$ is the planet's mass and $r$ is the orbital radius. It is independent of the satellite's mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two objects collide and bounce off each other without losing any Kinetic Energy, the collision is:",

          "Perfectly Inelastic",
          "Partially Inelastic",
          "Perfectly Elastic",
          "An Explosion"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A perfectly elastic collision is defined by conservation of total kinetic energy, in addition to conservation of momentum."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two parallel plates are separated by $0.10\\text{ m}$ with a potential difference of $50\\text{ V}$. The electric field strength ($E$) between them is:",
        "options": [
          "$5\\text{ V/m}$",
          "$50\\text{ V/m}$",
          "$500\\text{ V/m}$",
          "$0.5\\text{ V/m}$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a uniform field: $E = V/d = 50\\text{ V} / 0.10\\text{ m} = 500\\text{ V/m}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wire of length $L$ carries current $I$ in a magnetic field $B$. The force is zero if the wire is:",
        "options": [
          "Perpendicular to the field.",
          "At a $45^\\circ$ angle to the field.",
          "Parallel to the field.",
          "In a vacuum."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Magnetic force on a wire: $F = I L B \\sin\\theta$. If the wire is parallel to the field ($\\theta = 0$), then $\\sin 0 = 0$ and the force is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two light pulses strike the front and back of a moving train simultaneously for an observer on the ground, the passenger on the train sees:",
        "options": [
          "The front pulse strike first.",
          "The pulses strike simultaneously.",
          "The back pulse strike first.",
          "No pulses at all."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Relativity of simultaneity: Events simultaneous in the ground frame are not simultaneous in the train's frame. The passenger, moving toward the front, sees the front pulse arrive first because they are moving to meet it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Light passes through a narrow slit. If the slit width is decreased, the central maximum of the diffraction pattern:",
        "options": [
          "Becomes narrower.",
          "Becomes wider.",
          "Stays the same.",
          "Disappears."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Single-slit diffraction: The angular width of the central maximum is inversely proportional to the slit width. A narrower slit causes more diffraction spreading, making the central peak wider."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The experiment that most clearly demonstrated the wave nature of electrons was:",
        "options": [
          "The Photoelectric Effect",
          "The Davisson-Germer Experiment (Electron Diffraction)",
          "The Michelson-Morley Experiment",
          "Rutherford Scattering"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Davisson-Germer experiment (1927) showed that electrons produce a diffraction pattern when scattered off a nickel crystal, providing direct evidence of their wave nature and confirming de Broglie's hypothesis."
