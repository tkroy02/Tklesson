    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a series RLC circuit, what is the formula for the total impedance $Z$?",
        "options": [
          "$Z = R + X_L + X_C$",
          "$Z = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L + X_C)^2}$",
          "$Z = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}$",
          "$Z = R + |X_L - X_C|$"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Impedance magnitude: $Z = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}$. The reactances subtract because inductor and capacitor voltages are 180° out of phase. This is derived from phasor addition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At resonance in a series RLC circuit, which of the following is true?",
        "options": [
          "Impedance is maximum.",
          "Current is minimum.",
          "The circuit is purely capacitive.",
          "The circuit is purely resistive."
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "At resonance: $X_L = X_C$, so $X_L - X_C = 0$. Thus $Z = R$ (minimum impedance), current is maximum, and phase angle $\\phi = 0°$ (purely resistive behavior)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the resonant frequency $f_0$ of a series RLC circuit?",
        "options": [
          "$f_0 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}$",
          "$f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$",
          "$f_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{LC}}{2\\pi}$",
          "$f_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Resonant frequency: $f_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$. Derived from setting $X_L = X_C$: $2\\pi f L = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f C}$. Solving gives $f = 1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{LC})$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a series RLC circuit, if $X_L > X_C$, the circuit is:",
        "options": [
          "Capacitive (current leads voltage)",
          "Resistive",
          "Inductive (voltage leads current)",
          "At resonance"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Phase angle $\\phi = \\tan^{-1}((X_L - X_C)/R)$. If $X_L > X_C$, then $\\phi > 0$, meaning voltage leads current (inductive behavior). If $X_C > X_L$, $\\phi < 0$ (capacitive)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the quality factor (Q-factor) of a series RLC circuit if the resistance is increased?",
        "options": [
          "Q-factor increases.",
          "Q-factor decreases.",
          "Q-factor remains unchanged.",
          "Q-factor becomes negative."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Q-factor $Q = \\frac{\\omega_0 L}{R} = \\frac{1}{R}\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}$. Increasing $R$ decreases $Q$. High Q means sharp resonance peak; low Q means broad resonance."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a series RLC circuit, the voltage across which component can exceed the source voltage at resonance?",
        "options": [
          "Resistor only",
          "Inductor and capacitor",
          "All components equally",
          "None; all voltages are less than source"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At resonance, $V_L = I X_L$ and $V_C = I X_C$ can be much larger than source voltage if $Q > 1$. $V_R = I R =$ source voltage. This is voltage magnification."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the phase angle $\\phi$ between source voltage and current in a series RLC circuit?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Phase angle: $\\phi = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{X_L - X_C}{R}\\right)$. Positive $\\phi$: inductive (voltage leads); negative $\\phi$: capacitive (current leads); zero: resonant."

          "$22.4\\ \\Omega$",
          "$60\\ \\Omega$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$Z = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 + (30 - 20)^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 100} = \\sqrt{200} = 14.14\\ \\Omega$.\nPhase: $\\phi = \\tan^{-1}(10/10) = 45^\\circ$ (inductive)."

        "question": "Which graph shape describes the current vs. frequency curve for a series RLC circuit?",
        "options": [
          "Linear",
          "Exponential decay",
          "Bell-shaped curve (resonance peak)",
          "Sawtooth wave"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Current $I = V/Z$ is maximum at resonance frequency $f_0$, creating bell-shaped curve. Bandwidth $\\Delta f = f_0/Q$. Higher Q means sharper peak."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a series RLC circuit below resonance ($f < f_0$), the circuit behaves more like:",

          "A pure resistor",
          "A pure capacitor",
          "A pure inductor",
          "A short circuit"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Below resonance: $X_C > X_L$ (since $X_C \\propto 1/f$, $X_L \\propto f$). Circuit is capacitive dominated ($\\phi < 0$). Above resonance: inductive dominated ($\\phi > 0$)."
