      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC)?",
        "options": [
          "AC flows at a much higher speed than DC.",
          "AC reverses direction periodically, while DC flows in one direction.",
          "DC can only be produced by batteries, while AC can only be produced by solar panels.",
          "AC has a constant magnitude, while DC magnitude varies sinusoidally."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "AC periodically reverses direction (typically sinusoidal), while DC maintains constant direction. Electron drift speed is similar for both; the key difference is directional reversal in AC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mathematical function is most commonly used to describe the waveform of AC voltage?",
        "options": [
          "Linear",
          "Tangent",
          "Sine",
          "Logarithmic"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Standard AC voltage is sinusoidal: $v(t) = V_{peak}\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$ or $v(t) = V_{peak}\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$. Other waveforms exist (square, triangular) but sine is fundamental for power distribution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the frequency of an AC signal is 50 Hz, what is its period ($T$)?",
        "options": [
          "0.02 seconds",
          "0.5 seconds",
          "2 seconds",
          "50 seconds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period $T = 1/f = 1/50 = 0.02\\text{ s}$ or 20 ms. This is the European power standard; North America uses 60 Hz ($T = 1/60 \\approx 0.0167\\text{ s}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The \"RMS\" value of an AC current is also known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Peak value",
          "Average value",
          "Effective value",
          "Instantaneous value"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "RMS (Root Mean Square) = effective value. For sinusoidal AC: $I_{rms} = I_{peak}/\\sqrt{2}$. It represents the DC equivalent that would produce the same heating effect in a resistor."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A household outlet provides 120V RMS. What is the approximate peak voltage ($V_{peak}$)?",
        "options": [
          "85V",
          "120V",
          "170V",
          "240V"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "$V_{peak} = V_{rms} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 120 \\times 1.414 \\approx 170\\text{ V}$. For 230V systems (Europe): $V_{peak} \\approx 230 \\times 1.414 \\approx 325\\text{ V}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What component in an AC generator allows the current to alternate instead of being rectified into DC?",
        "options": [
          "Split-ring commutator",
          "Slip rings",
          "Capacitor",
          "Semiconductor diode"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Slip rings maintain continuous contact with rotating coil, allowing AC output. Split-ring commutators (used in DC motors/generators) reverse connections to produce DC. This is key difference between AC and DC generators."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In North America, the standard AC frequency is 60 Hz. How many times does the current reach a peak (either positive or negative) in one second?",
        "options": [
          "30 times",
          "60 times",
          "120 times",
          "240 times"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "One cycle = one positive peak + one negative peak. $60\\text{ Hz} = 60$ cycles/s × 2 peaks/cycle = 120 peaks/s. For 50 Hz: 100 peaks/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the main reason AC is used for long-distance power transmission?",
        "options": [
          "AC travels faster through copper wires than DC.",
          "AC can be easily stepped up to high voltages to reduce heat loss.",
          "AC is safer to touch than DC at high voltages.",
          "AC does not require a return wire."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Transformers (AC only) efficiently step up voltage for transmission (reducing $I^2R$ losses), then step down for safe use. High-voltage DC transmission exists but requires expensive converter stations."

          "5V",
          "10V",
          "14.1V",
          "40V"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "$V_{p-p} = 2V_{peak}$, so $V_{peak} = V_{p-p}/2 = 20/2 = 10\\text{ V}$. RMS: $V_{rms} = V_{peak}/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 7.07\\text{ V}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At what point in a sine wave cycle is the induced EMF (voltage) at its maximum in an AC generator?",
        "options": [
          "When the magnetic flux through the coil is at its maximum.",
          "When the coil is moving parallel to the magnetic field lines.",
          "When the rate of change of magnetic flux is highest.",
          "When the coil is at rest."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Faraday's Law: $\\varepsilon = -d\\Phi/dt$. Maximum EMF occurs when flux change rate is maximum, not when flux is maximum. For coil rotating in uniform field: maximum EMF when coil is parallel to field lines (zero flux but maximum $d\\Phi/dt$)."
