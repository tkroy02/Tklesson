    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels 60 km north in 1 hour, then 60 km south in 1 hour. Which statement is correct?",
        "options": [
          "Average speed is 60 km/h, average velocity is 0 km/h",
          "Average speed is 0 km/h, average velocity is 60 km/h",
          "Both average speed and velocity are 60 km/h",
          "Both average speed and velocity are 0 km/h"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average speed = total distance/time = 120 km/2 h = 60 km/h. Average velocity = displacement/time = 0 km/2 h = 0 km/h (start and end at same point)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two identical balls are dropped from the same height. Ball A falls straight down, Ball B is thrown horizontally. Which hits the ground first?",
        "options": [
          "Ball A hits first",
          "Ball B hits first",
          "They hit at the same time",
          "It depends on how hard Ball B was thrown"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion. Both have the same initial vertical velocity (0 m/s) and acceleration (g), so they hit simultaneously."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A graph shows an object's velocity decreasing uniformly from 20 m/s to 0 m/s in 5 seconds. What is the acceleration?",
        "options": [
          "4 m/s²",
          "-4 m/s²",
          "100 m/s²",
          "-100 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acceleration = (v_f - v_i)/t = (0 - 20)/5 = -4 m/s². The negative sign indicates deceleration."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do passengers lurch forward when a bus suddenly stops?",
        "options": [
          "The bus pulls them forward",
          "Their inertia keeps them moving forward",
          "Friction with the seat pushes them",
          "Gravity suddenly increases"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This demonstrates Newton's First Law - objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Passengers continue moving forward while the bus stops."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spaceship fires its engines in deep space where gravity is negligible. What happens to its motion?",

          "It immediately stops when engines turn off",
          "It continues at constant speed when engines turn off",
          "It slows down gradually after engines turn off",
          "It curves in a circle"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In space with no external forces, Newton's First Law applies: an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it harder to push a heavy box on carpet than on ice?",
        "options": [

          "The box has more mass on carpet",
          "Friction is greater on carpet",
          "Air pressure is higher on carpet"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Carpet has higher coefficient of friction than ice, requiring more force to overcome static friction and start motion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A book rests on a table. What is the reaction force to the book's weight?",

          "Book pulling Earth upward",
          "Earth pulling book downward",
          "Table pushing down on floor"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law: For every action force (Earth pulling book down), there's an equal opposite reaction force (book pulling Earth up)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do rockets work in space where there's no air to push against?",
        "options": [
          "They push against space itself",
          "Newton's Third Law doesn't require air",
          "They use magnetic fields",
          "Solar wind pushes them"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Rockets expel mass backward, and the reaction force pushes the rocket forward. This works in vacuum due to Newton's Third Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car rounds a curve at constant speed. Why is it accelerating?",
        "options": [
          "Speed is changing",
          "Direction is changing",
          "Both speed and direction change",
          "The engine provides constant force"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Acceleration includes any change in velocity, which has both speed and direction. Changing direction requires centripetal acceleration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do sharp knives cut better than dull knives?",
        "options": [
          "They have less surface area, creating more pressure",
          "They are usually made of better metal",
          "They have more mass per area",
          "They create less friction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pressure = Force/Area. Sharp knives have smaller cutting area, so same force creates much higher pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ball is dropped from rest. What happens to its energy during the fall?",
        "options": [
          "Potential energy decreases, kinetic energy increases",
          "Potential energy increases, kinetic energy decreases",
          "Both potential and kinetic energy decrease",
          "Both potential and kinetic energy increase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As height decreases, gravitational potential energy decreases. This converts to kinetic energy, increasing speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't a perpetual motion machine exist?",
        "options": [
          "It violates the Law of Conservation of Energy",
          "Friction can never be eliminated",
          "Gravity always slows objects down",
          "Air resistance is always present"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy cannot be created or destroyed. A perpetual motion machine would create energy from nothing, violating conservation laws."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two cars collide and stick together. Why is kinetic energy not conserved?",
        "options": [
          "The cars are damaged",
          "It's an inelastic collision",
          "Momentum isn't conserved",
          "Friction with the road"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In inelastic collisions, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not - some converts to heat, sound, and deformation energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do we use ramps to load heavy objects into trucks?",
        "options": [
          "Ramps increase the distance, decreasing required force",
          "Ramps reduce the object's weight",
          "Ramps increase friction",
          "Ramps make the object lighter"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work = Force × Distance. Ramps allow applying less force over longer distance to do the same work against gravity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What energy transformation occurs in a battery-powered flashlight?",
        "options": [
          "Chemical → Electrical → Light + Thermal",
          "Electrical → Chemical → Light",
          "Light → Electrical → Chemical",
          "Thermal → Chemical → Light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Batteries store chemical energy that becomes electrical energy, which powers the bulb to produce light (and waste heat)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student tests how surface texture affects friction. What is the independent variable?",

          "Surface texture",
          "Amount of friction",
          "Type of object",
          "Time of measurement"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The independent variable is what the experimenter changes intentionally - in this case, the surface texture."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Measurements show a ball falls 4.9 m in 1 second. Theory predicts 4.9 m. What should the student do next?",
        "options": [
          "Declare the theory proven",
          "Repeat the experiment multiple times",
          "Change the theory to match results",
          "Use a different ball"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Scientific conclusions require multiple trials to ensure results are reproducible, not due to chance or error."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An experiment finds plant growth increases with more light, but one plant with medium light grew most. What does this suggest?",
        "options": [
          "The hypothesis is completely wrong",
          "Other factors may affect growth",
          "The measurements are inaccurate",
          "Light has no effect on plants"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unexpected results often reveal additional variables (water, nutrients, temperature) that need investigation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is a control group important in experiments?",
        "options": [
          "It provides a baseline for comparison",
          "It makes the experiment more complex",
          "It guarantees the hypothesis is correct",
          "It reduces the number of variables"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The control group shows what happens without the experimental treatment, helping identify the treatment's actual effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A theory in science is best described as:",
        "options": [
          "A guess or speculation",
