    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics establishes the principle of:",
        "options": [
          "Thermal equilibrium and temperature measurement.",
          "Conservation of total energy in a system.",
          "The increase of disorder in isolated systems.",
          "The unattainability of absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Zeroth Law states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are in equilibrium with each other. This is the fundamental principle that allows thermometers to work and defines temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The First Law of Thermodynamics is a restatement of which fundamental principle?",
        "options": [
          "The Law of Conservation of Energy",
          "The Law of Universal Gravitation",
          "The Law of Conservation of Mass",
          "Newton's First Law of Motion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The First Law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed in form. The change in a system's internal energy equals the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the Second Law of Thermodynamics primarily describe?",
        "options": [
          "The direction of spontaneous processes and energy dispersal.",
          "The total energy content of the universe.",
          "The definition of absolute temperature.",
          "The behavior of systems at thermal equilibrium."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Second Law states that the total entropy (a measure of disorder or energy dispersal) of an isolated system always increases over time. It explains why heat flows from hot to cold and why perpetual motion machines are impossible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that:",
        "options": [
          "The entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero.",
          "Energy is always conserved in any thermodynamic process.",
          "All spontaneous processes increase the disorder of the universe.",
          "Heat always flows from a hotter object to a colder one."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Third Law establishes a clear reference point for entropy. It implies that absolute zero (0 K) is a theoretical limit that can be approached but never perfectly reached."
      },
      {
        type: "mcq",
        question: "In thermodynamics, the internal energy of a system is the total:",
        options: [
          "Kinetic and potential energy of all its particles.",
          "Heat content available to do work.",
          "Thermal radiation it emits.",
          "Energy it exchanges with its surroundings."
        ],
        answer: "A",
        explanation: "Internal energy is the sum of all the microscopic kinetic and potential energies of the molecules and atoms within the system. It is a state function, depending only on the current state of the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the First Law, if a system absorbs 100 J of heat and does 30 J of work on its surroundings, what is its change in internal energy?",
        "options": [
          "It increases by 70 J.",
          "It decreases by 70 J.",
          "It increases by 130 J.",
          "It remains unchanged."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔU = Q - W. Heat added (Q) is +100 J. Work done BY the system (W) is +30 J. So, ΔU = 100 J - 30 J = +70 J. The internal energy increases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which everyday observation is a direct consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics?",
        "options": [
          "A hot cup of coffee left on a table eventually cools down.",
          "A compressed spring will push back when released.",
          "Water will freeze when placed in a freezer.",
          "A battery can power a flashlight."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coffee cools because heat spontaneously disperses from the concentrated, high-temperature system (the coffee) into the more dispersed, lower-temperature surroundings (the room). This increase in total entropy is dictated by the Second Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two objects are at the same temperature, the Zeroth Law implies that:",
        "options": [
          "No net heat will flow between them.",
          "They have the same total internal energy.",
          "They are made of the same material.",
          "They will both be in equilibrium with a third object."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Zeroth Law defines thermal equilibrium: when two objects are at the same temperature, they are in thermal equilibrium, and there is no net flow of heat between them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The concept that 'you can't break even' in energy conversions is best described by which law?",
        "options": [
          "The Second Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The First Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Third Law of Thermodynamics"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The First Law says 'you can't win' (energy is conserved). The Second Law says 'you can't break even' because no process is 100% efficient; some energy is always dispersed as waste heat, increasing entropy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a negative change in internal energy (ΔU < 0) indicate about a system?",
        "options": [
          "The system has lost more energy than it has gained.",
          "The system's temperature has reached absolute zero.",
          "The system has become more disordered.",
          "The system has done no work on its surroundings."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative ΔU means the system's total internal energy has decreased. This happens if the system loses heat or has work done on it (or a combination)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is a perfectly efficient heat engine impossible?",
        "options": [
          "It would violate the Second Law by not increasing entropy.",
          "It would violate the First Law by creating energy.",
          "It would violate the Zeroth Law by having no temperature.",
          "It would violate the Third Law by reaching absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 100% efficient engine would convert all heat input into work with no waste heat expelled to a cold reservoir. This would mean no net increase in entropy, which violates the Second Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When you rub your hands together, they get warmer. In thermodynamic terms, this is because:",
        "options": [
          "Work is done on the system, increasing its internal energy.",
          "Heat is transferred from the surroundings to your hands.",
          "The entropy of your hands spontaneously decreases.",
          "Your hands reach thermal equilibrium with the air."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You are doing work on the system (your hands) through friction. This work input increases the internal energy of the system, which manifests as a temperature increase. (Q is approximately zero in this short time)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Third Law implies that reaching absolute zero is impossible because:",
        "options": [
          "It would require an infinite number of steps to remove the last bit of energy.",
          "It would violate the conservation of energy.",
          "All molecular motion would reverse direction.",
          "Time would stop at that temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As you get closer to 0 K, the efficiency of removing the next unit of heat approaches zero. To actually reach 0 K, you would need an infinite series of processes, making it practically and theoretically unattainable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation ΔU = Q - W, a positive value for W represents:",
        "options": [
          "Work done BY the system ON the surroundings.",
          "Work done ON the system BY the surroundings.",
          "The total work possible in the system.",
          "The wasted work due to friction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the standard physics convention, a positive W means the system is expanding or changing in a way that does work on its surroundings (e.g., a gas pushing a piston out), which costs the system energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which law explains why a scrambled egg never spontaneously unscrambles itself?",
        "options": [
          "The Second Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The First Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Third Law of Thermodynamics"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unscrambling the egg would be a decrease in the disorder (entropy) of the system. The Second Law states that for a spontaneous process, the total entropy of the universe must increase, so the egg stays scrambled."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system is isolated, what does the First Law tell us about its internal energy?",
        "options": [
          "It must remain constant.",
          "It must continuously increase.",
          "It must continuously decrease.",
          "It is exactly zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An isolated system cannot exchange heat (Q=0) or work (W=0) with its surroundings. Therefore, from ΔU = Q - W, the change in internal energy ΔU must be zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The statement 'Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body' is a classical expression of:",
        "options": [
          "The Second Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The First Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Third Law of Thermodynamics"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is the Clausius statement of the Second Law. If heat could flow from cold to hot by itself, it would decrease the total entropy of the universe, which is forbidden."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a gas expands rapidly against a vacuum (free expansion), its temperature can change even though no heat is exchanged and no work is done. This demonstrates that internal energy depends on:",
        "options": [
          "The state of the system (e.g., volume), not just temperature.",
          "The path taken during the process.",
          "The amount of entropy in the system.",
          "The external pressure applied to the system."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. But for real gases, internal energy can also depend on volume or pressure. This experiment shows U can change (ΔU ≠ 0) even with Q=0 and W=0, meaning U is a function of the system's state variables."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Third Law, what can be said about the motion of particles at absolute zero?",
        "options": [
          "They would be in their state of minimum possible energy.",
          "They would be completely motionless.",
          "They would be moving at the speed of light.",
          "Their motion would become perfectly predictable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Third Law suggests that a system at 0 K is in its quantum mechanical ground state. While there would be zero *thermal* motion, quantum mechanics dictates there is still a minimum, zero-point energy, so particles are not completely motionless."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which law provides the scientific basis for the feeling that 'things tend to wind down' or become more disordered over time?",
        "options": [
          "The Second Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The First Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Third Law of Thermodynamics"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Second Law's focus on increasing entropy gives a scientific foundation to this common observation. Energy becomes more dispersed and less available to do useful work, leading to the perception that systems 'run down.'"
