      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The specific heat capacity of water is 4,184 J/kg°C. What does this mean?",
        "options": [
          "It takes 4,184 Joules to heat 1 kg of water by 1°C.",
          "1 kg of water releases 4,184 Joules when it cools by 1°C.",

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The value works both for heating and cooling. It defines the energy required per mass per temperature change."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the difference between Heat Capacity and Specific Heat Capacity?",
        "options": [
          "Specific Heat Capacity is per unit mass; Heat Capacity is for the entire object.",
          "Heat Capacity is per unit mass; Specific Heat Capacity is for the entire object.",
          "They are the same thing.",
          "Heat Capacity is for solids, Specific Heat Capacity is for liquids."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Specific Heat Capacity (c) is an intensive property—it doesn't depend on the amount of material. Heat Capacity (C) is an extensive property—it depends on the object's total mass (C = m × c)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important to learn about specific heat capacity?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Q = m × c × ΔT = 2 kg × 900 J/kg°C × (40°C - 20°C) = 2 × 900 × 20 = 36,000 J."

          "Sand",
          "Concrete",
          "Iron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water has a very high specific heat capacity. It heats up and cools down slowly, absorbing and releasing large amounts of heat, which moderates the temperature of nearby land."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pot with 1.5 kg of water (c=4184 J/kg°C) loses 125,520 J of heat. What is its change in temperature?",
        "options": [

          "5°C decrease",
          "83.7°C decrease"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Q = m × c × ΔT → -125,520 J = 1.5 kg × 4184 J/kg°C × ΔT. ΔT = -125,520 / (1.5 × 4184) = -125,520 / 6276 = -20°C. The negative sign indicates a temperature decrease."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a piece of metal feel colder than a piece of wood at the same room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Metal has a lower specific heat capacity and is a better conductor.",
          "Wood has a lower temperature than metal.",

          "Wood absorbs heat from your hand."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metal is a good thermal conductor and has a relatively low specific heat capacity, so it quickly draws heat away from your hand, making it feel cold. Wood is a poor conductor and doesn't draw heat away as effectively."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How much heat is required to raise the temperature of 0.5 kg of copper (c = 385 J/kg°C) by 10°C?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Q = m × c × ΔT → 10,000 J = 1 kg × c × 5°C → c = 10,000 / 5 = 2,000 J/kg°C."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A swimming pool full of water and a cup of water are both at 25°C. Which has a higher Heat Capacity?",
        "options": [
          "The swimming pool",
          "The cup of water",
          "They have the same Heat Capacity.",
          "It cannot be determined."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat Capacity (C) depends on the total mass. The swimming pool has vastly more mass, so its total Heat Capacity (C = m × c) is much higher, even though the Specific Heat Capacity (c) is the same."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a car engine, why is coolant (a water-antifreeze mixture) used instead of just oil?",
        "options": [
          "Water-based coolant has a high specific heat capacity to absorb more engine heat.",
          "Oil is too expensive to use as a coolant.",
          "Water is a better lubricant than oil.",
          "Oil has a higher specific heat capacity than water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water has a very high specific heat capacity, meaning it can absorb a large amount of heat from the engine without its temperature skyrocketing, making it an efficient coolant."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Q = m × c × ΔT → 450 J = 0.1 kg × c × (75°C - 25°C) → 450 = 0.1 × c × 50 → 450 = 5c → c = 90 J/kg°C."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do bakers often use clay or stone pots instead of metal pans for some types of bread?",
        "options": [
          "Clay/stone has a higher heat capacity, providing steady, even heat.",
          "Metal pans get too hot too quickly.",
          "Clay is cheaper than metal.",
