    "duration": 40,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car travels at a constant speed of 20 m/s. Which of the following statements is TRUE?",
        "options": [
          "The net force on the car is zero.",
          "The car is not accelerating, so no forces are acting on it.",
          "The car's acceleration is constant and positive.",
          "The force of the engine is balanced by the force of inertia."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constant speed in a straight line (constant velocity) means no acceleration. According to Newton's First Law, if there is no acceleration, the net force must be zero. Forces like engine thrust and friction are balanced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The slope of a line on a distance-time graph represents:",
        "options": [
          "Speed",
          "Acceleration",
          "Force",
          "Energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Slope = Rise/Run. On a distance-time graph, this is Change in Distance / Change in Time, which is the definition of speed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a velocity-time graph, a straight line with a positive slope indicates:",
        "options": [
          "Constant positive acceleration",
          "Constant speed",
          "Constant negative acceleration",
          "Zero acceleration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The slope of a velocity-time graph is the change in velocity over time, which is acceleration. A positive slope means velocity is increasing at a constant rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1,500 kg car accelerates from 10 m/s to 20 m/s. What is the change in its kinetic energy?",

          "75,000 J",
          "300,000 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔKE = ½m(v_f² - v_i²) = ½ × 1500 kg × ((20 m/s)² - (10 m/s)²) = 750 kg × (400 - 100) m²/s² = 750 × 300 = 225,000 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "240 J",
          "600 J",
          "150 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work against gravity = Increase in GPE = m × g × h = 60 kg × 10 m/s² × 4 m = 2,400 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the person from the previous question took 8 seconds to climb the stairs, what was their average power output?",
        "options": [
          "300 W",
          "2,400 W",
          "30 W",
          "480 W"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Power = Work / Time = 2,400 J / 8 s = 300 Watts."
      },
      {

        "options": [
          "The book pulling up on the Earth",

          "The book pushing down on the table",
          "There is no reaction force"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newton's Third Law: The force pairs are equal and opposite and act on two different objects. The Earth pulls the book down (action), and the book pulls the Earth up (reaction)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A satellite orbits Earth at a constant speed. Why is it accelerating?",
        "options": [
          "Because its direction is constantly changing.",
          "Because gravity is increasing its speed.",
          "Because it is constantly gaining altitude.",
          "It is not accelerating because its speed is constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acceleration is a change in velocity, which has both speed and direction. Even at constant speed, moving in a circle means the direction is always changing, so the satellite is accelerating."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A spring with a spring constant of 400 N/m is compressed by 0.1 meters. How much elastic potential energy is stored?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elastic PE = ½ × k × x² = ½ × 400 N/m × (0.1 m)² = 200 × 0.01 = 2 Joules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which scenario best demonstrates the transformation from elastic potential energy to kinetic energy?",
        "options": [
          "Releasing a stretched rubber band",
          "A ball rolling to a stop on grass",
          "Lifting a book onto a shelf",
          "Burning a piece of wood"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A stretched rubber band has elastic potential energy. When released, this energy is transformed into the kinetic energy of the rubber band's motion."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 5 N force pushes a box 3 m across a floor. The force of friction opposing the motion is 2 N. What is the net work done on the box?",
        "options": [
          "9 J",
          "15 J",
          "6 J",
          "1 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net Work = Net Force × Distance. Net Force = 5 N (push) - 2 N (friction) = 3 N. Work = 3 N × 3 m = 9 Joules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An object is dropped from rest. Ignoring air resistance, which graph best represents its velocity over time?",

          "A straight line with a positive slope",
          "A horizontal line",
          "A straight line with a negative slope",
          "A curved line sloping upwards"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When dropped, an object accelerates downward due to gravity at a constant rate (≈9.8 m/s²). Constant acceleration means velocity increases linearly with time, creating a straight, positively-sloped line on a velocity-time graph."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Two forces act on an object: 10 N to the North and 15 N to the South. What is the net force?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Forces in opposite directions subtract. Net Force = 15 N South - 10 N North = 5 N South."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A machine has a work input of 100 J and a work output of 80 J. What is its efficiency?",

          "80%",
          "20%",
          "125%",
          "180%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency = (Useful Work Output / Work Input) × 100% = (80 J / 100 J) × 100% = 80%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

          "Zero, zero",
          "9.8 m/s downward, 9.8 m/s² downward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the top, it momentarily stops, so velocity is zero. However, gravity is still acting on it, pulling it down, so its acceleration is 9.8 m/s² downward the entire time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you double the speed of a car, the distance needed to stop it (assuming constant braking force) will be:",

          "Twice as long",
          "The same",
          "Half as long"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The work done by brakes (Force × Distance) must equal the kinetic energy (½mv²). If speed doubles, KE quadruples (2²=4), so the stopping distance must also quadruple."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the weight of a 50 kg object on Earth? (Use g = 10 m/s²)",

          "Distance = 800 m, Displacement = 800 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Distance is the total path length (2 × 400 m = 800 m). Displacement is the straight-line distance from start to end point. Since they finish where they started, displacement is 0 m."

          "Speed",
          "Time"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Area = Velocity × Time. Velocity × Time gives a unit of meters (e.g., (m/s)×s = m), which is displacement."

          "Chemical energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "On a frictionless surface, mechanical energy is conserved. The loss in height (and thus GPE) results in a gain in speed (and thus KE)."
