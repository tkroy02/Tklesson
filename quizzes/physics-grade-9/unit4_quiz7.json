        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "1. Calculate Weight ($W$): $W = m \\cdot g = (500 \\text{ kg})(9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2) = 4,900 \\text{ N}$. 2. Compare Forces: The upward applied force ($F_{applied} = 4,700 \\text{ N}$) is less than the downward weight ($W = 4,900 \\text{ N}$). 3. Determine Motion: Since the applied force is insufficient to overcome gravity, the object does not lift. Because it is initially at rest and cannot accelerate downward (due to the surface), the acceleration must be zero, and the object remains at rest."
