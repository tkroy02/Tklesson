    "duration": 30,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Kinetic Theory of Matter states that all matter is composed of particles that are:",
        "options": [
          "In constant, random motion.",
          "Stationary and fixed in place.",
          "Only moving when heat is applied.",
          "Orbiting a central nucleus in defined paths."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The core idea of the kinetic theory is that the particles of all matter (atoms, molecules) are in endless, random motion. The energy of this motion is what we perceive as heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are the particles in a solid held in fixed positions?",
        "options": [
          "Strong intermolecular forces overcome the particles' vibrational motion.",
          "They have no kinetic energy and cannot move.",
          "External pressure forces them into a rigid structure.",
          "Their electrical charges cancel out, locking them in place."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a solid, the attractive forces between particles are very strong. The particles do have kinetic energy (they vibrate), but this energy is not enough to overcome the forces holding them in their fixed, closely-packed arrangement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason gases fill their container and have no definite shape or volume?",
        "options": [
          "The particles have high kinetic energy and negligible attractive forces.",
          "Gas particles are repelled by the walls of the container.",
          "Gases have a lower density than solids or liquids.",
          "The particles are electrically charged and spread out."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gas particles move rapidly and randomly in straight lines. The forces of attraction between them are extremely weak, so they do not stick together and will spread out to fill the entire volume of any container."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a solid is heated, the increased thermal energy primarily causes the particles to:",
        "options": [
          "Vibrate more vigorously about their fixed positions.",
          "Break their chemical bonds and change identity.",
          "Move in straight lines at constant speed.",
          "Emit light and other forms of radiation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a solid, adding heat increases the kinetic energy of the particles. Since they are held in place by strong forces, this increased energy manifests as more intense vibration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The process where particles spread out and mix spontaneously, like a drop of food coloring in water, is called:",
        "options": [
          "Diffusion",
          "Effusion",
          "Dispersion",
          "Convection"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration due to their random motion. It occurs in all states but is fastest in gases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does diffusion happen faster in gases than in liquids?",
        "options": [
          "Gas particles have higher speeds and more space between them.",
          "Liquid particles are repelled by solute particles.",
          "Gases are less dense and therefore mix more easily.",
          "The force of gravity has a greater effect on liquids."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gas particles have much higher average kinetic energy and move at high speeds. They also have large spaces between them, allowing them to travel farther before colliding, leading to rapid mixing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'skin-like' surface of a liquid that allows insects to walk on water is due to:",
        "options": [
          "Surface Tension",
          "Capillary Action",
          "Viscosity",
          "Atmospheric Pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Surface tension is a property of a liquid's surface that allows it to resist an external force. It is caused by the cohesive forces between liquid molecules at the surface, which pull inward, creating a 'tight' film."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the average kinetic energy of particles when a substance is cooled?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases.",
          "It increases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It becomes zero at room temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. Cooling a substance reduces its temperature, which means the particles, on average, are moving more slowly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The spontaneous rising of water in a thin glass tube is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "Capillary Action",
          "Surface Tension",
          "Osmotic Pressure",
          "Gravitational Pull"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, or even in opposition to, external forces like gravity. It is caused by the interplay between cohesive (liquid-liquid) and adhesive (liquid-tube) forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which state of matter do particles have the most freedom of movement?",
        "options": [
          "Gas",
          "Liquid",
          "Solid",
          "Plasma"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gas particles have enough kinetic energy to completely overcome the attractive forces between them. They move independently in straight lines at high speeds, colliding with each other and the container walls."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a liquid have a definite volume but not a definite shape?",
        "options": [
          "Particles can slide past one another but are still held close together.",
          "The particles are locked in place but the container can change.",
          "The particles are too far apart to form a fixed structure.",
          "External pressure forces the liquid to take its container's shape."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a liquid, the particles are close together (giving a definite volume), but the kinetic energy is high enough for them to overcome the fixed positions, allowing them to flow and take the shape of their container."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you smell perfume from across a room, the Kinetic Theory explains this through:",
        "options": [
          "The diffusion of gas particles through the air.",
          "The convection currents carrying the scent.",
          "The radiation of 'scent waves' from the bottle.",
          "The evaporation of the perfume into a plasma."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perfume evaporates into a gas. These gas particles are in constant, random motion, diffusing from an area of high concentration (near the bottle) to low concentration (across the room), eventually reaching your nose."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary cause of Brownian motion, such as pollen grains jiggling on water?",
        "options": [
          "Continuous, uneven bombardment by invisible water molecules.",
          "Tiny currents and convection in the liquid.",
          "Static electricity building up on the particles.",
          "The particles are alive and moving on their own."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Brownian motion provides direct evidence for the kinetic theory. The visible jiggling of the pollen grain is caused by millions of smaller, invisible water molecules constantly and randomly colliding with it from all sides."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Adding soap to water reduces its surface tension. This is because soap molecules:",
        "options": [
          "Interfere with the cohesive forces between water molecules.",
          "Make the water molecules heavier and less mobile.",
          "Increase the adhesive forces with the air above.",
          "Cool down the surface of the water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Soap molecules are surfactants. They get between water molecules, weakening the strong hydrogen bonding (cohesive forces) that create high surface tension. This is why soapy water can form bubbles and wet surfaces more easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the kinetic theory, the pressure exerted by a gas in a container is due to:",
        "options": [
          "Particles colliding with the walls of the container.",
          "The weight of the gas particles pressing down.",
          "Magnetic fields generated by the moving particles.",
          "The chemical reactions between the gas and the container."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gas pressure is the result of the vast number of collisions of gas particles with the walls of their container. Each collision exerts a tiny force, and the sum of all these forces per unit area is the gas pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does water rise higher in a very narrow tube than in a wide one?",
        "options": [
          "The adhesive forces have a greater effect relative to the volume of water in a narrow tube.",
          "Gravity has less effect on small amounts of water.",
          "The air pressure is lower inside a narrow tube.",
          "The water molecules are compressed and pushed upwards."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Capillary rise is inversely proportional to the radius of the tube. In a narrower tube, the circumference (where adhesion occurs) is larger relative to the cross-sectional area (volume of water being lifted), so the adhesive forces can pull the column of water higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the speed of diffusion if the temperature of a substance is increased?",
        "options": [
          "It increases because the particles move faster.",
          "It decreases because the particles collide more often.",
          "It stays the same because the concentration hasn't changed.",
          "It stops because the particles have too much energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing temperature increases the average kinetic energy of the particles. Faster-moving particles will mix and spread out more quickly, increasing the rate of diffusion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The particles in a liquid are arranged:",
        "options": [
          "Randomly but close together, allowing them to flow.",
          "In a regular, repeating, three-dimensional pattern.",
          "Far apart with no regular arrangement.",
          "In flat layers that can slide over one another."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Liquids have a disordered or amorphous structure. The particles are close enough to touch, giving a definite volume, but the arrangement is random, not fixed, which allows for fluidity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do liquids with strong adhesive forces (like water and glass) have a concave meniscus?",
        "options": [
          "The adhesive forces pulling the liquid up the glass are stronger than the cohesive forces within the liquid.",
          "The cohesive forces within the liquid are stronger than the adhesive forces with the glass.",
          "Air pressure pushes down harder on the center of the surface.",
          "The glass tube expands at the top, creating a dip."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A concave meniscus (curving upwards) occurs when the liquid is attracted to the container wall (adhesion) more strongly than it is attracted to itself (cohesion). The water molecules 'climb' the walls, pulling the surface with them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The kinetic theory explains a gas's ability to be compressed by stating that:",
        "options": [
          "There is a great deal of empty space between the gas particles.",
          "Gas particles are soft and can be squeezed into a smaller size.",
          "The particles break apart under high pressure.",
          "The particles slow down and take up less room."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike solids or liquids, the particles in a gas are separated by large distances relative to their size. Compressing a gas simply forces the particles closer together, reducing the empty space."
