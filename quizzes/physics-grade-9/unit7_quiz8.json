      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does spraying water on a hot road create a cooling effect?",
        "options": [
          "The water's high heat of vaporization pulls energy from the surroundings.",
          "The cold water conducts heat away rapidly as it warms up.",
          "The water reflects solar radiation into the atmosphere.",
          "The water's high specific heat capacity lowers the air temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water has a very high 'heat of vaporization'. As it evaporates, it pulls a large amount of thermal energy from its surroundings (the road and air), creating a cooling effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary thermal reason for wearing light-colored clothing in summer?",
        "options": [
          "To reflect a large portion of incoming solar radiation.",
          "To absorb less visible light from the environment.",
          "To allow for better convection cooling around the body.",
          "To store less thermal energy due to lower heat capacity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is about radiation. Light, shiny surfaces are poor absorbers and good reflectors of radiant energy, including infrared radiation from the sun."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a wooden spoon handle feel cooler than a metal one in a hot pot?",
        "options": [
          "Wood is a poor thermal conductor, slowing heat transfer to your hand.",
          "Metal has a lower specific heat, so it feels hotter faster.",
          "Wood absorbs the heat into its core, away from the handle.",
          "The natural moisture in wood provides a cooling effect."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is about conduction. Metals are good thermal conductors, so heat moves rapidly to your hand. Wood is a good insulator, drastically slowing this heat transfer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A ceramic mug is preferred for hot drinks over a thin metal cup because:",
        "options": [
          "Ceramic is a poor conductor and has a higher heat capacity.",
          "Ceramic is a better conductor than most metals.",
          "The glaze on ceramic actively reflects heat inward.",
          "Metal reacts chemically with hot beverages."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ceramic's poor conductivity slows heat transfer to your hand, and its higher specific heat capacity means it doesn't heat up as quickly as metal, providing a more comfortable grip."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Bricks in building construction help moderate indoor temperatures because they:",
        "options": [
          "Store heat during the day and release it slowly at night.",
          "Block all heat transfer through the walls completely.",
          "Have very low density, preventing heat absorption.",
          "Create an insulating layer of still air inside them."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Materials with high specific heat capacity (like brick) act as 'thermal mass,' absorbing heat during the day and slowly releasing it at night, smoothing out temperature swings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The chill felt after swimming is mainly caused by:",
        "options": [
          "Energy absorption during water evaporation from the skin.",
          "Heat conduction from the body to the remaining water droplets.",
          "Convection currents carrying away body heat rapidly.",
          "Radiation of body heat into the cooler surrounding air."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is another application of the high heat of vaporization of water. As the water on your skin evaporates, it uses your body heat as the energy source, leaving you feeling cooler."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A black car interior gets hotter than a white one because dark colors:",
        "options": [
          "Are efficient absorbers across the electromagnetic spectrum.",
          "Have a higher natural temperature than light colors.",
          "Prevent heat from escaping through re-radiation.",
          "Generate more heat through chemical processes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Black surfaces are good absorbers of radiant energy across many wavelengths, including the infrared spectrum, converting more solar energy into heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Stainless steel is used for cookware bottoms primarily due to its:",
        "options": [
          "High thermal conductivity for even heat distribution.",
          "High specific heat capacity for heat retention.",
          "Low density, making it lightweight for handling.",
          "Chemical inertness, preventing food reactions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the bottom of a pot, you *want* a good conductor to efficiently transfer heat from the burner to the food evenly, preventing hot spots that can burn the food."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sidewalk feels hotter than adjacent grass because the grass:",
        "options": [
          "Uses solar energy for biological processes, not just heating.",
          "Has a much higher albedo, reflecting most sunlight.",
          "Contains water that conducts heat deep into the soil.",
          "Is usually in shade from buildings and trees."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Concrete absorbs radiant energy and turns it directly into heat. Grass also absorbs energy, but a significant portion is used for transpiration and photosynthesis rather than just heating the surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Steam at 100°C causes worse burns than water at 100°C because:",
        "options": [
          "It releases the heat of vaporization upon condensing on skin.",
          "Gas molecules carry more kinetic energy than liquid molecules.",
          "Steam can penetrate deeper into skin tissues than water.",
          "The phase change from gas to liquid creates a vacuum effect."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When steam touches your skin, it first condenses, releasing the 'heat of vaporization.' Then, the resulting hot water cools, releasing more heat. This double release makes steam burns much worse."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The effectiveness of down jackets primarily comes from:",
        "options": [
          "Trapping insulating air pockets that reduce conduction.",
          "The high specific heat capacity of the down material.",
          "Reflecting body heat back toward the skin surface.",
          "Generating metabolic heat through feather friction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary function of most insulation is to prevent conduction. Still air is a very poor conductor. Down creates a layer filled with countless tiny, still air pockets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Adding salt to boiling water for cooking affects the process by:",
        "options": [
          "Raising the boiling point of the water slightly.",
          "Increasing the thermal conductivity of the water.",
          "Lowering the specific heat capacity of the water.",
          "Creating nucleation sites for more vigorous boiling."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding a solute like salt raises the boiling point of water through boiling point elevation. This means the water can get slightly hotter than 100°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An ice cube melts in your hand primarily due to:",
        "options": [
          "Heat conduction from your hand providing the heat of fusion.",
          "Radiant heat from your hand melting the surface.",
          "Pressure from your grip lowering its melting point.",
          "Convection currents transferring room heat to the ice."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Your hand is warmer than the ice. Heat flows from your hand to the ice through conduction. This energy transfer provides the 'heat of fusion' needed to melt the ice."
