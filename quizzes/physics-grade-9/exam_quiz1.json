    "Normal Force",
    "Friction",
    "Net Force"
  ],
  "answer": ["A", "B"],
  "explanation": "Gravity pulls downward, and the normal force pushes upward from the table. Net force is not a separate force—it is the vector sum of all forces. Friction is not acting because the book is motionless with no applied force trying to slide it."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Only gravity acts on the ball. Weight = $mg = 0.5 \\times 10 = 5\\text{ N}$ downward. No other forces, so net force = $5\\text{ N}$ downward."
