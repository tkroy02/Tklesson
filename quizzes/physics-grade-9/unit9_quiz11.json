        "question": "In the circuit shown, R1 = 4 Ω and R2 = 6 Ω are in series, and this combination is in parallel with R3 = 12 Ω. What is the total resistance?",
        "options": [
          "5 Ω",

          "8 Ω",
          "12 Ω"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First, series combination: R_series = 4 + 6 = 10 Ω. Then parallel with R3: 1/R_total = 1/10 + 1/12 = 6/60 + 5/60 = 11/60. R_total = 60/11 ≈ 5.45 Ω. Wait, let me recalculate: 1/10 = 0.1, 1/12 ≈ 0.0833, sum = 0.1833, R_total = 1/0.1833 ≈ 5.45 Ω. My apologies, the correct calculation shows approximately 5.45 Ω, so the closest answer is 5 Ω."

        "explanation": "Parallel combination: 1/R_parallel = 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4, so R_parallel = 4 Ω. Series with 4 Ω: R_total = 4 + 4 = 8 Ω."

Voltage across parallel combination = I × R_parallel = 2.5 A × 2 Ω = 5 V. Wait, let me recalculate: Voltage divider: V_parallel = 10 V × (2 Ω / 4 Ω) = 10 × 0.5 = 5 V.

Voltage across parallel combination = 2 A × 4 Ω = 8 V. Current through 6 Ω = 8 V / 6 Ω ≈ 1.33 A. Let me recalculate more precisely: Current through 6 Ω = 8 V / 6 Ω = 1.33 A.

Voltage across parallel combination = 1.5 A × 5 Ω = 7.5 V. Current through R2 = 7.5 V / 10 Ω = 0.75 A. Wait, let me check: Current through each 10 Ω resistor = 7.5 V / 10 Ω = 0.75 A.
