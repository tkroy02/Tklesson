      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sam discovered a glowing object he named 'Raftan' and immediately published his findings online before proper testing. He then conducted lab tests measuring temperature, light response, and hardness.\n\nWhat was Sam's first major error in scientific approach?",
        "options": [
          "Giving the object a personal name before confirming anything about its nature",
          "Announcing conclusions publicly before gathering and evaluating experimental evidence",
          "Relying on simple laboratory tools without advanced instruments",
          "Carrying out the work without first assembling a formal research team"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Sam published his claims online before conducting proper experiments or seeking peer review, violating scientific principles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sam tested Raftan's properties systematically, then hypothesized it was a light-storing mineral. His light exposure experiment showed no correlation, so he revised his hypothesis to chemical reactions.\n\nAt what point did Sam first form a testable hypothesis?",
        "options": [
          "When he initially noticed that the object emitted a glow",
          "When he decided to refer to the object as 'Raftan'",
          "After his initial measurements allowed him to propose that it stores light",
          "After the exposure experiment failed and he switched to a chemical explanation"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Sam formed his first testable hypothesis after conducting initial observations and tests."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sam noticed Raftan's glow remained constant over several days without fading, and it maintained room temperature throughout his observations.\n\nWhich hypothesis about Raftan's energy source does this evidence challenge?",
        "options": [
          "That the glow is powered by slow internal chemical reactions using stored energy",
          "That the glow is produced by living cells in a bioluminescent process",
          "That the glow is due to the object absorbing light and then gradually re-emitting it",
          "That the glow is sustained by a subtle, continuous production of heat from within"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The constant glow without fading challenges the light absorption hypothesis, since stored light energy would typically diminish over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sam systematically tested Raftan's temperature, light response, and hardness before forming any hypotheses about its nature.\n\nWhich action demonstrated good scientific practice?",
        "options": [
          "Choosing a distinctive personal name for the object at the start of the study",
          "Collecting data on several different properties in a structured, methodical way",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When Sam's light exposure experiment with Raftan failed, he returned to the hypothesis stage and proposed chemical reactions instead of light storage.\n\nWas this scientifically appropriate?",
        "options": [
          "No, because changing direction after a single experiment shows inconsistency",
          "No, because he should have repeated exactly the same experiment several more times first",
          "Yes, because adjusting hypotheses in response to data is how scientific understanding progresses",
          "Yes, but only if he completely replaced his previous methods and discarded earlier data"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Returning to reformulate hypotheses based on experimental results is normal scientific process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sam tested Raftan with basic lab equipment but didn't consult experts or research similar glowing materials in scientific literature.\n\nWhat should he do next to improve his investigation?",
        "options": [
          "Immediately share his updated interpretation with the public to gain attention",
          "Reach out to specialists in materials science or related fields for feedback",
          "Design a more complicated set of experiments using additional variables",
          "Concentrate mainly on collecting data that supports his new preferred hypothesis"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Consulting domain experts would provide valuable insights and help avoid oversights."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sam handled the unknown glowing Raftan object without safety precautions and published claims before verification.\n\nWhat ethical consideration did he violate?",
        "options": [
          "Following appropriate safety protocols when dealing with unknown materials",
          "Correctly citing and crediting all previous contributors to the field",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Studying a single object (n=1) makes it difficult to draw general conclusions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Sam questioned his initial Raftan hypothesis when experimental evidence contradicted it and proposed an alternative explanation.\n\nHow did he demonstrate scientific integrity?",

      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "options": [
          "He treated the change in exposure time itself as an adequate control condition",
          "He completely left out any separate control object for meaningful comparison",
