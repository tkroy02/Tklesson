    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wave is best defined as a disturbance that:",
        "options": [
          "Transfers energy without transferring matter.",
          "Moves particles permanently from a source.",
          "Creates new energy as it propagates.",
          "Requires a physical medium to exist."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A wave is a disturbance or oscillation that travels through space and matter, transferring energy from one point to another. The particles of the medium oscillate but return to their original position; they do not travel with the wave."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which type of wave do particles oscillate perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel?",
        "options": [
          "Transverse wave",
          "Longitudinal wave",
          "Sound wave in air",
          "Pressure wave in water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a transverse wave, the disturbance is at right angles to the direction of energy transfer. Think of a wave on a string: the string moves up and down, but the wave moves horizontally."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What type of wave is characterized by alternating compressions and rarefactions?",
        "options": [
          "Longitudinal wave",
          "Transverse wave",
          "Electromagnetic wave",
          "Surface wave"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a longitudinal wave, particles vibrate parallel to the wave direction, creating regions of compression (high density) and rarefaction (low density). Sound waves are longitudinal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main distinction between mechanical and electromagnetic waves is that:",
        "options": [
          "Mechanical waves require a physical medium.",
          "Electromagnetic waves travel slower in vacuum.",
          "Mechanical waves are always invisible.",
          "Electromagnetic waves cannot be reflected."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mechanical waves (e.g., sound, water waves) need a material medium (solid, liquid, gas) to travel through. Electromagnetic waves (e.g., light, radio) are oscillations of electric and magnetic fields and can propagate through a vacuum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which phenomenon demonstrates a transverse wave?",
        "options": [
          "Light waves from the sun",
          "Sound waves from a speaker",
          "Seismic P-waves in rock",
          "Ultrasound in medical imaging"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Light is an electromagnetic wave, which is transverse. The electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The distance between two consecutive wave crests is called the:",

          "Amplitude",
          "Frequency",
          "Period"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wavelength (λ) is the spatial period of the wave—the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is measured from any point on one wave to the corresponding point on the next wave."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a wave's frequency increases while its speed remains constant, its wavelength must:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease",
          "Increase",
          "Remain unchanged",
          "Become zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From v = f × λ, if v is constant and f increases, then λ must decrease to maintain the equality. More waves must fit into the same space if they are passing by faster."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the period of a wave that completes 20 cycles in 4 seconds?",

          "1503 Hz"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the wave equation: f = v / λ = 1500 m/s / 3 m = 500 Hz."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a longitudinal wave, the region where particles are farthest apart is called a:",
        "options": [
          "Rarefaction",
          "Compression",
          "Crest",
          "Trough"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rarefactions are the low-pressure areas in longitudinal waves where particles are spread out. Compressions are where particles are bunched together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which wave property determines its loudness or brightness?",
        "options": [
          "Amplitude",
          "Wavelength",
          "Frequency",
          "Speed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amplitude is the maximum displacement from equilibrium. A wave with a larger amplitude carries more energy, resulting in a louder sound or brighter light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a wave's speed when it moves from air into water?",
        "options": [
          "It changes due to different medium properties.",
          "It remains constant in all media.",
          "It always decreases in denser media.",
          "It depends only on the wave's frequency."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wave speed depends on the properties of the medium (density, elasticity). For mechanical waves, speed typically changes when entering a different medium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A wave with a frequency of 440 Hz has a period of approximately:",

          "0.44 seconds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Period T = 1/f = 1/440 Hz ≈ 0.00227 seconds, or about 0.0023 seconds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about electromagnetic waves is correct?",
        "options": [
          "They can travel through empty space.",
          "They require air molecules to propagate.",
          "They are always longitudinal waves.",
          "They move slower than sound waves."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electromagnetic waves are oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that can propagate through the vacuum of space, unlike mechanical waves which require a medium."
      },
      {

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First find frequency: f = 1/T = 1/0.5 s = 2 Hz. Then v = f × λ = 2 Hz × 2 m = 4 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The wave equation v = fλ demonstrates that:",
        "options": [
          "Frequency and wavelength are inversely related for constant speed.",
          "Speed increases with both frequency and wavelength.",
          "Waves always travel at the same speed.",
          "Higher frequency waves have longer wavelengths."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For a constant wave speed, if frequency increases, wavelength must decrease proportionally, and vice versa. They have an inverse relationship."
      },
