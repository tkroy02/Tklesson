        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formula is °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9. So, (98 - 32) = 66. 66 × 5/9 = 330/9 ≈ 36.7°C, which rounds to about 37°C (normal human body temperature)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "question": "Why does the liquid in a thermometer rise when it gets warmer?",
        "options": [
          "The liquid particles move faster and spread out, causing expansion.",
          "The liquid becomes less dense and floats higher.",
          "The glass tube contracts, pushing the liquid up.",
          "Gravity has less effect on the warm liquid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When heated, the particles of the liquid gain kinetic energy, vibrate more, and push each other slightly farther apart. This increase in volume forces the liquid to rise in the narrow tube."

          "Thermal energies",
          "Specific heats"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A good thermal conductor (like metal) quickly draws heat away from your hand, making it feel cold. A poor conductor (like wood) does not, so it feels closer to room temperature. Their actual temperatures are the same."

          "The water has two different temperatures at once."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If two thermometers at the same temperature give different readings, it indicates a calibration error in one or both instruments. They need to be checked against a known standard."
      },
