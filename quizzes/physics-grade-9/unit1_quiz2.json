        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The readings are close to each other (precise) but are all significantly far from the true value (not accurate). This suggests a systematic error, like the scale needing calibration."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an experiment on memory, participants who sleep 8 hours recall 80% of words, while those who sleep 4 hours recall 60%. The 'amount of sleep' is the:",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "These are controlled variables. Keeping them constant ensures that any change in the dependent variable is due only to the manipulation of the independent variable."

    "0cm, 2cm, 4cm, 8cm, 16cm, 20cm, 24cm"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The scale '0cm, 4cm, 8cm, 12cm, 16cm, 20cm, 24cm' is the best choice. It uses a consistent interval of 4 cm, which cleanly accommodates the entire data range from 0cm to 24cm. All the data points (3, 7, 12, 15, 19, 24) will fit neatly within this scale, making the graph easy to plot and read."

          "Ask the student how focused they feel.",
          "Count the number of problems solved correctly in a set time.",
          "Measure the heart rate.",
          "Record the genre of music played."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A quantifiable, objective measure like 'number of problems solved correctly' is a more reliable and valid dependent variable than a subjective feeling."

          "The control group is larger than the experimental group."
        ],
        "answer": "B",

  "options": [
    "1",

  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The standard, preferred scale intervals are typically 1, 2, 5, and multiples of 10 thereof (like 10, 20, 0.1, 0.2, etc.). The number 4 is generally avoided because it does not create intervals that are as easy to mentally subdivide and interpret quickly as those based on 1, 2, or 5."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
