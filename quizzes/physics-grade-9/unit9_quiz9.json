        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In series, current is the same everywhere: 0.4 A. Total resistance = 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 Ω. Source voltage V = I × R_total = 0.4 A × 30 Ω = 12 V."

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In a series circuit, there is only one path for current. If any component fails open, the circuit is broken and current stops completely."
