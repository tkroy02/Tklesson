    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the key difference between heat and temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Heat is total energy; temperature is average energy.",
          "Temperature is total energy; heat is average energy.",
          "They are the same thing, just different units.",
          "Heat is measured in °C, temperature is measured in Joules."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat (Q) is the total thermal energy transferred. Temperature (T) is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. A bathtub of water (more heat) can be the same temperature as a cup of water (less heat)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of thermal physics, what is the relationship between the terms 'thermal energy' and 'heat energy'?",
        "options": [
          "They are generally used to mean the same thing.",
          "Thermal energy is stored, heat is energy in transfer.",
          "Heat energy is stored, thermal energy is in transfer.",
          "Thermal energy is measured in °C, heat energy in Joules."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While scientifically 'heat' specifically refers to energy *in transit*, in Grade 9 science, 'thermal energy' and 'heat energy' are often used interchangeably to mean the total internal energy of an object's particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A calorimeter is a device used to:",
        "options": [
          "Measure the heat transferred in a chemical or physical process.",
          "Measure the specific temperature of a substance.",
          "Measure the mass of a heated object.",
          "Create perfect thermal insulation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A calorimeter is designed to be well-insulated, minimizing heat exchange with the outside. This allows for accurate measurement of heat released or absorbed by a reaction or mixture inside it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The principle that heat lost by a hot object equals heat gained by a cold object in an isolated system is based on:",
        "options": [
          "Conservation of Energy",
          "Conservation of Mass",
          "The Law of Inertia",
          "Newton's Third Law"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a direct application of the Law of Conservation of Energy. In an ideal calorimeter (no heat loss), the energy just moves from the hotter substance to the colder one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following objects has the highest Heat Capacity (not specific heat capacity)?",
        "options": [
          "A swimming pool full of cool water",
          "A cup of hot water",
          "A 1 kg iron bar",
          "A 0.5 kg piece of aluminum"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat Capacity (C) is for the *entire object*. The swimming pool has a massive mass, and water has a high specific heat capacity, so its total Heat Capacity (C = m*c) is enormous compared to the other objects."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "100 g of hot water at 80°C is mixed with 100 g of cold water at 20°C in a perfect calorimeter. What is the most likely final equilibrium temperature?",
        "options": [
          "50°C",
          "30°C",
          "60°C",
          "100°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the masses and substances (water) are equal, the final temperature will be the average of the two starting temperatures: (80°C + 20°C) / 2 = 50°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 200 g of water at 25°C is mixed with 100 g of water at 55°C, what is the final temperature? (Assume no heat loss)",
        "options": [
          "35°C",
          "40°C",
          "30°C",
          "45°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat gained by cold water = Heat lost by hot water. Let T be the final temperature. (0.2 kg)*c*(T-25) = (0.1 kg)*c*(55-T). The 'c' cancels out. 0.2T - 5 = 5.5 - 0.1T -> 0.3T = 10.5 -> T = 35°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a lake feel cooler than the sand on a hot summer day?",
        "options": [
          "Water has a higher specific heat capacity, so it heats up more slowly than sand.",
          "Sand has a higher specific heat capacity than water.",
          "Water is a better conductor of heat than sand.",
          "The sun doesn't heat water as effectively as sand."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water's high specific heat capacity means it absorbs a huge amount of solar energy with only a small temperature increase. Sand, with a lower SHC, heats up rapidly under the same sun."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.5 kg block of iron at 100°C is placed into 1 kg of water at 20°C in a calorimeter. Which statement is true as they reach equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "The iron will have a larger temperature change than the water.",
          "The water will have a larger temperature change than the iron.",
          "They will both have the same temperature change.",
          "The iron's temperature will not change."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even though the iron loses all the heat that the water gains, the iron has a much lower specific heat capacity than water. Therefore, to transfer the same amount of energy, its temperature must change more drastically."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The main purpose of the lid on a Styrofoam cup calorimeter is to:",
        "options": [
          "Reduce heat loss by convection and evaporation.",
          "Make it easier to carry.",
          "Prevent the liquid from spilling.",
          "Allow for pressure to be released."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The lid primarily minimizes heat transfer. It prevents hot air (carrying heat) from rising out of the cup by convection and stops evaporative cooling, which would remove thermal energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When two objects at different temperatures touch, heat flows until:",
        "options": [
          "They reach the same temperature.",
          "They have the same amount of thermal energy.",
          "The heat is completely gone.",
          "They have the same density."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat flows from high temperature to low temperature. It stops when there is no longer a temperature difference, meaning thermal equilibrium has been reached."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which material would be the best to use as a calorimeter cup?",
        "options": [
          "Styrofoam",
          "Aluminum",
          "Copper",
          "Glass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Styrofoam is an excellent thermal insulator. It has a very low thermal conductivity, meaning it minimizes the unwanted transfer of heat between the contents of the calorimeter and the outside environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a 150 g piece of metal at 120°C is dropped into 100 g of water at 20°C and the final temperature is 30°C, what can you conclude?",
        "options": [
          "The metal has a relatively low specific heat capacity.",
          "The metal has a relatively high specific heat capacity.",
          "The metal and water have the same specific heat capacity.",
          "The experiment was done incorrectly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The metal's temperature changed by 90°C, while the water's only changed by 10°C. The metal transferred a lot of energy without having a extremely high mass, meaning it doesn't take much energy to change its temperature—a sign of a low specific heat capacity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a mixture problem, the formula used is based on:",
        "options": [
          "Heat Lost = Heat Gained",
          "Mass Lost = Mass Gained",
          "Temperature Lost = Temperature Gained",
          "Volume Lost = Volume Gained"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The fundamental principle for solving mixture problems in calorimetry is the conservation of energy: the heat lost by the hot substance must equal the heat gained by the cold substance (and the calorimeter, if its heat capacity is considered)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pot has a high heat capacity. What does this mean for cooking?",
        "options": [
          "It will take longer to heat up, but will then provide steady, even heat.",
          "It will heat up very quickly to a high temperature.",
          "It will cool down instantly when removed from the stove.",
          "It is not suitable for cooking."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A high heat capacity means the pot itself can store a large amount of thermal energy. This makes it slow to respond to temperature changes (slow to heat), but once hot, it acts as a stable heat reservoir, reducing hot spots and burning."
