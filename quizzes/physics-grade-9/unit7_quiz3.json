        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. From the graph, the wave oscillates between +4 m and -4 m, so the amplitude is 4 m."

        "options": ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Antinodes are points of maximum positive or negative displacement. Counting all peaks and troughs in the graph gives 6 antinodes."
