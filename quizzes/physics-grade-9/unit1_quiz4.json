      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two sprinters finished a race with times of 10.5 s and 10.7 s, what instrument is essential for determining this small difference?",
        "options": [
          "A standard wall clock",
          "A digital stopwatch",
          "A meter stick",
          "An hourglass"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A digital stopwatch that measures to the tenth of a second (0.1 s resolution) is precise enough to distinguish between 10.5 s and 10.7 s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an experiment's results consistently contradict a hypothesis, what is a scientist's most appropriate next step?",
        "options": [
          "Ignore the results and repeat the experiment until they fit.",
          "Modify or reject the hypothesis and develop a new one.",
          "Publish the data claiming the hypothesis is still correct.",
          "Assume the experimental design was flawless and the hypothesis is a law."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The scientific method is iterative. Evidence that disproves a hypothesis is valuable and leads to revised hypotheses, advancing scientific understanding."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A chef tests a new recipe, making one batch with 2 eggs and another with 3 eggs, while keeping all other ingredients and cooking times the same. In the experiment, the 'fluffiness' of the final dish, as measured by a panel of tasters, is the:",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The fluffiness is the outcome that is being measured in response to the change in the number of eggs; it depends on the independent variable."
      },

          "Incorrect units",
          "A proven theory"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Discrepancies between experimental results and accepted values are typically attributed to experimental error, which can be random or systematic."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To test a new plant fertilizer, a gardener applies it to ten rose bushes but does not apply it to another ten similar rose bushes. The group without fertilizer is the:",

          "Dependent Group",
          "Control Group",
          "Hypothesis Group"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The control group provides a baseline for comparison. By not receiving the treatment (fertilizer), it helps show whether observed changes are actually due to the fertilizer."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a scale reads 102.5 g, 102.4 g, and 102.6 g for the same object, but the object's true mass is 100.0 g, the scale is:",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The readings are close to each other (precise) but are all significantly far from the true value (not accurate). This suggests a systematic error, like the scale needing calibration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an experiment on memory, participants who sleep 8 hours recall 80% of words, while those who sleep 4 hours recall 60%. The 'amount of sleep' is the:",

          "Prove the hypothesis is wrong"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A best-fit line minimizes the distance to all points, showing the overall trend and allowing for interpolation and extrapolation."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The significant figures are 2, 0, 5, and 0. Leading zeros are not significant, but zeros between non-zero digits and trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant."
