    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of any heat engine?",
        "options": [
          "To convert heat energy into useful mechanical work.",
          "To convert mechanical work into heat energy.",
          "To create a perpetual source of energy.",
          "To transfer heat from a cold area to a hot area."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A heat engine is a device that transforms part of the heat flowing from a high-temperature source into mechanical work, while the remaining heat is rejected to a lower-temperature sink."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a typical heat engine (like a car engine), what is the role of the 'boiler' or heat source?",
        "options": [
          "To supply high-temperature heat to the working substance.",
          "To condense the working substance back into a liquid.",
          "To pump the working substance through the system.",
          "To reject waste heat to the environment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The boiler (or combustion chamber in a car) is the high-temperature reservoir (T_H). It adds thermal energy (Q_H) to the working fluid (e.g., fuel-air mixture, steam), causing it to expand and do work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of the condenser or radiator in a heat engine?",
        "options": [
          "To reject waste heat to the low-temperature environment.",
          "To compress the working fluid to a high pressure.",
          "To generate the initial spark or heat to start the cycle.",
          "To convert the linear motion of a piston into rotation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The condenser is the low-temperature reservoir (T_C). It receives the waste heat (Q_C) that was not converted to work. This step is crucial for the working fluid to be recycled and the cycle to continue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The component that converts the energy of a flowing fluid (like steam) into rotational motion is called a:",
        "options": [
          "Turbine",
          "Pump",
          "Compressor",
          "Condenser"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A turbine contains blades that are pushed by the high-pressure, high-temperature fluid. This spinning motion can be used directly to generate electricity or to drive other machinery."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of the pump in a heat engine cycle?",
        "options": [
          "To do work ON the system, compressing the fluid to restart the cycle.",
          "To extract useful work FROM the system as it expands.",
          "To add the primary heat energy to the system.",
          "To cool down the system by circulating a coolant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After the fluid has done work and been condensed, the pump uses external energy to compress the fluid and send it back to the boiler. This requires work input (W_in) but is necessary to complete the cycle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A refrigerator is essentially a heat engine operating:",
        "options": [
          "In reverse.",
          "At a lower temperature.",
          "With 100% efficiency.",
          "Without a condenser."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A heat engine takes heat from a hot source, converts some to work, and rejects the rest to a cold sink. A refrigerator uses work input to force heat to flow from a cold interior (the sink) to a hot exterior (the source)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The efficiency of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of:",
        "options": [
          "Useful work output to total heat input.",
          "Total heat input to useful work output.",
          "Waste heat output to total heat input.",
          "Useful work output to waste heat output."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency (η) = (Net Work Output) / (Heat Input from Hot Source). It tells you what fraction of the heat you put in is converted into the useful work you get out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a heat engine absorbs 1000 J from a hot reservoir and does 300 J of useful work, what is its efficiency?",
        "options": [
          "30%",
          "70%",
          "300%",
          "33%"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency η = (Work Output / Heat Input) = (300 J / 1000 J) = 0.30 or 30%."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the efficiency of a real heat engine is always:",
        "options": [
          "Less than 100%.",
          "Exactly 100%.",
          "Greater than 100%.",
          "Dependent only on the fuel type."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It is impossible to convert heat completely into work in a cyclic process. Some heat must always be rejected to a cold reservoir, making 100% efficiency unattainable for a real engine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a refrigerator, the component where the refrigerant absorbs heat from the inside, cooling it down, is the:",
        "options": [
          "Evaporator",
          "Condenser",
          "Compressor",
          "Expansion Valve"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The evaporator is located inside the fridge. Here, the cold liquid refrigerant evaporates into a gas, and to do so, it must absorb heat from the interior of the fridge, thus cooling it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Where is the hot condenser coil typically located in a household refrigerator?",
        "options": [
          "On the back or bottom of the appliance.",
          "Inside the freezer compartment.",
          "Surrounding the light bulb inside.",
          "Inside the insulation of the walls."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The condenser coils are where the refrigerant, now a hot, high-pressure gas, releases the heat it absorbed from the fridge's interior plus the heat from the compressor's work. This heat is dumped into the room, which is why the back of a fridge feels warm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Coefficient of Performance' (COP) for a refrigerator measures its:",
        "options": [
          "Effectiveness at moving heat from a cold space.",
          "Efficiency at converting electrical energy directly to heat.",
          "Rate of cooling compared to its size.",
          "Ability to maintain a constant temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "COP = (Heat Removed from Cold Space) / (Work Input). It's not an efficiency but a measure of performance. A higher COP means it moves more heat for the same amount of work, making it more effective."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a heat engine rejects 700 J of waste heat and is 25% efficient, how much heat did it absorb from the hot source?",
        "options": [
          "933 J",
          "175 J",
          "2800 J",
          "875 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency η = Work / Q_H. Also, Q_H = Work + Q_C. If η=0.25, then Work = 0.25*Q_H. And Q_H = 0.25*Q_H + 700 J. So, 0.75*Q_H = 700 J, and Q_H = 700 / 0.75 = 933 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can't a ship use the cold ocean water as the cold reservoir to run a heat engine without a hot source?",
        "options": [
          "A heat engine requires a temperature difference to operate.",
          "Ocean water is not cold enough to be a reservoir.",
          "Salt water would corrode the engine components.",
          "It would violate the First Law of Thermodynamics."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A heat engine operates by exploiting a flow of heat from a hot source to a cold sink. With only one temperature (the cold ocean), there is no driving force for heat flow, and thus no work can be extracted. This is a consequence of the Second Law."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a car engine, the 'exhaust' represents which part of the heat engine cycle?",
        "options": [
          "Rejecting waste heat to the low-temperature sink (the atmosphere).",
          "The input of high-temperature heat from burning fuel.",
          "The compression of the fuel-air mixture.",
          "The useful work done on the pistons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The expelled exhaust gases carry away the waste heat (Q_C) that was not converted into the work of moving the car. The atmosphere acts as the cold reservoir."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary energy input to the compressor in a refrigerator?",
        "options": [
          "Electrical work from an outlet.",
          "Heat from the food inside.",
          "Heat from the room air.",
          "Kinetic energy from opening the door."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The compressor is the pump of the refrigeration cycle. It is typically an electric motor that does work on the refrigerant, compressing it and raising its temperature and pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine depends only on:",
        "options": [
          "The temperatures of its hot and cold reservoirs.",
          "The type of fuel used in the boiler.",
          "The size of the engine's piston or turbine.",
          "The cost of the materials used to build it."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Carnot efficiency, the theoretical maximum, is given by η_max = 1 - (T_C / T_H), where temperatures are in Kelvin. It shows that a larger temperature difference yields a higher possible efficiency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What common household appliance operates on the same basic principle as a refrigerator?",
        "options": [
          "An air conditioner.",
          "A toaster.",
          "A water heater.",
          "An incandescent light bulb."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An air conditioner is a refrigerator for a room. It uses work input to pump heat from the cooler indoor air (cold reservoir) to the warmer outdoor air (hot reservoir)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the cold reservoir of a heat engine is made colder while the hot reservoir stays the same, the engine's efficiency will:",
        "options": [
          "Increase.",
          "Decrease.",
          "Remain the same.",
          "Become unpredictable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From the Carnot efficiency formula η_max = 1 - (T_C/T_H), if T_C decreases, the ratio T_C/T_H gets smaller, so the efficiency (1 - that ratio) gets larger. A bigger temperature difference means more potential for work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The working substance in a heat engine (like steam or fuel vapor) is important because it:",
        "options": [
          "Readily expands when heated and can be recycled.",
          "Burns completely without any waste products.",
          "Is always in a solid state at room temperature.",
          "Does not obey the normal laws of thermodynamics."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The working substance must be able to absorb heat, expand (doing work), reject heat, and be compressed to start the cycle again. Gases and vapors are ideal for this as they expand significantly when heated."
