    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The process of a solid turning directly into a gas, without becoming a liquid first, is called:",
        "options": [
          "Sublimation",
          "Deposition",
          "Evaporation",
          "Condensation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sublimation occurs when particles in a solid gain enough energy to break free and become a gas. Dry ice (solid CO2) turning into fog is a common example."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the reverse process of sublimation, where a gas turns directly into a solid?",
        "options": [
          "Deposition",
          "Condensation",
          "Freezing",
          "Melting"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Deposition is the phase change where a gas loses so much energy that it turns directly into a solid. Frost forming on a cold window is an example of water vapor depositing into ice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the process of melting, what happens to the temperature of a pure substance while the phase change is occurring?",
        "options": [
          "It remains constant.",
          "It increases steadily.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It changes unpredictably."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The energy added during a phase change is used to break the bonds holding the particles in a fixed structure (solid), not to increase their kinetic energy. Therefore, the temperature stays constant until all the solid has melted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter has a definite volume but no definite shape?",
        "options": [
          "Liquid",
          "Solid",
          "Gas",
          "Plasma"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Liquids have a fixed volume (they are hard to compress), but they take the shape of their container because the particles can flow past one another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between evaporation and boiling?",
        "options": [
          "Evaporation occurs at the surface; boiling occurs throughout the liquid.",
          "Evaporation requires heat; boiling does not.",
          "Boiling only occurs in sunlight.",
          "Evaporation is faster than boiling."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Evaporation is a surface phenomenon where high-energy particles escape a liquid at any temperature. Boiling happens when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, and vapor bubbles form throughout the entire volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a substance condenses from a gas to a liquid, what happens to the energy of its particles?",
        "options": [
          "Energy is released to the surroundings.",
          "Energy is absorbed from the surroundings.",
          "Energy is created.",
          "Energy is destroyed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condensation is an exothermic process. As gas particles slow down and form liquid, they release the extra energy that once allowed them to be free-moving. This is why steam burns are so severeâ€”it releases the heat of vaporization as it condenses on your skin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter is characterized by electrically charged particles (ions and electrons) and is the most common state in the visible universe?",
        "options": [
          "Plasma",
          "Gas",
          "Liquid",
          "Solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plasma is a superheated gas where atoms have been stripped of their electrons, creating a soup of positive ions and free electrons. Stars, lightning, and neon signs are made of plasma."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the motion of particles when a substance is heated?",
        "options": [
          "The particles move faster and vibrate more.",
          "The particles move slower and vibrate less.",
          "The particles get smaller.",
          "The particles change into different elements."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat energy increases the kinetic energy of particles. In solids, they vibrate more. In liquids and gases, they move faster. This increased motion can eventually lead to a phase change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The process of a liquid turning into a solid is called:",
        "options": [
          "Freezing",
          "Melting",
          "Condensation",
          "Sublimation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Freezing (or solidification) occurs when a liquid loses enough thermal energy for its particles to slow down and lock into a fixed, organized structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a property of a solid?",
        "options": [
          "Definite shape and definite volume",
          "Definite volume but no definite shape",
          "No definite shape and no definite volume",
          "Takes the shape of its container and is easily compressed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The particles in a solid are tightly packed and vibrate in place, giving solids a rigid structure with a fixed shape and volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a solid melts, the energy absorbed is used to:",
        "options": [
          "Overcome the attractions between particles.",
          "Increase the speed of the particles.",
          "Decrease the density of the substance.",
          "Break the chemical bonds within the particles."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'heat of fusion' is the energy required to break the intermolecular forces that hold the particles in a rigid, solid structure, allowing them to slide past one another as a liquid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which phase change is responsible for the formation of clouds?",
        "options": [
          "Condensation",
          "Evaporation",
          "Sublimation",
          "Freezing"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Clouds form when water vapor in the atmosphere rises, cools down, and condenses into tiny liquid water droplets around dust particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the arrangement of particles when a liquid freezes?",
        "options": [
          "They become more ordered and fixed in place.",
          "They become more disordered and spread out.",
          "They start moving randomly in all directions.",
          "They lose all attraction to each other."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As a liquid freezes, the particles lose kinetic energy. This allows the attractive forces between them to pull them into a more organized, repeating pattern, forming a solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a spilled puddle of gasoline disappear on a warm day?",
        "options": [
          "It evaporates into a gas.",
          "It sublimates into a solid.",
          "It condenses into the air.",
          "It undergoes deposition."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The liquid gasoline gains energy from the warm air, and its molecules at the surface gain enough energy to escape into the air as a vapor. This is evaporation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter is most easily compressed?",
        "options": [
          "Gas",
          "Solid",
          "Liquid",
          "Plasma"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gases are easily compressed because there is a great deal of empty space between the particles. Pushing the particles closer together reduces the volume significantly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During boiling, the temperature of a pure substance remains constant because the added heat energy is used to:",
        "options": [
          "Break the attractions between liquid particles.",
          "Increase the speed of the liquid particles.",
          "Increase the air pressure above the liquid.",
          "Create bubbles of air."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'heat of vaporization' is the energy required to overcome the attractive forces between particles in the liquid, allowing them to escape as a gas. This energy input does not raise the temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main particle-level difference between a gas and a plasma?",
        "options": [
          "Plasma particles are electrically charged; gas particles are neutral.",
          "Gas particles move faster than plasma particles.",
          "Plasma has a definite volume; gas does not.",
          "There is no difference; they are the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A gas consists of neutral atoms or molecules. A plasma is a gas that has been energized to the point where some electrons are stripped away, creating a mixture of positive ions and free electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The frost on a car windshield on a cold morning forms through which process?",
        "options": [
          "Deposition",
          "Sublimation",
          "Condensation",
          "Evaporation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The water vapor in the air comes into contact with the very cold glass and loses energy so rapidly that it turns directly into solid ice crystals (frost), skipping the liquid phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a substance is cooled, the spaces between its particles generally:",
        "options": [
          "Decrease",
          "Increase",
          "Stay the same",
          "Become unpredictable"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As particles lose kinetic energy, they move less and the attractive forces between them pull them closer together, decreasing the space between them. This often leads to a decrease in volume."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following lists the states of matter in order of INCREASING particle energy?",
        "options": [
          "Solid â†’ Liquid â†’ Gas â†’ Plasma",
          "Plasma â†’ Gas â†’ Liquid â†’ Solid",
          "Gas â†’ Liquid â†’ Solid â†’ Plasma",
          "Liquid â†’ Solid â†’ Gas â†’ Plasma"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Particles in a solid have the least energy (mostly vibration). Liquids have more (can flow). Gases have even more (free, rapid motion). Plasma has the most energy (particles are torn apart into charged ions)."
