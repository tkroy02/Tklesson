      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What causes the Doppler Effect?",
        "options": [
          "Relative motion between source and observer",

          "The type of sound wave"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Doppler Effect occurs when there is relative motion between the source of waves and the observer, causing frequency changes."

          "Pitch decreases",
          "Pitch stays the same",
          "Pitch becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a sound source moves toward you, wavefronts are compressed, increasing frequency and making the pitch higher."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "After a train passes you and moves away, what happens to the sound you hear?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The moving source 'catches up' to its own waves, compressing them and increasing the frequency you detect."

          "Wavelength becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

          "Tires on the track"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The high pitch as it approaches and sudden drop as it passes is classic Doppler Effect from relative motion."
      },
      {

          "Very low frequency sound"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Moving at wave speed toward the source means you intercept all wavefronts simultaneously, creating extremely high detected frequency."

          "Telescope lens effects"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Redshift is the Doppler Effect for light - galaxies moving away from us show longer wavelengths (shifted toward red)."
      },

          "Pitch would rise continuously"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The source moves as fast as the waves it creates, so wavefronts never reach a stationary observer ahead of it."
