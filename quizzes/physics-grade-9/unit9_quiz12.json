          "43.2 W"

        "explanation": "Equivalent resistance: 1/R_total = 1/5 + 1/10 = 2/10 + 1/10 = 3/10, so R_total = 10/3 ≈ 3.33 Ω. Power P = V²/R = (12 V)² / 3.33 Ω = 144 / 3.33 ≈ 43.2 W. Wait, let me recalculate: P = V²/R = 144 / (10/3) = 144 × 3/10 = 432/10 = 43.2 W. My apologies, the correct answer is 43.2 W."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel combination: R_parallel = 4 Ω (since 1/R = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4). Total R = 4 + 4 = 8 Ω. Voltage across parallel combo = half of total voltage. Current through R2 = (V_parallel)/8 Ω. Since R2 and R3 are equal, each gets half of the parallel branch current, which is 25% of total current."
