    "duration": 35,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the fundamental atomic-level reason most substances expand when heated?",
        "options": [
          "Particles vibrate more vigorously, increasing the average distance between them.",
          "Atoms increase in size as they absorb thermal energy.",
          "The chemical bonds between atoms weaken and stretch.",
          "Electrons are ejected from the atoms, reducing attraction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As temperature increases, the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules increases. This causes them to vibrate more intensely, pushing their neighbors slightly farther away, which results in an increase in the overall size of the material."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the study of thermal expansion important in engineering and construction?",
        "options": [
          "To design structures and components that can safely withstand size changes with temperature.",
          "To calculate the exact melting point of construction materials.",
          "To determine the chemical composition of metals used in bridges.",
          "To increase the rate at which materials conduct heat."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If expansion isn't accounted for, forces can build up in structures like bridges, railways, and pipelines, leading to bending, buckling, or failure. Engineers must design expansion joints and allowances."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the small gaps left between sections of a railway track called, and what is their purpose?",
        "options": [
          "Expansion joints; to allow the rails to expand on hot days without buckling.",
          "Contraction joints; to allow the rails to shrink on cold days without cracking.",
          "Conduction gaps; to prevent the flow of electricity along the track.",
          "Insulation spaces; to reduce heat transfer between rail segments."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "These are expansion joints. On a hot day, steel rails can expand significantly in length. Without these gaps, the rails would have nowhere to go and would bend sideways or push upwards, causing a derailment hazard."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metal rod has a length of 2.000 m at 20°C. If the coefficient of linear expansion is 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ /°C, what is its length at 70°C?",
        "options": [
          "2.0012 m",
          "2.0120 m",
          "2.1200 m",
          "1.9988 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔL = α * L₀ * ΔT = (1.2 × 10⁻⁵ /°C) * (2.000 m) * (50°C) = 0.0012 m. New length = L₀ + ΔL = 2.000 m + 0.0012 m = 2.0012 m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The coefficient of volume expansion for a liquid is typically much larger than the coefficient of linear expansion for a solid. Why is this important for a common household device?",
        "options": [
          "It is the principle behind liquid-in-glass thermometers.",
          "It explains why metal pots are used for cooking.",
          "It is why hot water rises in a tank.",
          "It prevents car engines from overheating."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a thermometer, the liquid (often alcohol or mercury) expands much more than the glass tube that contains it when heated. This large, visible expansion in the narrow capillary tube allows us to measure temperature easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the hot riveting technique used in construction and shipbuilding?",
        "options": [
          "The rivet contracts as it cools, pulling the metal plates together tightly.",
          "The hot rivet is softer and easier to hammer into shape.",
          "Heating the rivet makes it expand permanently for a better fit.",
          "It prevents the rivet from conducting electricity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A rivet is heated until it's red-hot (expanded), inserted through holes in two metal plates, and then the end is hammered flat. As it cools and contracts, it pulls the plates together with immense force, creating a very strong joint."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an application of *differential* thermal expansion?",
        "options": [
          "A bimetallic strip in a thermostat bending when heated.",
          "A balloon expanding when left in a hot car.",
          "A concrete sidewalk cracking in the winter.",
          "A metal lid becoming easier to open under hot water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A bimetallic strip is made of two different metals bonded together. Since they have different coefficients of expansion, one expands more than the other when heated, causing the strip to bend. This motion can open or close an electrical circuit in a thermostat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A square aluminum plate has a side length of 0.5 m at 25°C. If the linear expansivity is 2.4 × 10⁻⁵ /°C, what is the increase in its area when heated to 75°C?",
        "options": [
          "6.0 × 10⁻⁴ m²",
          "1.2 × 10⁻⁴ m²",
          "3.0 × 10⁻⁴ m²",
          "2.4 × 10⁻⁴ m²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficient of area expansion (β) is approximately 2α. β ≈ 4.8 × 10⁻⁵ /°C. Initial Area A₀ = (0.5 m)² = 0.25 m². ΔT = 50°C. ΔA = β * A₀ * ΔT = (4.8 × 10⁻⁵) * (0.25) * (50) = 6.0 × 10⁻⁴ m²."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is Pyrex glass less likely to crack than ordinary glass when subjected to sudden temperature changes?",
        "options": [
          "It has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion.",
          "It is a much better thermal conductor.",
          "It is thicker and stronger than ordinary glass.",
          "It has a higher melting point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pyrex is a borosilicate glass with a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. This means it expands and contracts much less than ordinary soda-lime glass for the same temperature change, reducing the internal stresses that cause cracking."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between the coefficient of linear expansion (α) and the coefficient of volume expansion (γ) for a solid?",
        "options": [
          "γ ≈ 3α",
          "γ ≈ α³",
          "γ ≈ 2α",
          "γ ≈ α"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For isotropic solids (which expand equally in all directions), the volume expansion coefficient is approximately three times the linear expansion coefficient. This is because expansion occurs in three dimensions: length, width, and height."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 500 mL glass flask is filled to the brim with a liquid at 30°C. When the system is heated to 80°C, 2.5 mL of liquid overflows. What does this demonstrate?",
        "options": [
          "The liquid has a higher coefficient of volume expansion than the glass.",
          "The glass has a higher coefficient of volume expansion than the liquid.",
          "The mass of the liquid increased upon heating.",
          "The air pressure above the liquid decreased."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both the glass and the liquid expand. The liquid overflows because its volume increases *more* than the internal volume of the glass flask does. Therefore, the liquid's volume expansivity is greater."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are sidewalks and concrete driveways laid in sections with gaps between them?",
        "options": [
          "To provide space for the concrete to expand and contract with temperature changes.",
          "To make them easier to repair one section at a time.",
          "To allow water to drain through the cracks.",
          "To create a non-slip surface texture."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Concrete, like most materials, expands when hot and contracts when cold. Without control joints (the planned gaps), the concrete would crack randomly due to the internal stress from this thermal movement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A steel bridge is 500 m long at 0°C. By how much does its length increase on a hot summer day of 40°C? (α_steel = 1.1 × 10⁻⁵ /°C)",
        "options": [
          "0.22 m",
          "0.022 m",
          "2.2 m",
          "0.0022 m"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔL = α * L₀ * ΔT = (1.1 × 10⁻⁵ /°C) * (500 m) * (40°C) = 0.22 m. This significant change (22 cm!) is why expansion joints are critical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it often easier to loosen a tight metal jar lid by running hot water over it?",
        "options": [
          "The metal lid expands more than the glass jar due to a higher expansivity.",
          "The heat melts the sticky residue sealing the lid.",
          "The glass jar contracts, pulling away from the lid.",
          "The hot water acts as a lubricant on the threads."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Metal generally has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than glass. When heated, the metal lid expands more than the glass jar neck, creating a slightly larger gap and making it easier to unscrew."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the density of a substance when it is heated and undergoes volume expansion, assuming its mass is constant?",
        "options": [
          "Its density decreases.",
          "Its density increases.",
          "Its density remains the same.",
          "Its density becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Density = Mass / Volume. If the mass is constant and the volume increases, the density must decrease. This is why warm air rises—it's less dense than the surrounding cooler air."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which material would be most suitable for the pendulum of a precise clock that must keep accurate time in varying room temperatures?",
        "options": [
          "Invar (an alloy with a very low expansivity)",
          "Aluminum (a metal with a high expansivity)",
          "Copper (a good conductor)",
          "Glass (a poor conductor)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The period of a pendulum depends on its length. If the pendulum rod expanded in the heat, the clock would run slow. Invar, an iron-nickel alloy, has a near-zero coefficient of expansion, making the clock's timing insensitive to temperature changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A metal cube has a volume of 0.001 m³ at 10°C. If the volume expansivity is 3.6 × 10⁻⁵ /°C, what is its volume at 60°C?",
        "options": [
          "0.0010018 m³",
          "0.001018 m³",
          "0.00118 m³",
          "0.0009982 m³"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "ΔV = γ * V₀ * ΔT = (3.6 × 10⁻⁵ /°C) * (0.001 m³) * (50°C) = 1.8 × 10⁻⁶ m³. New Volume = V₀ + ΔV = 0.001 m³ + 0.0000018 m³ = 0.0010018 m³."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do electrical transmission lines appear looser and sag more on a hot summer day compared to a cold winter day?",
        "options": [
          "The metal cables expand in the heat, increasing their length and thus their sag.",
          "The weight of the cables increases due to thermal absorption.",
          "The poles contract in the cold, pulling the wires tighter.",
          "Ice buildup in winter adds weight, stretching the wires taut."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a direct and visible consequence of linear thermal expansion. Engineers must calculate this sag when designing power lines to ensure they are high enough off the ground at their lowest point (on the hottest days)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason that a balloon inflated at room temperature might appear to deflate slightly when taken outside on a very cold day?",
        "options": [
          "The air inside the balloon cools and contracts, reducing its volume.",
          "The rubber of the balloon contracts, squeezing the air out.",
          "Cold air from outside leaks into the balloon.",
          "The atmospheric pressure decreases in cold weather."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is an example of the volume contraction of a gas. The air molecules inside the balloon lose kinetic energy, move more slowly, and exert less pressure on the walls, causing the balloon to shrink. The rubber's own contraction is a secondary, smaller effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The coefficient of linear expansion is defined as the fractional change in ______ per degree change in temperature.",
        "options": [
          "Length",
          "Volume",
          "Area",
          "Density"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficient of linear expansion (α) is specifically defined as the change in length (ΔL) per unit original length (L₀) per degree of temperature change. α = ΔL / (L₀ * ΔT)."
