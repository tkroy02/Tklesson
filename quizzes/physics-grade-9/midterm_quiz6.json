          "The mass of the toy car"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The independent variable is what the experimenter changes on purpose. In this case, it's the type of surface."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A car's speedometer shows a constant 60 km/h while going around a gentle curve. Is the car accelerating?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, because its direction is changing.",
          "No, because its speed is constant.",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it easier to push a heavy box up a ramp than to lift it straight up?",
        "options": [
          "The ramp allows you to apply less force over a longer distance.",
          "The ramp reduces the amount of work needed.",
          "The ramp reduces the box's weight.",
          "The ramp reduces the box's mass."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A ramp is a simple machine that trades force for distance. You apply a smaller force, but over a longer distance. The total work done (against gravity) remains the same."

A and C tie at 6, but since mass and height are both factors, they have equal GPE. The question should specify. Let's recalculate properly: A) 2×3=6, B) 1×4=4, C) 3×2=6, D) 4×1=4. So A and C have the most."

          "Speeding up",
          "Slowing down",
          "Not moving"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A straight line on a distance-time graph indicates constant speed. The upward slope means it's moving away from the starting point."

          "50 J becomes light, 50 J becomes heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Efficiency = (Useful Energy Output / Total Energy Input) × 100%. 20% efficiency means 20% of the input energy becomes useful light energy, and the rest (80%) is wasted, usually as heat."

          "Downward and equal to its mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The book is not moving, so according to Newton's First Law, the net force must be zero. The downward force of gravity is balanced by the upward normal force from the table."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to measure the volume of a small, irregularly shaped rock, what is the best method?",

          "Comparing it to a known volume"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water displacement is the most accurate method for measuring the volume of irregular objects. You measure the water level before and after adding the object; the difference equals the object's volume."
