    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Scientific notation is primarily used to express very large or very small numbers in a more compact and manageable form.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Scientific notation efficiently represents extremely large or small numbers using powers of 10, making calculations and comparisons more manageable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When converting 0.000456 to scientific notation, it becomes 4.56 × 10⁴ because we move the decimal four places to the right.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Moving the decimal four places to the right from 0.000456 gives 4.56, but since we started with a small number, we use a negative exponent: 4.56 × 10⁻⁴."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All zeros in a measured number are always considered significant figures, regardless of their position in the number.",

          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Leading zeros are never significant, trailing zeros are significant only if they come after a decimal point, and captive zeros (between non-zero digits) are always significant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The measurement 0.00520 kg has two significant figures because the zeros before the 5 don't count.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "0.00520 kg has three significant figures: the 5, the 2, and the trailing zero (which is significant because it comes after the decimal point)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Accuracy refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other, while precision refers to how close measurements are to the true value.",

          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is reversed: precision describes the consistency of repeated measurements, while accuracy describes how close measurements are to the true or accepted value."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A measurement can be precise but not accurate if there is a systematic error in the measuring instrument.",

          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Systematic errors can cause measurements to be consistently off in one direction, making them precise (close to each other) but not accurate (not close to the true value)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In data analysis, the independent variable should always be plotted on the y-axis and the dependent variable on the x-axis.",

          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A line of best fit represents the general trend of the data and should minimize the distance from all points, but it doesn't need to pass through any specific points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When multiplying 2.5 × 10³ by 3.00 × 10², the result should have two significant figures because 2.5 has only two significant figures.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In multiplication, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures, which is two in this case."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The number 100.0 has three significant figures because zeros at the end of a number without a decimal point are not significant.",

          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "100.0 has four significant figures because the decimal point indicates that the trailing zeros are significant."
      },

          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "While averaging multiple measurements reduces the effect of random errors, it doesn't completely eliminate them; it only minimizes their impact on the final result."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A bar graph is the most appropriate choice for showing the relationship between two continuous variables.",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Bar graphs are best for comparing discrete categories, while scatter plots or line graphs are more appropriate for showing relationships between continuous variables."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When adding 12.5 and 3.21, the sum should be reported as 15.71 to maintain the correct number of significant figures.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In addition, the result should be rounded to the least precise decimal place. Since 12.5 has one decimal place, the sum should be 15.7."
      },

          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Every measurement has inherent uncertainty due to instrument limitations and human error, and scientific reporting should include uncertainty estimates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When creating a scientific graph, the scale must always start at zero to avoid misleading the reader.",

          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "While starting at zero is often good practice to avoid distortion, sometimes it's appropriate to start at other values to show details more clearly, as long as the scale is clearly indicated."

          "True",
          "False",
          "Cannot say",
          "Partially True"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Correlation shows a relationship between variables but does not prove causation; other factors or coincidence could be responsible for the observed relationship."
