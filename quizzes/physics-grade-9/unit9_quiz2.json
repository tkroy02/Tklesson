    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "1. Coulomb's Law describes the force between two what?",
        "options": [
          "Masses",
          "Charged objects",
          "Magnetic poles",
          "Neutral atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Coulomb's Law specifically describes the electrostatic force between two charged objects."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "2. If the distance between two charged objects is doubled, what happens to the electrostatic force between them?",
        "options": [
          "It doubles",
          "It halves",
          "It quarters (becomes 1/4)",
          "It quadruples"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "According to Coulomb's Law, force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Double the distance = 1/(2²) = 1/4 the force."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "3. Two positive charges, +2 C and +4 C, are 1 meter apart. What is the direction of the force between them?",
        "options": [
          "Attractive",
          "Repulsive",
          "No force",
          "It depends on the mass"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Like charges repel each other. Since both charges are positive, the force is repulsive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "4. If the charge on both objects is tripled, what happens to the electrostatic force between them?",
        "options": [
          "It triples",

          "It becomes 1/9 as large",
          "It doesn't change"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Force is proportional to the product of the charges. 3 × 3 = 9, so the force becomes 9 times larger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "5. A +3 μC charge and a -6 μC charge are 0.5 m apart. What type of force exists between them?",

          "Gravitational only"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unlike charges attract each other. Since one is positive and one is negative, the force is attractive."

          "3 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Tripling distance reduces force to 1/9. If 9 N is 1/9 of original, then original was 9 × 9 = 81 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "7. What is the constant 'k' in Coulomb's Law approximately equal to?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Halving distance increases force by 4 times (inverse square). Doubling both charges increases force by 4 times (2 × 2). Total: 4 × 4 = 16 times larger."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "9. Two charges exert a force of 20 N on each other. If one charge is doubled and the distance is doubled, what is the new force?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Doubling one charge doubles force (20 × 2 = 40 N). Doubling distance quarters force (40 ÷ 4 = 10 N)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "11. A +5 μC charge and a +10 μC charge are 2 meters apart. If the +5 μC charge is changed to -5 μC, what happens to the force?",
        "options": [

          "It becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Changing from positive to negative changes attraction/repulsion (direction), but the magnitude stays the same since charge magnitudes are unchanged."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Halving both charges reduces force to 1/4 (0.5 × 0.5). Doubling distance reduces force to 1/4. Total reduction: 1/4 × 1/4 = 1/16."

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Force decreases from 36 N to 4 N, which is 1/9 of original. Distance must triple (3r) since force ∝ 1/d²."
