        "question": "What is the net horizontal force on the box when both Tom and Fred pull?",
        "options": [
          "30 N toward Tom",
          "30 N toward Fred", 
          "130 N toward Tom",
          "130 N toward Fred"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net force $= F_{\\text{Tom}} - F_{\\text{Fred}} = 80\\text{N} - 50\\text{N} = 30\\text{N}$ in Tom's direction"

          "80 N",
          "196 N"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Maximum static friction $f_{s,\\text{max}} = \\mu_s N = 0.27 \\times (20\\text{kg} \\times 9.8\\text{m/s}^2) = 0.27 \\times 196\\text{N} = 52.92\\text{N} \\approx 53\\text{N}$"

        "question": "Will the box move, and if so, in which direction?",
        "options": [
          "Yes, toward Tom because net force $>$ static friction",
          "Yes, toward Fred because $50\\text{N} >$ friction",
          "No, because net force $<$ static friction", 
          "No, because forces cancel out"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Net force $(30\\text{N})$ is less than maximum static friction $(53\\text{N})$, so static friction can balance the net force and the box won't move."

          "53 N opposing Fred"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Static friction adjusts to exactly balance the net applied force, so it provides $30\\text{N}$ opposing the net force direction (toward Tom)."

          "Box moves toward Tom with $100\\text{N}$ force"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "New net force $= 100\\text{N} - 50\\text{N} = 50\\text{N}$ toward Tom. Since $50\\text{N} < 53\\text{N}$ (max static friction), the box still won't move! Static friction increases to $50\\text{N}$."

          "Box accelerates at $4\\text{m/s}^2$"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With Fred gone, net force $= 80\\text{N}$. Since $80\\text{N} > 53\\text{N}$ (max static friction), box moves. Net force after overcoming friction $= 80\\text{N} - 53\\text{N} = 27\\text{N}$. $a = \\frac{27\\text{N}}{20\\text{kg}} = 1.35\\text{m/s}^2$"

          "Box moves randomly" 
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Net force $= 60\\text{N} - 60\\text{N} = 0\\text{N}$. With zero net force, static friction is zero and box remains stationary."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "New max static friction $= 0.35 \\times 196\\text{N} = 68.6\\text{N}$. Net force is still $30\\text{N}$, which is less than $68.6\\text{N}$, so box still doesn't move."

          "245 N"
        ],
        "answer": "C", 
        "explanation": "Normal force $N = mg = 20\\text{kg} \\times 9.8\\text{m/s}^2 = 196\\text{N}$ (assuming horizontal surface)"

          "When kinetic friction takes over"
        ],

        "explanation": "The rope moves when the net force applied by the teams exceeds the maximum static friction between the ground and the participants' feet."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can static friction prevent motion even with large opposing forces?",

          "It can adjust up to its maximum value",
          "It increases with applied force",
          "It's always greater than applied forces",
          "It creates energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Static friction is self-adjusting - it matches the net applied force up to its maximum value $(\\mu_s N)$."
      },

        "type": "mcq", 
        "question": "What determines the direction of kinetic friction?",
        "options": [
          "Direction of heavier person",
          "Direction of net force",
          "Opposite to actual motion",
          "Same as applied force"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Kinetic friction always opposes the actual direction of motion, regardless of which forces are larger."

          "Equal to friction force"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a balanced tug-of-war, tension equals the force applied by either team (since they pull with equal force)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do tug-of-war teams lean backward?",
        "options": [
          "To increase normal force and thus friction",
          "To decrease their weight",
          "To push the ground forward", 
          "To reduce the tension"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Leaning back increases the normal force between their feet and ground, which increases maximum static friction $(f_{s,\\text{max}} = \\mu_s N)$, making them harder to pull."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to friction if a box is pulled upward at an angle?",
        "options": [
          "Friction increases due to more contact",
          "Friction decreases due to reduced normal force",
          "Friction stays the same",
          "Friction becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "B", 
        "explanation": "Pulling upward reduces the normal force $(N = mg - F_{\\text{vertical}})$, which reduces the maximum friction force $(f_{s,\\text{max}} = \\mu_s N)$."

          "Object moving at constant speed",
          "Car turning a corner"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "On a frictionless surface, $\\mu_s = 0$, so static friction is zero regardless of applied forces."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it easier to keep a box moving than to start it?",

          "Inertia decreases",
          "Normal force reduces",
          "Weight decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Kinetic friction coefficient $(\\mu_k)$ is typically less than static friction coefficient $(\\mu_s)$, so less force is needed to maintain motion."

          "It only works on ice"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When you push backward on the ground, static friction pushes you forward (action-reaction pair)."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "On low-friction surfaces, the team that can maintain sufficient static friction $(f_s = \\mu_s N)$ with the ground will win, as their feet won't slip."
