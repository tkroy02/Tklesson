      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A hot piece of metal is placed into cool water in an insulated calorimeter. What is the fundamental principle used to find the final temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Heat lost by metal = Heat gained by water",
          "Mass of metal = Mass of water",
          "Temperature lost by metal = Temperature gained by water",
          "The final temperature is the average of the two starting temperatures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an ideal calorimeter, the core principle is the conservation of energy: the thermal energy leaving the hot object must equal the thermal energy entering the cold object."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation correctly sets up a calorimeter problem where a hot metal block is added to cooler water? (Let m=mass, c=specific heat, T=final temp, i=initial)",
        "options": [
          "(m_metal)(c_metal)(T_initial_metal - T) = (m_water)(c_water)(T - T_initial_water)",
          "(m_metal)(c_metal)(T - T_initial_metal) = (m_water)(c_water)(T_initial_water - T)",
          "(m_metal + m_water)(c_water)(T) = (m_metal)(T_initial_metal) + (m_water)(T_initial_water)",
          "(m_metal)(c_metal)(T) = (m_water)(c_water)(T)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The correct form ensures heat lost (positive value on left) equals heat gained (positive value on right). The hot object cools down (T_initial - T_final), and the cold object warms up (T_final - T_initial)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 150 g (0.15 kg) sample of metal at 90°C is placed in a calorimeter with 100 g (0.10 kg) of water at 25°C. The final temperature is 29°C. What is the specific heat capacity of the metal? (c_water = 4184 J/kg°C)",
        "options": [
          "~450 J/kg°C",
          "~900 J/kg°C",
          "~1200 J/kg°C",
          "~2000 J/kg°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat gained by water = (0.10)(4184)(29-25) = 1673.6 J. This equals heat lost by metal: 1673.6 = (0.15)(c_metal)(90-29). So, 1673.6 = (0.15)(c_metal)(61) -> c_metal = 1673.6 / (9.15) ≈ 450 J/kg°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a lab, a student performs a calorimetry experiment but forgets to put the lid on the Styrofoam cup. How will this likely affect the calculated specific heat capacity of the metal?",
        "options": [
          "It will be higher than the true value.",
          "It will be lower than the true value.",
          "It will not affect the calculation.",
          "It will make the calculated value zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Without a lid, heat escapes from the water to the air. The measured temperature change of the water will be smaller, meaning we calculate that the water gained less heat. If the metal 'lost' less heat in our calculation, its specific heat capacity (c = Q/(mΔT)) will appear higher."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "100 g of water at 80.0°C is mixed with 100 g of water at 20.0°C in a perfect calorimeter. What is the final temperature?",
        "options": [
          "50.0°C",
          "30.0°C",
          "60.0°C",
          "100.0°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the masses and substances are identical, the final temperature is simply the average: (80.0°C + 20.0°C) / 2 = 50.0°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.05 kg metal bolt at 115°C is placed into an insulated cup containing 0.15 kg of water at 18°C. The final temperature is 20°C. What is the approximate specific heat capacity of the metal?",
        "options": [
          "~500 J/kg°C",
          "~1000 J/kg°C",
          "~200 J/kg°C",
          "~4000 J/kg°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat gained by water = (0.15)(4184)(20-18) = 1255.2 J. Heat lost by metal = 1255.2 J = (0.05)(c_metal)(115-20). So, 1255.2 = (0.05)(c_metal)(95) -> c_metal = 1255.2 / 4.75 ≈ 500 J/kg°C."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What mass of hot water at 70°C must be added to 2.0 kg of cold water at 10°C in a large, insulated container for the final mixture to be 30°C?",
        "options": [
          "1.0 kg",
          "2.0 kg",
          "0.5 kg",
          "4.0 kg"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Let m be the mass of hot water. Heat lost by hot water = Heat gained by cold water. (m)(4184)(70-30) = (2.0)(4184)(30-10). The 4184 cancels. 40m = 40 -> m = 1.0 kg."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a calorimeter cup itself absorbs a significant amount of heat during an experiment, what must be included in the 'Heat Gained' side of the equation?",
        "options": [
          "The heat capacity of the calorimeter",
          "The mass of the air inside",
          "The temperature of the room",
          "The heat lost by the thermometer"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation becomes: Heat Lost by Hot Object = Heat Gained by Cold Water + Heat Gained by Calorimeter Cup. The heat gained by the cup is calculated as (heat capacity of cup) × (ΔT of cup)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.1 kg unknown metal is heated to 95°C and placed into a calorimeter containing 0.25 kg of water at 22°C. The final temperature stabilizes at 25°C. What is the heat gained by the water, in Joules? (c_water = 4184 J/kg°C)",
        "options": [
          "3138 J",
          "1255 J",
          "418 J",
          "Cannot be determined"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The heat gained by the water can be calculated directly with its own data: Q_water = m_water * c_water * ΔT_water = (0.25 kg)(4184 J/kg°C)(25°C - 22°C) = 3138 J."

      {
        "type": "mcq",

        "explanation": "Common metal SHC values: Iron/Steel ~450 J/kg°C, Aluminum ~900 J/kg°C, Copper ~385 J/kg°C, Lead ~130 J/kg°C. A value of 450 J/kg°C is typical for iron or steel."
