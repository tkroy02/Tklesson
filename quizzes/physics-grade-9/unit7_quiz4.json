    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "1. In a transverse wave, how do the particles of the medium move compared to the wave's direction?",
        "options": [
          "They move in the same direction.",
          "They move up and down while the wave moves sideways.",
          "They don't move at all.",
          "They move in circles."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Think of a wave on a rope. You shake it up and down, but the wave travels along the rope. The particle motion (up/down) is perpendicular to the wave direction (sideways)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "2. What are the high points of a transverse wave called?",
        "options": [
          "Troughs",
          "Crests",
          "Compressions",
          "Valleys"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The high points are called crests, just like the top of a wave in the ocean."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "3. What are the low points of a transverse wave called?",
        "options": [
          "Crests",
          "Troughs",
          "Rarefactions",
          "Hills"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The low points are called troughs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "4. Which of the following is the BEST example of a transverse wave?",
        "options": [
          "A sound wave traveling through air.",
          "A wave you make by shaking a rope up and down.",
          "A push moving through a slinky.",
          "Voices talking in another room."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A wave on a rope is a classic example. You can see the up-and-down motion creating crests and troughs."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "5. Which type of wave is transverse and can travel through empty space?",
        "options": [
          "Sound waves",
          "Ocean waves",
          "Waves on a guitar string",
          "Light waves"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Light is an electromagnetic wave, which is transverse. Unlike sound, it doesn't need air or a medium to travel; it can move through a vacuum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "6. What do we call it when the vibrations of a transverse wave are restricted to one plane?",
        "options": [
          "Reflection",
          "Polarization",
          "Amplification",
          "Vibration"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Polarization is a property of only transverse waves. Polarized sunglasses use this to block out glare by restricting the light waves' vibration direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "7. What is the maximum distance a particle moves from its rest position in a wave called?",
        "options": [
          "Wavelength",
          "Frequency",
          "Amplitude",
          "Crest"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Amplitude is the height of the wave from the rest position to a crest. A higher amplitude means more energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "8. The distance from one wave crest to the next is called the...",
        "options": [
          "Amplitude",
          "Frequency",
          "Wavelength",
          "Speed"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Wavelength is the distance between two identical points on consecutive waves, like crest-to-crest or trough-to-trough."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "9. Why can't you make a true transverse wave in the air with your hand?",
        "options": [
          "Air is invisible.",
          "Air particles can't push each other sideways to transfer energy up and down.",
          "It would be too quiet.",
          "Transverse waves are only for light."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Air particles are easily pushed forward and backward (making sound waves), but they can't effectively grip each other to transfer a sideways, up-and-down motion like a rope can."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "10. Looking at a transverse wave diagram, how could you identify it?",
        "options": [
          "It shows areas squeezed together and spread out.",
          "It looks like a straight line.",
          "It has a repeating pattern of crests and troughs.",
          "It shows particles moving in circles."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The clearest visual clue for a transverse wave is its pattern of alternating crests (high points) and troughs (low points)."
