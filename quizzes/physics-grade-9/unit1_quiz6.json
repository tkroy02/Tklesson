    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A scientist discovers a new particle. For this discovery to be accepted, the most important next step is to:",
        "options": [
          "Give the particle a catchy name.",
          "Publish the findings so other scientists can attempt to replicate the results.",
          "Immediately add it to textbooks.",
          "Assume no one else will understand it."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science. For a finding to be accepted, it must be verified by other independent researchers following the same procedure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All of the following numbers are considered standard, preferred intervals for scaling a graph axis, EXCEPT:",
        "options": [
          "1",
