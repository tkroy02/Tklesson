        "question": "A student hypothesizes that 'plants grow faster with more sunlight.' In an experiment testing this, what is the independent variable?",
        "options": [
          "The amount of sunlight",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since there are 100 cm in a meter, 250 cm / 100 = 2.5 m."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cyclist travels 30 meters north in 5 seconds, then 20 meters south in the next 3 seconds. What is their average speed for the entire trip?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time. Total Distance = 30m + 20m = 50m. Total Time = 5s + 3s = 8s. 50m / 8s = 6.25 m/s."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the cyclist's journey from the previous question (30m north, then 20m south), what is their average velocity?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acceleration = (Final Velocity - Initial Velocity) / Time. a = (30 m/s - 10 m/s) / 4 s = 20 m/s / 4 s = 5 m/s²."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Newton's Second Law is expressed as F_net = m × a. Therefore, for a constant force, a larger mass (m) results in a smaller acceleration (a)."
      },

          "25 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is an example of Newton's Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction."

          "Decreases, decreases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the boulder falls, it loses height (so GPE decreases) and gains speed (so KE increases). Energy is transformed from potential to kinetic."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A simple machine, like a ramp, reduces the force needed to lift an object by:",
