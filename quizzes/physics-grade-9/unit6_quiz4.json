      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1000 kg car accelerates from 20 m/s to 30 m/s over a distance of 100 m. What is the magnitude of the net force acting on the car? (Hint: Use a kinematics equation first)",
        "options": [
          "2,500 N",
          "1,000 N",
          "5,000 N",
          "10,000 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, find acceleration using v_f² = v_i² + 2ad. (30)² = (20)² + 2a(100). 900 = 400 + 200a. 500 = 200a, so a = 2.5 m/s². Then, F_net = m × a = 1000 kg × 2.5 m/s² = 2,500 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A crane lifts a 200 kg steel beam vertically at a constant speed of 0.5 m/s. What is the power output of the crane? (Use g = 10 m/s²)",
        "options": [
          "1,000 W",
          "100 W",
          "500 W",
          "2,000 W"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Constant speed means the net force is zero, so the crane's force equals the weight: F = m × g = 200 kg × 10 m/s² = 2000 N. Power = Force × Velocity = 2000 N × 0.5 m/s = 1,000 W."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 2 kg ball is dropped from a height of 10 m. What is its kinetic energy just before it hits the ground? (Ignore air resistance, use g = 10 m/s²)",
        "options": [
          "200 J",
          "20 J",
          "100 J",
          "400 J"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By conservation of energy, all initial GPE is converted to KE. Initial GPE = m × g × h = 2 kg × 10 m/s² × 10 m = 200 J. So, KE just before impact = 200 J."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Using the previous scenario (2 kg ball from 10 m), what is the velocity of the ball just before impact?",

          "14.1 m/s",
          "10 m/s",
          "20 m/s",
          "4.5 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "From the KE of 200 J: KE = ½mv² → 200 J = ½ × 2 kg × v² → 200 = v² → v = √200 ≈ 14.1 m/s. (Or using kinematics: v_f² = v_i² + 2gh = 0 + 2×10×10 = 200)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A person pushes a 50 kg box with a horizontal force of 100 N against a constant frictional force of 20 N. What is the acceleration of the box?",

          "0.4 m/s²",
          "2.4 m/s²"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net Force = Applied Force - Friction = 100 N - 20 N = 80 N. Using F_net = m × a, 80 N = 50 kg × a → a = 80 / 50 = 1.6 m/s²."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 0.1 kg arrow is fired from a bow. The bowstring exerts an average force of 150 N over a distance of 0.5 m. What is the speed of the arrow as it leaves the bow?",
        "options": [
          "~38.7 m/s",

          "~150 m/s",
          "~8.5 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The work done by the bowstring becomes the arrow's KE. Work = Force × Distance = 150 N × 0.5 m = 75 J. KE = 75 J = ½ × 0.1 kg × v² → v² = 1500 → v = √1500 ≈ 38.7 m/s."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a statement of the Law of Conservation of Energy?",
        "options": [
          "The total energy of the universe is constantly increasing.",
          "Energy cannot be created or destroyed.",
          "Energy can be transformed from one form to another.",
          "The total energy in an isolated system remains constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total energy of the universe is considered constant, not increasing. The other options are correct statements of the law."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 60 kg diver drops from a 10 m platform into the water. After entering the water, she comes to a stop 2.0 m below the surface. What is the average net force the water exerted on her? (Use g = 10 m/s²)",
        "options": [
          "3,000 N upward",
          "600 N upward",
          "3,000 N downward",
          "2,400 N upward"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Her initial GPE at the platform is converted to work done by water. m × g × h_total = F_water × d_water. (60 kg × 10 m/s² × 12 m) = F_water × 2 m. 7200 J = F_water × 2 m → F_water = 3600 N. This is the total upward force. Net Force = F_water - Weight = 3600 N - (60×10=600 N) = 3000 N upward."
      },

          "Moving at constant speed",
          "At rest",
          "Moving in the opposite direction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A curved line on a distance-time graph means the slope (which is speed) is changing. A change in speed means the object is accelerating."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 1500 kg car is moving at 15 m/s. The driver applies the brakes and the car stops in 5 seconds. What is the average power dissipated by the brakes?",

          "22,500 W",
          "45,000 W"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work done by brakes = Initial KE of car = ½ × 1500 kg × (15 m/s)² = ½ × 1500 × 225 = 168,750 J. Power = Work / Time = 168,750 J / 5 s = 33,750 W."

          "30° North of East"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The forces are perpendicular. The magnitude is √(40² + 30²) = 50 N. The direction is given by tanθ = (opposite/adjacent) = 30/40 = 0.75. θ = arctan(0.75) ≈ 37° North of East."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The component of gravity parallel to the incline is F = m × g × sin(θ) = 5 kg × 10 m/s² × sin(30°) = 50 N × 0.5 = 25 N."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the mass of a planet were doubled while its radius remained the same, the acceleration due to gravity on its surface would:",
        "options": [

          "Stay the same",
          "Quadruple"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gravity force F = G M m / R². Since F = m g, then g = G M / R². If mass M doubles and R is constant, g doubles."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A pendulum swings back and forth. At which point is the tension in the string the greatest?",
        "options": [
          "At the lowest point of the swing",
          "At the highest points of the swing",
          "The tension is constant throughout",
          "Halfway between the high and low points"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the lowest point, the pendulum has its maximum speed and thus requires the maximum centripetal force. Tension must not only support weight but also provide this centripetal force, making it greatest here."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 10 kW motor is used to lift a 500 kg load vertically. What is the maximum constant speed at which it can lift the load? (Use g = 10 m/s²)",

          "20 m/s"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Power = Force × Velocity. The force needed is equal to the weight: F = m × g = 500 kg × 10 m/s² = 5000 N. 10,000 W = 5000 N × v → v = 10,000 / 5000 = 2 m/s."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the bottom, the centripetal force is the sum of tension and weight (F_c = T - mg). At the top, it's the difference (F_c = T + mg). For constant speed, the force providing the centripetal acceleration is greatest at the bottom."

          "+700 J",
          "+1700 J",
          "-700 J",
          "-1700 J"
        ],
        "explanation": "This applies the First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy). ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done BY the system. Here, work is done ON the system, so W is negative: -1200 J. Heat is lost, so Q is negative: -500 J. ΔU = (-500 J) - (-1200 J) = +700 J. The internal energy increases by 700 J.",

          "200 N"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "First, find acceleration: v_f² = v_i² + 2ad. (7)² = (3)² + 2a(20). 49 = 9 + 40a. 40 = 40a, so a = 1 m/s². Then, F = m × a = 75 kg × 1 m/s² = 75 N. This is the net force. However, the question asks for the runner's force output. This must overcome any friction or drag. Assuming this is the net force, the answer is 75 N. If we assume the net force *is* the runner's force (on a frictionless track), the answer is 75 N. The most accurate answer given the context is 75 N, but it highlights the nuance between net force and applied force."
