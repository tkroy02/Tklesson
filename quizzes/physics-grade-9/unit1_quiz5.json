        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "One can typically estimate a measurement to within half of the smallest division on a standard ruler (1 mm), giving a common uncertainty of ± 0.1 cm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an experiment, all factors that could influence the results, except for the one being tested, must be:",
        "options": [
          "Maximized",
          "Ignored",
          "Kept constant",
          "Changed randomly"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "These are controlled variables. Keeping them constant ensures that any change in the dependent variable is due only to the manipulation of the independent variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A scientist publishes their experimental procedure, data, and conclusions for other experts to examine. This process is called:",

          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The number 3.5 has the fewest significant figures (2). When multiplying and dividing, the result must be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the value with the least."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A company claims its battery lasts 'over 10 hours.' To test this claim scientifically, you should:",

          "Inverse relationship"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A U-shaped curve is characteristic of a quadratic relationship, where the dependent variable changes with the square of the independent variable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct formula for calculating the slope (gradient) of a straight line on a graph?",
        "options": [
          "(x₂ - x₁)/(y₂ - y₁)",
          "(y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)",

          "The control group is larger than the experimental group."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A fair test ensures that the outcome is due to the variable being tested and not other factors. This is achieved by controlling all other relevant variables."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the line of best fit for a dataset has the equation y = 5x + 2, what does the '5' represent?",
