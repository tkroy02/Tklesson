Average velocity = 19.2 m / 7 s ≈ 2.74 m/s. (Note: The closest correct calculation is √(15²+12²)/7 = √369/7 ≈ 19.2/7 ≈ 2.74 m/s. The options seem inconsistent. The correct magnitude is approximately 2.74 m/s, which is not listed. However, based on the provided options and typical calculation errors, 4.0 m/s might be selected if one incorrectly averages the speeds.)"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Change in velocity = (60 - 30) km/h = 30 km/h = 8.33 m/s. Acceleration = 8.33 m/s / 5 s ≈ 1.67 m/s²."
