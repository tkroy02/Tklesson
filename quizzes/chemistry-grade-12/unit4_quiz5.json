    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Predicting reaction pathways",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which substrate is almost exclusively limited to the SN2 mechanism due to the inability to form a stable carbocation?",
        "options": [
          "Methyl and primary (1°) halides",
          "Secondary (2°) halides",
          "Tertiary (3°) halides",
          "Allylic halides"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methyl and primary carbocations are extremely unstable, making the SN1 pathway energetically unfavorable. Their low steric hindrance makes them ideal for SN2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor most strongly favors an SN1 reaction over an SN2 reaction for a secondary (2°) haloalkane?",
        "options": [
          "Use of a polar protic solvent",
          "Use of a strong, concentrated nucleophile",
          "Increasing the concentration of the substrate",
          "Use of a polar aprotic solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polar protic solvents (like water or alcohols) stabilize the carbocation intermediate of SN1. In contrast, they hinder SN2 by solvating and 'weakening' the nucleophile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does nucleophile strength affect the choice of mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "Strong nucleophiles favor SN2; weak nucleophiles favor SN1",
          "Strong nucleophiles favor SN1; weak nucleophiles favor SN2",
          "Nucleophile strength only affects elimination reactions",
          "Strong nucleophiles prevent any reaction from occurring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "SN2 requires a strong nucleophile to force the leaving group out in one step. SN1 occurs when a substrate ionizes on its own, often reacting with a weak nucleophile (like the solvent)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the behavior of tertiary (3°) haloalkanes?",
        "options": [
          "They react via SN1 because of steric hindrance to SN2 and high carbocation stability",
          "They react via SN2 because they have many electrons",
          "They never react under any conditions",
          "They react via SN2 only in polar protic solvents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tertiary centers are too crowded for a back-side attack (SN2) but form very stable carbocations, making them perfect candidates for SN1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which mechanism is the rate highly dependent on the 'leaving group ability'?",
        "options": [
          "Both SN1 and SN2",
          "Only SN1",
          "Only SN2",
          "Neither; leaving group ability only matters in elimination"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In both mechanisms, the carbon-halogen bond must break. A better leaving group (like I- vs Cl-) lowers the activation energy for both pathways."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Predict the most likely mechanism for the reaction: 2-iodopropane + Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) in DMSO.",
        "options": [
          "SN2",
          "SN1",
          "E1",
          "No reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cyanide is a strong nucleophile and DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. These conditions strongly favor the SN2 pathway for a secondary substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a polar aprotic solvent (like Acetone) speed up SN2 reactions?",
        "options": [
          "It does not solvate the nucleophile strongly, keeping it highly reactive",
          "It stabilizes the carbocation intermediate",
          "It reacts with the leaving group to remove it",
          "It increases the steric hindrance of the substrate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aprotic solvents lack H-atoms bonded to electronegative elements, so they cannot form hydrogen bonds to 'cloak' the nucleophile, leaving it 'naked' and ready to attack."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these would likely lead to a mixture of SN1 and SN2 products?",
        "options": [
          "A secondary (2°) halide with a moderately strong nucleophile",
          "A methyl halide with a weak nucleophile",
          "A tertiary (3°) halide with a strong base",
          "A primary (1°) halide in a non-polar solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Secondary halides are the 'middle ground.' Depending on the solvent and nucleophile strength, they can often proceed through either (or both) pathways."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the mechanism of a 3° halide if you increase the concentration of a weak nucleophile?",
        "options": [
          "The mechanism remains SN1, and the rate does not change",
          "The mechanism switches to SN2",
          "The reaction stops completely",
          "The rate increases significantly but stays SN1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the rate-determining step of SN1 does not involve the nucleophile, increasing its concentration doesn't change the rate or the mechanism for a 3° substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of an SN2 reaction that distinguishes it from SN1?",
        "options": [
          "The reaction rate depends on the concentration of the nucleophile",
          "The reaction involves a carbocation",
          "The reaction results in racemization",
          "The reaction is favored by polar protic solvents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "SN2 is bimolecular, meaning the nucleophile is part of the rate law ($Rate = k[Substrate][Nu]$), unlike SN1."
