    "topic": "Predicting reaction pathways",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which substrate is almost exclusively limited to the $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ mechanism due to the inability to form a stable carbocation?",
        "options": [
          "Methyl and primary ($1^{\\circ}$) halides",
          "Secondary ($2^{\\circ}$) halides",
          "Tertiary ($3^{\\circ}$) halides",
          "Allylic halides"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methyl and primary carbocations are extremely unstable, making the $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ pathway energetically unfavorable. Their low steric hindrance makes them ideal for $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor most strongly favors an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ reaction over an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ reaction for a secondary ($2^{\\circ}$) haloalkane?",
        "options": [
          "Use of a polar protic solvent",
          "Use of a strong, concentrated nucleophile",
          "Increasing the concentration of the substrate",
          "Use of a polar aprotic solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polar protic solvents (like water or alcohols) stabilize the carbocation intermediate of $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$. In contrast, they hinder $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ by solvating and 'weakening' the nucleophile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does nucleophile strength affect the choice of mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "Strong nucleophiles favor $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$; weak nucleophiles favor $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$",
          "Strong nucleophiles favor $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$; weak nucleophiles favor $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$",
          "Nucleophile strength only affects elimination reactions",
          "Strong nucleophiles prevent any reaction from occurring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ requires a strong nucleophile to force the leaving group out in one step. $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ occurs when a substrate ionizes on its own, often reacting with a weak nucleophile (like the solvent)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the behavior of tertiary ($3^{\\circ}$) haloalkanes?",
        "options": [
          "They react via $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ because of steric hindrance to $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ and high carbocation stability",
          "They react via $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ because they have many electrons",
          "They never react under any conditions",
          "They react via $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ only in polar protic solvents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tertiary centers are too crowded for a back-side attack ($\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$) but form very stable carbocations, making them perfect candidates for $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which mechanism is the rate highly dependent on the 'leaving group ability'?",
        "options": [
          "Both $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ and $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$",
          "Only $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$",
          "Only $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$",
          "Neither; leaving group ability only matters in elimination"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In both mechanisms, the carbon-halogen bond must break. A better leaving group (like $\\text{I}^{-}$ vs $\\text{Cl}^{-}$) lowers the activation energy for both pathways."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Predict the most likely mechanism for the reaction: 2-iodopropane + Sodium Cyanide ($\\text{NaCN}$) in DMSO.",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$",
          "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$",
          "$\\text{E}1$",
          "No reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cyanide is a strong nucleophile and DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. These conditions strongly favor the $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ pathway for a secondary substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a polar aprotic solvent (like Acetone) speed up $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ reactions?",
        "options": [
          "It does not solvate the nucleophile strongly, keeping it highly reactive",
          "It stabilizes the carbocation intermediate",
          "It reacts with the leaving group to remove it",
          "It increases the steric hindrance of the substrate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aprotic solvents lack H-atoms bonded to electronegative elements, so they cannot form hydrogen bonds to 'cloak' the nucleophile, leaving it 'naked' and ready to attack."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these would likely lead to a mixture of $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ and $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ products?",
        "options": [
          "A secondary ($2^{\\circ}$) halide with a moderately strong nucleophile",
          "A methyl halide with a weak nucleophile",
          "A tertiary ($3^{\\circ}$) halide with a strong base",
          "A primary ($1^{\\circ}$) halide in a non-polar solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Secondary halides are the 'middle ground.' Depending on the solvent and nucleophile strength, they can often proceed through either (or both) pathways."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the mechanism of a $3^{\\circ}$ halide if you increase the concentration of a weak nucleophile?",
        "options": [
          "The mechanism remains $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$, and the rate does not change",
          "The mechanism switches to $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$",
          "The reaction stops completely",
          "The rate increases significantly but stays $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the rate-determining step of $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ does not involve the nucleophile, increasing its concentration doesn't change the rate or the mechanism for a $3^{\\circ}$ substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ reaction that distinguishes it from $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$?",
        "options": [
          "The reaction rate depends on the concentration of the nucleophile",
          "The reaction involves a carbocation",
          "The reaction results in racemization",
          "The reaction is favored by polar protic solvents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ is bimolecular, meaning the nucleophile is part of the rate law ($\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{Substrate}][\\text{Nu}]$), unlike $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$."
