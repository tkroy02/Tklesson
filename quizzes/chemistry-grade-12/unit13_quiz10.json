      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would result in an increase in the value of the equilibrium constant (K) for an exothermic reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing the temperature",
          "Increasing the temperature",

          "Increasing the concentration of reactants"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For exothermic reactions, heat is a product. Removing heat (decreasing temperature) shifts the equilibrium to the right, increasing K."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the pH of a 0.01 M solution of a strong diprotic acid, assuming complete dissociation?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 0.01 M diprotic acid yields 0.02 M $H^{+}$. $pH = -\\log(0.02) \\approx 1.7$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which transition metal ion is expected to be paramagnetic?",
        "options": [
          "Fe³⁺",

          "Cu⁺"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fe³⁺ has a $d^{5}$ configuration with unpaired electrons. The others have full ($d^{10}$) or empty ($d^{0}$) d-shells."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a galvanic cell, oxidation occurs at the _______ and the flow of electrons is toward the _______.",

          "Anode; Cathode",
          "Cathode; Anode",
          "Anode; Salt bridge",
          "Cathode; External circuit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation always occurs at the anode (An Ox). Electrons travel through the wire from the anode to the cathode."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following molecules has a square planar molecular geometry?",

          "CH₄",
          "SF₄",
          "NH₃"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "XeF₄ has 4 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs ($AX_{4}E_{2}$), resulting in a square planar shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of radioactive decay increases the atomic number by 1?",
        "options": [
          "Beta-minus decay",
          "Alpha decay",
          "Positron emission",
          "Gamma emission"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In ${\\beta}^{-}$ decay, a neutron becomes a proton, increasing Z while mass (A) remains constant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction has $\\Delta H > 0$ and $\\Delta S > 0$. When is this reaction spontaneous?",
        "options": [
          "At high temperatures",
          "At low temperatures",
          "It is never spontaneous",
          "It is spontaneous at all temperatures"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Based on $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, when both are positive, the $T\\Delta S$ term must be large enough to make $\\Delta G$ negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for $[Cu(NH₃)₄]SO₄$?",
        "options": [
          "Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate",
          "Copper(II) tetraammine sulfate",

          "Tetraamminecopper sulfate(II)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The complex is a cation, so the metal name remains 'copper'. $NH₃$ is neutral, so Cu must be +2 to balance the -2 sulfate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which organic reaction mechanism involves a carbocation intermediate and results in a racemic mixture of products?",

          "Electrophilic addition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The planar carbocation in S_N1 reactions allows the nucleophile to attack from either side, leading to racemization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the rate law for a reaction where doubling the concentration of [A] quadruples the rate?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
