    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between a 'primary' cell and a 'secondary' cell?",
        "options": [
          "Secondary cells are rechargeable, while primary cells are not.",
          "Primary cells use liquid electrolytes, while secondary cells are dry.",
          "Primary cells have a higher voltage than secondary cells.",
          "Secondary cells cannot be used in portable electronics."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Primary cells involve redox reactions that are not easily reversible, meaning they are discarded after use. Secondary cells can be recharged by applying an external electrical current to reverse the reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a common Alkaline battery (Leclanché cell), which material serves as the anode?",

          "Potassium hydroxide ($KOH$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zinc acts as the anode in alkaline batteries, where it is oxidized. It is often used in powder form to increase surface area and current output."
      },

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lead-acid batteries are the standard for internal combustion engine vehicles because they provide the high surge currents needed for starting motors and are rechargeable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the major advantage of Lithium-ion batteries over Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) batteries?",
        "options": [
          "Higher energy density and lack of 'memory effect'.",
          "They are much cheaper to produce.",
          "They use water-based electrolytes that cannot catch fire.",
          "They have a much lower voltage per cell."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lithium-ion batteries store more energy for their size/weight and do not suffer from the memory effect, which reduces the effective capacity of NiCd batteries over time."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Lead-acid battery, what is the composition of the cathode when the battery is fully charged?",
        "options": [
          "Lead(IV) oxide ($PbO_{2}$)",
          "Pure Lead ($Pb$)",
          "Lead(II) sulfate ($PbSO_{4}$)",
          "Sulfuric acid ($H_{2}SO_{4}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cathode consists of a lead grid packed with lead(IV) oxide. During discharge, both the anode ($Pb$) and cathode ($PbO_{2}$) are converted into $PbSO_{4}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What electrolyte is typically used in a Lead-acid battery?",
        "options": [
          "Sulfuric acid ($H_{2}SO_{4}$)",
          "Potassium hydroxide ($KOH$)",
          "Ammonium chloride ($NH_{4}Cl$)",
          "Sodium chloride ($NaCl$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Concentrated sulfuric acid serves as the electrolyte. Its density changes as the battery discharges, which can be used to check the state of charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are Silver-oxide batteries commonly used in watches and hearing aids?",
        "options": [
          "They maintain a very constant voltage during discharge and are small.",
          "They are the cheapest batteries available on the market.",
          "They can be recharged thousands of times.",
          "They produce large amounts of heat during use."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Silver-oxide batteries have a very flat discharge curve (constant voltage) and high energy density, making them ideal for small, precision electronics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens at the anode during the charging process of a secondary battery?",
        "options": [
          "Reduction occurs as electrons are forced into the electrode.",
          "Oxidation occurs as the metal dissolves into the solution.",
          "The anode turns into a gas and escapes the battery.",
          "The anode's mass stays exactly the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During charging, the roles of the electrodes are reversed. The electrode that acted as the anode during discharge now undergoes reduction to restore the original material."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which metal is becoming less common in rechargeable batteries due to its high toxicity and environmental impact?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cadmium is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to the environment, leading to the gradual phasing out of NiCd batteries in favor of NiMH and Li-ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'dry cell' is named such because:",
        "options": [
          "The electrolyte is a paste rather than a free-flowing liquid.",
          "It contains no water at all.",
          "It can only function in low-humidity environments.",
          "The outer casing is made of waterproof plastic."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a dry cell, the electrolyte is immobilized in a paste, which prevents leakage and allows the battery to be used in any orientation."
