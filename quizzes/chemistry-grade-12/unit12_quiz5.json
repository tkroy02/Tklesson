      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does a catalyst increase the rate of a chemical reaction?",
        "options": [
          "By providing an alternative mechanism with a lower activation energy.",
          "By increasing the average kinetic energy of the reactants.",
          "By shifting the equilibrium constant toward the products.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A catalyst lowers the energy barrier ($E_{a}$), allowing a larger fraction of collisions to be successful at a given temperature."

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a potential energy diagram, the presence of a catalyst will:",
        "options": [
          "Lower the height of the activation energy peak.",
          "Lower the potential energy of the reactants.",
          "Increase the potential energy of the products.",
          "Increase the total enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$) of the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The energy of the reactants and products (and thus the $\\Delta H$) remains unchanged; only the transition state energy is lowered."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'heterogeneous' catalyst?",
        "options": [
          "A catalyst that exists in a different phase from the reactants.",
          "A catalyst that is made of more than one element.",
          "A catalyst that speeds up only the reverse reaction.",
          "A catalyst that requires a high concentration to work."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A common example is a solid metal surface (like Platinum) used to catalyze a reaction between gaseous reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The process of 'adsorption' in heterogeneous catalysis refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The binding of reactant molecules to the surface of the catalyst.",
          "The release of product molecules from the catalyst surface.",
          "The internal diffusion of reactants through a liquid.",
          "The permanent bonding of an inhibitor to the catalyst."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adsorption weakens the bonds within the reactant molecules, making it easier for them to react."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Enzymes are biological catalysts that are typically made of:",
        "options": [
          "Proteins",
          "Lipids",
          "Carbohydrates",
          "Transition metals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enzymes are specialized protein molecules that provide highly specific active sites for biochemical reactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a catalyst at the end of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It is regenerated in its original chemical form.",
          "It is converted into a waste product.",
          "It is incorporated into the final product molecule.",
          "It is evaporated due to the heat of the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, catalysts participate in the mechanism but are not consumed in the overall process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the effect of a catalyst on the equilibrium position of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It has no effect on the equilibrium position.",
          "It shifts the equilibrium toward the products.",
          "It shifts the equilibrium toward the reactants.",
          "It increases the value of $K_{eq}$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A catalyst speeds up the forward and reverse reactions equally, so it helps reach equilibrium faster but does not change the concentrations at equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following can 'poison' a catalyst?",

          "An increase in the concentration of reactants.",
          "The removal of products as they are formed.",
          "The use of a noble gas as a solvent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalyst poisons block the active sites, preventing reactants from adsorbing and effectively stopping the catalytic activity."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'lock and key' model is used to describe the specificity of:",
