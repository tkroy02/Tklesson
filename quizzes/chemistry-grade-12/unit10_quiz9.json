    "topic": "The relationship between Gibbs Free Energy and the equilibrium constant K",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation correctly relates the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}$) to the equilibrium constant ($K$)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K$",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = RT \\ln K$",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -nFE^{\\circ}$",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This equation links thermodynamic stability to the extent of a reaction. Note the negative sign, which ensures that a spontaneous reaction (negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$) results in a large $K$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction has an equilibrium constant $K > 1$, what can be said about its standard free energy change ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ must be negative.",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ must be positive.",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ must be zero.",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is independent of $K$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $K > 1$, the natural log ($\\ln K$) is positive. Multiplying by $-RT$ makes the resulting $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ negative, indicating a product-favored reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of the non-standard free energy change ($\\Delta G$) when a system reaches chemical equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "Equal to $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$",
          "1",
          "Infinite"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, there is no longer a net driving force for the reaction to proceed in either direction, so $\\Delta G = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which constant is represented by 'R' in the equation $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K$?",
        "options": [
          "The ideal gas constant ($8.314\\ J/mol\\cdot K$)",
          "The Rydberg constant",
          "The Faraday constant",
          "The rate constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\Delta G$ is measured in energy units (Joules), we use the gas constant $8.314\\ J/mol\\cdot K$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is exactly zero, what is the value of the equilibrium constant $K$?",
        "options": [
          "1",
          "0",
          "100",
          "$-1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $0 = -RT \\ln K$, then $\\ln K$ must be 0. Since $e^{0} = 1$, the equilibrium constant must be 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'thermodynamically dead' system?",
        "options": [
          "A system where $\\Delta G = 0$ (at equilibrium).",
          "A system with a very high $\\Delta H$.",
          "A system at absolute zero.",
          "A system in a vacuum."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A system at equilibrium can no longer perform work because its free energy is at a minimum; hence it is described as thermodynamically dead."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the position of equilibrium if $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ becomes more negative?",
        "options": [
          "The equilibrium shifts further toward the products.",
          "The equilibrium shifts further toward the reactants.",
          "The equilibrium constant $K$ decreases.",
          "The reaction rate increases significantly."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A more negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ corresponds to a larger $K$, meaning the products are even more thermodynamically favored over the reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The relationship $\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q$ is used to calculate:",
        "options": [
          "The free energy change under non-standard conditions.",
          "The activation energy of a reaction.",
          "The enthalpy of formation.",
          "The entropy of the surroundings."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This equation allows us to find $\\Delta G$ for any given concentrations or pressures by using the reaction quotient $Q$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does a reaction with a positive $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ still produce a small amount of product?",
        "options": [
          "Because $K$ is small but never truly zero.",
          "Because the reaction is actually exothermic.",
          "Because entropy always increases in the surroundings.",
          "Because the catalyst forces the reaction to happen."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even if $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is positive, $K$ will be a small fraction (e.g., $10^{-5}$), meaning a tiny but measurable amount of product exists at equilibrium."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does an increase in temperature affect $K$ for an endothermic reaction ($\\Delta H^{\\circ} > 0$)?",
        "options": [
          "$K$ increases as $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ becomes more negative.",
          "$K$ decreases as $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ becomes more positive.",
          "$K$ remains constant because $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is standard.",
          "$K$ becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For endothermic reactions, increasing $T$ makes the $-T\\Delta S$ term more influential (if $\\Delta S$ is positive) or simply drives the equilibrium toward products per Le Chatelier's Principle, increasing $K$."
