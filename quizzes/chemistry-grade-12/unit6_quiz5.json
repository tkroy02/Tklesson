    "topic": "Acetal and ketal chemistry",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An acetal is formed by the reaction of an aldehyde with how many equivalents of alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "Two equivalents",
          "One equivalent",
          "Three equivalents",
          "None; it reacts with water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "One equivalent of alcohol forms a hemiacetal; the second equivalent reacts to form the full acetal and a molecule of water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the intermediate structure called that contains both an alcohol (-OH) and an ether (-OR) group on the same carbon?",
        "options": [
          "Hemiacetal",
          "Acetal",
          "Enol",
          "Hydrate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A hemiacetal is the 'halfway' point of the reaction, where the carbonyl oxygen has been protonated/converted to a hydroxyl group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Acetal formation is typically catalyzed by:",
        "options": [
          "Acid",
          "Base",
          "Heat only",
          "UV light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acids are required to protonate the hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal to make it a good leaving group (water) for the second nucleophilic attack."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the formation of an acetal from a hemiacetal not possible under basic conditions?",
        "options": [
          "The hydroxide group (-OH) is a poor leaving group and cannot be protonated in base.",
          "The alcohol becomes too nucleophilic and stays attached.",
          "Bases cause the carbonyl to decompose.",
          "The reaction is too fast to observe in base."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To move from a hemiacetal to an acetal, the -OH group must leave as $H_{2}O$. This requires protonation, which cannot happen in a basic environment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is often used to drive the reversible acetal reaction toward the product side?",
        "options": [
          "Removing water as it forms",
          "Adding more water to the mixture",
          "Decreasing the concentration of alcohol",
          "Using a basic catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By Le Chatelier's principle, removing water (a byproduct) shifts the equilibrium toward the formation of the acetal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cyclic acetals are often formed using which of the following reagents?",
        "options": [
          "Ethane-1,2-diol (Ethylene glycol)",
          "Ethanol",
          "Methanol",
          "Phenol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diols like ethylene glycol react with carbonyls to form stable five-membered cyclic acetals, often used to protect carbonyls during synthesis."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Acetals are stable in basic solutions but can be converted back to the original carbonyl by adding:",
        "options": [
          "Aqueous acid",
          "Strong base",
          "Anhydrous alcohol",
          "A reducing agent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acetals are sensitive to acid; adding water and acid (hydrolysis) reverses the equilibrium back to the aldehyde or ketone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the mechanism of acetal formation, the step following the formation of the hemiacetal involves:",
        "options": [
          "Loss of water to form a resonance-stabilized carbocation.",
          "Attack of a second alcohol on the neutral hemiacetal.",
          "Deprotonation of the carbonyl oxygen.",
          "Addition of a hydride ion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hemiacetal -OH is protonated and leaves as water, leaving behind an oxonium ion (carbocation stabilized by oxygen) that is attacked by the second alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which functional group is characterized by two -OR groups attached to the same carbon atom?",
        "options": [
          "Acetal",
          "Hemiacetal",
          "Ester",
          "Ether"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An acetal (or ketal, if derived from a ketone) has two ether-like linkages on a single carbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are acetals used as 'protecting groups'?",
        "options": [
          "They are unreactive toward bases and nucleophiles.",
          "They make the molecule more soluble in water.",
          "They increase the reactivity of the carbonyl carbon.",
          "They prevent the molecule from being oxidized."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once a carbonyl is converted to an acetal, it no longer has an electrophilic carbon, allowing other parts of the molecule to be treated with strong bases or nucleophiles without interference."
