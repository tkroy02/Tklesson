    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a balanced nuclear equation, which two quantities must be conserved?",
        "options": [
          "Sum of mass numbers and sum of atomic numbers",
          "Total number of molecules and total moles",
          "Sum of oxidation states and total volume",
          "Total mass in grams and number of electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass: $9 + 4 = 13$; Product side has 12, so 1 is missing. Atomic: $4 + 2 = 6$; Product side has 6, so 0 is missing. $^{1}_{0}n$ (a neutron) balances it."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mass stays the same, and the atomic number increases by 1 ($6 \\rightarrow 7 + -1$). This is beta-minus decay."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In electron capture, an inner-shell electron is 'captured' by the nucleus, so it appears on the left side of the equation."
