    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the two essential components of a Brønsted-Lowry buffer solution?",
        "options": [
          "A weak acid and its conjugate base (or vice versa).",
          "A strong acid and a strong base.",
          "A weak acid and a strong acid.",
          "Pure water and a neutral salt."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A buffer requires a conjugate pair of a weak species to neutralize small amounts of added $H_{3}O^{+}$ or $OH^{-}$ without a large change in pH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation is most commonly used to calculate the pH of a buffer solution?",
        "options": [
          "Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: $pH = pK_{a} + \\log\\frac{[Base]}{[Acid]}$",
          "Arrhenius equation: $k = Ae^{-E_{a}/RT}$",
          "Gibbs equation: $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$",
          "Nernst equation: $E = E^{\\circ} - \\frac{RT}{nF}\\ln Q$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a buffer to the $pK_{a}$ of the weak acid and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate pair."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a small amount of $HCl$ is added to a buffer containing $CH_{3}COOH$ and $CH_{3}COONa$, which species reacts to neutralize it?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_{3}COO^{-}$",
          "$CH_{3}COOH$",
          "$Na^{+}$",
          "$H_{2}O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conjugate base ($CH_{3}COO^{-}$) reacts with the added $H^{+}$ from the strong acid to form more weak acid, preventing a drastic pH drop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the pH of a buffer when the concentration of the weak acid equals the concentration of its conjugate base?",
        "options": [
          "pH = $pK_{a}$",
          "pH = 7.0",
          "pH = 14.0",
          "pH = 0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $[Base] = [Acid]$, the $\\log(1)$ term in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation becomes zero, leaving $pH = pK_{a}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following mixtures would NOT function as a buffer?",
        "options": [
          "$HCl$ and $NaCl$",
          "$NH_{3}$ and $NH_{4}Cl$",
          "$HF$ and $NaF$",
          "$H_{2}CO_{3}$ and $NaHCO_{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strong acids like $HCl$ and their salts do not form buffers because the conjugate base ($Cl^{-}$) is too weak to react with added $H^{+}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A buffer is most effective at resisting pH changes when the pH is:",
        "options": [
          "Within $\\pm 1$ unit of the $pK_{a}$.",
          "Exactly 7.0.",
          "At the pOH of the base.",
          "Greater than 10.0."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'buffer range' is generally considered to be $pK_{a} \\pm 1$, where the ratio of acid to base is within a 10:1 or 1:10 range."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you dilute a buffer solution with a small amount of pure water, what happens to its pH?",
        "options": [
          "The pH remains nearly constant.",
          "The pH increases significantly.",
          "The pH decreases significantly.",
          "The pH drops to 0."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the absolute concentrations change, the ratio of $[Base]/[Acid]$ remains the same, so the pH does not change significantly upon dilution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the human body, which buffer system is primarily responsible for maintaining blood pH around 7.4?",
        "options": [
          "Carbonate/Bicarbonate ($H_{2}CO_{3}/HCO_{3}^{-}$)",
          "Acetate/Acetic acid",
          "Ammonia/Ammonium",
          "Hydrochloric acid/Chloride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The bicarbonate buffer system is critical for physiological homeostasis, allowing the body to manage metabolic $CO_{2}$ and maintain pH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To prepare a buffer with a pH of 4.7, which weak acid would be the best choice?",
        "options": [
          "Acetic acid ($pK_{a} = 4.74$)",
          "Formic acid ($pK_{a} = 3.74$)",
          "Ammonium ($pK_{a} = 9.25$)",
          "Nitrous acid ($pK_{a} = 3.34$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For maximum effectiveness, you should choose a weak acid whose $pK_{a}$ is as close as possible to the desired pH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Adding $NaOH$ to a buffer results in the conversion of:",
        "options": [
          "Weak acid into conjugate base.",
          "Conjugate base into weak acid.",
          "Strong acid into strong base.",
          "Water into $H_{3}O^{+}$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $OH^{-}$ from the strong base reacts with the weak acid ($HA$) to produce more conjugate base ($A^{-}$) and water."
