          "Chloropropene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Following Markovnikov's rule, the hydrogen adds to $C_{1}$ (the carbon with more hydrogens) and the chlorine adds to $C_{2}$, yielding 2-chloropropane as the major product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the halogenation of an alkene with $Br_{2}$ in an inert solvent like $CCl_{4}$, what is the specific geometry of the addition?",

          "Substitution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Halogenation involves the formation of a cyclic halonium ion intermediate, which forces the second halogen to attack from the opposite face, resulting in anti-addition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is formed when ethene reacts with steam ($H_{2}O$) in the presence of a phosphoric acid catalyst?",
        "options": [
          "Ethanol",
          "Ethane",
          "Ethanal",
          "Ethanoic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a hydration reaction. The addition of water across the double bond of ethene produces the alcohol ethanol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the reaction between an alkene and a halogen ($X_{2}$)?",
        "options": [
          "The pi bond is broken and two C-X sigma bonds are formed",
          "The sigma bond is broken and a pi bond is formed",
          "One hydrogen is substituted by a halogen atom",
          "The molecule breaks into two smaller halogenated alkanes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an addition reaction, the weak pi bond is sacrificed to form two new, strong sigma bonds with the incoming atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the reaction of ethene with $Br_{2}$ occur much faster than the reaction of ethane with $Br_{2}$?",
        "options": [
          "The pi bond in ethene provides an easily accessible region of high electron density",
          "Ethene is more polar than ethane",
          "Ethane is too large to react with bromine",
          "The C-H bonds in ethene are weaker than those in ethane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkenes are much more reactive than alkanes because the pi electrons are held less tightly and are outside the C-C axis, making them vulnerable to electrophilic attack."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Predict the major product of the reaction between 2-methylbut-2-ene and HBr.",

          "2-methylbutane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reaction forms a tertiary carbocation intermediate at $C_{2}$, which is more stable than the secondary carbocation at $C_{3}$. Thus, the bromine attaches to $C_{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about the hydrogenation of fats is true?",
        "options": [
          "It converts liquid unsaturated oils into solid saturated fats",
          "It makes the oils more prone to oxidation and spoilage",
          "It increases the number of double bonds in the fat molecule",
          "It is a substitution reaction used to colorize margarine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Industrial hydrogenation reduces the degree of unsaturation, raising the melting point of the oils to create solid products like margarine."
