    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary organic product of an elimination reaction involving a haloalkane?",
        "options": [
          "An alkene",
          "An alcohol",
          "An alkane",
          "A substituted haloalkane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elimination (dehydrohalogenation) involves the removal of $HX$ from a haloalkane to form a pi bond between the alpha and beta carbons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the E2 mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "Bimolecular and concerted (happens in one step)",
          "Unimolecular and stepwise (via a carbocation)",
          "Bimolecular and stepwise",
          "Unimolecular and concerted"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "E2 stands for Elimination Bimolecular. The base removes a proton at the same time the leaving group departs and the double bond forms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Zaitsev's Rule, which alkene is the major product in an elimination reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The more highly substituted alkene",
          "The least substituted alkene",
          "The alkene with the most hydrogen atoms",
          "The alkene that forms fastest, regardless of stability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zaitsev's Rule states that the more stable (more substituted) alkene is generally the major product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which intermediate is formed during an E1 reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Carbocation",
          "Carbanion",
          "Free radical",
          "No intermediate is formed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "E1 (Elimination Unimolecular) follows the same first step as $S_N1$: the loss of the leaving group to form a carbocation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following conditions strongly favors an E2 mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "Strong, concentrated base and high temperature",
          "Weak nucleophile and low temperature",
          "Primary haloalkane in a polar protic solvent",
          "Absence of heat"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strong bases (like $OH^-$ or $OR^-$) and heat favor the E2 pathway over substitution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What geometric requirement must be met for an E2 reaction to occur efficiently?",
        "options": [
          "The H and the Leaving Group must be anti-periplanar (180°)",
          "The H and the Leaving Group must be on the same side (syn)",
          "The molecule must be perfectly linear",
          "There are no specific geometric requirements"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For the orbitals to overlap correctly to form the new pi bond, the beta-hydrogen and the leaving group must be anti-periplanar."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which substrate is MOST likely to undergo an E1 reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Tertiary (3°) haloalkane",
          "Primary (1°) haloalkane",
          "Methyl halide",
          "E1 is equally likely for all substrates"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like $S_N1$, E1 relies on carbocation stability. Tertiary substrates form the most stable carbocations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the rate law for an E2 reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Rate = k[Substrate][Base]",
          "Rate = k[Substrate]",
          "Rate = k[Base]",
          "Rate = k[Substrate]^2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because it is bimolecular, the rate depends on the concentration of both the haloalkane and the base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction of 2-bromobutane with potassium hydroxide, why is but-2-ene favored over but-1-ene?",
        "options": [
          "But-2-ene is more stable because it is more substituted",
          "But-1-ene is too volatile to form",
          "The primary hydrogens are harder to remove than secondary ones",
          "Bromine can only leave if a middle hydrogen is removed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "But-2-ene has two alkyl groups attached to the double bond, while but-1-ene has only one. Zaitsev's rule predicts the more substituted but-2-ene."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does heating a reaction favor elimination over substitution?",
        "options": [
          "Elimination increases entropy (3 molecules produced from 2)",
          "Heat makes the C-H bonds stronger",
          "Heat prevents the nucleophile from attacking the carbon",
          "Substitution reactions are only possible at 0°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elimination produces more particles than substitution, meaning it has a positive $\\Delta S$. According to Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$), higher temperatures make the entropy term more dominant."
