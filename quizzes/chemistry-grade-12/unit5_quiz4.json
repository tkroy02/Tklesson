        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acid-catalyzed hydration follows Markovnikov's rule, adding $H$ and $OH$ across the $C=C$ double bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The reduction of an aldehyde using $LiAlH_{4}$ or $NaBH_{4}$ yields which type of alcohol?",

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the organic product when a ketone is reduced using Sodium Borohydride ($NaBH_{4}$)?",

          "Aqueous Sodium Hydroxide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$LiAlH_{4}$ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing acids and esters. $NaBH_{4}$ is too weak to reduce carboxylic acids."
      },

          "Fermentation",
          "Saponification",

          "Fractional distillation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fermentation involves the anaerobic breakdown of sugars by enzymes (like zymase) in yeast to produce ethanol and $CO_{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydroboration-oxidation of an alkene results in which type of hydration?",

          "Formation of a vicinal diol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This two-step sequence adds the $-OH$ group to the less substituted carbon of the double bond, providing a route to primary alcohols from terminal alkenes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which combination of reagents will produce a tertiary (3°) alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "Grignard reagent + Ketone",
          "Grignard reagent + Aldehyde",
          "Reduction of an aldehyde",
          "Hydration of ethene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A ketone already has two alkyl groups. Attacking it with a Grignard reagent ($R-MgX$) adds a third $R$ group, forming a tertiary alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which gas is a byproduct of the industrial 'oxo process' (hydroformylation) followed by hydrogenation to produce alcohols?",

          "Carbon monoxide and Hydrogen (Syn-gas)",
          "Oxygen",
          "Nitrogen",
          "Chlorine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The oxo process reacts alkenes with $CO$ and $H_{2}$ to form aldehydes, which are then hydrogenated to alcohols."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the main advantage of using $NaBH_{4}$ over $LiAlH_{4}$ in a lab setting?",
        "options": [
          "It is safer and can be used in protic solvents like ethanol or water",
          "It is much more powerful and reduces all functional groups",
          "It is a gas and easy to remove",
          "It does not require any solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$NaBH_{4}$ is milder and easier to handle. $LiAlH_{4}$ reacts violently with water and alcohols, requiring anhydrous ether solvents."

          "Dehydration"
        ],
