      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which reagent is most commonly used to convert an alcohol into an alkyl chloride while producing only gaseous byproducts ($SO_{2}$ and $HCl$)?",
        "options": [
          "Thionyl chloride ($SOCl_{2}$)",
          "Phosphorus pentachloride ($PCl_{5}$)",
          "Concentrated hydrochloric acid ($HCl$)",
          "Sodium chloride ($NaCl$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thionyl chloride is preferred because the byproducts are gases, which escape the reaction mixture, making the purification of the alkyl chloride much easier."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The conversion of an alcohol to an alkyl halide using phosphorus tribromide ($PBr_{3}$) typically follows which mechanism for primary alcohols?",
        "options": [
          "$S_{N}2$",
          "$S_{N}1$",
          "E1",
          "Free Radical Substitution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$PBr_{3}$ converts the hydroxyl group into a good leaving group, which is then displaced by a bromide ion in a backside attack ($S_{N}2$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the product of the reaction between an alcohol and phosphorus pentachloride ($PCl_{5}$)?",
        "options": [
          "Alkyl chloride, $POCl_{3}$, and $HCl$",
          "Alkyl chloride and $H_{2}O$",
          "Alkene and $PCl_{3}$",
          "Ether and $HCl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reaction of $R-OH$ with $PCl_{5}$ yields the alkyl chloride along with phosphorus oxychloride ($POCl_{3}$) and hydrogen chloride gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it difficult to convert a primary alcohol to an alkyl chloride using only concentrated $HCl$ at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The chloride ion is a relatively weak nucleophile and the primary carbocation is unstable",
          "Primary alcohols are too acidic to react",
          "The $O-H$ bond is too strong to break",
          "$HCl$ acts as an oxidizing agent instead"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Primary alcohols do not form stable carbocations for $S_{N}1$, and $Cl^{-}$ is not strong enough to force $S_{N}2$ without a catalyst like $ZnCl_{2}$ (Lucas reagent)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of anhydrous $ZnCl_{2}$ in the conversion of alcohols to alkyl chlorides?",
        "options": [
          "It acts as a Lewis acid catalyst to weaken the $C-O$ bond",
          "It acts as a solvent",
          "It is a reducing agent",
          "It prevents the formation of alkenes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$ZnCl_{2}$ coordinates with the oxygen atom, making the hydroxyl group a better leaving group for the nucleophilic attack."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which reagent is typically used to prepare alkyl iodides from alcohols?",
        "options": [
          "Red phosphorus and Iodine ($P/I_{2}$)",
          "Sodium iodide in water",
          "Concentrated $HI$ only",
          "Thionyl iodide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$P/I_{2}$ reacts in situ to form $PI_{3}$, which then converts the alcohol into the alkyl iodide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Reaction of an alcohol with a sulfonyl chloride (like $TsCl$) produces a 'tosylate'. What is the purpose of this conversion?",
        "options": [
          "To turn the poor leaving group ($-OH$) into an excellent leaving group ($-OTs$)",
          "To make the alcohol more soluble in water",
          "To oxidize the alcohol to a ketone",
          "To protect the alcohol from reacting with bases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tosylates are very stable and excellent leaving groups, allowing for further substitution or elimination reactions under mild conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the organic product when methanol reacts with an excess of $PBr_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "Bromomethane",
          "Dibromomethane",
          "Methyl phosphite",
          "Ethane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "One mole of $PBr_{3}$ can convert up to three moles of alcohol into the corresponding alkyl bromide (bromomethane)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $R-OH + HX \\rightarrow R-X + H_{2}O$, which halogen acid is the most reactive?",
        "options": [
          "$HI$",
          "$HBr$",
          "$HCl$",
          "$HF$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reactivity follows the order $HI > HBr > HCl$ due to the increasing acidity and nucleophilicity of the halide ions as you move down the group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding the stereochemistry of the reaction between a chiral secondary alcohol and $SOCl_{2}$ in the presence of pyridine?",
        "options": [
          "It proceeds with inversion of configuration",
          "It proceeds with retention of configuration",
          "It results in complete racemization",
          "No reaction occurs with secondary alcohols"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the presence of pyridine, the reaction follows an $S_{N}2$ pathway, leading to the inversion of the stereocenter. (Without pyridine, it can follow an $S_{N}i$ pathway with retention)."
