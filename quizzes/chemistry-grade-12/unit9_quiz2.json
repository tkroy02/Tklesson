          "Highly reactive metal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A high positive $E^{\\circ}$ indicates a strong tendency to gain electrons (be reduced), making the substance an effective oxidizing agent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a standard electrochemical cell table, which species is the strongest reducing agent?",

          "Water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A very negative reduction potential means the species 'hates' being reduced and 'prefers' being oxidized, thus acting as a strong reducing agent (e.g., Lithium)."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which metal is used as the electrode surface in a Standard Hydrogen Electrode because it is inert?",

          "Silver ($Ag$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Platinum is used because it provides a surface for the redox reaction without participating in it chemically."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the $E^{\\circ}$ of $Zn^{2+}/Zn$ is -0.76 V and $Cu^{2+}/Cu$ is +0.34 V, which reaction is more likely to occur spontaneously at the cathode?",

          "The species is more easily oxidized than $H_{2}$.",
          "The species is more easily reduced than $H^{+}$.",
          "The species cannot participate in redox reactions.",
          "The reaction is non-spontaneous under all conditions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative value means the substance is a better reducing agent than $H_{2}$, meaning it is more easily oxidized than hydrogen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Electrochemical Series'?",
        "options": [
          "A list of half-cells arranged in order of their standard reduction potentials.",
          "A list of elements arranged by their atomic mass.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electrochemical series ranks half-reactions by their $E^{\\circ}$, allowing us to predict the direction of electron flow."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Can $Fe^{3+}$ ($E^{\\circ} = +0.77$ V) oxidize $Ag$ ($E^{\\circ} = +0.80$ V) under standard conditions?",
        "options": [
          "No, because $Ag$ has a higher reduction potential than $Fe^{3+}$.",
          "Yes, because $Fe$ is a metal.",
          "Yes, because the difference is very small.",
          "No, because $Fe^{3+}$ is already in its highest oxidation state."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an oxidizing agent to oxidize a species, its reduction potential must be higher (more positive) than the reduction potential of the species being oxidized."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard reduction potential of the $F_{2}/F^{-}$ half-cell, known as one of the strongest oxidizing agents?",
