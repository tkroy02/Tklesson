    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is an 'elementary step' in a reaction mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "A single molecular event that cannot be broken down into simpler steps.",
          "The overall balanced equation for the reaction.",
          "The step that involves only the most abundant reactant.",
          "A step that always occurs in the gas phase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elementary steps describe individual collisions or dissociations. The sum of these steps must equal the overall balanced equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'molecularity' of an elementary step refers to:",
        "options": [
          "The number of reactant particles involved in that specific step.",
          "The total number of molecules in the overall balanced equation.",
          "The speed of the molecules in the reaction vessel.",
          "The number of product molecules formed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecularity is classified as unimolecular (1 reactant), bimolecular (2), or termolecular (3)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a 'reaction intermediate'?",
        "options": [
          "A species produced in one step and consumed in a subsequent step.",
          "A substance that speeds up the reaction without being consumed.",
          "The stable product found at the end of the reaction.",
          "The transition state at the peak of the potential energy diagram."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intermediates are temporary species. They do not appear in the overall balanced equation because they cancel out when steps are added."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'rate-determining step' (RDS) of a mechanism is:",
        "options": [
          "The slowest step in the sequence.",
          "The first step in the sequence.",
          "The step with the lowest activation energy.",
          "The step that produces the most heat."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The overall reaction rate is limited by the slowest step, much like water flowing through a narrow pipe in a series."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the elementary step $2A + B \\rightarrow C$, the rate law is:",
        "options": [
          "Rate = $k[A]^{2}[B]$",
          "Rate = $k[A][B]$",
          "Rate = $k[C]$",
          "It cannot be determined without experimental data."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike overall reactions, the rate law for an *elementary* step can be derived directly from its stoichiometry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a proposed mechanism consists of a slow first step followed by a fast second step, the overall rate law will be:",
        "options": [
          "Identical to the rate law of the first step.",
          "The sum of the rate laws of both steps.",
          "Identical to the rate law of the second step.",
          "Determined by the equilibrium constant of the second step."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the first step is the slowest, it dictates the rate of the entire process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following must be true for a proposed reaction mechanism to be considered valid?",
        "options": [
          "The steps must add up to the overall reaction and the RDS must match the experimental rate law.",
          "All steps must have the same activation energy.",
          "The mechanism must only contain unimolecular steps.",
          "The rate-determining step must be the final step."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A mechanism is a hypothesis that must satisfy both the stoichiometry and the observed kinetics."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a potential energy diagram, a mechanism with three elementary steps will show how many 'peaks'?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "1",
          "2",
          "6"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each elementary step has its own transition state (activated complex), represented by a peak in the energy profile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Termolecular elementary steps are very rare because:",
        "options": [
          "The probability of three particles colliding simultaneously with correct orientation is extremely low.",
          "Three particles cannot fit in a reaction vessel.",
          "They violate the law of conservation of mass.",
          "They only occur at absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Simultaneous three-body collisions are statistically improbable, so most mechanisms consist of unimolecular and bimolecular steps."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A catalyst differs from an intermediate because a catalyst:",
        "options": [
          "Is present at the start and regenerated at the end.",
          "Is produced in the first step and consumed later.",
          "Is always in the solid phase.",
          "Does not participate in the elementary steps."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Catalysts are reactants in an early step and products in a later step; intermediates are products first and reactants later."
