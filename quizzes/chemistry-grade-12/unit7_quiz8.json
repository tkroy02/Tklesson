        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To synthesize $N$-phenylethanamide (acetanilide), which pair of reagents would be most effective?",

          "Ethanoyl chloride and aniline (phenylamine)",
          "Ethanoic acid and benzene",

        "question": "Why is a base like pyridine or $NaOH$ often added to the reaction between an acyl chloride and an alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "To neutralize the $HCl$ byproduct as it forms.",
          "To act as a dehydrating agent to remove water.",
          "To oxidize the alcohol into an aldehyde first.",
          "To prevent the ester from evaporating."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reaction produces $HCl$, which can be corrosive or cause side reactions. A base neutralizes the acid, driving the reaction forward."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which derivative is commonly used in the industrial synthesis of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) from salicylic acid?",
        "options": [
          "Ethanoic anhydride",
          "Ethanoic acid",
          "Ethanoyl chloride",
          "Ethanamide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethanoic anhydride is preferred over ethanoyl chloride in industry because it is less volatile, cheaper, and does not produce corrosive $HCl$ gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The reaction of an excess of ammonia with an acyl chloride produces a primary amide and:",

          "Hydrazine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "One equivalent of ammonia forms the amide, while the second equivalent neutralizes the $HCl$ produced to form the salt ammonium chloride."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements about using acid anhydrides for synthesis is TRUE?",
        "options": [
          "They are slower than acyl chlorides but faster than carboxylic acids.",
          "They require a strong acid catalyst to react with alcohols.",
          "They produce water as a byproduct.",
          "They cannot be used to make amides."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Anhydrides are 'middle-ground' reagents—very effective and reactive, but more controlled and less hazardous than acyl chlorides."

          "A quaternary ammonium salt"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A secondary amine ($R_{2}NH$) already has two carbons on the nitrogen; adding an acyl group ($RCO-$) makes it a tertiary amide ($RCONR_{2}$)."
