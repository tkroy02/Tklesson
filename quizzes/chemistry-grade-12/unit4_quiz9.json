    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Multi-step organic synthesis and retrosynthesis",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'retrosynthetic' approach to planning a synthesis?",
        "options": [
          "Working backward from the target molecule to simpler starting materials",
          "Working forward from the simplest available alkane",
          "Using only reactions that involve heat",
          "Randomly combining reagents until the product is found"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Retrosynthesis involves mentally breaking bonds in the target molecule (TM) to identify the precursors ('synthons') that could form it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which sequence of reagents would best convert ethane ($C_{2}H_{6}$) into ethanol ($C_{2}H_{5}OH$)?",
        "options": [
          "1. $Cl_{2}/UV$ light; 2. $NaOH(aq)$",
          "1. $H_{2}O/H_{2}SO_{4}$; 2. $Cl_{2}$",
          "1. $NaOH(aq)$; 2. $HCl$",
          "1. $KMnO_{4}$; 2. $LiAlH_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkanes are unreactive. First, use free radical halogenation to create a haloalkane, then perform a nucleophilic substitution ($S_{N}2$) with aqueous $OH^{-}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How can you specifically increase the carbon chain length by one carbon using a haloalkane?",
        "options": [
          "React with Sodium Cyanide ($NaCN$) followed by hydrolysis or reduction",
          "Perform an E2 elimination",
          "React with Sodium Hydroxide ($NaOH$)",
          "Perform a hydrogenation reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cyanide ion ($-CN$) adds a new carbon-carbon bond. The resulting nitrile can then be converted into a carboxylic acid or an amine."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To convert 2-bromopropane into propan-1-ol, which strategy is most effective?",
        "options": [
          "1. Elimination (E2) to form propene; 2. Anti-Markovnikov hydration",
          "Direct substitution with $NaOH(aq)$",
          "Reaction with $Mg$ followed by $H_{2}O$",
          "Reaction with $KMnO_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Direct substitution on 2-bromopropane would yield propan-2-ol. To get the primary alcohol, you must eliminate to the alkene and then use hydroboration-oxidation (anti-Markovnikov)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the best way to convert a primary alcohol into a haloalkane?",
        "options": [
          "React with $PCl_{5}$ or $SOCl_{2}$",
          "React with $H_{2}$ and $Ni$ catalyst",
          "React with $UV$ light and $Cl_{2}$",
          "React with concentrated $NaOH$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$SOCl_{2}$ (thionyl chloride) or $PCl_{3}/PCl_{5}$ are superior reagents for converting alcohols to halides compared to $HX$ because they avoid rearrangements."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a multi-step synthesis, what is a 'protecting group' used for?",
        "options": [
          "To temporarily block a reactive functional group from participating in unwanted reactions",
          "To speed up the overall rate of the reaction",
          "To change the color of the final product",
          "To make the molecule more soluble in water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a molecule has two reactive sites, a protecting group hides one of them so a reagent only reacts with the intended target."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is the most effective way to turn a terminal alkyne into a longer alkane?",
        "options": [
          "1. $NaNH_{2}$; 2. $R-X$; 3. $H_{2}/Pd$",
          "1. $H_{2}O/HgSO_{4}$; 2. $LiAlH_{4}$",
          "1. $Cl_{2}$; 2. $NaOH$",
          "1. $O_{3}$; 2. $Zn/H_{2}O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkylation of an acetylide ion ($NaNH_{2}$ then $R-X$) lengthens the chain, and full hydrogenation ($H_{2}/Pd$) removes the triple bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the overall yield of a synthesis as the number of steps increases?",
        "options": [
          "It generally decreases",
          "It generally increases",
          "It remains perfectly constant",
          "It depends only on the temperature of the final step"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because each step has a yield less than $100\\%$, the total yield is the product of the individual yields ($0.9 \\times 0.9 \\times 0.9 \\dots$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you want to synthesize a secondary alcohol from a Grignard reagent, which carbonyl should you choose?",
        "options": [
          "An aldehyde (like ethanal)",
          "A ketone (like propanone)",
          "Formaldehyde ($HCHO$)",
          "Carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Grignard + Formaldehyde = $1^{\\circ}$ alcohol; Grignard + Aldehyde = $2^{\\circ}$ alcohol; Grignard + Ketone = $3^{\\circ}$ alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which reagent would you use to perform a 'Hofmann elimination' to get the less substituted alkene?",
        "options": [
          "A very bulky base like $t-BuOK$",
          "A small base like $NaOH$",
          "Concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$",
          "Liquid Ammonia"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bulky bases cannot reach the more substituted internal protons due to steric hindrance, forcing the removal of a terminal proton to give the Hofmann product."
