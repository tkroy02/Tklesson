    "topic": "Thin Layer Chromatography techniques and Rf calculations",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Retention Factor ($R_f$) is calculated as the ratio of:",
        "options": [
          "Distance moved by the substance / Distance moved by the solvent front",
          "Distance moved by the solvent front / Distance moved by the substance",
          "Mass of the substance / Total mass of the mixture",
          "Time spent in the mobile phase / Time spent in the stationary phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $R_f$ value is a dimensionless ratio that describes the relative distance traveled by a specific component compared to the solvent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following $R_f$ values is physically impossible?",
        "options": [
          "1.20",
          "0.50",
          "0.05",
          "0.99"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since a substance cannot travel further than the solvent front, the $R_f$ value must always be between 0 and 1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "On a silica gel TLC plate (polar stationary phase), which type of compound would generally have the lowest $R_f$ value?",
        "options": [
          "A highly polar compound (e.g., a carboxylic acid)",
          "A non-polar compound (e.g., a hydrocarbon)",
          "A moderately polar compound (e.g., an ester)",
          "The solvent itself"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Highly polar compounds have a strong affinity for the polar silica gel, causing them to 'stick' more and travel a shorter distance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of placing a piece of filter paper (wick) inside the TLC developing chamber?",
        "options": [
          "To saturate the atmosphere with solvent vapor.",
          "To prevent the TLC plate from touching the glass.",
          "To absorb excess sample from the plate.",
          "To act as a secondary stationary phase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Saturation ensures that the solvent does not evaporate off the plate as it rises, which would lead to inconsistent results and incorrect $R_f$ values."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the components of a mixture are colorless, which method is commonly used to visualize the spots on a TLC plate?",
        "options": [
          "Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light.",
          "Washing the plate with distilled water.",
          "Heating the plate until it melts.",
          "Looking at the plate through a green filter."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Many organic compounds fluoresce or quench fluorescence under UV light, making them visible as bright or dark spots on a specially treated TLC plate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What will happen to the $R_f$ value of a compound if a more polar solvent is used as the mobile phase?",
        "options": [
          "The $R_f$ value will increase.",
          "The $R_f$ value will decrease.",
          "The $R_f$ value will remain exactly the same.",
          "The $R_f$ value will drop to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A more polar solvent is better at 'pulling' compounds away from the polar stationary phase, moving them further up the plate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must the initial sample spots be kept above the level of the solvent in the developing chamber?",
        "options": [
          "To prevent the samples from dissolving directly into the solvent pool.",
          "To allow the samples to dry more quickly.",
          "To ensure the solvent moves by gravity rather than capillary action.",
          "To prevent the silica gel from falling off the plate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the spots are submerged, the sample will wash off into the bulk solvent at the bottom instead of traveling up the stationary phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Iodine crystals are often used in a 'developing jar' for TLC to:",
        "options": [
          "Form brown complexes with organic compounds, making them visible.",
          "Catalyze the separation of the mixture.",
          "Permanently fix the spots so they don't fade.",
          "React with the silica gel to change its color."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iodine vapor is a non-destructive visualization technique where $I_2$ molecules reversibly adsorb to many organic compounds, creating brown spots."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student finds two spots on a TLC plate with the same $R_f$ value in one solvent system. Does this prove the compounds are identical?",
        "options": [
          "No; they should be tested in a different solvent system to confirm.",
          "Yes; identical $R_f$ values are unique to specific molecules.",
          "Yes; $R_f$ values are constant physical properties like boiling points.",
          "No; $R_f$ values change depending on the size of the plate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Different compounds can have the same $R_f$ in one specific solvent. Running the TLC in a solvent of different polarity helps distinguish them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary advantage of TLC over paper chromatography?",
        "options": [
          "It is faster and provides better resolution (sharper spots).",
          "It uses much larger amounts of sample.",
          "It does not require a mobile phase.",
          "It can only be used for colored substances."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The uniform particle size in TLC plates allows for quicker development and much cleaner separation than the irregular fibers in paper."
