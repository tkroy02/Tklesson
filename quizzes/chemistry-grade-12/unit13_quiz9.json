          "It results in a higher overall yield.",
          "It uses fewer reagents.",
          "It requires lower temperatures.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In linear synthesis, the yield drops exponentially with each step. Convergent synthesis couples two large fragments, preserving more of the material."
