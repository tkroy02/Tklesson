    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the '1' in the term $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ stand for?",
        "options": [
          "Unimolecular: only one molecule is involved in the rate-determining step",
          "One-step: the reaction happens in a single concerted step",
          "Primary: the reaction only happens on primary haloalkanes",
          "First-order: the reaction rate depends only on the concentration of the nucleophile"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ stands for Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular. The rate-determining step involves only the dissociation of the substrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first and slowest step of the $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "Ionization of the haloalkane to form a carbocation and a halide ion",
          "Attack of the nucleophile on the carbon atom",
          "Formation of a transition state with five bonds",
          "Deprotonation of the solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rate-limiting step is the breaking of the C-X bond to form a carbocation intermediate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following haloalkanes is most likely to react via an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "2-bromo-2-methylpropane (Tertiary)",
          "2-bromopropane (Secondary)",
          "1-bromopropane (Primary)",
          "Bromomethane (Methyl)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ reactions depend on carbocation stability. Tertiary carbocations are the most stable, making tertiary halides the most reactive in $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The rate law for an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ reaction is expressed as:",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{Substrate}]$",
          "$\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{Substrate}][\\text{Nucleophile}]$",
          "$\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{Nucleophile}]$",
          "$\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{Substrate}]^{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since only the substrate is involved in the slow step, the concentration of the nucleophile does not affect the initial reaction rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the geometry of the carbocation intermediate in an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Linear",
          "Pyramidal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carbocation carbon is $sp^{2}$ hybridized, resulting in a flat, trigonal planar shape with an empty $p$ orbital."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a chiral haloalkane reacts via an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ mechanism, what is the typical stereochemical outcome?",
        "options": [
          "Racemization (a mix of inversion and retention)",
          "Complete inversion of configuration",
          "Complete retention of configuration",
          "The molecule becomes achiral and stays that way"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the carbocation intermediate is planar, the nucleophile can attack from either side with nearly equal probability, leading to a racemic mixture."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of solvent best facilitates an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Polar protic solvents (e.g., water, alcohols)",
          "Non-polar solvents (e.g., hexane)",
          "Polar aprotic solvents (e.g., acetone, DMSO)",
          "Gaseous solvents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polar protic solvents stabilize both the forming carbocation and the leaving halide ion through solvation (hydrogen bonding), lowering the activation energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ reaction, what happens to the rate if the concentration of the nucleophile is doubled?",
        "options": [
          "The rate remains the same",
          "The rate doubles",
          "The rate quadruples",
          "The rate is halved"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The nucleophile is not involved in the rate-determining step, so changing its concentration has no effect on the rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following leaving groups would result in the fastest $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Iodide ($\\text{I}^{-}$)",
          "Bromide ($\\text{Br}^{-}$)",
          "Chloride ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$)",
          "Fluoride ($\\text{F}^{-}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iodide is the best leaving group because the C-I bond is the weakest and the larger iodide ion is better at stabilizing the negative charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these energy profile features is characteristic of an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Two peaks (transition states) with a valley (intermediate) in between",
          "A single peak representing a concerted step",
          "A flat line indicating no energy change",
          "A single transition state with five half-bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ is a two-step mechanism. Each step has its own transition state, separated by the formation of the carbocation intermediate."
