          "Molecular formula"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Expanded structural formulas (Lewis structures) explicitly draw out every single covalent bond as a line between all atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a skeletal (line-angle) formula, what does each vertex or end of a line represent?",

        "question": "How are hydrogen atoms attached to carbons typically represented in a skeletal formula?",
        "options": [
          "They are omitted and assumed based on carbon's tetravalence",
          "They are drawn as dots",
          "They are drawn with the letter 'H' only",
          "They are represented by dashed lines"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon are not shown; the reader assumes enough hydrogens exist to give each carbon four total bonds."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct condensed structural formula for propane?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condensed formulas group the hydrogens with their respective carbon atoms in a linear sequence."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of using a 'wedge' bond in a 3D structural representation?",
        "options": [
          "To show a bond coming forward out of the page",
          "To show a bond going backward into the page",
          "To indicate a double bond",
          "To show a bond within the plane of the paper"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In stereochemical drawings, a solid wedge represents a bond pointing toward the viewer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'dash' or 'hashed' bond in a molecular drawing indicates that the bond is:",
        "options": [
          "Pointing away from the viewer (into the page)",
          "Pointing toward the viewer (out of the page)",
          "In the same plane as the paper",
          "Undergoing a chemical reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dashed lines are used to represent bonds that extend behind the plane of the drawing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which representation provides only the type and number of atoms but no information about their connectivity?",

          "Molecular formula",
          "Structural formula",
          "Skeletal formula",
          "Condensed formula"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The molecular formula (e.g., $\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{10}$) simply lists the atom counts without showing how they are linked."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a skeletal structure, heteroatoms (such as $\\text{O}$, $\\text{N}$, or $\\text{Cl}$) and the hydrogens attached to them must be:",
        "options": [
          "Explicitly written out",
          "Left out like carbon-bound hydrogens",
          "Represented by symbols only, without their hydrogens",
          "Drawn in red"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While carbon-bound hydrogens are omitted, heteroatoms and any hydrogens bonded to them (e.g., $-\\text{OH}$ or $-\\text{NH}_{2}$) must be clearly shown."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the condensed formula for a molecule consisting of a central carbon bonded to four methyl groups (2,2-dimethylpropane)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{4}$",
          "$\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$",

          "$(\\text{CH}_{4})_{4}\\text{C}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parentheses are used in condensed formulas to indicate identical groups attached to the same atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are skeletal formulas preferred by organic chemists for drawing large molecules?",
        "options": [
          "They are faster to draw and reduce visual clutter",
          "They are the only way to show 3D geometry",
          "They use fewer atoms than other formulas",
          "They ignore the octet rule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By omitting repetitive carbon and hydrogen labels, skeletal formulas allow chemists to focus on the functional groups and the overall molecular 'frame'."
