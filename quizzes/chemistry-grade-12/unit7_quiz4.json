    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following functional groups is characteristic of an acid anhydride?",

          "$R-CO-Cl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An acid anhydride consists of two acyl groups linked by an oxygen atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct IUPAC suffix for an acyl chloride?",
        "options": [
          "-oyl chloride",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acyl chlorides are named by replacing the '-ic acid' suffix of the parent acid with '-oyl chloride'. For example, ethanoic acid becomes ethanoyl chloride."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The name 'ethyl propanoate' refers to which type of acid derivative?",

          "An ester",
          "An amide",
          "An anhydride",
          "An acyl halide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Esters are named with the alkyl group from the alcohol followed by the carboxylate name from the acid, ending in '-oate'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for $CH_{3}CONH_{2}$?",

          "Ethanamide",
          "Acetamide",
          "Methylamide",
          "Ethanamine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The two-carbon parent chain makes it an 'ethan-' stem, and the amide functional group gives it the suffix '-amide'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following derivatives is formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid with another molecule of the same acid, losing water?",

          "Acid anhydride",
          "Ester",
          "Amide",
          "Acyl chloride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the name suggests, 'anhydride' means 'without water'. It is formed by the dehydration of two acid molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the IUPAC name 'N-methylpropanamide', what does the 'N-' signify?",
        "options": [
          "The methyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom.",
          "The molecule contains a nitrile group.",
          "The methyl group is on the alpha-carbon.",
          "It is a common name, not an IUPAC name."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'N-' locant is used for secondary and tertiary amides to show that a substituent is attached to the nitrogen rather than the carbon chain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following derivatives is considered the most structurally similar to a carboxylic acid, where the $-OH$ is replaced by a halogen?",
        "options": [
          "Acyl halide",
          "Ester",
          "Amide",
          "Nitrile"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acyl halides ($R-CO-X$) are direct derivatives where the hydroxyl group is substituted by a halogen atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The boiling points of amides are generally much higher than those of esters of similar mass because:",
        "options": [
          "Primary and secondary amides can form extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds.",
          "Amides are non-polar molecules.",
          "Esters have stronger dipole-dipole interactions.",
          "Amides always have longer carbon chains."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $N-H$ bonds in amides allow for strong hydrogen bonding between molecules, whereas esters only have dipole-dipole forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for the ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol?",
        "options": [
          "Ethyl benzoate",
          "Benzyl ethanoate",
          "Phenyl propanoate",
          "Ethyl benzenoate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The alcohol part (ethanol) gives 'ethyl' and the acid part (benzoic acid) gives 'benzoate'."

          "Nitrile"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While amides have one acyl group on nitrogen, imides have two acyl groups attached to the same nitrogen atom."
