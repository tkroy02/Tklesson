      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The reaction of an alkane with a halogen (like $\\text{Cl}_{2}$) under UV light to form a haloalkane is a classic example of:",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a hydrogenation reaction (a type of addition) where the $\\text{C}=\\text{C}$ double bond is converted into a $\\text{C}-\\text{C}$ single bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
