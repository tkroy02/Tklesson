    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In chromatography, the substance that moves through the system carrying the mixture is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Mobile phase",
          "Stationary phase",
          "Adsorbent",
          "Solute"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mobile phase is the solvent (liquid or gas) that moves over the stationary phase, carrying the components of the mixture at different rates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary factor that causes different components in a mixture to separate during chromatography?",
        "options": [
          "Differential affinity for the stationary and mobile phases.",
          "The color of the components.",
          "The total volume of the solvent used.",
          "The reactivity of the components with the glass container."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Separation occurs because components distribute themselves differently between the two phases based on their polarity, solubility, or size."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a component has a very strong affinity for the stationary phase, how will it move compared to the mobile phase?",
        "options": [
          "It will move slowly.",
          "It will move at the same speed as the solvent front.",
          "It will move faster than the mobile phase.",
          "It will not move at all, regardless of the solvent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Components that interact strongly with the stationary phase spend less time in the mobile phase, resulting in slower migration through the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Adsorption chromatography relies on which physical principle?",
        "options": [
          "The binding of molecules to the surface of a solid stationary phase.",
          "The dissolving of molecules into a thin film of liquid on a solid support.",
          "The separation of molecules based on their boiling points.",
          "The reaction of molecules with a gaseous mobile phase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adsorption involves the surface interaction between the solute and a solid stationary phase (like silica gel)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Partition chromatography is best described as separation based on:",
        "options": [
          "The relative solubility of a solute between two immiscible phases.",
          "The physical size of the molecules passing through pores.",
          "The electrical charge of the ions in the mixture.",
          "The rate of evaporation of the solvent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Partition chromatography involves a solute distributing (partitioning) itself between a liquid stationary phase and a mobile phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be an example of a common stationary phase in paper chromatography?",
        "options": [
          "Water molecules trapped in the cellulose fibers of the paper.",
          "The liquid solvent moving up the paper.",
          "The air surrounding the beaker.",
          "The pencil line used to mark the start."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In paper chromatography, the stationary phase is actually the water molecules held within the structure of the cellulose paper."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'retention' of a substance in chromatography is a measure of:",
        "options": [
          "How long the substance remains in the stationary phase.",
          "How much of the substance was originally in the mixture.",
          "The color intensity of the separated spot.",
          "The total distance the solvent moved."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Retention reflects the extent to which a substance is held back by the stationary phase relative to the mobile phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'solvent front' in a chromatographic separation?",
        "options": [
          "The furthest point reached by the mobile phase.",
          "The point where the sample was originally spotted.",
          "The interface between the stationary phase and the glass.",
          "The point where the most polar component stops."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The solvent front is the leading edge of the mobile phase as it moves across or through the stationary phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which property of a molecule most significantly influences its affinity for a polar stationary phase like silica gel?",
        "options": [
          "Polarity",
          "Molar mass",
          "Flammability",
          "Color"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Silica gel is highly polar; therefore, more polar molecules will form stronger intermolecular attractions (like hydrogen bonds) and move more slowly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In general, chromatography is used for which two primary purposes?",
        "options": [
          "Identification of components and purification of mixtures.",
          "Measuring boiling points and determining density.",
          "Synthesizing new compounds and increasing yield.",
          "Determining the state of matter and radioactivity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chromatography allows us to see how many components are in a mixture (identification) and to separate them for further use (purification)."
