    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which isotope is most commonly used to date once-living organic materials up to approximately 50,000 years old?",
        "options": [
          "Carbon-14",
          "Uranium-238",
          "Potassium-40",
          "Cobalt-60"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon-14 is incorporated into living tissues and begins to decay once the organism dies, making it a clock for organic remains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary source of Carbon-14 in the Earth's atmosphere?",
        "options": [
          "Cosmic ray bombardment of Nitrogen-14",
          "Nuclear power plant emissions",
          "Volcanic eruptions",
          "Natural decay of Uranium in the soil"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High-energy neutrons from cosmic rays collide with nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere to produce C-14."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is Carbon-14 dating ineffective for objects that are millions of years old?",
        "options": [
          "The half-life of C-14 is too short (5,730 years).",
          "Carbon does not exist in very old rocks.",
          "C-14 only works on metallic objects.",
          "The decay constant of C-14 changes over long periods."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After about 10 half-lives (~50,000 to 60,000 years), the amount of C-14 remaining is too small to measure accurately."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which isotope pair is typically used to determine the age of the Earth and very ancient rocks?",
        "options": [
          "Uranium-238 / Lead-206",
          "Carbon-14 / Nitrogen-14",
          "Iodine-131 / Xenon-131",
          "Technetium-99m / Technetium-99"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, making it ideal for geological dating on a planetary scale."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In radioactive dating, the 'parent' isotope decays into a stable:",
        "options": [
          "Daughter isotope",
          "Alpha particle",
          "Catalyst",
          "Intermediate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ratio of the parent isotope to the daughter isotope is used to calculate the time elapsed since the 'clock' started."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What assumption is made when using the Potassium-Argon ($^{40}K/^{40}Ar$) dating method for volcanic rocks?",
        "options": [
          "No Argon-40 was present when the rock solidified.",
          "Potassium-40 decays into Carbon-14 first.",
          "The rock has been underwater for its entire existence.",
          "Argon-40 is a solid at all temperatures."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Argon is a gas; it is assumed that any pre-existing Argon escaped while the rock was molten, so all Argon found now must come from decay since solidification."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a sample contains 25% of its original Carbon-14, how many half-lives have passed?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "3",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$100\\% \\rightarrow 50\\% (1\\ t_{1/2}) \\rightarrow 25\\% (2\\ t_{1/2})$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which method would be best for dating a wooden tool found in an archaeological site from 3,000 years ago?",
        "options": [
          "Carbon-14 dating",
          "Uranium-Lead dating",
          "Rubidium-Strontium dating",
          "Fission track dating"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wood is organic and the timeframe (3,000 years) is well within the range of Carbon-14's utility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Radioactive dating is possible because the rate of decay is:",
        "options": [
          "Constant and unaffected by environmental conditions.",
          "Dependent on the chemical bonds of the atom.",
          "Faster in the vacuum of space.",
          "Proportional to the temperature of the sample."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nuclear decay rates are intrinsic to the nucleus and remain constant regardless of heat, pressure, or chemical state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the half-life of Carbon-14?",
        "options": [
          "5,730 years",
          "1,200 years",
          "4.5 billion years",
          "24,000 years"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
