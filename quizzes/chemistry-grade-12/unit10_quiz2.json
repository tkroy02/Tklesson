        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an exothermic process, energy is released (usually as heat), meaning the system loses enthalpy, resulting in a negative $\\Delta H$."

          "$\\Delta H$ is always zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Endothermic reactions absorb energy, so the products have more stored chemical potential energy than the reactants, making $\\Delta H$ positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the specific heat capacity of liquid water, often used in calorimetry calculations?",

          "4.18 kJ/kg·K"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water has a relatively high specific heat capacity of 4.18 J/g·°C, meaning it takes 4.18 Joules to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius."

          "Dependent on the activation energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Combustion reactions involve burning a fuel in oxygen, a process that always releases energy to the surroundings."

          "Adiabatic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the water (the surroundings) gets warmer, it means the chemical system released heat into the water, characterizing an exothermic reaction."
