    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Synthesis and reactions of organomagnesium compounds",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the general formula of a Grignard reagent?",
        "options": [
          "$R-MgX$",
          "$R-Li$",
          "$R-OH$",
          "$R-X$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A Grignard reagent consists of an alkyl or aryl group ($R$) bonded to a magnesium atom, which is in turn bonded to a halogen ($X$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the typical solvent used for the preparation and storage of Grignard reagents?",
        "options": [
          "Dry ether (e.g., diethyl ether or THF)",
          "Water",
          "Ethanol",
          "Concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethers stabilize the magnesium atom through coordination and must be 'dry' because Grignard reagents react explosively with water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Grignard reagent, what is the electronic nature of the carbon atom attached to the magnesium?",
        "options": [
          "Nucleophilic and basic ($\\delta-$)",
          "Electrophilic ($\\delta+$)",
          "Neutral and unreactive",
          "Acidic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because magnesium is much less electronegative than carbon, the $C-Mg$ bond is highly polarized, giving the carbon a strong partial negative charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when a Grignard reagent reacts with water or an alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "It is protonated to form an alkane",
          "It forms a more stable Grignard reagent",
          "It acts as a catalyst for polymerization",
          "It produces a carboxylic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Grignard reagents are very strong bases ($pK_{a} \\approx 50$) and will instantly strip a proton from any source containing an $-OH$ or $-NH$ group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A Grignard reagent reacts with formaldehyde ($HCHO$) followed by acid workup to produce:",
        "options": [
          "A primary (1°) alcohol",
          "A secondary (2°) alcohol",
          "A tertiary (3°) alcohol",
          "A ketone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Formaldehyde has only hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbon, so adding one $R$ group results in a primary alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To synthesize a tertiary (3°) alcohol using a Grignard reagent, which carbonyl compound should be used?",
        "options": [
          "A ketone",
          "An aldehyde",
          "Formaldehyde",
          "Carbon dioxide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ketones already have two alkyl groups; adding a third from the Grignard reagent creates a tertiary alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What organic product is formed when a Grignard reagent reacts with dry ice ($CO_{2}$) followed by hydrolysis?",
        "options": [
          "A carboxylic acid",
          "An alcohol",
          "An ester",
          "An alkane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The nucleophilic $R$ group attacks the $CO_{2}$ carbon, and subsequent acidification yields $R-COOH$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of Grignard reagents?",
        "options": [
          "They cannot be formed in the presence of acidic functional groups like $-OH$ or $-COOH$",
          "They only react with noble gases",
          "They are only stable at temperatures above $200^{\\circ}C$",
          "They can only be made from fluorine-containing compounds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because they are such strong bases, they will destroy themselves by reacting with any acidic protons present in the same molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following reactions would correctly produce methylmagnesium bromide?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_{3}Br + Mg \\xrightarrow{ether} CH_{3}MgBr$",
          "$CH_{4} + MgBr_{2} \\rightarrow CH_{3}MgBr + HBr$",
          "$CH_{3}OH + Mg \\rightarrow CH_{3}MgBr$",
          "$CH_{3}Br + Mg \\xrightarrow{H_{2}O} CH_{3}MgBr$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Grignard reagents are prepared by reacting an alkyl halide with magnesium turnings in an anhydrous ether solvent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an aldehyde (other than formaldehyde) reacts with a Grignard reagent, the resulting product is:",
        "options": [
          "A secondary (2°) alcohol",
          "A primary (1°) alcohol",
          "A tertiary (3°) alcohol",
          "An ether"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aldehydes have one $R$ group and one $H$; adding a second $R$ group from the Grignard reagent results in a secondary alcohol."
