    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general IUPAC system for naming ethers?",
        "options": [
          "Naming the smaller alkyl group as an 'alkoxy' substituent on the larger 'alkane' chain",
          "Adding the suffix '-ether' to the end of the longest chain",
          "Naming both alkyl groups alphabetically followed by the word 'ether'",
          "Changing the parent alkane name to an 'alkone'"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In IUPAC, ethers are named as alkoxyalkanes. For example, $CH_{3}OCH_{2}CH_{3}$ is methoxyethane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do ethers have much lower boiling points than isomeric alcohols?",
        "options": [
          "Ethers cannot form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with themselves",
          "Ethers are completely non-polar molecules",
          "Ethers have much lower molecular masses",
          "Ethers react instantly with the air to form gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because ethers lack a hydrogen atom bonded directly to oxygen, they cannot form H-bonds with other ether molecules, leading to weaker intermolecular forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Williamson Ether Synthesis involves the reaction between which two types of reagents?",
        "options": [
          "An alkoxide ion and a primary alkyl halide",
          "An alcohol and a carboxylic acid",
          "An alkene and water with an acid catalyst",
          "A Grignard reagent and an aldehyde"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Williamson synthesis is an $S_{N}2$ reaction where a nucleophilic alkoxide ($R-O^{-}$) attacks an alkyl halide ($R'-X$) to form an ether."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following alkyl halides would be LEAST effective in a Williamson Ether Synthesis?",
        "options": [
          "2-bromo-2-methylpropane (Tertiary)",
          "Bromomethane (Methyl)",
          "1-bromopropane (Primary)",
          "Iodoethane (Primary)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the Williamson synthesis is an $S_{N}2$ mechanism, tertiary halides are too sterically hindered and will undergo elimination (E2) instead of substitution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Ethers are widely used as laboratory solvents because:",
        "options": [
          "They are relatively unreactive toward most bases and nucleophiles",
          "They are highly miscible with water in all proportions",
          "They have extremely high boiling points and do not evaporate",
          "They act as strong oxidizing agents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $C-O-C$ linkage is quite stable, making ethers excellent inert solvents for reactions involving strong bases like Grignard reagents."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the common name for $CH_{3}CH_{2}OCH_{2}CH_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "Diethyl ether",
          "Ethoxyethane",
          "Ethyl ether",
          "Both A and C are acceptable common names"
        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Common names name both alkyl groups followed by 'ether'. If the groups are the same, the prefix 'di-' is used, though it is sometimes omitted."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a cyclic ether?",
        "options": [
          "Tetrahydrofuran (THF)",
          "Methoxyethane",
          "Anisole",
          "Ethanol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "THF is a five-membered ring containing four carbons and one oxygen atom, commonly used as a polar aprotic solvent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Ethers can form hydrogen bonds with which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Water molecules",
          "Other ether molecules",
          "Methane gas",
          "Noble gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While ethers cannot H-bond with themselves, the lone pairs on the oxygen can accept hydrogen bonds from water, giving small ethers some water solubility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which reagent is used to convert an alcohol into an alkoxide for the Williamson synthesis?",
        "options": [
          "Active metals like $Na$ or $K$, or $NaH$",
          "Concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$",
          "Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)",
          "Aqueous $HCl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A strong base or an active metal is needed to remove the weakly acidic proton from the alcohol to generate the nucleophilic alkoxide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a potential safety hazard of storing ethers for long periods in the presence of air?",
        "options": [
          "Formation of explosive organic peroxides",
          "Spontaneous combustion into methane",
          "The ether turning into a strong acid",
          "The container shrinking due to pressure loss"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethers react slowly with atmospheric oxygen to form hydroperoxides and peroxides, which can explode when the ether is distilled or heated."
