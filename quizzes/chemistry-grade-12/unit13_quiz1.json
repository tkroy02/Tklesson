    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Nucleons, N/Z ratio, and binding energy",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which force is responsible for holding the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, overcoming electrostatic repulsion?",
        "options": [
          "Strong nuclear force",
          "Electromagnetic force",
          "Gravitational force",
          "Weak nuclear force"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The strong nuclear force acts over very short distances to bind nucleons together, counteracting the repulsion between positively charged protons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For light elements (Z < 20), what is the typical neutron-to-proton (N/Z) ratio for stable isotopes?",
        "options": [
          "1.0",
          "1.5",
          "2.0",
          "0.5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stable light nuclei generally have approximately equal numbers of protons and neutrons ($N/Z \\approx 1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the required N/Z ratio for stability as the atomic number (Z) increases beyond 20?",
        "options": [
          "It increases toward 1.5.",
          "It decreases toward 0.5.",
          "It remains constant at 1.0.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As more protons are added, more neutrons are required to provide additional strong force to stabilize the increasing electrostatic repulsion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are 'magic numbers' in nuclear chemistry?",
        "options": [
          "Specific numbers of nucleons that result in extra stable nuclei.",
          "The number of electrons in a noble gas.",
          "The number of isotopes each element has.",
          "The ratio of mass to energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nuclei with 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, or 126 protons or neutrons are exceptionally stable, similar to the stability of noble gas electron configurations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The difference between the mass of an atom and the sum of the masses of its individual nucleons is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Mass defect",
          "Binding energy",
          "Atomic weight",
          "Critical mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'missing mass' or mass defect is converted into energy when the nucleus forms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Einstein's equation $E = mc^2$, a higher binding energy per nucleon generally indicates:",
        "options": [
          "A more stable nucleus.",
          "A more radioactive nucleus.",
          "A larger atomic radius.",
          "A higher boiling point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Binding energy per nucleon is a measure of nuclear stability; the higher the value, the more tightly the nucleons are held together."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element has the highest binding energy per nucleon, making it the most stable nucleus?",
        "options": [
          "Iron-56",
          "Uranium-238",
          "Hydrogen-1",
          "Helium-4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iron-56 ($^{56}Fe$) is at the peak of the binding energy curve. Elements lighter than iron undergo fusion, while heavier elements undergo fission to reach this stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Nuclei located above the 'band of stability' (too many neutrons) typically undergo which type of decay?",
        "options": [
          "Beta decay",
          "Positron emission",
          "Alpha decay",
          "Electron capture"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In beta decay, a neutron is converted into a proton, which reduces the N/Z ratio to move the nucleus closer to the band of stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "All elements with an atomic number (Z) greater than ____ are unstable and radioactive.",
        "options": [
          "83",
          "92",
          "50",
          "26"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bismuth (Z=83) is the last element with stable isotopes. All elements from Polonium (Z=84) onwards are radioactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Nuclear stability is generally higher for nuclei with:",
        "options": [
          "Even numbers of both protons and neutrons.",
          "Odd numbers of both protons and neutrons.",
          "High electronegativity.",
          "A large number of electrons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Statistically, most stable nuclei have even numbers of protons and even numbers of neutrons, suggesting a 'pairing' effect similar to electrons."
