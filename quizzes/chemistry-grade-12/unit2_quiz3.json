    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Conformational isomers (conformers) are different spatial arrangements of atoms that result from rotation about which type of bond?",
        "options": [
          "Carbon-carbon single bond ($\\sigma$ bond)",
          "Carbon-carbon double bond ($\\pi$ bond)",
          "Carbon-carbon triple bond",
          "Ionic bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Single bonds allow for free rotation of the atoms they connect, leading to different conformations. Double and triple bonds restrict rotation due to $\\pi$ orbital overlap."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following representations is specifically used to visualize the conformations of a molecule by looking straight down a carbon-carbon bond axis?",

          "Newman projection",
          "Fischer projection",
          "Skeletal formula",
          "Lewis structure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A Newman projection views the molecule along a specific bond, representing the front carbon as a dot and the back carbon as a circle."
      },
      {

          "Anti-periplanar conformation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the staggered conformation, the $\\text{C-H}$ bonds are as far apart as possible, minimizing electron-pair repulsion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the term for the energy required to rotate a molecule around a bond, often caused by the repulsion between electron clouds in eclipsed bonds?",
        "options": [
          "Torsional strain",
          "Steric strain",
          "Angle strain",
          "Bond energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torsional strain is the resistance to rotation caused by the eclipsing of bonds on adjacent atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Newman projection of ethane, what is the dihedral (torsional) angle between hydrogens in the eclipsed conformation?",

          "$60^{\\circ}$",
          "$120^{\\circ}$",
          "$180^{\\circ}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an eclipsed conformation, the bonds on the front carbon align directly with the bonds on the back carbon, resulting in an angle of $0^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For butane, which staggered conformation features the two large methyl groups at a dihedral angle of $180^{\\circ}$ from each other?",
        "options": [
          "Anti conformation",
          "Gauche conformation",
          "Eclipsed conformation",
          "Syn conformation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The anti conformation is the most stable because the bulky methyl groups are at the maximum possible distance from one another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Steric Strain' (or steric hindrance)?",
        "options": [
          "Repulsion between atoms or groups when they are forced too close together",
          "The energy released when a bond is formed",
          "The strain caused by bond angles deviating from the ideal $109.5^{\\circ}$",
          "The vibration of atoms within a single bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Steric strain occurs when the electron clouds of non-bonded atoms overlap and repel each other, increasing the potential energy of the molecule."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the gauche conformation of butane, the methyl groups are separated by a dihedral angle of:",
        "options": [
          "$60^{\\circ}$",
          "$0^{\\circ}$",
          "$120^{\\circ}$",
          "$180^{\\circ}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gauche is a staggered conformation where the methyl groups are relatively close ($60^{\\circ}$), leading to some steric strain compared to the anti conformation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which conformation of butane has the highest potential energy?",

          "Fully eclipsed (methyl-methyl eclipsed)",
          "Anti staggered",
          "Gauche staggered",
          "H-H eclipsed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The fully eclipsed conformation suffers from both torsional strain (eclipsed bonds) and significant steric strain between the two bulky methyl groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why can we usually not isolate individual conformers at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The energy barrier for rotation is low enough to allow rapid interconversion",
          "Conformers have the same boiling point",
          "Rotation around single bonds is impossible",
          "They are only stable in the gas phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At room temperature, there is enough thermal energy for molecules to rotate constantly, meaning they switch between staggered and eclipsed forms billions of times per second."
