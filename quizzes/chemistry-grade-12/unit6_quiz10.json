    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general formula for a Grignard reagent?",
        "options": [
          "$RMgX$",
          "$RLi$",
          "$R_{2}CuLi$",
          "$ROH$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A Grignard reagent consists of an alkyl or aryl group ($R$) bonded to magnesium ($Mg$), which is also bonded to a halogen ($X$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a Grignard reagent, the carbon atom bonded to the magnesium acts as a(n):",
        "options": [
          "Nucleophile",
          "Electrophile",
          "Leaving group",
          "Catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because magnesium is much less electronegative than carbon, the $C-Mg$ bond is highly polarized, giving the carbon a strong partial negative charge (carbanion character)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The reaction of a Grignard reagent with methanal (formaldehyde) followed by acid hydrolysis produces:",
        "options": [
          "A primary alcohol",
          "A secondary alcohol",
          "A tertiary alcohol",
          "A ketone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methanal has only hydrogens attached to the carbonyl. Adding one $R$ group from the Grignard reagent results in an $R-CH_{2}OH$ structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which carbonyl compound must be used with a Grignard reagent to synthesize a secondary alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "An aldehyde (other than methanal)",
          "Methanal",
          "A ketone",
          "Carbon dioxide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aldehydes like ethanal already have one $R$ group; adding a second $R$ group from the Grignard reagent creates a secondary alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Reacting a Grignard reagent with a ketone produces:",
        "options": [
          "A tertiary alcohol",
          "A secondary alcohol",
          "A primary alcohol",
          "A carboxylic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ketones already have two $R$ groups. Adding a third from the Grignard reagent results in a tertiary alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must Grignard reactions be carried out in anhydrous (water-free) conditions, such as dry ether?",
        "options": [
          "Grignard reagents react violently with water to form alkanes.",
          "Water acts as a catalyst and makes the reaction too fast.",
          "Water prevents the Grignard reagent from dissolving.",
          "The carbonyl group will evaporate in the presence of water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Grignard reagents are very strong bases; they will immediately abstract a proton from water to form an alkane ($R-H$), destroying the reagent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of the second step (acid workup) in a Grignard reaction?",
        "options": [
          "To protonate the alkoxide intermediate to form the final alcohol.",
          "To remove the magnesium metal from the flask.",
          "To oxidize the alcohol into a ketone.",
          "To neutralize the ether solvent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The initial addition forms a magnesium alkoxide salt. Adding dilute acid ($H_{3}O^{+}$) provides the proton needed to create the neutral alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is produced when a Grignard reagent reacts with carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$)?",
        "options": [
          "A carboxylic acid",
          "A primary alcohol",
          "A ketone",
          "An ester"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Grignard reagent attacks the carbon in $CO_{2}$, and after acid workup, it forms a carboxylic acid ($R-COOH$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you react methylmagnesium bromide ($CH_{3}MgBr$) with propanone, what is the final product?",
        "options": [
          "2-methylpropan-2-ol",
          "Butan-2-ol",
          "2-methylpropan-1-ol",
          "Butan-1-ol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Propanone is a ketone. Adding a methyl group to the central carbon creates a 4-carbon tertiary alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which solvent is most commonly used to prepare and store Grignard reagents?",
        "options": [
          "Ethoxyethane (Diethyl ether)",
          "Ethanol",
          "Water",
          "Acetone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diethyl ether is an aprotic solvent that stabilizes the Grignard reagent by coordinating the lone pairs of the oxygen with the magnesium atom."
