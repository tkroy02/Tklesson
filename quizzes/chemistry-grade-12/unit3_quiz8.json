    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Alkyne bonding, geometry, and acidity",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the hybridization of the carbon atoms involved in a carbon-carbon triple bond?",
        "options": [
          "sp",
          "sp2",
          "sp3",
          "dsp2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an alkyne, each triple-bonded carbon is bonded to only two other atoms, requiring two sp hybrid orbitals and leaving two unhybridized p orbitals for pi bonding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the molecular geometry around the triple bond in ethyne?",
        "options": [
          "Linear",
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Bent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sp hybrid orbitals are oriented 180° apart to minimize electron repulsion, resulting in a linear arrangement of atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general molecular formula for an acyclic alkyne with one triple bond?",
        "options": [
          "CnH2n-2",
          "CnH2n",
          "CnH2n+2",
          "CnHn"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A triple bond contains two pi bonds; since each pi bond removes two hydrogens from the saturated count, the formula is CnH2n-2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A carbon-carbon triple bond consists of which set of individual bonds?",
        "options": [
          "One sigma (σ) bond and two pi (π) bonds",
          "Three sigma (σ) bonds",
          "Three pi (π) bonds",
          "Two sigma (σ) bonds and one pi (π) bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first bond is a sigma bond formed by head-on orbital overlap; the second and third are pi bonds formed by lateral overlap of p orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the bond length of a C≡C triple bond compare to C=C and C-C bonds?",
        "options": [
          "The triple bond is the shortest and strongest",
          "The triple bond is the longest and strongest",
          "The triple bond is the shortest and weakest",
          "All three bond types have equal lengths"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher electron density (six shared electrons) pulls the nuclei closer together, resulting in a shorter and stronger bond than single or double bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Terminal alkynes exhibit a property that is unusual for hydrocarbons. What is it?",
        "options": [
          "Weak acidity of the terminal hydrogen",
          "Strong basicity",
          "High solubility in water",
          "Extreme resistance to addition reactions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The high 's' character (50%) of the sp hybrid orbital stabilizes the resulting carbanion after a proton is lost, making terminal hydrogens somewhat acidic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are terminal alkynes more acidic than alkenes or alkanes?",
        "options": [
          "The sp hybrid orbital has more 's' character, holding electrons closer to the nucleus",
          "The triple bond is more polar than a single bond",
          "Triple bonds have more pi electrons to donate",
          "The linear geometry allows for easier removal of the hydrogen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased 's' character means electrons in the C-H bond are closer to the nucleus, which stabilizes the conjugate base (acetylide ion)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes an 'internal' alkyne?",
        "options": [
          "The triple bond is located between two carbon atoms, neither of which is at the end",
          "The triple bond is at the very end of the carbon chain",
          "The triple bond is inside a ring structure",
          "The alkyne is found inside a crude oil sample"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An internal alkyne has alkyl groups on both sides of the triple bond, meaning it does not have a terminal hydrogen atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the IUPAC name 'But-2-yne', what does the '2' represent?",
        "options": [
          "The locant for the first carbon of the triple bond",
          "The number of triple bonds in the molecule",
          "The number of methyl branches attached to the chain",
          "The number of hydrogen atoms attached to the triple bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The number 2 indicates that the triple bond starts at the second carbon of the four-carbon parent chain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the bond angle in a terminal alkyne like propyne (CH3-C≡C-H) at the C≡C-H part?",
        "options": [
          "180°",
          "120°",
          "109.5°",
          "90°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sp-hybridized carbons involved in the triple bond maintain a linear geometry with 180° bond angles."
