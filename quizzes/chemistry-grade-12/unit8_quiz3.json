    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In Gas Chromatography (GC), what is typically used as the mobile phase?",
        "options": [
          "An inert carrier gas such as Helium or Nitrogen.",
          "A volatile organic liquid.",
          "Steam.",
          "A pressurized aqueous buffer."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In GC, the mobile phase is a gas that carries the vaporized sample through the column without reacting with it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The time taken for a component to travel from the injection port to the detector is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Retention time ($t_{R}$)",
          "Travel coefficient",
          "Migration ratio",
          "Separation interval"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Retention time is the characteristic time a specific substance stays in the column, similar to how an $R_{f}$ value works in TLC."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the area under a peak in a GC or HPLC chromatogram represent?",
        "options": [
          "The relative amount (concentration) of that component in the mixture.",
          "The molar mass of the component.",
          "The boiling point of the component.",
          "The toxicity of the component."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The peak area is proportional to the quantity of the substance detected; larger areas indicate higher concentrations."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of compound is best suited for analysis by Gas Chromatography?",
        "options": [
          "Volatile compounds that do not decompose at high temperatures.",
          "Non-volatile polymers.",
          "Ionic salts like sodium chloride.",
          "Large, heat-sensitive proteins."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since GC requires the sample to be in the gas phase, the molecules must be able to be vaporized without breaking down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary difference between HPLC and standard column chromatography?",
        "options": [
          "HPLC uses high pressure to push the mobile phase through a very finely packed stationary phase.",
          "HPLC uses a gas as the mobile phase instead of a liquid.",
          "HPLC can only be used for colored compounds.",
          "HPLC does not require a stationary phase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard chromatography relies on gravity; HPLC uses high-pressure pumps, which allows for much faster and higher-resolution separation using very small particles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In 'Reverse-Phase' HPLC, which is the most common mode, the stationary phase is:",
        "options": [
          "Non-polar",
          "Highly polar",
          "Acidic",
          "Gaseous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In reverse-phase HPLC, the stationary phase is non-polar (often silica with C18 chains) and the mobile phase is polar (like water or methanol)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors would DECREASE the retention time of a component in Gas Chromatography?",
        "options": [
          "Increasing the temperature of the column oven.",
          "Increasing the length of the column.",
          "Using a slower flow rate of carrier gas.",
          "Using a stationary phase with a higher affinity for the component."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher temperatures increase the vapor pressure of the components, keeping them in the mobile gas phase longer and moving them through the column faster."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "GC-MS is a powerful analytical combination. What does 'MS' stand for?",
        "options": [
          "Mass Spectrometry",
          "Molecular Scanning",
          "Manual Separation",
          "Metallic Solubility"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "GC separates the components, and the Mass Spectrometer (MS) immediately identifies them by their mass-to-charge ratio."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A chromatogram shows three peaks. Peak A has the shortest retention time, and Peak C has the longest. Which component has the greatest affinity for the stationary phase?",
        "options": [
          "Component C",
          "Component A",
          "Component B",
          "All have equal affinity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The longer a substance is 'retained' in the column (longer $t_{R}$), the stronger its interaction with the stationary phase."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is HPLC preferred over GC for analyzing many biological samples like medications or vitamins?",
        "options": [
          "Many biological molecules are non-volatile or thermally unstable.",
          "HPLC is significantly cheaper to run than GC.",
          "GC cannot detect carbon-based molecules.",
          "Biological samples must be analyzed as gases to be accurate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Medications and vitamins often decompose if heated to the temperatures required for GC; HPLC works at room temperature in liquid solutions."
