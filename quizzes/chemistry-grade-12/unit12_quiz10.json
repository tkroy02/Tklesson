    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Crystal Field Theory (CFT) explains the properties of transition metal complexes by considering:",
        "options": [
          "Electrostatic repulsions between ligand lone pairs and metal d-electrons.",
          "Covalent sharing of electrons in sigma and pi bonds.",
          "The overlap of s and p orbitals of the metal.",
          "The gravitational attraction between the nucleus and ligands."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CFT treats ligands as point charges. The approach of these charges causes the five degenerate d-orbitals to split into different energy levels due to repulsion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an octahedral crystal field, which d-orbitals are raised highest in energy?",
        "options": [
          "$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and $d_{z^{2}}$",
          "$d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$, and $d_{xz}$",
          "All five d-orbitals are raised equally.",
          "Only the $d_{z^{2}}$ orbital."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an octahedral field, ligands approach along the axes. The $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and $d_{z^{2}}$ orbitals (the $e_{g}$ set) point directly at the ligands and experience maximum repulsion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy difference between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ orbital sets is symbolized by:",
        "options": [
          "$\u0394_{o}$ (or 10 Dq)",
          "$\u03bb$",
          "$E_{a}$",
          "$K_{w}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\u0394_{o}$ represents the crystal field splitting energy for an octahedral complex."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following ligands is considered a 'strong-field' ligand according to the spectrochemical series?",
        "options": [
          "$CN^{-}$",
          "$Cl^{-}$",
          "$F^{-}$",
          "$I^{-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cyanide ($CN^{-}$) and Carbon monoxide ($CO$) cause the largest splitting ($\u0394$), whereas halides like $I^{-}$ and $Br^{-}$ cause the smallest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'low-spin' octahedral complex occurs when:",
        "options": [
          "The splitting energy ($\u0394_{o}$) is greater than the pairing energy ($P$).",
          "The splitting energy ($\u0394_{o}$) is less than the pairing energy ($P$).",
          "The metal has a $d^{10}$ configuration.",
          "The temperature of the solution is absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the 'gap' is large (strong field), electrons will pair up in the lower energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals rather than jumping to the higher $e_{g}$ orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are many transition metal complexes brightly colored?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons absorb light to move from the lower d-orbitals to higher d-orbitals.",
          "The metal nucleus emits visible light during radioactive decay.",
          "Ligands reflect all wavelengths of light except for one.",
          "The complex ions vibrate at the frequency of visible light."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is known as a d-d transition. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the crystal field splitting energy ($\u0394$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a complex absorbs orange light (~600 nm), what color will it likely appear to the human eye?",
        "options": [
          "Blue",
          "Orange",
          "Red",
          "Yellow"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The perceived color is the complement of the absorbed color. Blue is the complement of orange on the color wheel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Tetrahedral complexes are almost always 'high-spin' because:",
        "options": [
          "The crystal field splitting ($\u0394_{t}$) is much smaller than in octahedral fields.",
          "Tetrahedral complexes only form with strong-field ligands.",
          "They have more d-electrons than octahedral complexes.",
          "The pairing energy is effectively zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\u0394_{t}$ is roughly $4/9$ the size of $\u0394_{o}$. Because the gap is so small, the pairing energy usually exceeds the splitting energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following ions would be colorless in aqueous solution?",
        "options": [
          "$Zn^{2+}$",
          "$Cu^{2+}$",
          "$Fe^{3+}$",
          "$Cr^{3+}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$Zn^{2+}$ has a $d^{10}$ configuration. Since the d-orbitals are completely full, no d-d transitions are possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the oxidation state of the metal affect the splitting energy?",
        "options": [
          "Higher oxidation states generally increase $\u0394$.",
          "Higher oxidation states generally decrease $\u0394$.",
          "Oxidation state has no effect on $\u0394$.",
          "Only negative oxidation states increase $\u0394$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A higher positive charge pulls ligands closer to the metal, increasing the electrostatic repulsion and thus the splitting of the d-orbitals."
