    "topic": "Diagnostic and therapeutic applications of radionuclides",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which radioisotope is the most widely used in diagnostic nuclear medicine for imaging organs like the heart and thyroid?",
        "options": [
          "Technetium-99m",
          "Iodine-131",
          "Cobalt-60",
          "Carbon-11"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Technetium-99m has a short half-life (6 hours) and emits low-energy gamma rays, making it ideal for imaging with minimal radiation dose to the patient."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary function of Iodine-131 in medical practice?",
        "options": [
          "Treating thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism",
          "Imaging the lungs and respiratory tract",
          "Sterilizing surgical equipment",
          "Dating ancient skeletal remains"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The thyroid gland naturally concentrates iodine; therefore, I-131 is used to selectively destroy overactive or cancerous thyroid tissue via beta decay."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans rely on isotopes that undergo positron emission. What happens when the emitted positron meets an electron in the body?",
        "options": [
          "They undergo annihilation, producing two gamma photons in opposite directions.",
          "They fuse to form a stable neutron.",
          "The positron is absorbed by the cell nucleus.",
          "They produce an alpha particle and a neutrino."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The detection of these simultaneous, back-to-back gamma rays allows the PET scanner to precisely locate the isotope in the body."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which isotope is commonly used as a gamma source for the external beam radiation therapy of tumors?",
        "options": [
          "Cobalt-60",
          "Phosphorus-32",
          "Hydrogen-3",
          "Carbon-14"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cobalt-60 is a high-energy gamma emitter used in 'cobalt units' to target and kill cancer cells from outside the body."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'radiopharmaceutical' is a drug that consists of:",
        "options": [
          "A radioisotope attached to a biologically active molecule.",
          "A lead-lined pill to protect the stomach.",
          "A mixture of heavy metals and stable isotopes.",
          "A high dose of Vitamin C mixed with Uranium."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The biological molecule targets a specific organ or process, while the radioisotope provides the signal for imaging or the energy for treatment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important for diagnostic isotopes to have a short half-life?",
        "options": [
          "To minimize the long-term radiation exposure to the patient.",
          "To ensure the isotope is cheaper to produce.",
          "To prevent the isotope from reacting with stomach acid.",
          "To allow the patient to leave the hospital immediately."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Short half-lives ensure the radioactivity levels drop to negligible amounts quickly after the procedure is finished."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of a PET-active isotope used to monitor glucose metabolism?",
        "options": [
          "Fluorine-18 (in FDG)",
          "Iron-59",
          "Sodium-24",
          "Plutonium-239"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) containing F-18 is taken up by high-glucose-using cells, such as brain cells or tumors."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The use of radioisotopes to determine the volume of blood or the function of an organ without surgery is called:",
        "options": [
          "Tracing",
          "Fission",
          "Chelation",
          "Titration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Radioactive tracers follow the path of stable elements through the body, providing a non-invasive 'window' into physiological processes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of radiation is generally preferred for *internal* therapeutic applications where a specific tumor is targeted?",
        "options": [
          "Alpha or Beta emitters",
          "Gamma emitters only",
          "Neutron emitters",
          "X-ray emitters"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alpha and Beta particles have low penetration, meaning they deposit their destructive energy in a very small, localized area, sparing surrounding healthy tissue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Medical isotopes like Technetium-99m are often produced on-site using a:",

          "Bunsen burner",
          "Mass spectrometer",
          "Distillation column"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because of their short half-lives, isotopes are 'milked' from a generator containing a longer-lived parent isotope like Molybdenum-99."
