    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which equation defines the change in Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G$) for a system at constant temperature and pressure?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$",
          "$\\Delta G = \\Delta H + T\\Delta S$",
          "$\\Delta G = q + w$",
          "$\\Delta G = \\Delta U - P\\Delta V$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Gibbs equation combines enthalpy, temperature, and entropy to determine the energy available to do useful work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a process to be spontaneous at constant temperature and pressure, the change in Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G$) must be:",
        "options": [
          "Negative ($\\Delta G < 0$)",
          "Positive ($\\Delta G > 0$)",
          "Exactly zero",
          "Greater than the activation energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative $\\Delta G$ indicates that the process is thermodynamically favorable and can occur without continuous external energy input."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is at equilibrium, what is the value of $\\Delta G$?",
        "options": [
          "0",
          "1",
          "$-RT \\ln K$",
          "It is equal to $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, there is no net driving force for the reaction in either direction, so the free energy change is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction has a negative $\\Delta H$ and a positive $\\Delta S$. Under what conditions is this reaction spontaneous?",
        "options": [
          "It is spontaneous at all temperatures.",
          "It is never spontaneous.",
          "It is only spontaneous at high temperatures.",
          "It is only spontaneous at low temperatures."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When $\\Delta H$ is negative and $\\Delta S$ is positive, both terms in the Gibbs equation ($\\Delta H$ and $-T\\Delta S$) are negative, making $\\Delta G$ always negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the physical meaning of the 'free' in Gibbs free energy?",
        "options": [
          "Energy available to do useful work.",
          "Energy that is gained for no cost.",
          "Energy that is released as light.",
          "Energy that is independent of pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Free energy represents the portion of the total enthalpy change that is not 'lost' to entropy and can be used for work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction has a positive $\\Delta H$ and a positive $\\Delta S$. When does this reaction become spontaneous?",
        "options": [
          "At high temperatures.",
          "At low temperatures.",
          "At all temperatures.",
          "It is never spontaneous."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $-T\\Delta S$ term must be large enough to overcome the positive $\\Delta H$. This happens when $T$ is high."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard state temperature usually used for $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ calculations in textbooks?",
        "options": [
          "298 K",
          "273 K",
          "0 K",
          "100 K"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard conditions are defined as 298 K ($25$°C) and 1 atm pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\Delta G$ for a process is positive, the process is said to be:",
        "options": [
          "Non-spontaneous",
          "Exothermic",
          "At equilibrium",
          "Rapidly occurring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A positive $\\Delta G$ means the process is endergonic and requires work to be done on the system to proceed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true for a reaction where $\\Delta H > 0$ and $\\Delta S < 0$?",
        "options": [
          "The reaction is non-spontaneous at all temperatures.",
          "The reaction is spontaneous at all temperatures.",
          "The reaction is spontaneous only at low temperatures.",
          "The reaction is spontaneous only at high temperatures."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both terms ($+\\Delta H$ and $-T(-\\Delta S)$) are positive, so $\\Delta G$ will always be positive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Does a spontaneous reaction ($\\Delta G < 0$) necessarily occur quickly?",
        "options": [
          "No, $\\Delta G$ only tells us about the direction of the reaction, not the rate.",
          "Yes, all spontaneous reactions are fast.",
          "No, but it will occur instantly if a catalyst is added.",
          "Yes, if the temperature is above 298 K."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spontaneity is a thermodynamic property. The speed of the reaction depends on kinetics (activation energy)."
