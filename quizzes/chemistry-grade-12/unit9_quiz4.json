    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Nernst Equation is primarily used to calculate:",
        "options": [
          "Cell potential under non-standard concentrations.",
          "The standard reduction potential of the SHE.",
          "The rate constant of a redox reaction.",
          "The activation energy of an electrochemical cell."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While $E^{\\circ}$ is measured at 1.0 M, the Nernst equation allows for the calculation of potential ($E$) when concentrations deviate from standard state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Nernst Equation $E = E^{\\circ} - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q$, what does the constant $F$ represent?",
        "options": [
          "Faraday's constant (approx. 96,500 C/mol).",
          "The universal gas constant.",
          "The frequency of electron collisions.",
          "The freezing point of the electrolyte."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Faraday's constant ($F$) represents the magnitude of electric charge per mole of electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At $298\\ K$, the Nernst Equation is often simplified using the value $0.0592$. This version uses which logarithmic base?",
        "options": [
          "Base-10 logarithm ($\\log_{10}$)",
          "Natural logarithm ($\\ln$)",
          "Binary logarithm ($\\log_{2}$)",
          "The equation does not use logarithms."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The value $0.0592$ results from multiplying the constants ($R$, $T$, $F$) and the conversion factor ($2.303$) to switch from $\\ln$ to $\\log_{10}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the concentration of the reactants is increased relative to the products, what happens to the cell potential ($E$)?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It stays exactly at $E^{\\circ}$.",
          "It drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increasing reactants decreases the reaction quotient ($Q$). In the Nernst equation, subtracting a smaller value increases the overall cell potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of the cell potential ($E$) when an electrochemical cell reaches equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "0 V",
          "$E^{\\circ}$",
          "1.10 V",
          "It depends on the metal used."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, the driving force for electron transfer is zero; therefore, the voltmeter would read 0 V."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a 'concentration cell' where both electrodes are the same metal, the standard cell potential ($E^{\\circ}$) is always:",
        "options": [
          "0 V",
          "1.0 V",
          "Negative",
          "Positive"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since both half-cells are identical, the difference between their standard reduction potentials ($E^{\\circ}_{cathode} - E^{\\circ}_{anode}$) is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the term $\\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q$, what does '$n$' represent?",
        "options": [
          "Number of moles of electrons transferred.",
          "Number of ions in the salt bridge.",
          "Number of moles of reactant remaining.",
          "The temperature in Celsius."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The variable $n$ is the number of moles of electrons exchanged in the balanced redox reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A cell has a reaction quotient $Q = 1$. How does $E$ compare to $E^{\\circ}$?",
        "options": [
          "$E = E^{\\circ}$",
          "$E > E^{\\circ}$",
          "$E < E^{\\circ}$",
          "$E = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $\\log(1) = 0$, the entire correction term becomes zero, and the measured potential equals the standard potential."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As a battery discharges, why does the voltage eventually drop?",
        "options": [
          "Reactants are consumed and products accumulate, increasing $Q$.",
          "The standard potential ($E^{\\circ}$) of the metals changes.",
          "The electrons are used up and disappear.",
          "The salt bridge becomes permanently magnetized."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $Q$ increases during discharge, the subtracted term in the Nernst equation becomes larger, reducing the value of $E$ until it reaches zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the relationship between $Q$ and $K$ at equilibrium in the Nernst Equation?",
        "options": [
          "$Q = K$",
          "$Q = 1$",
          "$Q = 0$",
          "$Q = 1/K$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, at equilibrium, the reaction quotient $Q$ is equal to the equilibrium constant $K$, and $E$ is 0."
