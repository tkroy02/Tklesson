    "topic": "Molecular mass and fragmentation patterns",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The peak with the highest m/z ratio in a simplified mass spectrum usually represents:",
        "options": [
          "The molecular ion ($M^{+}$), which gives the molar mass.",
          "The base peak, which is the most stable fragment.",
          "The fragment with the lowest mass.",
          "The catalyst used in the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The molecular ion peak is formed when the entire molecule loses one electron. Its m/z value corresponds to the relative molecular mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the $M+1$ peak present in the mass spectrum of organic compounds?",
        "options": [
          "Due to the natural abundance of the $^{13}C$ isotope.",
          "Because the molecule gained a proton during ionization.",
          "Due to contamination from the solvent.",
          "Because the molecule was hit by two electrons."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "About $1.1\\%$ of carbon atoms are $^{13}C$. In a molecule with many carbons, there is a high probability that at least one atom is $^{13}C$, creating a peak at $M+1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A mass spectrum showing two molecular ion peaks of equal intensity at $M$ and $M+2$ indicates the presence of:",
        "options": [
          "Bromine",
          "Chlorine",
          "Nitrogen",
          "Oxygen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bromine has two isotopes, $^{79}Br$ and $^{81}Br$, in an approximately $1:1$ ratio, leading to two peaks of equal height separated by 2 mass units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a mass spectrometer, the path of the ions is curved by a magnetic field. Which ions are deflected the most?",
        "options": [
          "Ions with the lowest mass-to-charge ($m/z$) ratio.",
          "Ions with the highest mass.",
          "Ions that are neutral.",
          "Ions traveling at the slowest speed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lighter ions are more easily deflected by the magnetic field than heavier ones."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'base peak' in a mass spectrum?",
        "options": [
          "The most intense peak, representing the most stable fragment.",
          "The peak representing the total molecular mass.",
          "The peak at the very beginning of the spectrum (lowest mass).",
          "The peak caused by the air in the machine."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base peak is the tallest peak in the spectrum. All other peak heights are measured relative to it ($100\\%$ abundance)."
