    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which process occurs first when a sample is introduced into a mass spectrometer?",
        "options": [
          "Ionization",
          "Acceleration",
          "Deflection",
          "Detection"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sample must first be ionized (usually by electron impact) to create positive ions before they can be manipulated by magnetic or electric fields."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the symbol $m/z$ represent on the x-axis of a mass spectrum?",
        "options": [
          "Mass-to-charge ratio",
          "Molar concentration",
          "Molecular velocity",
          "Magnetic zone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since most ions produced have a +1 charge, the $m/z$ value numerically equals the mass of the fragment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The peak with the highest $m/z$ ratio (neglecting small isotope peaks) is called the:",
        "options": [
          "Molecular ion peak ($M^{+}$)",
          "Base peak",
          "Fragment peak",
          "Parent isotope"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The molecular ion peak represents the intact molecule that has lost one electron, providing the relative molecular mass."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a mass spectrum shows a base peak at 100% relative abundance, this means:",
        "options": [
          "It is the most stable and abundant fragment detected.",
          "It is the heaviest ion in the sample.",
          "The molecule did not undergo fragmentation.",
          "The sample is 100% pure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum and is used as a reference to scale all other peaks."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The presence of a small $M+1$ peak is primarily due to which isotope?",
        "options": [
          "$^{13}C$",
          "$^{2}H$",
          "$^{18}O$",
          "$^{15}N$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Naturally occurring Carbon contains approximately 1.1% of the $^{13}C$ isotope, leading to a small peak 1 mass unit higher than the molecular ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A compound with one Chlorine atom will show a characteristic molecular ion pattern of:",
        "options": [
          "Two peaks ($M$ and $M+2$) in a 3:1 ratio.",
          "Two peaks ($M$ and $M+2$) in a 1:1 ratio.",
          "A single sharp peak.",
          "Three peaks in a 1:2:1 ratio."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorine exists as $^{35}Cl$ and $^{37}Cl$ in a roughly 75% to 25% ratio, creating a 3:1 height ratio in the spectrum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What causes fragmentation of the molecular ion?",
        "options": [
          "Excess energy from the electron bombardment.",
          "The vacuum pressure is too high.",
          "Collisions with the detector plate.",
          "The magnetic field is too strong."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The high-energy electrons used for ionization transfer enough energy to break covalent bonds within the molecular ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A loss of 15 mass units from the molecular ion peak typically indicates the loss of which group?",
        "options": [
          "Methyl group ($-CH_{3}$)",
          "Ethyl group ($-C_{2}H_{5}$)",
          "Hydroxyl group ($-OH$)",
          "Water molecule ($H_{2}O$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A methyl fragment has a mass of 12 (C) + 3 (H) = 15. Fragmentation often involves the loss of such radical groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must the interior of a mass spectrometer be kept under a high vacuum?",
        "options": [
          "To prevent ions from colliding with air molecules.",
          "To keep the sample from catching fire.",
          "To cool down the electron gun.",
          "To increase the mass of the fragments."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Collisions with air molecules would deflect the ions and prevent them from reaching the detector, ruining the resolution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following cannot be directly determined by low-resolution mass spectrometry?",
        "options": [
          "The exact spatial arrangement (cis/trans) of atoms.",
          "The relative molecular mass.",
          "The presence of bromine or chlorine isotopes.",
          "The mass of common fragments."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mass spectrometry identifies mass and composition, but it cannot easily distinguish between geometric isomers or stereoisomers without further specialized techniques."
