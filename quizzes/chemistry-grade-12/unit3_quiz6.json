          "Carboxylic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydration is the addition of a water molecule (H-OH) across a double bond, which converts an alkene into an alcohol."
      },

        "explanation": "Industrially, ethene is reacted with steam over a solid phosphoric acid catalyst at high temperature and pressure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the hydration of propene, why is propan-2-ol the major product instead of propan-1-ol?",
        "options": [
          "The reaction follows Markovnikov's rule via a secondary carbocation",
          "The reaction follows Markovnikov's rule via a primary carbocation",
          "The primary carbon is too sterically hindered for the OH group",
          "Water naturally prefers to bond to the center of a carbon chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The H+ from the catalyst adds to the terminal carbon to form the more stable secondary carbocation; the water molecule then attacks that positive center."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in the mechanism of acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene?",
        "options": [
          "Protonation of the double bond to form a carbocation",
          "Nucleophilic attack by water on the double bond",
          "Loss of a hydrogen atom from the alkene",
          "Formation of a hydroxide ion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pi electrons of the alkene attack a proton (H+) from the acid catalyst, creating a carbocation intermediate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the hydration mechanism, after water attacks the carbocation, an oxonium ion ($R-OH_{2}^{+}$) is formed. What happens next?",
        "options": [
          "Deprotonation by another water molecule to form the neutral alcohol",
          "The oxygen-carbon bond breaks to reform the alkene",
          "A second water molecule adds to the same carbon",
          "The molecule undergoes combustion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The oxonium ion is acidic; a water molecule acts as a base to remove the extra proton, regenerating the acid catalyst and leaving the alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the hydration of alkenes considered a 'catalytic' process?",
        "options": [
          "The acid used in the first step is regenerated in the final step",
          "The water molecule is never actually consumed",
          "The reaction happens instantly without any energy input",
          "It only works in the presence of sunlight"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The H+ ion consumed in the initiation step is released back into the solution in the final step, meaning it is not used up in the overall reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following conditions favors the formation of an alkene from an alcohol (dehydration) rather than an alcohol from an alkene (hydration)?",
        "options": [
          "High temperature and concentrated acid",
          "Low temperature and excess water",
          "High pressure and no catalyst",
          "Neutral pH and room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydration and dehydration are reversible. According to Le Chatelier's principle, removing water (using concentrated acid) and increasing heat favors the elimination reaction to form an alkene."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the major product of the hydration of 2-methylbut-2-ene?",
        "options": [
          "2-methylbutan-2-ol",
          "3-methylbutan-2-ol",
          "2-methylbutan-1-ol",
          "3-methylbutan-1-ol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The proton adds to C3, creating a stable tertiary carbocation at C2. The hydroxyl group then attaches to C2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is the hydration of an alkene an exothermic or endothermic process?",
        "options": [
          "Exothermic",
          "Endothermic",
          "Athermous (no heat change)",
          "It depends on the color of the flask"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formation of two strong sigma bonds (C-H and C-OH) releases more energy than is required to break the pi bond and the O-H bond of water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following alkenes will produce a primary alcohol upon hydration?",
        "options": [
          "Ethene",
          "Propene",
          "But-1-ene",
          "2-methylpropene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethene is the only alkene that yields a primary alcohol (ethanol). All other alkenes follow Markovnikov's rule to produce secondary or tertiary alcohols."
