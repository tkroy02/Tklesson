    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The general mechanism for reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives is known as:",
        "options": [
          "Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution",
          "Nucleophilic Addition",
          "Electrophilic Substitution",
          "Free Radical Substitution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because these derivatives have a leaving group, the net result is the replacement (substitution) of that group by a nucleophile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the geometry of the unstable intermediate formed during a nucleophilic acyl substitution?",
        "options": [
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Linear",
          "Square planar"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the nucleophile attacks the $sp^2$ carbonyl carbon, it pushes electrons onto the oxygen, creating a tetrahedral ($sp^3$) intermediate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the two main steps of an acyl substitution reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Addition of the nucleophile, followed by elimination of the leaving group.",
          "Elimination of the leaving group, followed by addition of the nucleophile.",
          "Simultaneous bond breaking and bond forming ($S_N2$ style).",
          "Protonation followed by dehydration."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mechanism is often called 'addition-elimination' because the nucleophile adds first to form a tetrahedral intermediate, which then collapses to expel the leaving group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What drives the 'elimination' step in the acyl substitution mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "The reformation of the stable $C=O$ double bond.",
          "The attack of a second nucleophile.",
          "The evaporation of the leaving group.",
          "The presence of an acid catalyst."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carbon-oxygen double bond is very stable; the lone pair on the negative oxygen 'kicks back' to reform the pi bond, forcing the best leaving group out."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do aldehydes and ketones NOT undergo substitution like acid derivatives do?",
        "options": [
          "They lack a suitable leaving group (like $H^-$ or $R^-$) to be expelled.",
          "They are too small to form a tetrahedral intermediate.",
          "Their carbonyl carbon is not electrophilic enough.",
          "They only react with electrophiles."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydride ($H^-$) and carbanions ($R^-$) are extremely strong bases and terrible leaving groups, so the tetrahedral intermediate in those cases just stays as an addition product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction of an acyl chloride with an alcohol, what acts as the nucleophile?",
        "options": [
          "The lone pair on the alcohol oxygen.",
          "The chloride ion.",
          "The carbonyl oxygen.",
          "The alkyl group of the alcohol."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electron-rich oxygen of the alcohol attacks the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the acyl chloride."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Acid catalysis in acyl substitution (like esterification) primarily works by:",
        "options": [
          "Making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic through protonation of the oxygen.",
          "Making the leaving group a stronger base.",
          "Increasing the concentration of the nucleophile.",
          "Preventing the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Protonating the $C=O$ oxygen increases the positive charge on the carbon, making it more susceptible to attack by weak nucleophiles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which species is expelled during the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate when an acid anhydride reacts with an amine?",
        "options": [
          "A carboxylate ion ($RCOO^-$)",
          "A chloride ion ($Cl^-$)",
          "An alkoxide ion ($RO^-$)",
          "A molecule of water ($H_2O$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an anhydride ($R-CO-O-CO-R$), the leaving group is the carboxylate group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The rate of a nucleophilic acyl substitution is determined by:",
        "options": [
          "Both the electrophilicity of the carbonyl and the ability of the leaving group.",
          "Only the temperature of the reaction.",
          "The length of the hydrocarbon chain.",
          "The type of solvent used."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A more positive carbon (electrophilicity) speeds up the addition step, and a better leaving group speeds up the elimination step."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a neutral nucleophile (like $H_2O$ or $ROH$) is used in acyl substitution, the final step is usually:",
        "options": [
          "Loss of a proton to reach a neutral product.",
          "Addition of a second leaving group.",
          "Formation of a carbocation.",
          "Breaking of the $C-C$ sigma bond."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After the nucleophile attacks and the leaving group departs, the nucleophile (now with a positive charge) must lose a proton to become stable."
