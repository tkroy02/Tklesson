    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of the ion-product constant for water ($K_{w}$) at 25°C?",
        "options": [
          "$1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$",
          "$1.0 \\times 10^{-7}$",
          "$7.0$",
          "$14.0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{w} = [H_{3}O^{+}][OH^{-}]$. At 25°C, this constant is exactly $1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mathematical expression correctly defines pH?",
        "options": [
          "pH = $-\\log[H_{3}O^{+}]$",
          "pH = $\\ln[H_{3}O^{+}]$",
          "pH = $10^{-[H_{3}O^{+}]}$",
          "pH = $-\\log[OH^{-}]$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pH scale is logarithmic; pH is the negative base-10 logarithm of the hydronium ion molarity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the pH of a solution is 4.0, what is the concentration of $H_{3}O^{+}$ ions?",
        "options": [
          "$1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ M",
          "$4.0$ M",
          "$1.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ M",
          "$0.0004$ M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To find concentration from pH, use $[H_{3}O^{+}] = 10^{-pH}$. Therefore, $10^{-4.0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ M."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For any aqueous solution at 25°C, the sum of pH and pOH is always equal to:",
        "options": [
          "14.0",
          "7.0",
          "1.0 \\times 10^{-14}",
          "0.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Taking the negative log of both sides of the $K_{w}$ expression gives $pk_{w} = pH + pOH = 14$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the hydroxide ion concentration $[OH^{-}]$ is $1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ M, what is the pH of the solution?",
        "options": [
          "11.0",
          "3.0",
          "7.0",
          "1.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "pOH = $-\\log(10^{-3}) = 3.0$. Since pH + pOH = 14, pH = $14 - 3 = 11.0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the autoionization of water ($2H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^{+} + OH^{-}$) respond to an increase in temperature, given it is an endothermic process?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{w}$ increases and neutral pH becomes less than 7.0",
          "$K_{w}$ decreases and neutral pH becomes greater than 7.0",
          "$K_{w}$ remains constant but pH changes",
          "The solution becomes basic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As an endothermic process, increasing temperature shifts equilibrium to the right, increasing $[H_{3}O^{+}]$. A solution is still 'neutral' if $[H^{+}] = [OH^{-}]$, even if the pH is below 7."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A solution with a pH of 9.0 is considered:",
        "options": [
          "Basic",
          "Acidic",
          "Neutral",
          "Amphoteric"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At 25°C, any solution with a pH greater than 7.0 is basic because $[OH^{-}] > [H_{3}O^{+}]$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the concentration of $H_{3}O^{+}$ increases by a factor of 100, how does the pH change?",
        "options": [
          "The pH decreases by 2 units.",
          "The pH increases by 2 units.",
          "The pH decreases by 100 units.",
          "The pH remains the same."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the scale is logarithmic, a 10-fold change equals 1 pH unit. A 100-fold increase ($10^{2}$) decreases the pH by 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the pH of a $0.001$ M solution of $NaOH$?",

          "11.0",
          "3.0",
          "1.0",
          "14.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$NaOH$ is a strong base, so $[OH^{-}] = 0.001 = 10^{-3}$ M. pOH = 3, so pH = $14 - 3 = 11.0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Pure water at 25°C has a pH of 7.0 because:",
        "options": [
          "The concentrations of $H_{3}O^{+}$ and $OH^{-}$ are equal.",
          "There are no ions present in pure water.",
          "Water cannot act as an acid or a base.",
          "The atmospheric pressure is 1 atm."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In pure water, the only source of ions is autoionization, which produces $H_{3}O^{+}$ and $OH^{-}$ in a 1:1 ratio ($1.0 \\times 10^{-7}$ M each)."
