    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the structure of a cyanohydrin?",
        "options": [
          "A molecule with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a nitrile group (-CN) on the same carbon.",
          "A molecule with a carbonyl group and a cyanide ion.",
          "A molecule where an oxygen has been replaced by a nitrogen.",
          "A cyclic ether containing nitrogen."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cyanohydrins are formed when $HCN$ adds across the $C=O$ bond, placing both the $-OH$ and $-CN$ groups on the former carbonyl carbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is pure $HCN$ rarely used alone for this reaction in a laboratory setting?",
        "options": [
          "It is a highly toxic gas and a weak acid with a low concentration of $CN^{-}$ ions.",
          "It is a strong base that would decompose the carbonyl.",
          "It is a non-polar solvent that does not dissolve ketones.",
          "It reacts too violently with water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$HCN$ is both dangerous to handle and a weak acid. To speed up the reaction, a salt like $KCN$ or a base is usually added to provide a higher concentration of the nucleophilic $CN^{-}$ ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The formation of a cyanohydrin is an example of:",
        "options": [
          "Nucleophilic addition",
          "Electrophilic substitution",
          "Free radical substitution",
          "Elimination"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cyanide ion ($CN^{-}$) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of $KCN$ (or base) when added to $HCN$ in this reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It acts as a catalyst by providing $CN^{-}$ ions.",
          "It acts as an oxidizing agent.",
          "It prevents the formation of the hydroxyl group.",
          "It lowers the boiling point of the mixture."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $HCN$ is a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate much. Adding $KCN$ provides the $CN^{-}$ nucleophile needed to start the attack."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a major synthetic use of cyanohydrins?",
        "options": [
          "They can be hydrolyzed to form α-hydroxy carboxylic acids.",
          "They are used to reduce ketones to alkanes.",
          "They act as excellent protecting groups for alcohols.",
          "They are the primary starting material for making esters."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The nitrile group ($-CN$) can be hydrolyzed (treated with acid and water) to a carboxylic acid ($-COOH$), making cyanohydrins a route to α-hydroxy acids like lactic acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Cyanohydrin formation is reversible. Which condition would favor the decomposition of a cyanohydrin back into the original carbonyl?",
        "options": [
          "Treating the cyanohydrin with a strong base.",
          "Adding more $HCN$ to the solution.",
          "Cooling the reaction to 0°C.",
          "Adding a dehydrating agent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the presence of base, the hydroxyl group is deprotonated, and the resulting alkoxide can reform the $C=O$ pi bond, expelling the cyanide ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which carbonyl compound would react fastest with $HCN$?",
        "options": [
          "Ethanal",
          "Propanone",
          "Butan-2-one",
          "Benzophenone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aldehydes (like ethanal) are more reactive than ketones due to less steric hindrance and less inductive stabilization of the carbonyl carbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Reducing a cyanohydrin with $LiAlH_{4}$ typically produces:",
        "options": [
          "A β-amino alcohol",
          "A carboxylic acid",
          "A ketone",
          "An alkane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $-CN$ group is reduced to a primary amine ($-CH_{2}NH_{2}$), resulting in an amino alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the change in the number of carbon atoms when an aldehyde is converted to a cyanohydrin?",
        "options": [
          "The number of carbons increases by one.",
          "The number of carbons stays the same.",
          "The number of carbons decreases by one.",
          "The number of carbons doubles."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cyanide group introduces a new carbon atom into the molecular skeleton."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the mechanism of cyanohydrin formation, what is the final step?",
        "options": [
          "Protonation of the alkoxide oxygen.",
          "Attack of the cyanide ion on the carbon.",
          "Elimination of water.",
          "Loss of a proton from the nitrile group."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After $CN^{-}$ attacks to form an alkoxide intermediate, the oxygen is protonated (usually by $HCN$ or water) to yield the final hydroxyl group."
