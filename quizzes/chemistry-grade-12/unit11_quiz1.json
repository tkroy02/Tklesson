    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Brønsted-Lowry theory, an acid is defined as a substance that:",
        "options": [
          "Donates a proton ($H^{+}$).",
          "Accepts a proton ($H^{+}$).",
          "Produces $OH^{-}$ ions in aqueous solution.",
          "Accepts an electron pair."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Brønsted-Lowry acids are proton donors, while Arrhenius acids specifically produce $H^{+}$ in water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the conjugate base of the ammonium ion ($NH_{4}^{+}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$NH_{3}$",
          "$NH_{2}^{-}$",
          "$NH_{5}^{2+}$",
          "$OH^{-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To find a conjugate base, remove one proton ($H^{+}$) from the acid. $NH_{4}^{+} - H^{+} = NH_{3}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following substances is 'amphiprotic'?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}O$",
          "$HCl$",
          "$NaOH$",
          "$CH_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amphiprotic substances like water can either donate a proton (to become $OH^{-}$) or accept a proton (to become $H_{3}O^{+}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction: $HF + H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^{+} + F^{-}$, what are the conjugate acid-base pairs?",
        "options": [
          "$HF/F^{-}$ and $H_{3}O^{+}/H_{2}O$",
          "$HF/H_{2}O$ and $H_{3}O^{+}/F^{-}$",
          "$HF/H_{3}O^{+}$ and $H_{2}O/F^{-}$",
          "$F^{-}/H_{2}O$ and $HF/H_{3}O^{+}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A conjugate pair differs by exactly one proton. $HF$ loses a proton to become $F^{-}$, and $H_{2}O$ gains a proton to become $H_{3}O^{+}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which species is the conjugate acid of the hydrogen phosphate ion ($HPO_{4}^{2-}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}$",
          "$PO_{4}^{3-}$",
          "$H_{3}PO_{4}$",
          "$P^{3-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A conjugate acid is formed by adding one proton ($H^{+}$) to the base. $HPO_{4}^{2-} + H^{+} = H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Lewis theory of acids and bases is broader than the Brønsted-Lowry theory because it focuses on:",
        "options": [
          "Electron pairs.",
          "Hydroxide ions.",
          "Gaseous molecules only.",
          "Solvent effects."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lewis acids accept electron pairs, allowing substances without protons (like $BF_{3}$) to be classified as acids."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $NH_{3} + HCl \\rightarrow NH_{4}^{+} + Cl^{-}$, $NH_{3}$ acts as a:",
        "options": [
          "Brønsted-Lowry base.",
          "Brønsted-Lowry acid.",
          "Arrhenius acid.",
          "Spectator ion."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ammonia accepts a proton from $HCl$ to become $NH_{4}^{+}$, qualifying it as a Brønsted-Lowry base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following cannot act as a Brønsted-Lowry acid?",

          "$CO_{3}^{2-}$",
          "$H_{2}O$",
          "$HCO_{3}^{-}$",
          "$NH_{4}^{+}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A Brønsted-Lowry acid must have at least one hydrogen atom to donate. $CO_{3}^{2-}$ has no protons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the conjugate base of $H_{2}SO_{4}$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Removing one $H^{+}$ from $H_{2}SO_{4}$ leaves the hydrogen sulfate ion ($HSO_{4}^{-}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the Brønsted-Lowry acid in the reverse reaction: $CH_{3}COOH + NH_{3} \\rightleftharpoons CH_{3}COO^{-} + NH_{4}^{+}$.",
