      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The destruction of ozone by chlorine radicals is described as a 'catalytic' process. Why?",
        "options": [
          "A single chlorine radical can destroy thousands of ozone molecules",
          "The reaction requires a platinum catalyst to occur",
          "Chlorine is consumed in the first step and never released",
          "The reaction only happens inside clouds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The chlorine radical reacts with ozone to form $ClO\\cdot$, which then reacts with atomic oxygen to regenerate the $Cl\\cdot$ radical, allowing the cycle to repeat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which international treaty was signed in 1987 to phase out the production of ozone-depleting substances?",
        "options": [
          "The Montreal Protocol",
          "The Kyoto Protocol",
          "The Paris Agreement",
          "The Geneva Convention"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Montreal Protocol is considered one of the most successful environmental treaties, leading to a significant recovery of the ozone layer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) considered a 'greener' alternative to CFCs regarding ozone depletion?",
        "options": [
          "They do not contain chlorine, so they cannot produce chlorine radicals",
          "They react with ozone to produce more oxygen",
          "They are much heavier and stay in the troposphere",
          "They are made from biodegradable plant materials"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "HFCs lack the $C-Cl$ bond. While they are potent greenhouse gases, they have an 'Ozone Depletion Potential' (ODP) of zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is a major environmental drawback of using certain haloalkanes like HFCs, even if they don't deplete ozone?",
        "options": [
          "They have high Global Warming Potential (GWP)",
          "They cause acid rain",
          "They turn the ocean acidic",
          "They lead to the overgrowth of algae"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, leading to more recent regulations like the Kigali Amendment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The persistence of CFCs in the atmosphere is primarily due to:",
        "options": [
          "The high strength and stability of the $C-Cl$ and $C-F$ bonds",
          "Their ability to dissolve in rainwater",
          "Their high reactivity with nitrogen gas",
          "Their magnetic attraction to the North Pole"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "CFCs are chemically inert in the lower atmosphere, allowing them to drift into the stratosphere over several decades."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Green Chemistry' approach to haloalkanes?",

          "A total loss of the Earth's atmosphere"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Excess UV radiation causes DNA damage in living tissues, leading to health issues in humans and damage to marine phytoplankton."
