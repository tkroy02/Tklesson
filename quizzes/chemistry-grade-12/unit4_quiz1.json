    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following defines a 'primary' (1°) haloalkane?",
        "options": [
          "The halogen atom is attached to a carbon that is bonded to only one other carbon",
          "The halogen atom is the first substituent on the chain",
          "The molecule contains only one halogen atom",
          "The halogen is attached to a terminal methyl group"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Classification (1°, 2°, 3°) is determined by the number of carbon atoms directly attached to the 'alpha' carbon (the one holding the halogen)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the classification of 2-bromo-2-methylpropane?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In 2-bromo-2-methylpropane, the carbon holding the bromine is bonded to three other methyl groups, making it a tertiary haloalkane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In IUPAC nomenclature, how are halogens treated when naming a substituted alkane?",
        "options": [
          "As substituents with the prefixes fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, or iodo-",
          "As the principal functional group with a suffix change",
          "As part of the parent chain name (e.g., chloromethane becomes methachlore)",
          "They are ignored if an alkyl group is present"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Halogens are always treated as substituents and listed alphabetically along with alkyl groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a 'geminal' dihalide?",
        "options": [
          "A molecule with two halogen atoms on the same carbon atom",
          "A molecule with two halogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms",
          "A molecule with two different types of halogens",
          "A molecule where the halogens are at opposite ends of the chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Geminal' (from Gemini, twins) refers to two functional groups on the same carbon. 'Vicinal' refers to groups on adjacent carbons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct IUPAC name for $CH_{3}CH(Cl)CH_{2}CH_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "2-chlorobutane",
          "3-chlorobutane",
          "sec-butyl chloride",
          "1-methyl-1-chloropropane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The longest chain is four carbons (butane), and numbering from the left gives the chlorine the lowest locant of 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which classification does isopropyl chloride fall into?",
        "options": [
          "Secondary (2°)",
          "Primary (1°)",
          "Tertiary (3°)",
          "Aryl halide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an isopropyl group, the central carbon is bonded to two other carbons. Therefore, the chloride attached to that central carbon is secondary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are multiple identical halogen atoms indicated in an IUPAC name?",
        "options": [
          "Using prefixes like di-, tri-, or tetra- before the halogen name",
          "By repeating the halogen name (e.g., chlorochloroethane)",
          "By adding a suffix to the end of the alkane",
          "By using capital letters for the halogens"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Standard IUPAC multipliers (di, tri, etc.) are used to indicate the quantity of identical substituents."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is considered an 'allyl' halide?",
        "options": [
          "3-chloroprop-1-ene",
          "1-chloroprop-1-ene",
          "Chlorobenzene",
          "Chloroethane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An allylic position is a carbon atom adjacent to a carbon-carbon double bond. 3-chloroprop-1-ene fits this description."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a molecule with both a bromine and a chlorine atom, which is listed first in the name?",
        "options": [
          "Bromine",
          "Chlorine",
          "Whichever has the lower number",
          "Whichever is heavier"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substituents are always listed in alphabetical order (Bromo- before Chloro-), regardless of their locant numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for a benzene ring with a chlorine atom attached directly to it?",
        "options": [
          "Chlorobenzene",
          "Benzyl chloride",
          "1-chlorocyclohexane",
          "Phenyl chloride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a halogen is directly attached to an aromatic ring, it is named as a halo-benzene. 'Benzyl chloride' refers to a $CH_{2}Cl$ group attached to the ring."
