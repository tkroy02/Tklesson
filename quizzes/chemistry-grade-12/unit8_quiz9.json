    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which intermolecular force is primarily responsible for the high tensile strength of polyamides like Nylon?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen bonding",
          "London dispersion forces",
          "Permanent dipole-dipole interactions",
          "Ionic bonding"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $N-H$ and $C=O$ groups in polyamides form extensive hydrogen bonds between adjacent chains, significantly increasing the material's strength."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the degree of branching in a polymer affect its density?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases density by preventing chains from packing closely.",
          "It increases density by adding more mass to the chain.",
          "It has no effect on the density of the polymer.",
          "It increases density by creating more covalent bonds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Branches act as 'spacers' that prevent polymer chains from aligning in an orderly, compact fashion, resulting in lower density (e.g., LDPE)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of 'cross-linking' between polymer chains?",
        "options": [
          "The polymer becomes a rigid, infusible thermoset.",
          "The polymer becomes easier to melt and recycle.",
          "The polymer becomes more soluble in organic solvents.",
          "The polymer chains slide past each other more easily."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Covalent cross-links bind chains into a 3D network, preventing them from melting or flowing when heated (thermosetting polymers)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'crystalline' region in a polymer?",
        "options": [
          "An area where chains are highly ordered and closely packed.",
          "An area where chains are tangled and randomly arranged.",
          "A region that is completely transparent to light.",
          "A region containing only monomer molecules."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Crystallinity refers to the ordered alignment of polymer chains. Higher crystallinity usually leads to higher melting points and increased stiffness."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does Poly(tetrafluoroethene) (PTFE) have such low friction and high chemical resistance?",
        "options": [
          "The $C-F$ bonds are exceptionally strong and the fluorine atoms protect the carbon chain.",
          "The polymer contains many double bonds that absorb energy.",
          "The polymer is held together by strong ionic cross-links.",
          "The chains are short and move past each other like a liquid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The high electronegativity of fluorine and the strength of the $C-F$ bond make PTFE chemically inert and create a non-stick surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a thermoplastic polymer when it is heated above its glass transition temperature ($T_g$)?",
        "options": [
          "It transitions from a hard, brittle state to a rubbery, flexible state.",
          "It immediately decomposes into its constituent monomers.",
          "It forms permanent covalent bonds between all chains.",
          "It becomes a crystalline solid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$T_g$ is the temperature where the polymer chains gain enough thermal energy to begin sliding past each other, making the material flexible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor would increase the 'stiffness' of a polymer chain?",
        "options": [
          "The presence of bulky side groups or aromatic rings.",
          "Increasing the temperature of the environment.",
          "Adding plasticizers between the chains.",
          "Decreasing the average molecular mass of the chains."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bulky groups (like the benzene ring in polystyrene) restrict the rotation of the carbon-carbon bonds, making the chain more rigid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the purpose of adding a 'plasticizer' to a polymer like PVC?",
        "options": [
          "To reduce intermolecular forces and increase flexibility.",
          "To increase the melting point for high-temperature use.",
          "To make the polymer more resistant to UV light.",
          "To catalyze the polymerization reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plasticizers fit between polymer chains, pushing them apart and weakening the intermolecular forces, which makes the plastic softer and more pliable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which polymer would likely have the highest melting point?",
        "options": [
          "A highly crystalline polymer with strong hydrogen bonding.",
          "An amorphous polymer with weak London dispersion forces.",
          "A highly branched polymer with no functional groups.",
          "A low-molecular-weight polymer with many side chains."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both high crystallinity (close packing) and strong intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding) require more thermal energy to overcome, raising the melting point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'elastomer' refers to a polymer that:",
        "options": [
          "Can return to its original shape after being stretched.",
          "Is used exclusively for electrical insulation.",
          "Conducts electricity like a metal.",
          "Is liquid at room temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elastomers have occasional cross-links that prevent chains from sliding permanently but allow them to stretch and snap back."
