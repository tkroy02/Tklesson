    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When setting up an ICE table for a weak acid $HA$, what is the expression for the equilibrium concentration of the unionized acid?",
        "options": [
          "$[HA]_{initial} - x$",
          "$x$",
          "$[HA]_{initial} + x$",
          "$2x$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $x$ is the amount of acid that ionizes, the concentration remaining at equilibrium is the initial molarity minus $x$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The '5% rule' allows chemists to simplify weak acid calculations by:",
        "options": [
          "Assuming $[HA]_{initial} - x \\approx [HA]_{initial}$",
          "Assuming $x$ is exactly 5% of the initial concentration.",
          "Ignoring the $K_{a}$ value entirely.",
          "Rounding the pH to the nearest whole number."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $x$ is very small compared to the initial concentration, we can neglect it in the denominator to avoid using the quadratic formula."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the $[H_{3}O^{+}]$ of a $0.10$ M solution of a weak acid with $K_{a} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$.",

          "$0.10$ M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{a} = x^{2} / 0.10$. So $x^{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$, and $x = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ M."
      },

          "$K_{b} = \\frac{[BH^{+}][OH^{-}]}{[B]}$",
          "$K_{a} = \\frac{[H_{3}O^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$",

          "$K_{w} = K_{a} / K_{b}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak base calculations mirror weak acid calculations but solve for hydroxide concentration using the base dissociation constant ($K_{b}$)."

        "options": [
          "A relatively high $K_{a}$ and a very dilute solution.",
          "A very small $K_{a}$ and a concentrated solution.",
          "A strong acid solution.",
          "A solution at absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the acid is strong enough or dilute enough that $x$ is more than 5% of the initial concentration, the approximation is invalid."
      },

        "options": [
          "Find pOH, then subtract from 14 to find pH.",
          "Take the negative log to get pH directly.",
          "Multiply by $K_{w}$.",
          "Add 7 to the result."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ICE table for a base gives $[OH^{-}]$. You must convert this to pOH and then to pH (or use $K_{w}$ to find $[H^{+}]$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the initial concentration of a weak acid affect the equilibrium pH and the percent ionization?",

          "pH increases, percent ionization increases.",

          "Both remain constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More acid produces more ions (lower pH), but the ratio of ions to unionized molecules (percent ionization) actually drops in more concentrated solutions."
