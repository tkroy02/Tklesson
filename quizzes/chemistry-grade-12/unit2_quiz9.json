    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of strain occurs when the bond angles in a cycloalkane deviate from the ideal tetrahedral angle of $109.5^{\\circ}$?",
        "options": [
          "Angle strain (Baeyer strain)",
          "Torsional strain",
          "Steric strain",
          "Van der Waals strain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Baeyer proposed that the stability of cycloalkanes depends on how much the internal angles of the ring deviate from the ideal $sp^{3}$ angle of $109.5^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which cycloalkane experiences the highest degree of angle strain due to its $60^{\\circ}$ internal bond angles?",
        "options": [
          "Cyclopropane",
          "Cyclobutane",
          "Cyclopentane",
          "Cyclohexane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In cyclopropane, the carbon atoms form an equilateral triangle. The $60^{\\circ}$ angles are significantly smaller than the ideal $109.5^{\\circ}$, creating intense angle strain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Besides angle strain, cyclopropane and cyclobutane also suffer from high energy due to 'eclipsed' $C-H$ bonds. What is this type of strain called?",
        "options": [
          "Torsional strain",
          "Angle strain",
          "Ring-flip strain",
          "Electronic strain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Torsional strain occurs when the electron pairs in $C-H$ bonds on adjacent carbons repel each other because they are forced into an eclipsed conformation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do rings larger than cyclopropane minimize torsional strain?",
        "options": [
          "By puckering (adopting non-planar shapes)",
          "By increasing their internal bond angles to $120^{\\circ}$",
          "By losing hydrogen atoms to form double bonds",
          "By rotating around the $C-C$ bonds until they are linear"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Molecules like cyclobutane and cyclopentane twist or 'pucker' out of a flat plane to move their $C-H$ bonds out of the eclipsed position, even if it slightly increases angle strain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Based on the heat of combustion per $CH_{2}$ unit, which of the following cycloalkanes is considered the most stable (strain-free)?",
        "options": [
          "Cyclohexane",
          "Cyclopentane",
          "Cyclobutane",
          "Cycloheptane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cyclohexane is considered strain-free because its chair conformation allows for ideal $109.5^{\\circ}$ angles and perfectly staggered $C-H$ bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the internal bond angle of a planar (flat) regular pentane ring, and how does it compare to the tetrahedral angle?",
        "options": [
          "$108^{\\circ}$; it is very close to $109.5^{\\circ}$",
          "$90^{\\circ}$; it is much smaller than $109.5^{\\circ}$",
          "$120^{\\circ}$; it is larger than $109.5^{\\circ}$",
          "$60^{\\circ}$; it is much smaller than $109.5^{\\circ}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A flat cyclopentane has angles of $108^{\\circ}$, which is nearly ideal. However, a flat cyclopentane would have massive torsional strain from 10 eclipsed $C-H$ bonds, so it puckers into an 'envelope' shape."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The term 'Banana Bonds' (bent bonds) is often used to describe the bonding in which highly strained molecule?",
        "options": [
          "Cyclopropane",
          "Cyclohexane",
          "n-Butane",
          "Benzene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In cyclopropane, the $sp^{3}$ orbitals cannot point directly at each other to form a linear $\\sigma$ bond. Instead, they overlap at an angle, creating weaker, 'bent' bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why did Baeyer's original theory incorrectly predict that cyclohexane would be more strained than cyclopentane?",
        "options": [
          "He assumed that all cycloalkane rings were planar (flat)",
          "He didn't know that carbon was tetrahedral",
          "He calculated the angles for triangles incorrectly",
          "He ignored the existence of hydrogen atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Baeyer assumed rings were flat polygons. A flat hexagon has angles of $120^{\\circ}$, which would be strained; however, cyclohexane is actually puckered, allowing it to reach $109.5^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the 'envelope' conformation of cyclopentane, how many carbon atoms stay in one plane while the other flips up?",
        "options": [
          "Four",
          "Three",
          "Two",
          "Five"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the envelope shape, four carbons are roughly coplanar, and one carbon is out of the plane to reduce eclipsing interactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Total ring strain is the sum of which two primary factors?",
        "options": [
          "Angle strain and Torsional strain",
          "Steric strain and Ionic strain",
          "Nuclear strain and Kinetic strain",
          "Bond length and Electronegativity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ring strain is the total potential energy increase caused by bond angle distortion and the eclipsing of neighboring bonds."
