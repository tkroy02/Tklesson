        "question": "How does the hydroxyl group ($-OH$) influence the reactivity of the benzene ring toward electrophiles?",
        "options": [
          "It is strongly activating and ortho/para-directing",
          "It is strongly deactivating and meta-directing",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intramolecular H-bonding in the ortho isomer reduces its ability to H-bond with water or other molecules, making it steam-volatile compared to the para isomer."
