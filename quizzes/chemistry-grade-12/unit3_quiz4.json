    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of organic mechanisms, what is an 'electrophile'?",
        "options": [
          "An electron-deficient species that seeks a pair of electrons",
          "An electron-rich species that seeks a positive center",
          "A neutral molecule that remains unreactive",
          "A species that donates a pair of electrons to form a bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrophiles ('electron-lovers') are species like $H^{+}$ or $Br^{\\delta+}$ that are attracted to areas of high electron density, such as the pi bond in an alkene."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which part of the alkene molecule acts as the nucleophile during the first step of electrophilic addition?",
        "options": [
          "The pi (π) bond",
          "The sigma (σ) bond",
          "The hydrogen atoms",
          "The carbon nuclei"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pi bond consists of a cloud of electrons above and below the plane of the molecule, making it easily accessible to attacking electrophiles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the reactive intermediate formed after the electrophile attacks the double bond but before the nucleophile attaches?",
        "options": [
          "Carbocation",
          "Carbanion",
          "Free radical",
          "Transition state only"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the pi bond breaks to form a bond with the electrophile, the other carbon atom in the former double bond is left with a positive charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Markovnikov’s Rule, when a hydrogen halide (HX) adds to an unsymmetrical alkene, where does the hydrogen atom attach?",
        "options": [
          "To the carbon atom that already has the greater number of hydrogen atoms",
          "To the carbon atom that has the fewer number of hydrogen atoms",
          "To the carbon atom with the most substituents",
          "To the halogen atom"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen attaches to the carbon with more hydrogens to ensure the formation of the more stable carbocation intermediate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following carbocations is the most stable?",
        "options": [
          "Tertiary (3°)",
          "Secondary (2°)",
          "Primary (1°)",
          "Methyl"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkyl groups are electron-donating and stabilize the positive charge through the inductive effect and hyperconjugation. More alkyl groups equals more stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction of propene with HBr, why is 2-bromopropane the major product?",
        "options": [
          "It proceeds via a more stable secondary carbocation",
          "It proceeds via a more stable primary carbocation",
          "Bromine is too large to fit on the end of the chain",
          "The reaction is controlled by steric hindrance"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The secondary carbocation (charge on the middle carbon) is more stable than the primary one, leading to the preferred formation of the 2-substituted product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during the second step of the electrophilic addition mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "A nucleophile donates an electron pair to the carbocation",
          "The pi bond reforms",
          "A second electrophile attacks the molecule",
          "The molecule breaks into two smaller pieces"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "After the carbocation is formed, it quickly reacts with a nucleophile (like $Br^{-}$ or $Cl^{-}$) to form the final saturated product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the addition of $Br_{2}$ to an alkene, how does the non-polar bromine molecule become electrophilic?",
        "options": [
          "The high electron density of the pi bond induces a dipole in the $Br-Br$ bond",
          "UV light breaks the $Br-Br$ bond into ions",
          "The bromine molecule is naturally polar",
          "A catalyst is always required to polarize bromine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As $Br_{2}$ approaches the pi cloud, the electrons in the $Br-Br$ bond are repelled, creating a $\\delta+$ end that acts as the electrophile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an electrophilic addition reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogenation of ethene to ethane",
          "Combustion of methane",
          "Substitution of ethane with chlorine",
          "Cracking of decane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The addition of $H_{2}$ across a double bond is a classic addition reaction, though it often requires a metal catalyst like Nickel or Platinum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does a 'curly arrow' represent in an organic reaction mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "The movement of a pair of electrons",
          "The movement of a single atom",
          "The direction of heat flow",
          "The movement of a single electron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In mechanism diagrams, a double-headed curly arrow shows the path of an electron pair, usually from a nucleophile or a bond to an electrophile."
