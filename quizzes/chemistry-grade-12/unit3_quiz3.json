    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Cis-trans and E-Z isomerism",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the fundamental requirement for a molecule to exhibit geometric (cis-trans) isomerism?",
        "options": [
          "Restricted rotation around a bond and two different groups on each carbon of the double bond",
          "The presence of at least one triple bond",
          "Four identical groups attached to the double bond",
          "A minimum of six carbon atoms in the parent chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Geometric isomerism requires restricted rotation (usually a double bond) and that each carbon involved in the bond is attached to two distinct groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a 'cis' isomer of an alkene, where are the identical or high-priority groups located relative to the double bond?",
        "options": [
          "On the same side of the double bond",
          "On opposite sides of the double bond",
          "Attached to the same carbon atom",
          "At a 180° angle from each other"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The term 'cis' comes from Latin meaning 'on this side,' indicating the groups are on the same side of the plane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule can exist as a pair of geometric isomers?",
        "options": [
          "But-2-ene",
          "But-1-ene",
          "Ethene",
          "2-methylpropene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In but-2-ene, each double-bonded carbon has a hydrogen and a methyl group. In but-1-ene and 2-methylpropene, one of the carbons has two identical groups (hydrogens or methyls), which prevents geometric isomerism."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When the groups on the double bond are all different, which naming system is used to assign configuration based on atomic number priority?",
        "options": [
          "E-Z system",
          "Cis-trans system",
          "R-S system",
          "Alpha-beta system"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The E-Z system uses Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules to handle complex alkenes where cis-trans labels are ambiguous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the E-Z system, if the two groups of higher priority are on opposite sides of the double bond, the isomer is labeled as:",
        "options": [
          "(E)",
          "(Z)",
          "Cis",
          "Trans"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "(E) stands for 'entgegen' (German for 'opposite')."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, which atom would have the highest priority?",
        "options": [
          "Bromine ($Z=35$)",
          "Chlorine ($Z=17$)",
          "Fluorine ($Z=9$)",
          "Carbon ($Z=6$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Priority is assigned based on the atomic number; the higher the atomic number, the higher the priority."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the physical properties of cis and trans isomers typically compare?",
        "options": [
          "They have different physical properties such as boiling points and melting points",
          "They have identical physical properties",
          "Only their colors are different",
          "They only differ in their molecular mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because they have different spatial arrangements, their dipole moments and packing efficiency differ, leading to different boiling and melting points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does trans-but-2-ene typically have a higher melting point than cis-but-2-ene?",
        "options": [
          "The trans isomer is more symmetrical and packs better in a crystal lattice",
          "The trans isomer is more polar",
          "The trans isomer has more carbon atoms",
          "The cis isomer has stronger covalent bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "High symmetry in trans isomers leads to better packing in the solid state, requiring more energy to break the lattice."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A molecule is named (Z)-1-bromo-1-chloroprop-1-ene. Where are the highest priority groups located?",
        "options": [
          "On the same side of the double bond",
          "On opposite sides of the double bond",
          "On the same carbon atom",
          "Diagonally across from each other"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "(Z) stands for 'zusammen' (German for 'together'), meaning the high-priority groups are on the same side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following can be considered a 'stereoisomer'?",
        "options": [
          "Geometric isomers",
          "Chain isomers",
          "Positional isomers",
          "Functional group isomers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stereoisomers have the same bond connectivity but different arrangements of atoms in space. Geometric isomers are a type of stereoisomer."
