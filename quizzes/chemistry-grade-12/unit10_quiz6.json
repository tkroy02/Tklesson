      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In which of the following reactions is the entropy change ($\\Delta S$) expected to be most positive?",
        "options": [
          "$CaCO_{3}(s) \\rightarrow CaO(s) + CO_{2}(g)$",
          "$N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \\rightarrow 2NH_{3}(g)$",
          "$H_{2}O(l) \\rightarrow H_{2}O(s)$",
          "$Ag^{+}(aq) + Cl^{-}(aq) \\rightarrow AgCl(s)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The decomposition of calcium carbonate produces a mole of gas from a solid, which represents a massive increase in the number of microstates and disorder."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the expected sign of $\\Delta S$ for the reaction: $2SO_{2}(g) + O_{2}(g) \\rightarrow 2SO_{3}(g)$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are 3 moles of gaseous reactants producing only 2 moles of gaseous product. A decrease in the number of gas moles leads to a decrease in entropy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a gas is compressed at constant temperature, the entropy of the gas:",

          "Stays the same",
          "Doubles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reducing the volume limits the space in which molecules can move, reducing the number of available positional microstates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Predict the sign of $\\Delta S$ for the process: $I_{2}(s) \\rightarrow I_{2}(g)$ at $25$°C.",

        "options": [
          "The change in the number of moles of gas.",
          "The change in the color of the reactants.",
          "The total mass of the products.",
          "The speed of the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gases have much higher absolute entropies than solids or liquids, so changes in gas moles usually dominate the overall $\\Delta S$ calculation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $HCl(g) + NH_{3}(g) \\rightarrow NH_{4}Cl(s)$, the entropy change is:",

          "Positive",
          "Zero",
          "Indeterminate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Two moles of gas react to form one mole of solid; this is a drastic increase in order, resulting in a negative entropy change."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\Delta n_{gas}$ (moles of gaseous products minus moles of gaseous reactants) is positive, what is likely true of $\\Delta S$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta S > 0$",
          "$\\Delta S < 0$",
          "$\\Delta S = 0$",
          "$\\Delta S$ will be exactly equal to $\\Delta n_{gas}$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An increase in the quantity of gas molecules typically results in a positive change in the system's entropy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the entropy change when a liquid crystallizes into a solid?",
        "options": [
          "The system becomes more ordered, so $\\Delta S$ is negative.",
          "The system becomes more disordered, so $\\Delta S$ is positive.",
          "The entropy remains constant because no chemical bonds are broken.",
          "The entropy increases because heat is released."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Freezing/crystallization reduces the freedom of movement of the particles, leading to a more ordered state."

          "Impossible to determine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dissolving a liquid in a solvent to form an aqueous solution increases the volume available to the solute molecules, increasing disorder."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the entropy of a system during an isothermal expansion into a vacuum?",

          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains zero.",
          "It becomes negative."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even though temperature is constant, the gas molecules now have a larger volume to occupy, which increases the number of positional microstates."
