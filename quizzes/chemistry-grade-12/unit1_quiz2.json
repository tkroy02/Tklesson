        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To form four equivalent single bonds, one $2s$ orbital and three $2p$ orbitals mix to form four equivalent $sp^{3}$ hybrid orbitals."

        "question": "How many unhybridized $p$ orbitals remain on a carbon atom that has undergone $sp$ hybridization?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $sp$ hybridization, one $s$ and one $p$ orbital mix, leaving two $p$ orbitals unchanged and available for $\\pi$ bonding."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first bond between two atoms is always a $\\sigma$ bond; any additional bonds in a multiple bond system are $\\pi$ bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the characteristic bond angle associated with $sp$ hybridized carbon atoms, such as those found in ethyne (acetylene)?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethene contains a double bond; the carbons involved must be $sp^{2}$ hybridized to provide the trigonal planar framework and one $\\pi$ bond."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to a single bond, a triple bond is:",
        "options": [
          "Shorter and stronger",
          "Longer and stronger",
          "Shorter and weaker",
          "Longer and weaker"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased electron density between nuclei in a triple bond pulls the atoms closer together and requires more energy to break."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the valence bond model, which orbital overlap is responsible for the formation of a $\\sigma$ bond in $\\text{H}-\\text{H}$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen has only a $1s$ orbital; therefore, the bond in $\\text{H}_{2}$ is formed by the head-on overlap of two $s$ orbitals."

        "question": "The percent 's-character' in an $sp^{3}$ hybrid orbital is:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An $sp^{3}$ orbital is made from one $s$ part and three $p$ parts, so the $s$ contribution is $1/4$, or $25\\%$."
