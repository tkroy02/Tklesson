      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which set of reagents is typically required for the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne?",
        "options": [
          "H2SO4, HgSO4, and H2O",
          "NaOH and H2O",
          "Ni and H2",
          "KMnO4 and KOH"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkynes require a mercuric ion catalyst ($Hg^{2+}$) along with aqueous sulfuric acid to facilitate the addition of water across the triple bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the unstable intermediate initially formed during the hydration of an alkyne?",

          "Enol",
          "Alkane",
          "Dihaloalkane",
          "Carboxylic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The initial addition of water produces an 'enol'—a molecule with a hydroxyl group (-OH) directly attached to a carbon-carbon double bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The process by which an enol rapidly rearranges into a more stable carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone) is called:",
        "options": [
          "Tautomerism",
          "Isomerization",
          "Polymerization",
          "Hydrogenation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Keto-enol tautomerism is a chemical equilibrium that involves the migration of a proton and the shifting of a double bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the only alkyne that yields an aldehyde upon hydration?",
        "options": [
          "Ethyne",
          "Propyne",
          "But-1-yne",
          "But-2-yne"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethyne (acetylene) produces ethanal (acetaldehyde). All other alkynes follow Markovnikov's rule, placing the oxygen on an internal carbon to form a ketone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When propyne ($CH3-C≡CH$) is hydrated, what is the final major product?",
        "options": [
          "Propanone (Acetone)",
          "Propanal",
          "Propan-1-ol",
          "Propan-2-ol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Following Markovnikov's rule, the -OH group attaches to the second carbon. The resulting enol tautomerizes to the ketone, propanone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the keto-enol equilibrium for simple carbonyls, which form is generally much more stable and favored?",
        "options": [
          "Keto form (Carbonyl)",
          "Enol form (Vinyl alcohol)",
          "Both are equally stable",
          "The stability depends on the pressure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The C=O double bond is significantly stronger than the C=C double bond, making the keto form energetically preferred in most cases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the $Hg^{2+}$ catalyst during the reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It coordinates with the triple bond to make it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water",
          "It is consumed to form a stable mercury-carbon salt",
          "It acts as an oxidizing agent to turn the alkyne into an acid",
          "It prevents the reaction from occurring too quickly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The mercuric ion acts as a Lewis acid, forming a complex with the pi electrons of the alkyne, which facilitates the addition of water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydration of but-2-yne ($CH3-C≡C-CH3$) yields which product?",
        "options": [
          "Butanone",
          "Butanal",
          "Butan-2-ol",
          "Butane-2,3-dione"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydration of a symmetrical internal alkyne like but-2-yne yields butanone. Since both carbons are equivalent, Markovnikov's rule results in the same product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the change in hybridization of the carbon atoms during the complete conversion of an alkyne to a ketone?",
        "options": [
          "sp to sp2 and sp3",
          "sp2 to sp3",
          "sp3 to sp",
          "No change in hybridization occurs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The triple-bonded carbons (sp) transition through an enol stage (sp2) to the final ketone, where the carbonyl carbon is sp2 and the adjacent carbon becomes sp3."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the hydration of alkynes industrially important?",
        "options": [
          "It provides a pathway to synthesize ketones and aldehydes from petroleum-derived alkynes",
          "It is the primary way to create drinking water",
          "It converts toxic alkynes into harmless alkanes",
          "It is used to manufacture synthetic diamonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This reaction is a key synthetic tool for producing various carbonyl compounds used as solvents and chemical intermediates."
