    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the first step in a general nucleophilic addition reaction under neutral or basic conditions?",
        "options": [
          "The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon.",
          "The carbonyl oxygen is protonated by an acid.",
          "The pi bond breaks and the oxygen leaves the molecule.",
          "The carbon-hydrogen bond in the aldehyde breaks."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In basic or neutral conditions, the strong nucleophile directly attacks the δ+ carbon, pushing the pi electrons onto the oxygen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During nucleophilic addition, the hybridisation of the carbonyl carbon changes from:",
        "options": [
          "$sp^2$ to $sp^3$",
          "$sp^3$ to $sp^2$",
          "$sp$ to $sp^2$",
          "$sp^2$ to $sp$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carbon starts as trigonal planar ($sp^2$) and becomes tetrahedral ($sp^3$) once the nucleophile has bonded and the pi bond is gone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following generally makes an aldehyde more reactive than a ketone toward nucleophilic attack?",
        "options": [
          "Less steric hindrance and less inductive stabilization of the positive charge.",
          "The presence of a hydrogen atom which acts as a better leaving group.",
          "Aldehydes have a more electronegative oxygen atom than ketones.",
          "Ketones are more polar than aldehydes, making them less reactive."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aldehydes are less sterically hindered (hydrogen is small) and have fewer alkyl groups to stabilize the δ+ charge on the carbon via induction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Acid catalysis increases the reactivity of a carbonyl group by:",
        "options": [
          "Protonating the oxygen, making the carbon more electrophilic.",
          "Protonating the nucleophile, making it stronger.",
          "Increasing the steric bulk around the carbon.",
          "Removing the oxygen atom as a molecule of water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Protonation of the oxygen places a full positive charge on the group, which greatly increases the electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the intermediate formed after the nucleophile attacks a neutral carbonyl group?",
        "options": [
          "An alkoxide ion",
          "A carbocation",
          "A carbanion",
          "An enol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The attack results in a tetrahedral intermediate where the oxygen carries a negative charge ($R_2C(Nu)O^-$), known as an alkoxide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the presence of a strong nucleophile like a Grignard reagent, which step is usually the rate-determining step?",
        "options": [
          "The attack of the nucleophile on the carbonyl carbon.",
          "The protonation of the oxygen atom during workup.",
          "The formation of the magnesium salt.",
          "The dissociation of the R-Mg bond."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The initial nucleophilic attack that breaks the stable $C=O$ double bond is typically the slowest, rate-determining step."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following substituents on a benzene ring would increase the reactivity of benzaldehyde toward nucleophiles?",
        "options": [
          "A nitro group ($-NO_2$)",
          "A methyl group ($-CH_3$)",
          "A methoxy group ($-OCH_3$)",
          "An amino group ($-NH_2$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electron-withdrawing groups like $-NO_2$ pull electron density away from the carbonyl carbon, making it more positive and more reactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the bond angle around the carbon atom after a successful nucleophilic addition?",
        "options": [
          "It decreases from ~120° to ~109.5°.",
          "It increases from ~109.5° to ~120°.",
          "It remains unchanged at 120°.",
          "It becomes 180°."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The change from trigonal planar geometry to tetrahedral geometry results in a decrease of the bond angle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Nucleophilic addition reactions are characteristic of carbonyl compounds because the $C=O$ bond is:",
        "options": [
          "Polar and unsaturated.",
          "Non-polar and saturated.",
          "Ionic and weak.",
          "Triple bonded and stable."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The polarity creates an electrophilic site, and the unsaturation (pi bond) allows for addition without losing a substituent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is propanone less reactive than ethanal?",
        "options": [
          "Propanone has more steric hindrance and more inductive electron donation.",
          "Ethanal has a higher molar mass.",
          "Propanone is a liquid while ethanal is a gas.",
          "Ethanal can form hydrogen bonds but propanone cannot."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The two methyl groups in propanone provide more steric bulk and push more electron density toward the carbon (reducing its δ+) than the single methyl group in ethanal."
