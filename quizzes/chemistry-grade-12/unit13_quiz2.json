        "answer": "A",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To maintain charge balance, a neutral neutron becomes a positive proton and a negative electron (the beta particle)."

          "Positron radiation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gamma rays are high-energy photons with no mass or charge, allowing them to pass through materials that stop alpha and beta particles."

        "question": "Positron emission (${\\beta}^{+}$) is most likely to occur in nuclei that are:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nuclei with too many protons convert a proton into a neutron and a positron to increase stability."

          "Gamma emission"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both electron capture and positron emission convert a proton to a neutron, decreasing Z by 1 and keeping A the same."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens during an annihilation event?",

          "Two hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium.",
          "A neutron decays into a proton."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a particle and its antiparticle (electron and positron) meet, they are converted entirely into energy."

          "+2",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A beta-minus particle is a high-speed electron ejected from the nucleus."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Gamma emission usually occurs because:",
        "options": [
          "The nucleus is in an excited state following other types of decay.",
          "The nucleus has too many neutrons.",
          "The N/Z ratio is too low.",
          "The strong nuclear force has failed."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gamma rays carry away excess energy to bring a 'daughter' nucleus to its ground state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If an isotope undergoes alpha decay, how does its position on the periodic table change?",
        "options": [
          "It moves two places to the left.",
          "It moves one place to the right.",
          "It moves one place to the left.",
          "It does not change position."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The loss of two protons reduces the atomic number by 2."
