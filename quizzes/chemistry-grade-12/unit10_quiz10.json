    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which term in the Gibbs equation ($\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$) dictates the temperature dependence of a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The $-T\\Delta S$ term",
          "The $\\Delta H$ term",
          "The $E_{a}$ (Activation Energy)",
          "The stoichiometry of the gas moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since temperature ($T$) is a multiplier for the entropy change, the influence of entropy on spontaneity increases as the temperature rises."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction has $\\Delta H > 0$ and $\\Delta S > 0$, under what condition is it spontaneous?",
        "options": [
          "At high temperatures.",
          "At low temperatures.",
          "At all temperatures.",
          "Never spontaneous."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For an endothermic reaction with increasing entropy, the $-T\\Delta S$ term must be large enough to overcome the positive $\\Delta H$, which happens at high $T$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction that is spontaneous at low temperatures but non-spontaneous at high temperatures must have:",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta H < 0$ and $\\Delta S < 0$",
          "$\\Delta H > 0$ and $\\Delta S > 0$",
          "$\\Delta H < 0$ and $\\Delta S > 0$",
          "$\\Delta H > 0$ and $\\Delta S < 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reaction is driven by enthalpy (exothermic), but as $T$ increases, the negative entropy change makes the $-T\\Delta S$ term positive and eventually dominant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the spontaneity of a reaction where $\\Delta H$ is negative and $\\Delta S$ is positive?",
        "options": [
          "Spontaneous at all temperatures.",
          "Non-spontaneous at all temperatures.",
          "Spontaneous only at low temperatures.",
          "Spontaneous only at high temperatures."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In this case, both enthalpy (release of energy) and entropy (increase in disorder) favor spontaneity, making $\\Delta G$ negative regardless of $T$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the 'transition temperature' where a reaction changes from non-spontaneous to spontaneous, which is true?",
        "options": [
          "$T = \\Delta H / \\Delta S$",
          "$\\Delta G = 1$",
          "$\\Delta S = 0$",
          "$T = \\Delta S / \\Delta H$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the transition point, the reaction is at equilibrium ($\\Delta G = 0$). Solving $0 = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$ gives $T = \\Delta H / \\Delta S$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these processes is spontaneous only above a certain temperature?",
        "options": [
          "The melting of ice at 1 atm.",
          "The freezing of water at 1 atm.",
          "The combustion of methane.",
          "The formation of $HCl$ from its elements."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Melting is endothermic ($\\Delta H > 0$) and increases entropy ($\\Delta S > 0$). It only occurs spontaneously when $T > 273.15\\ K$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is non-spontaneous at all temperatures, the signs of $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ must be:",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta H > 0$ and $\\Delta S < 0$",
          "$\\Delta H < 0$ and $\\Delta S > 0$",
          "$\\Delta H > 0$ and $\\Delta S > 0$",
          "$\\Delta H < 0$ and $\\Delta S < 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An endothermic reaction that also decreases entropy will always have a positive $\\Delta G$, making it non-spontaneous under any thermal conditions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the freezing of liquid water, which term dominates at temperatures below $0$°C?",
        "options": [
          "The enthalpy term ($\\Delta H$)",
          "The entropy term ($-T\\Delta S$)",
          "The volume term ($P\\Delta V$)",
          "The internal energy ($U$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Freezing is exothermic. At low temperatures, the enthalpy term is larger than the entropy term, allowing the process to be spontaneous."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As $T$ approaches absolute zero ($0\\ K$), the spontaneity of a reaction is determined almost entirely by:",
        "options": [
          "The enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$)",
          "The entropy change ($\\Delta S$)",
          "The gas constant ($R$)",
          "The reaction quotient ($Q$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the equation $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, if $T$ is near zero, the $T\\Delta S$ term vanishes, leaving $\\Delta G \\approx \\Delta H$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is spontaneous at high temperatures but its $K$ value decreases as temperature rises, what must be true?",
        "options": [
          "This scenario is thermodynamically impossible.",
          "The reaction is exothermic.",
          "The reaction is endothermic.",
          "The reaction has zero entropy change."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a reaction is spontaneous at high $T$ due to entropy ($\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ both positive), $K$ will actually increase with temperature, not decrease."
