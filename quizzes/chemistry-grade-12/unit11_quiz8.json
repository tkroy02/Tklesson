    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "At the equivalence point of a strong acid-strong base titration at 25°C, the pH is:",
        "options": [
          "7.0",
          "Greater than 7.0",
          "Less than 7.0",
          "Equal to the pKa of the acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Neither the conjugate base of the strong acid nor the conjugate acid of the strong base undergoes hydrolysis, resulting in a neutral solution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, what is true at the half-equivalence point?",
        "options": [
          "pH = $pK_{a}$",
          "pH = 7.0",
          "pOH = $pK_{a}$",
          "The solution is purely conjugate base."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the halfway point, half the acid has been converted to conjugate base. $[HA] = [A^{-}]$, so pH = $pK_{a}$ according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the pH at the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration greater than 7?",
        "options": [
          "The conjugate base produced undergoes hydrolysis with water.",
          "Strong bases always dominate the final pH.",
          "The weak acid is not fully neutralized.",
          "The indicator causes a basic shift."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The salt formed contains the conjugate base of the weak acid, which reacts with water to produce $OH^{-}$ ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the titration curve of a weak base with a strong acid?",
        "options": [
          "The pH starts high and the equivalence point is below 7.",
          "The pH starts low and the equivalence point is above 7.",
          "The pH starts high and the equivalence point is exactly 7.",
          "The pH starts low and the equivalence point is exactly 7."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A base starts at a high pH. When titrated with a strong acid, the resulting conjugate acid causes the equivalence point to be acidic (pH < 7)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the 'buffer region' of a titration curve?",
        "options": [
          "The relatively flat part of the curve before the equivalence point.",
          "The sharp vertical climb at the equivalence point.",
          "The horizontal line at the end of the titration.",
          "The point where pH = 7."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In weak acid/base titrations, the region around the half-equivalence point resists pH change because both members of the conjugate pair are present."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many equivalence points would be observed in the titration of $H_{3}PO_{4}$ with $NaOH$?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "1",
          "2",
          "4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phosphoric acid is triprotic, meaning it has three ionizable protons, each with its own distinct equivalence point (though the third is often hard to detect)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The steepness of the pH change at the equivalence point is greatest for which type of titration?",
        "options": [
          "Strong acid - Strong base",
          "Weak acid - Strong base",
          "Strong acid - Weak base",
          "Weak acid - Weak base"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strong-strong titrations produce the most dramatic 'inflection point' or vertical section, making the equivalence point very easy to detect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a titration curve shows an initial pH of 1.0, what can be inferred about the analyte?",
        "options": [
          "It is a strong acid.",
          "It is a weak acid.",
          "It is a strong base.",
          "It is a buffer."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A pH of 1.0 corresponds to a $0.1$ M concentration of a strong acid ($10^{-1}$), whereas a weak acid of the same concentration would have a higher pH."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which point on a titration curve is used to determine the $pK_{b}$ of a weak base?",
        "options": [
          "The half-equivalence point (where pOH = $pK_{b}$)",
          "The equivalence point",
          "The initial pH",
          "The end point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Similar to acids, at the halfway mark of a base titration, $[B] = [BH^{+}]$, which means pOH = $pK_{b}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When titrating a weak acid, as the $K_{a}$ of the acid decreases (weaker acid):",
        "options": [
          "The initial pH increases and the vertical section becomes shorter.",
          "The initial pH decreases and the vertical section becomes longer.",
          "The equivalence point pH decreases.",
          "The half-equivalence point pH decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weaker acids start at a higher pH and have a less defined 'break' at the equivalence point, making them harder to titrate accurately."
