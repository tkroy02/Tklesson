    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the acidity of simple alcohols compare to that of water?",
        "options": [
          "Most alcohols are slightly weaker acids than water",
          "Most alcohols are significantly stronger acids than water",
          "Alcohols are as acidic as hydrochloric acid",
          "Alcohols are strong bases, not acids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With the exception of methanol, most alcohols have $pK_a$ values between 16 and 18, making them slightly less acidic than water ($pK_a = 15.7$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the conjugate base of an alcohol ($R-OH$) called?",
        "options": [
          "Alkoxide ion ($R-O^-$)",
          "Hydroxyl ion ($OH^-$)",
          "Carboxyl ion ($R-COO^-$)",
          "Alkyl radical ($R\\cdot$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When an alcohol loses a proton ($H^+$), the resulting anion is an alkoxide ion, which is a very strong base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the trend in acidity for primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols?",
        "options": [
          "Primary > Secondary > Tertiary",
          "Tertiary > Secondary > Primary",
          "Secondary > Primary > Tertiary",
          "They all have identical acidity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Primary alcohols are the most acidic because their alkoxide ions are less hindered and more easily solvated. Tertiary alcohols are the least acidic due to the electron-donating effect of three alkyl groups destabilizing the negative charge."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Alcohols react with active metals like sodium ($Na$) to produce which gas?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen ($H_2$)",
          "Oxygen ($O_2$)",
          "Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$)",
          "Methane ($CH_4$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reaction $2R-OH + 2Na \\rightarrow 2R-ONa + H_2$ is a redox reaction where the acidic hydrogen is reduced to hydrogen gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the presence of electron-donating alkyl groups (inductive effect) decrease the acidity of an alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "They increase the electron density on the oxygen, destabilizing the resulting negative charge",
          "They make the $O-H$ bond stronger",
          "They prevent the alcohol from dissolving in water",
          "They neutralize the acid immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkyl groups push electron density toward the oxygen. In an alkoxide ion, this extra density makes the negative charge more intense and less stable, making the alcohol less likely to donate a proton."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which reagent is strong enough to completely deprotonate an alcohol to form an alkoxide?",
        "options": [
          "Sodium hydride ($NaH$)",
          "Sodium chloride ($NaCl$)",
          "Dilute hydrochloric acid ($HCl$)",
          "Sodium bicarbonate ($NaHCO_3$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sodium hydride contains the $H^-$ ion, a very strong base that reacts with the $H^+$ of the alcohol to form $H_2$ gas and the alkoxide salt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the $pK_a$ value of ethanol approximately?",
        "options": [
          "16",
          "5",
          "7",
          "-2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethanol has a $pK_a$ of about 16, which is typical for a simple primary alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Alcohols generally do not react with which of the following due to their low acidity?",
        "options": [
          "Aqueous sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$)",
          "Metallic potassium ($K$)",
          "Sodium amide ($NaNH_2$)",
          "Grignard reagents ($R-MgX$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alcohols are weaker acids than water. Therefore, the equilibrium of an alcohol reacting with $NaOH$ (which produces water as the conjugate acid) favors the reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the product of the reaction between methanol and sodium metal?",
        "options": [
          "Sodium methoxide and hydrogen",
          "Sodium hydroxide and methane",
          "Sodium carbonate and water",
          "Methyl ether and sodium"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reaction is $2CH_3OH + 2Na \\rightarrow 2CH_3ONa + H_2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which effect describes how polar solvents stabilize the alkoxide ion, thereby increasing acidity?",
        "options": [
          "Solvation effect",
          "Resonance effect",
          "Tyndall effect",
          "Greenhouse effect"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Solvation involves solvent molecules surrounding the ion to disperse the charge. Smaller alkoxides (primary) are better solvated and thus more stable than bulky ones (tertiary)."
