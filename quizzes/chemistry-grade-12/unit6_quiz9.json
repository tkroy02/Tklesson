    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which process is used to prepare an aldehyde from a primary alcohol without further oxidation to a carboxylic acid?",
        "options": [
          "Controlled oxidation using PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate) in $CH_{2}Cl_{2}$.",
          "Oxidation using acidified $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$ under reflux.",
          "Reduction using $LiAlH_{4}$ in dry ether.",
          "Hydration using concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that stops at the aldehyde stage because it is used in anhydrous conditions (no water to form the hydrate necessary for further oxidation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Oxidation of a secondary alcohol like propan-2-ol yields:",
        "options": [
          "A ketone (Propanone)",
          "An aldehyde (Propanal)",
          "A carboxylic acid (Propanoic acid)",
          "An alkene (Propene)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones. Since ketones lack the necessary $H$ atom on the carbonyl carbon, they do not easily oxidize further."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the product of the ozonolysis ($O_{3}$ followed by $Zn/H_{2}O$) of 2-methylbut-2-ene?",
        "options": [
          "Propanone and Ethanal",
          "Ethanal and Methanal",
          "Butanal and Methanal",
          "Propanone and Propanal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ozonolysis cleaves the $C=C$ double bond. 2-methylbut-2-ene splits into a three-carbon ketone (propanone) and a two-carbon aldehyde (ethanal)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the preparation of an aldehyde using $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$ and a primary alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "The aldehyde must be distilled off as soon as it forms.",
          "The reaction must be carried out under reflux to ensure completion.",
          "A large excess of the oxidizing agent must be used.",
          "The reaction must be kept at 0°C to prevent evaporation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because aldehydes have lower boiling points than the alcohols they are made from, distilling them immediately prevents them from remaining in contact with the oxidant and turning into carboxylic acids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The hydration of ethyne ($C_{2}H_{2}$) using $H_{2}SO_{4}$ and $HgSO_{4}$ produces:",
        "options": [
          "Ethanal",
          "Ethanol",
          "Ethanoic acid",
          "Ethene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkynes undergo acid-catalyzed hydration. Ethyne is unique because it is the only alkyne that produces an aldehyde; all higher alkynes produce ketones."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydration of propyne ($CH_{3}C≡CH$) in the presence of $Hg^{2+}$ ions yields:",
        "options": [
          "Propanone",
          "Propanal",
          "Propan-1-ol",
          "Propanoic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Following Markovnikov's rule, the hydroxyl group adds to the more substituted carbon, leading to an enol that tautomerizes into a ketone (propanone)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with acetyl chloride ($CH_{3}COCl$) and $AlCl_{3}$ produces:",
        "options": [
          "Acetophenone",
          "Benzaldehyde",
          "Benzyl alcohol",
          "Chlorobenzene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acylation introduces an acyl group ($-COR$) onto the benzene ring, forming an aromatic ketone like acetophenone."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do tertiary alcohols not produce aldehydes or ketones when treated with $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$?",
        "options": [
          "They lack a hydrogen atom on the carbon bearing the $-OH$ group.",
          "They are too sterically hindered for the oxidant to approach.",
          "They are immediately dehydrated to alkenes.",
          "They are already in their most oxidized form."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation of an alcohol to a carbonyl requires the loss of the $-OH$ hydrogen and the hydrogen on the alpha-carbon. Tertiary alcohols have no alpha-hydrogen."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Stephen's reduction involves the conversion of a nitrile ($-CN$) to an aldehyde using:",
        "options": [
          "$SnCl_{2}$ and $HCl$, followed by hydrolysis.",
          "$LiAlH_{4}$ in dry ether.",
          "$NaBH_{4}$ in ethanol.",
          "$H_{2}$ gas with a $Pd$ catalyst."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stephen's reduction specifically reduces nitriles to imines, which are then hydrolyzed to form aldehydes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a common method for the industrial production of methanal?",
        "options": [
          "Catalytic oxidation of methanol over a silver or iron-molybdenum oxide catalyst.",
          "Reduction of formic acid.",
          "Hydration of methyne.",
          "Ozonolysis of ethene."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Industrial methanal (formaldehyde) is produced by the large-scale catalytic oxidation/dehydrogenation of methanol."
