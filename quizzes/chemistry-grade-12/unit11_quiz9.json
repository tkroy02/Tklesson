    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "An acid-base indicator is chemically defined as:",
        "options": [
          "A weak organic acid or base whose conjugate forms have different colors.",
          "A strong acid that reacts with the analyte.",
          "An inert dye that changes color based on temperature.",
          "A metal catalyst that speeds up neutralization."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Indicators are weak acids ($HIn$). When they lose a proton to become $In^{-}$, the electronic structure changes, resulting in a different absorbed wavelength of light."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'end point' of a titration is the point where:",
        "options": [
          "The indicator changes color.",
          "The moles of acid exactly equal the moles of base.",
          "The pH is exactly 7.0.",
          "The burette is empty."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The end point is an experimental observation (color change), whereas the equivalence point is a theoretical stoichiometric requirement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a titration to be accurate, the indicator should be chosen such that its $pK_{a}$ is:",
        "options": [
          "Close to the pH at the equivalence point.",
          "Exactly 7.0.",
          "As far from the equivalence point as possible.",
          "Equal to the pKa of the analyte acid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Indicators change color over a range of approximately $pK_{In} \\pm 1$. To minimize titration error, this range must overlap with the steep vertical section of the titration curve."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which indicator would be most appropriate for a strong acid-strong base titration (equivalence point pH = 7)?",
        "options": [
          "Bromothymol blue ($pK_{a} \\approx 7.1$)",
          "Methyl orange ($pK_{a} \\approx 3.4$)",
          "Phenolphthalein ($pK_{a} \\approx 9.4$)",
          "Thymol blue ($pK_{a} \\approx 1.6$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bromothymol blue is ideal because its transition range surrounds the neutral equivalence point of 7."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is phenolphthalein often used for weak acid-strong base titrations?",
        "options": [
          "The equivalence point occurs at a basic pH (above 7).",
          "It changes color at pH 7.0.",
          "It reacts with the weak acid to make it stronger.",
          "It is the only indicator that is colorless."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak acid-strong base titrations have a basic equivalence point due to conjugate base hydrolysis; phenolphthalein's range (8.2–10) matches this."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a highly acidic solution, what is the dominant form of the indicator $HIn \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + In^{-}$?",
        "options": [
          "$HIn$ (Acid form)",
          "$In^{-}$ (Conjugate base form)",
          "$OH^{-}$",
          "The solution remains colorless regardless of the indicator."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Le Chatelier's Principle, high $[H^{+}]$ shifts the equilibrium to the left, favoring the protonated acid form ($HIn$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the typical pH range over which an indicator changes color?",
        "options": [
          "About 2 pH units.",
          "Exactly 1 pH unit.",
          "7 pH units.",
          "0.1 pH units."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The human eye typically perceives a color change when the ratio of the two forms changes from 1:10 to 10:1, which spans roughly 2 pH units."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If methyl orange (range 3.1–4.4) is used for a weak acid-strong base titration, the titration will end:",
        "options": [
          "Too early (before the equivalence point).",
          "Too late (after the equivalence point).",
          "At the exact equivalence point.",
          "It will never change color."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the equivalence point for a weak acid is basic (>7) and methyl orange changes color at an acidic pH, the color change will occur long before enough base has been added."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding a 'universal indicator'?",
        "options": [
          "It is a mixture of several different indicators.",
          "It only works for strong acids.",
          "It has only one $pK_{a}$ value.",
          "It cannot be used in aqueous solutions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Universal indicators combine multiple indicators to provide a continuous spectrum of colors across a wide pH range (typically 1–14)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which indicator would be best for titrating $NH_{3}$ with $HCl$ (equivalence point pH $\\approx$ 5)?",
        "options": [
          "Methyl red ($pK_{a} \\approx 5.0$)",
          "Phenolphthalein ($pK_{a} \\approx 9.4$)",
          "Alizarin yellow ($pK_{a} \\approx 11.0$)",
          "Bromothymol blue ($pK_{a} \\approx 7.1$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A weak base titrated with a strong acid results in an acidic equivalence point. Methyl red's range (4.2–6.2) is the best fit."
