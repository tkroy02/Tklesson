    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Factors affecting buffer strength and preparation",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines 'buffer capacity'?",
        "options": [
          "The amount of acid or base a buffer can neutralize before the pH changes significantly.",
          "The maximum volume of a buffer solution that can be stored in a glass container.",
          "The speed at which a buffer reacts with a strong base.",
          "The total concentration of water molecules in the buffer solution."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Buffer capacity refers to the magnitude of the resistance to pH change. It is limited by the actual moles of the conjugate acid and base present."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these buffers would have the highest capacity for resisting pH changes?",
        "options": [
          "1.0 M $CH_{3}COOH$ and 1.0 M $CH_{3}COONa$",
          "0.1 M $CH_{3}COOH$ and 0.1 M $CH_{3}COONa$",
          "0.01 M $CH_{3}COOH$ and 0.01 M $CH_{3}COONa$",
          "0.1 M $HCl$ and 0.1 M $NaCl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair provide more 'reservoir' to neutralize added hydronium or hydroxide ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A buffer's capacity is exhausted when:",
        "options": [
          "One of the buffer components is completely consumed by a reaction.",
          "The pH reaches exactly 7.0.",
          "The temperature of the solution increases by 5°C.",
          "Water is added to the solution."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once the added strong acid or base exceeds the moles of the available conjugate component, the solution can no longer resist pH changes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you need a buffer to be specifically more resistant to added base, how should you adjust the components?",
        "options": [
          "Increase the concentration of the weak acid ($HA$).",
          "Increase the concentration of the conjugate base ($A^{-}$).",
          "Decrease the total concentration of the buffer.",
          "Add a strong base to the mixture."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The weak acid component is responsible for neutralizing added $OH^{-}$. Increasing $[HA]$ increases the capacity to handle base additions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the optimal ratio of $[Base]/[Acid]$ for a buffer to have maximum capacity in both directions?",
        "options": [
          "1:1",
          "10:1",
          "1:10",
          "2:1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 1:1 ratio ensures that the buffer is equally capable of neutralizing both acids and bases and places the pH exactly at the $pK_{a}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the total concentration of a buffer affect its pH (assuming the ratio $[A^{-}]/[HA]$ remains constant)?",
        "options": [
          "The pH remains the same, but the capacity changes.",
          "The pH increases as concentration increases.",
          "The pH decreases as concentration increases.",
          "Both pH and capacity remain constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH depends on the ratio. Concentration determines how much 'stress' (added acid/base) the buffer can handle."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When preparing a buffer using a pH meter, what is the common method involving a weak acid?",
        "options": [
          "Partial neutralization of the weak acid with a strong base.",
          "Adding equal volumes of any two random acids.",
          "Adding a strong acid to a strong base until the pH is 7.",
          "Boiling a weak acid until it reaches the desired pH."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding $NaOH$ to a weak acid converts a portion of the acid into its conjugate base, creating the required conjugate pair in situ."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would result in a buffer with very low capacity?",
        "options": [
          "A ratio of $[Base]/[Acid]$ that is 100:1.",
          "High concentrations of both components.",
          "A pH that is equal to the $pK_{a}$.",
          "A temperature of 25°C."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A ratio beyond 10:1 or 1:10 means one component is very sparse, making the buffer easily overwhelmed in one direction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A student adds $0.05$ moles of $NaOH$ to a buffer containing $0.03$ moles of $HF$ and $0.10$ moles of $F^{-}$. What happens?",
        "options": [
          "The buffer capacity is exceeded.",
          "The pH remains constant.",
          "The pH decreases slightly.",
          "The $F^{-}$ concentration decreases."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are only $0.03$ moles of $HF$ to neutralize the $0.05$ moles of $OH^{-}$. The buffer is overwhelmed, and the pH will spike."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is it important to choose a buffer with a $pK_{a}$ close to the target pH for biological experiments?",
        "options": [
          "To ensure the highest possible capacity for the given total concentration.",
          "To prevent the acid from denaturing proteins.",
          "To make the buffer visible under a microscope.",
          "To allow the buffer to act as a catalyst."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Maximum capacity occurs at $pH = pK_{a}$. The closer these values are, the more efficiently the buffer resists changes in both directions."
