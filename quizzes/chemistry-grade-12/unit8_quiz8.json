        "question": "What is the defining characteristic of condensation polymerization compared to addition polymerization?",
        "options": [
          "A small molecule, such as water or $HCl$, is eliminated during the reaction.",
          "It only involves monomers with carbon-carbon double bonds.",
          "The empirical formula of the polymer is identical to the monomer.",
          "The reaction occurs instantly without the need for functional groups."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condensation polymerization involves the reaction of functional groups, resulting in the formation of a polymer and the loss of a small byproduct molecule."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bifunctionality is required so that the molecule can link to other monomers at both ends, allowing the chain to grow in both directions."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The amide link ($-CONH-$) in synthetic polyamides is chemically the same as the peptide bond that holds amino acids together in proteins."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the starting materials for the production of Nylon-6,6?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nylon-6,6 is named for the six carbon atoms present in both the diamine and the dicarboxylic acid monomers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule is typically eliminated when a dicarboxylic acid reacts with a diamine?",

          "Water ($H_{2}O$)",
          "Hydrogen ($H_{2}$)",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $OH$ from the carboxylic acid and a $H$ from the amine group combine to form water as the byproduct."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does 'step-growth' polymerization differ from 'chain-growth' regarding monomer consumption?",
        "options": [
          "Monomers are consumed early in the reaction to form dimers and trimers.",
          "Monomers are added one by one only to the end of a single growing chain.",
          "Monomers only react once a free-radical initiator is added.",
          "The monomer concentration remains high until the very end of the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In step-growth, any two species (monomers, dimers, or oligomers) can react with each other, meaning monomers disappear quickly as they form small chains that later link up."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Kevlar is a high-strength polyamide. Its strength is primarily due to:",

          "Strong ionic bonds between the polymer layers.",
          "The presence of triple bonds in the polymer backbone.",
          "The loss of $HCl$ instead of water during synthesis."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The aromatic rings make the chains rigid, and the $N-H$ and $C=O$ groups allow for intense hydrogen bonding between adjacent chains."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to a condensation polymer during acid hydrolysis?",
        "options": [
          "The ester or amide linkages break, reforming the original monomers.",
          "The polymer chain becomes longer and more branched.",
          "The polymer turns into an addition polymer.",
          "Nothing, as condensation polymers are chemically inert."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Condensation polymers are biodegradable/reactive because the ester and amide links can be broken down by water in the presence of an acid or base catalyst."
