    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to IUPAC rules, what is the first and most critical step in naming an organic molecule?",
        "options": [
          "Identify the longest continuous carbon chain",
          "Identify all the functional groups",
          "Number the carbon atoms from right to left",
          "Alphabetize the substituents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parent name of the molecule is determined by the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms. This establishes the base name of the structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When numbering the parent carbon chain, how should the direction be chosen if substituents are present?",
        "options": [
          "Give the substituents the lowest possible locant numbers",
          "Always start from the end with the most hydrogens",
          "Always start from the left side of the drawing",
          "Give the substituents the highest possible locant numbers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You must number the chain starting from the end that reaches a substituent first, ensuring the numerical 'addresses' (locants) are as small as possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a molecule contains three identical methyl substituents, which prefix is used before the name 'methyl'?",
        "options": [
          "tri-",
          "di-",
          "tetra-",
          "poly-"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The numerical prefixes are: di- for 2, tri- for 3, tetra- for 4, and penta- for 5 identical groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When assembling the final IUPAC name, in what order should the names of different substituents be listed?",
        "options": [
          "Alphabetical order",
          "Numerical order of their locants",
          "In order of increasing size",
          "In order of decreasing complexity"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substituents are listed alphabetically (e.g., ethyl before methyl). Note that prefixes like di- and tri- are ignored during alphabetization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In IUPAC nomenclature, what punctuation is used to separate a number (locant) from a word?",
        "options": [
          "A hyphen (-)",
          "A comma (,)",
          "A semicolon (;)",
          "A space"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hyphens are used to separate numbers from letters (e.g., 2-methylhexane)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct punctuation used to separate two numbers from each other in an IUPAC name?",
        "options": [
          "A comma (,)",
          "A hyphen (-)",
          "A colon (:)",
          "A period (.)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Commas are used between numbers to list multiple locants (e.g., 2,2-dimethylbutane)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When identifying the longest chain, what happens if two different chains have the same maximum length?",
        "options": [
          "Choose the chain with the greater number of substituents",
          "Choose the chain that is drawn horizontally",
          "Choose the chain with the fewest number of substituents",
          "The chains are always considered identical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The IUPAC tie-breaker rule states that the parent chain should be the one with the most branches (substituents) to simplify naming."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The parent name for a five-carbon saturated chain is:",
        "options": [
          "Pentane",
          "Hexane",
          "Butane",
          "Propane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The prefixes for 1-6 carbons are: meth-, eth-, prop-, but-, pent-, and hex-."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is ignored when determining the alphabetical order of substituents?",
        "options": [
          "Numerical prefixes like 'di-', 'tri-', and 'tetra-'",
          "The first letter of the substituent name",
          "The prefix 'iso-'",
          "The entire name of the substituent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While 'iso-' is usually considered part of the name for alphabetization, multiplicity prefixes like di- and tri- are strictly ignored."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What suffix is added to the end of a substituent name to indicate it is an alkyl group (a branch)?",
        "options": [
          "-yl",
          "-one",
          "-ol",
          "-oic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A substituent group derived from an alkane by removing one hydrogen atom is named by changing the suffix '-ane' to '-yl'."
