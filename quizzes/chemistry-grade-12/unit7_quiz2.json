    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which reagent is most commonly used to oxidize a primary alcohol directly to a carboxylic acid?",
        "options": [
          "Acidified $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$ under reflux",
          "PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate) in $CH_{2}Cl_{2}$",
          "$NaBH_{4}$ in ethanol",
          "Concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$ at 170°C"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To reach the carboxylic acid stage, a strong oxidant and reflux conditions are needed to ensure the intermediate aldehyde is further oxidized."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The hydrolysis of a nitrile ($-CN$) using aqueous acid and heat produces a carboxylic acid and which byproduct?",
        "options": [
          "Ammonium ion ($NH_{4}^{+}$)",
          "Nitrogen gas ($N_{2}$)",

          "Hydroxylamine ($NH_{2}OH$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "During acid hydrolysis, the nitrogen atom of the nitrile is released as an ammonium salt (or ammonia, which then reacts with the acid)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct sequence for preparing a carboxylic acid from an alkyl halide via a Grignard reagent?",
        "options": [
          "1. $Mg$/dry ether, 2. $CO_{2}$, 3. $H_{3}O^{+}$",

          "1. $KCN$, 2. $LiAlH_{4}$, 3. $H_{2}O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The alkyl halide is converted to a Grignard reagent, which then attacks $CO_{2}$ to form a carboxylate salt; acid workup yields the final acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The oxidation of alkylbenzenes (like toluene) with hot, alkaline $KMnO_{4}$ always produces which acid, regardless of the chain length (as long as there is an alpha-H)?",

          "Benzoic acid",
          "Phenylethanoic acid",

          "Phenol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vigorous oxidation of an alkyl side chain on a benzene ring 'chews' the chain down until only the carboxyl group remains attached to the ring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydrolysis of an ester under acidic conditions yields a carboxylic acid and:",
        "options": [
          "An alcohol",
          "An aldehyde",
          "A ketone",
          "An ether"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ester hydrolysis is the reverse of esterification, breaking the ester into its original acid and alcohol components."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these starting materials would produce propanoic acid upon treatment with acidified potassium dichromate?",

          "Propan-1-ol",
          "Propan-2-ol",
          "Propanone",
          "Methyl ethanoate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Propan-1-ol is a primary alcohol; its complete oxidation leads to the corresponding three-carbon carboxylic acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the advantage of using the Grignard method over the Nitrile method to prepare an acid from an alkyl halide?",
        "options": [
          "The Grignard method works well with tertiary alkyl halides, while nitriles do not (due to $S_{N}2$ limitations).",
          "The Grignard method is safe to perform in the presence of water.",
          "The Grignard method does not change the number of carbon atoms.",
          "The Grignard method is a single-step reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrile synthesis requires an $S_{N}2$ displacement, which fails for tertiary halides. The Grignard reagent is easily formed from tertiary halides and then reacted with $CO_{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Ozonolysis of a symmetrical alkene like hex-3-ene followed by an oxidative workup ($H_{2}O_{2}$) produces:",

          "Hexanoic acid",
          "Butanoic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Under oxidative ozonolysis conditions, the alkene is cleaved, and the resulting fragments are oxidized to carboxylic acids."

          "Dehydration by fungi."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acetobacter bacteria use oxygen from the air to oxidize ethanol into ethanoic acid (vinegar)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which gas is evolved when a nitrile is hydrolyzed with aqueous sodium hydroxide?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In alkaline hydrolysis, the nitrogen is released as ammonia gas, while the acid stays in solution as a sodium carboxylate salt."
