        "question": "Why are most addition polymers, such as poly(ethene), considered non-biodegradable?",
        "options": [
          "The carbon-carbon backbone is chemically inert and lacks polar bonds for microbial attack.",
          "They are too dense for water to penetrate.",
          "They contain toxic additives that kill decomposers.",
          "They are too large to be recognized by enzymes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Addition polymers consist of strong, non-polar C-C bonds that enzymes in bacteria cannot easily recognize or break down."

          "They require no energy to manufacture."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The presence of polar linkages (ester or amide) makes these polymers susceptible to chemical or biological degradation."
      },

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Plastics take centuries to degrade, wasting the petroleum resources used to make them and requiring vast amounts of land."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What toxic gas is produced during the incineration of Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen chloride ($HCl$)",
          "Helium ($He$)",
          "Pure oxygen ($O_{2}$)",
          "Methane ($CH_{4}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The chlorine content in PVC is released as acidic $HCl$ gas during burning, which must be removed to prevent acid rain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does 'feedstock recycling' differ from mechanical recycling?",
        "options": [
          "It chemically breaks polymers back down into monomers or small molecules.",
          "It involves sorting, washing, and melting plastics into pellets.",
          "It involves turning plastics into organic compost.",
          "It is the process of burning plastic for heat energy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Feedstock recycling uses chemical processes to recover the raw chemical building blocks rather than just reshaping the plastic."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a significant challenge when recycling mixed plastic waste?",
        "options": [
          "Different polymers are often incompatible and produce poor-quality materials if melted together.",
          "Plastics become radioactive after one use.",
          "Recycling plastic requires more water than the Earth possesses.",
          "Mixed plastics always turn into liquid at room temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Mixing different types of plastic (e.g., PET and PE) results in a weak, brittle product because the polymers do not mix at a molecular level."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary goal of developing 'bioplastics'?",
        "options": [
          "To produce polymers from renewable plant-based sources that are often biodegradable.",
          "To make plastics that are strong enough to replace steel in buildings.",
          "To create plastics that can be eaten by humans as a food source.",
          "To eliminate the need for any chemical catalysts during production."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bioplastics aim to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and improve end-of-life options through biodegradability or composting."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the recycling symbol, what does the number inside the triangle represent?",

          "The type of polymer resin used in the product.",
          "The number of times the plastic has been recycled.",
          "The toxicity level of the plastic on a scale of 1 to 7.",
          "The number of years it takes for the plastic to decompose."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Resin Identification Code (1-7) tells recyclers which specific polymer the item is made from to assist in sorting."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of 'energy recovery' from plastic waste?",

          "Burning plastics in specialized incinerators to produce steam or electricity.",
          "Using solar panels to power a recycling plant.",

          "Burying plastic to prevent it from absorbing heat from the sun."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy recovery (incineration) utilizes the high calorific value of plastics to generate power, though it releases $CO_{2}$."
      },

          "Hydrogenation",
          "Cracking",
          "Addition"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrolysis uses water (often with an acid or base catalyst) to break the ester linkages and reform the original diol and dicarboxylic acid."
