    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Functional group identification using infrared radiation",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What physical change occurs in a molecule when it absorbs infrared radiation?",
        "options": [
          "The chemical bonds vibrate (stretch or bend).",
          "Electrons are promoted to higher energy levels.",
          "The nuclear spin state changes.",
          "The molecule is ionized into fragments."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IR radiation has the right energy to cause bonds to vibrate. The specific frequency of vibration depends on the mass of the atoms and the strength of the bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an IR spectrum, the y-axis is typically measured in percentage of:",
        "options": [
          "Transmittance",
          "Absorbance",
          "Reflectance",
          "Concentration"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IR spectra usually plot Transmittance (%). A 'dip' or 'peak' pointing downwards represents light being absorbed by the sample."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the characteristic IR absorption of an alcohol's hydroxyl ($-OH$) group?",
        "options": [
          "A broad, strong peak between 3200–3600 $cm^{-1}$.",
          "A sharp, narrow peak at 1700 $cm^{-1}$.",
          "A weak peak at 2100 $cm^{-1}$.",
          "A broad peak between 1000–1200 $cm^{-1}$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $-OH$ group in alcohols is broad due to hydrogen bonding and appears at the high-frequency end of the spectrum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A strong, sharp peak at approximately 1700–1750 $cm^{-1}$ indicates the presence of which functional group?",
        "options": [
          "Carbonyl ($C=O$)",
          "Hydroxyl ($-OH$)",
          "Carbon-carbon double bond ($C=C$)",
          "Nitrile ($-C≡N$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $C=O$ stretch is one of the most distinct and useful signals in IR spectroscopy, appearing as a strong 'v' shape in the middle of the spectrum."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the IR spectrum of a carboxylic acid differ from that of a simple alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "The acid has an extremely broad $-OH$ peak that overlaps with the $C-H$ region and a $C=O$ peak.",
          "The acid lacks a peak in the 3000 $cm^{-1}$ region.",
          "The acid peak is much sharper and narrower than the alcohol peak.",
          "There is no difference; they look identical."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carboxylic acids exhibit a very wide 'hump' for the $-OH$ (2500–3300 $cm^{-1}$) and a distinct $C=O$ peak near 1710 $cm^{-1}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The region of an IR spectrum below 1500 $cm^{-1}$ is unique to every molecule and is known as the:",
        "options": [
          "Fingerprint region",
          "Functional group region",
          "Saturation zone",
          "Blank space"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the high-frequency region tells us the groups present, the fingerprint region contains complex patterns unique to a specific molecule, allowing for definitive identification."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which unit is used on the x-axis of an IR spectrum to represent the frequency of light?",
        "options": [
          "Wavenumbers ($cm^{-1}$)",
          "Nanometers ($nm$)",
          "Hertz ($Hz$)",
          "Parts per million ($ppm$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Wavenumbers ($cm^{-1}$) are the reciprocal of the wavelength and are proportional to energy and frequency."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following bonds would absorb at the highest wavenumber?",
        "options": [
          "$C-H$",
          "$C-C$",
          "$C-Cl$",
          "$C-O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bonds involving very light atoms (like Hydrogen) vibrate at much higher frequencies than bonds between heavier atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is IR spectroscopy often used to monitor the progress of a reaction, such as the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone?",
        "options": [
          "The disappearance of the $-OH$ peak and appearance of the $C=O$ peak can be easily seen.",
          "IR can measure the exact mass of the product formed.",
          "IR can tell you the position of the carbon atoms in the chain.",
          "IR is the only way to see if a catalyst is working."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since different functional groups have distinct 'signatures,' IR is perfect for seeing when one group is converted into another."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A molecule shows a sharp peak at 2250 $cm^{-1}$. This likely indicates the presence of:",
        "options": [
          "A nitrile ($C≡N$) or alkyne ($C≡C$) group.",
          "An aromatic ring.",
          "An ether linkage.",
          "A primary amine."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Triple bonds are strong and stiff, causing them to absorb in the 'triple-bond region' around 2100–2250 $cm^{-1}$."
