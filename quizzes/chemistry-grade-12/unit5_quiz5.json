      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the major organic product when ethanol is heated with concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$ at $180^{\\circ}C$?",
        "options": [
          "Ethene",
          "Diethyl ether",
          "Ethane",
          "Ethanal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At high temperatures, concentrated sulfuric acid acts as a dehydrating agent, removing water to form an alkene. (Note: At $140^{\\circ}C$, the major product would be the ether)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of alcohol is generally resistant to oxidation by common reagents like $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$?",
        "options": [
          "Tertiary (3°) alcohol",
          "Primary (1°) alcohol",
          "Secondary (2°) alcohol",
          "Methanol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tertiary alcohols do not have a hydrogen atom on the carbinol carbon ($C-OH$), which is required for the oxidation mechanism to proceed without breaking $C-C$ bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Oxidation of a primary alcohol with a strong oxidizing agent like acidified $KMnO_{4}$ primarily yields:",
        "options": [
          "A carboxylic acid",
          "An aldehyde",
          "A ketone",
          "An ester"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Primary alcohols are first oxidized to aldehydes, but under strong conditions, they are immediately further oxidized to carboxylic acids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To stop the oxidation of a primary alcohol at the aldehyde stage, which reagent should be used?",
        "options": [
          "Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)",
          "Acidified $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$",
          "Hot $KMnO_{4}$",
          "Concentrated $HNO_{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "PCC is a specialized oxidant that allows for the controlled oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes without continuing to the carboxylic acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the organic product of the oxidation of propan-2-ol?",
        "options": [
          "Propanone",
          "Propanal",
          "Propanoic acid",
          "Propene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Propan-2-ol is a secondary alcohol. Oxidation of secondary alcohols yields ketones."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Zaitsev's Rule, the dehydration of butan-2-ol will primarily yield:",
        "options": [
          "But-2-ene",
          "But-1-ene",
          "Cyclobutane",
          "But-1,3-diene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dehydration follows Zaitsev's rule, favoring the more highly substituted (and thus more stable) alkene."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the ease of dehydration of alcohols?",
        "options": [
          "Tertiary > Secondary > Primary",
          "Primary > Secondary > Tertiary",
          "They all dehydrate at the same rate",
          "Primary alcohols cannot be dehydrated"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tertiary alcohols dehydrate most easily because they form the most stable carbocation intermediates during the mechanism."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What color change is observed when acidified Potassium Dichromate ($K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$) successfully oxidizes an alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "Orange to Green",
          "Purple to Colorless",
          "Blue to Red",
          "Colorless to Pink"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The dichromate ion ($Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-}$, orange) is reduced to the chromium(III) ion ($Cr^{3+}$, green)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Lucas Test is used to distinguish between alcohol types. Which alcohol reacts almost instantly at room temperature to form a cloudy layer?",
        "options": [
          "Tertiary alcohol",
          "Secondary alcohol",
          "Primary alcohol",
          "Methanol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Lucas reagent ($HCl/ZnCl_{2}$) converts alcohols to alkyl chlorides. Tertiary alcohols form the chloride immediately due to high carbocation stability."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an alcohol reacts with a carboxylic acid in the presence of an acid catalyst, the product is:",

          "An ester",
          "An ether",
          "An aldehyde",
          "An alkane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is known as Fischer Esterification, where an alcohol and an acid combine to form an ester and water."
