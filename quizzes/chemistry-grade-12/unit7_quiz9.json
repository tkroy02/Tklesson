        "question": "Which of the following is a significant difference between addition polymers and condensation polymers?",
        "options": [
          "Condensation polymers are generally biodegradable via hydrolysis.",

          "Addition polymers are held together by ester linkages."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because condensation polymers contain polar linkages like esters or amides, they can be chemically broken down by water, unlike the non-polar C-C backbone of addition polymers."

          "Methanol ($CH_{3}OH$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While diacids produce water, using the more reactive diacyl chlorides results in the elimination of $HCl$ gas."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Kevlar is an exceptionally strong polyamide used in bulletproof vests. It is made from:",

          "Aliphatic chains with 10 carbons each.",
          "Single monomers containing both an alcohol and an acid group.",
          "Propene and vinyl chloride."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The aromatic rings in Kevlar allow for rigid, flat polymer chains that can form extensive hydrogen bonds, leading to its extreme strength."

          "Contains only one type of repeating unit.",
          "Cannot be recycled.",
          "Is produced by a single catalyst."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Copolymers involve the alternating or random arrangement of different monomer units, such as a diacid and a diol."

          "Bifunctional (having two functional groups).",
          "Saturated hydrocarbons.",
          "Gaseous at room temperature.",
          "Inorganic compounds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each monomer must have at least two reactive sites (like a -COOH at both ends) to allow the chain to grow in both directions."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The repeat unit of a polymer is:",

          "The total number of monomers in one chain."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The repeat unit shows the atoms contributed by the monomers after the small molecule (like water) has been removed."
