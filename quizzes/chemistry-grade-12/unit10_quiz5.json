    "topic": "Concept of disorder, microstates, and entropy measurement",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best defines thermodynamic entropy ($S$)?",
        "options": [
          "A measure of the dispersal of energy and the disorder of a system.",
          "The total heat content of a system at constant pressure.",
          "The energy available to do useful work.",
          "The average kinetic energy of the particles in a system."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Entropy is a measure of the number of possible microstates (arrangements) available to a system; more arrangements mean higher entropy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which state of matter for a given substance generally has the highest entropy?",
        "options": [
          "Gas",
          "Liquid",
          "Solid",
          "Crystalline"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gaseous particles have the greatest freedom of motion and the highest number of possible positions/velocities, resulting in the highest entropy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the Third Law of Thermodynamics, what is the entropy of a perfect crystal at $0\\ K$?",
        "options": [
          "Zero",
          "Infinite",
          "1.0 J/mol·K",
          "$-273$ J/mol·K"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At absolute zero ($0\\ K$), all molecular motion stops in a perfect crystal, meaning there is only one possible microstate, so $S = 0$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the standard units for entropy ($S$)?",
        "options": [
          "J/mol·K",
          "kJ/mol",
          "kJ/K",
          "Calories"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Entropy is measured in Joules per mole-Kelvin. Note that unlike enthalpy, it is usually expressed in Joules (J) rather than kiloJoules (kJ)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following processes results in an increase in entropy ($\\Delta S > 0$)?",
        "options": [
          "Sublimation (Solid $\\rightarrow$ Gas)",
          "Freezing (Liquid $\\rightarrow$ Solid)",
          "Condensation (Gas $\\rightarrow$ Liquid)",
          "Deposition (Gas $\\rightarrow$ Solid)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sublimation involves a phase change from a highly ordered solid to a highly disordered gas, which significantly increases entropy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that for any spontaneous process:",
        "options": [
          "The total entropy of the universe must increase.",
          "The entropy of the system must decrease.",
          "The enthalpy of the universe must remain constant.",
          "The temperature of the system must increase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While the entropy of a system can decrease, the sum of the entropy changes of the system and the surroundings must be positive for spontaneity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does increasing the temperature affect the entropy of a substance?",
        "options": [
          "Entropy increases.",
          "Entropy decreases.",
          "Entropy remains constant.",
          "Entropy becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy and the range of possible velocities for particles, thereby increasing the number of microstates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the formula for calculating the standard entropy change of a reaction ($\\Delta S^{\\circ}_{rxn}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta S^{\\circ} = \\sum S^{\\circ}(products) - \\sum S^{\\circ}(reactivos)$",
          "$\\Delta S^{\\circ} = \\sum S^{\\circ}(reactivos) - \\sum S^{\\circ}(productos)$",
          "$\\Delta S^{\\circ} = q / T$",
          "$\\Delta S^{\\circ} = \\Delta H / T$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like enthalpy, the change in entropy is a state function calculated as the sum of the absolute entropies of products minus reactants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule would you expect to have a higher standard entropy: $CH_{4}(g)$ or $C_{3}H_{8}(g)$?",
        "options": [
          "$C_{3}H_{8}(g)$",
          "$CH_{4}(g)$",
          "They have the same entropy because both are gases.",
          "It depends on the pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Propane ($C_{3}H_{8}$) is a larger, more complex molecule with more atoms, allowing for more vibrational and rotational modes (microstates)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Dissolving a solid solute into a liquid solvent usually:",
        "options": [
          "Increases the entropy of the system.",
          "Decreases the entropy of the system.",
          "Has no effect on entropy.",
          "Reduces the temperature to absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a solid dissolves, its highly ordered crystal lattice is broken down, and the particles disperse throughout the solvent, increasing disorder."
