    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the Solubility Product Constant ($K_{sp}$) represent for a saturated solution of a salt?",
        "options": [
          "The equilibrium between the undissolved solid and its dissolved ions.",
          "The speed at which a solid dissolves in water.",
          "The total mass of the salt that can dissolve in 1 Liter of water.",
          "The pH at which a salt becomes insoluble."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$K_{sp}$ is the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of a sparingly soluble ionic compound."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the salt $Ag_{2}CO_{3}$, which is the correct $K_{sp}$ expression?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{sp} = [Ag^{+}]^{2}[CO_{3}^{2-}]$",
          "$K_{sp} = [Ag^{+}][CO_{3}^{2-}]$",
          "$K_{sp} = [2Ag^{+}][CO_{3}^{2-}]$",
          "$K_{sp} = \\frac{[Ag^{+}]^{2}[CO_{3}^{2-}]}{[Ag_{2}CO_{3}]}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coefficients in the balanced dissociation equation ($Ag_{2}CO_{3} \\rightleftharpoons 2Ag^{+} + CO_{3}^{2-}$) become the exponents in the $K_{sp}$ expression."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If 's' represents the molar solubility of $CaF_{2}$ in mol/L, what is the correct relationship to its $K_{sp}$?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{sp} = 4s^{3}$",
          "$K_{sp} = s^{2}$",
          "$K_{sp} = 2s^{2}$",
          "$K_{sp} = 27s^{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$CaF_{2} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + 2F^{-}$. If $[Ca^{2+}] = s$, then $[F^{-}] = 2s$. $K_{sp} = (s)(2s)^{2} = 4s^{3}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Common Ion Effect' on solubility?",
        "options": [
          "Adding an ion already present in the equilibrium decreases the solubility of the salt.",
          "Adding an ion already present in the equilibrium increases the solubility of the salt.",
          "The solubility remains constant regardless of other ions.",
          "Only strong acids can change the solubility of a salt."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Le Chatelier's Principle, increasing the concentration of a product ion shifts the equilibrium to the left (toward the solid)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Under what condition will a precipitate form when two solutions are mixed?",
        "options": [
          "$Q_{sp} > K_{sp}$",
          "$Q_{sp} < K_{sp}$",
          "$Q_{sp} = K_{sp}$",
          "$Q_{sp} = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the ion product ($Q$) exceeds the solubility product constant ($K$), the solution is supersaturated and a precipitate will form until $Q = K$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The solubility of which salt would increase significantly if the pH of the solution was lowered (made more acidic)?",
        "options": [
          "$CaCO_{3}$",
          "$AgCl$",
          "$PbI_{2}$",
          "$KNO_{3}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Salts with basic anions (like $CO_{3}^{2-}$) react with $H^{+}$ ions, which reduces the anion concentration and shifts the solubility equilibrium toward more dissolution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which salt is the most soluble based on the following $K_{sp}$ values (all are $XY$ type salts)?",
        "options": [
          "Salt A: $K_{sp} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$",

          "Salt C: $K_{sp} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-15}$",
          "Salt D: $K_{sp} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-20}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For salts with the same stoichiometry, a larger $K_{sp}$ indicates a higher molar solubility."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate the molar solubility of $AgCl$ if its $K_{sp}$ is $1.8 \\times 10^{-10}$.",
        "options": [
          "$1.34 \\times 10^{-5}$ M",
          "$1.8 \\times 10^{-10}$ M",
          "$9.0 \\times 10^{-11}$ M",
          "$1.34 \\times 10^{-10}$ M"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For $AgCl$, $K_{sp} = s^{2}$. Therefore, $s = \\sqrt{1.8 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 1.34 \\times 10^{-5}$ M."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the $K_{sp}$ of a salt if the temperature of the solution is increased?",
        "options": [
          "It changes (usually increases for endothermic dissolution).",
          "It remains exactly the same as it is a constant.",
          "It always decreases.",
          "It becomes zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like all equilibrium constants, $K_{sp}$ is temperature-dependent. Most salts dissolve endothermically, so $K_{sp}$ increases with temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the process of 'selective precipitation', which salt precipitates first as a reagent is added?",
        "options": [
          "The salt that requires the lowest concentration of the added ion to reach its $K_{sp}$.",
          "The salt with the highest molar mass.",
          "The salt with the highest $K_{sp}$ value.",
          "The salt that forms a brightly colored precipitate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Precipitation begins as soon as $Q$ exceeds $K$. The salt that reaches this threshold first (at the lowest concentration of titrant) will precipitate first."
