    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the polarity of the carbonyl group?",
        "options": [
          "The oxygen is partially negative (δ-) and the carbon is partially positive (δ+).",
          "The carbon is partially negative (δ-) and the oxygen is partially positive (δ+).",
          "The bond is non-polar because carbon and oxygen have similar electronegativities.",
          "The bond is purely ionic."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen is significantly more electronegative than carbon, pulling electron density toward itself and creating a permanent dipole."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do aldehydes and ketones have higher boiling points than alkanes of similar molar mass?",
        "options": [
          "They experience dipole-dipole interactions.",
          "They can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with each other.",
          "They have stronger London dispersion forces due to the oxygen atom.",
          "They exist as dimers in the gas phase."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The polar carbonyl group allows for dipole-dipole attractions between molecules, which are stronger than the London dispersion forces found in alkanes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement correctly compares the boiling points of propanal and propan-1-ol?",
        "options": [
          "Propan-1-ol has a higher boiling point because it can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds.",
          "Propanal has a higher boiling point because the $C=O$ bond is more polar than the $C-O$ bond.",
          "They have identical boiling points because they have the same number of carbons.",
          "Propanal has a higher boiling point due to its trigonal planar geometry."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alcohols can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which are much stronger than the dipole-dipole forces in aldehydes, leading to significantly higher boiling points."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Small aldehydes and ketones (like acetone) are miscible in water because:",
        "options": [
          "They can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.",
          "They react chemically with water to form stable salts.",
          "They are non-polar and follow the 'like dissolves like' rule for water.",
          "They can form hydrogen bonds with other carbonyl molecules."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While they cannot hydrogen bond with themselves, the lone pairs on the carbonyl oxygen can accept hydrogen bonds from the $H$ atoms in water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the water solubility of aldehydes and ketones as the hydrocarbon chain length increases?",
        "options": [
          "Solubility decreases.",
          "Solubility increases.",
          "Solubility remains constant.",
          "Solubility increases only for ketones."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the non-polar alkyl chain grows longer, the hydrophobic effect dominates, making the molecule less able to dissolve in polar solvents like water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following compounds would you expect to have the lowest boiling point?",
        "options": [
          "Butane",
          "Propanal",
          "Propanone",
          "Propan-1-ol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Butane is a non-polar alkane with only weak London dispersion forces, whereas the others have dipole-dipole forces or hydrogen bonding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The boiling point of ketones is generally slightly higher than that of isomeric aldehydes because:",
        "options": [
          "Ketones have a slightly more polar carbonyl group due to two electron-donating alkyl groups.",
          "Ketones are able to form internal hydrogen bonds.",
          "Aldehydes are more chemically reactive.",
          "Ketones are always larger than aldehydes."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In ketones, two alkyl groups push electron density toward the carbonyl carbon (inductive effect), slightly increasing the polarity of the $C=O$ bond compared to aldehydes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is most likely to be a gas at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Methanal",
          "Butanal",
          "Acetone",
          "Benzaldehyde"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methanal (formaldehyde) is the simplest aldehyde with the lowest molar mass and weakest total intermolecular forces, existing as a gas at room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a carbonyl group, the carbon atom acts as a(n):",
        "options": [
          "Electrophile",
          "Nucleophile",
          "Brønsted-Lowry base",
          "Reducing agent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the oxygen pulls electrons away, the carbon atom is electron-deficient (δ+) and susceptible to attack by nucleophiles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which property is shared by both aldehydes and alcohols of similar chain length?",
        "options": [
          "Significant dipole-dipole interactions.",
          "The ability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with themselves.",
          "Identical boiling points.",
          "Lack of solubility in water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Both functional groups contain polar bonds that result in dipole-dipole interactions, though alcohols also possess hydrogen bonding."
