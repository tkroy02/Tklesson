      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the temperature decrease as you move upward in a fractional distillation column?",
        "options": [
          "To allow vapors with lower boiling points to rise and condense at specific heights",
          "To prevent the tower from melting at the top",
          "To increase the pressure at the top of the column",
          "To ensure that bitumen evaporates quickly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A temperature gradient allows different fractions to reach their specific 'dew point' and condense into liquid on trays at different levels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which process is used to convert low-quality straight-chain alkanes into high-octane branched or aromatic hydrocarbons?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reforming rearranges the molecular structure to improve fuel performance (octane rating) without necessarily breaking the chain into smaller pieces."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'Bitumen' primarily used for in industry?",

          "Premature combustion of low-octane fuel",
          "The engine is running out of oil",
          "The fuel is too pure",
          "The exhaust pipe is blocked"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Engine knocking is caused by the uneven burning of fuel (often straight-chain alkanes). Branched alkanes burn more smoothly, which is why cracking and reforming are vital."
