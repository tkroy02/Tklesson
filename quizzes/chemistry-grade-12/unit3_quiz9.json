    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many moles of hydrogen gas ($H_{2}$) are required to completely saturate one mole of an alkyne into an alkane?",
        "options": [
          "2 moles",
          "1 mole",
          "3 moles",
          "0.5 moles"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An alkyne has two pi bonds. Each pi bond requires one mole of $H_{2}$ to break, so two moles are needed for complete saturation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which catalyst and condition can be used to stop the hydrogenation of an alkyne specifically at the alkene stage?",
        "options": [
          "Lindlar's catalyst (Pd/CaCO3 poisoned with lead)",
          "Nickel catalyst at high temperature",
          "Platinum catalyst at room temperature",
          "Concentrated sulfuric acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Lindlar's catalyst is a 'poisoned' catalyst that is less reactive; it allows for the partial reduction of alkynes to cis-alkenes without further reducing them to alkanes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When an alkyne reacts with excess bromine ($Br_{2}$), what is the final product?",
        "options": [
          "A tetrahaloalkane",
          "A dihaloalkene",
          "A monohaloalkane",
          "A vinyl bromide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Excess bromine adds across both pi bonds, resulting in four bromine atoms attached to the two carbons of the original triple bond (e.g., 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The addition of hydrogen halides (HX) to unsymmetrical alkynes follows which rule?",
        "options": [
          "Markovnikov's Rule",
          "Hund's Rule",
          "Zaitsev's Rule",
          "Le Chatelier's Principle"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like alkenes, the electrophilic addition to alkynes follows Markovnikov's rule, where the hydrogen adds to the carbon with more hydrogen atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is formed when a terminal alkyne reacts with a very strong base like sodium amide ($NaNH_{2}$)?",
        "options": [
          "An acetylide ion (sodium salt)",
          "An alkene",
          "An alcohol",
          "A ketone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because terminal alkynes are weakly acidic, a strong base can remove the terminal proton to form a carbanion known as an acetylide (or alkynide) ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When one mole of HBr is added to ethyne, the product is bromoethene. If a second mole of HBr is added, what is the major product?",
        "options": [
          "1,1-dibromoethane",
          "1,2-dibromoethane",
          "1,1-dibromoethene",
          "1,2-dibromoethene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Markovnikov's rule, the second hydrogen adds to the carbon already bearing two hydrogens (the $CH_{2}$ group), and the bromine adds to the carbon already bearing a bromine, forming a geminal dihalide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary utility of acetylide ions in organic synthesis?",
        "options": [
          "They act as nucleophiles to form new carbon-carbon bonds",
          "They are used to bleach colored solutions",
          "They act as catalysts for fermentation",
          "They prevent the oxidation of alkanes"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acetylide ions can react with alkyl halides to lengthen the carbon chain, making them vital tools for building larger organic molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Partial reduction of an internal alkyne using sodium in liquid ammonia ($Na/NH_{3}$) yields which isomer?",
        "options": [
          "Trans-alkene",
          "Cis-alkene",
          "Terminal alkene",
          "Alkane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike Lindlar's catalyst (which gives cis), dissolving metal reduction ($Na/NH_{3}$) provides the anti-addition of hydrogen, resulting in the more stable trans-alkene."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the reactivity of alkynes compared to alkenes toward electrophilic addition?",
        "options": [
          "Alkynes are generally less reactive than alkenes",
          "Alkynes are significantly more reactive than alkenes",
          "They have identical reactivity",
          "Alkynes only react with noble gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Surprisingly, despite having more pi electrons, alkynes are often slightly less reactive than alkenes toward electrophiles because the sp-hybridized carbons hold the pi electrons more tightly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when ethyne is passed through a solution of ammoniacal silver nitrate?",
        "options": [
          "A white precipitate of silver acetylide forms",
          "The solution turns bright blue",
          "Ethane gas is evolved",
          "Silver metal is plated onto the glass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a characteristic test for terminal alkynes. The acidic hydrogen is replaced by a silver ion, forming an insoluble, explosive salt."
