      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is primarily used by organic chemists to identify:",
        "options": [
          "Functional groups present in a molecule",
          "The exact molar mass of a compound",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IR spectroscopy measures the vibrations of chemical bonds. Different functional groups absorb specific frequencies of IR radiation, creating a unique 'fingerprint' of peaks."

          "Molecular ion ($M^{+}$) peak",
          "Base peak",

          "Isotope peak"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The molecular ion peak corresponds to the radical cation formed when the molecule loses one electron, providing the molar mass of the compound."
      },
      {

        "explanation": "Wavenumbers, the reciprocal of wavelength, are used in IR to represent frequency in a way that is directly proportional to energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A strong, broad absorption peak in the range of $3200-3600 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ in an IR spectrum is most characteristic of which functional group?",

        "explanation": "The $\\text{O-H}$ bond in alcohols produces a very distinctive broad peak due to hydrogen bonding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Base Peak' in a mass spectrum is defined as the peak that:",
        "options": [
          "Has the greatest intensity (is the tallest)",
          "Represents the heaviest fragment",
          "Has the smallest $m/z$ ratio",
          "Represents the molecular weight of the compound"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The base peak is the most stable and abundant ion formed during fragmentation, and all other peaks are scaled relative to its height ($100\\%$ intensity)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A sharp, intense peak near $1700 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ in an IR spectrum indicates the presence of which group?",
        "options": [
          "Carbonyl group ($\\text{C=O}$)",
          "Alkyne group ($\\text{C} \\equiv \\text{C}$)",

          "Alkane group ($\\text{C-H}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $\\text{C=O}$ stretch is one of the most useful diagnostic features in IR spectroscopy, appearing consistently as a strong peak between $1650$ and $1750 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During mass spectrometry, molecules are typically converted into ions by:",
        "options": [
          "Bombarding them with high-energy electrons",
          "Heating them to extremely high temperatures",
          "Dissolving them in a strong acid",
          "Exposing them to visible light"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electron Impact (EI) ionization involves hitting gas-phase molecules with an electron beam, causing them to lose an electron and fragment into smaller pieces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'Fingerprint Region' of an IR spectrum, which is unique to every molecule, is found in which range?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The region below $1500 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ contains complex patterns of single bond vibrations and bending that are specific to the entire molecular structure."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In mass spectrometry, what does the $z$ in the $m/z$ ratio represent?",

          "The charge of the ion",
          "The atomic number of the element",
          "The frequency of the vibration",
          "The spin of the electron"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$m$ is the mass and $z$ is the charge. Since most ions formed are singly charged ($+1$), the $m/z$ ratio usually equals the mass of the fragment."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which spectroscopic method would be most effective for distinguishing between propanal (an aldehyde) and propanone (a ketone)?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While both have a $\\text{C=O}$ peak in IR, their mass spectra will show different fragment ions (like the $\\text{CHO}$ fragment vs. $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CO}$ fragment), allowing for definitive identification."
