    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which conformation of cyclohexane is the most stable due to having virtually zero angle strain and zero torsional strain?",
        "options": [
          "Chair conformation",
          "Boat conformation",
          "Twist-boat conformation",
          "Half-chair conformation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The chair conformation allows all C-C-C bond angles to be $109.5^{\circ}$ and ensures all C-H bonds are perfectly staggered."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the chair conformation, hydrogen atoms are divided into two types based on their orientation. What are they called?",
        "options": [
          "Axial and Equatorial",
          "Cis and Trans",
          "Staggered and Eclipsed",
          "Vertical and Horizontal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Axial bonds point vertically up or down, parallel to the ring axis, while equatorial bonds point out around the 'equator' of the ring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason the 'boat' conformation is less stable than the 'chair' conformation?",
        "options": [
          "Torsional strain from eclipsed bonds and 'flagpole' interactions",
          "Extreme angle strain exceeding $120^{\\circ}$",
          "The carbon atoms are too far apart to bond properly",
          "The molecule becomes polar in the boat form"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The boat form suffers from torsional strain due to eclipsing hydrogens along the sides and steric repulsion between the two 'flagpole' hydrogens at the ends."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During a 'ring-flip' (interconversion between two chair forms), what happens to a substituent that was in an axial position?",
        "options": [
          "It becomes equatorial",
          "It stays axial but points in the opposite direction",
          "It moves to a different carbon atom",
          "It remains axial and unchanged"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A ring-flip converts all axial positions to equatorial positions and all equatorial positions to axial positions, though 'up' stays 'up' and 'down' stays 'down'."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a mono-substituted cyclohexane, such as methylcyclohexane, which position for the methyl group is energetically favored?",
        "options": [
          "Equatorial position",
          "Axial position",
          "Flagpole position",
          "The energy is identical for both"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equatorial position is more stable because it avoids 1,3-diaxial interactions (steric strain) with other axial hydrogens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are '1,3-diaxial interactions'?",
        "options": [
          "Steric repulsion between an axial substituent and the axial hydrogens on the same side of the ring",
          "The bonding between the 1st and 3rd carbon in a ring",
          "The attraction between two equatorial groups",
          "The vibration of the carbon-carbon bonds in the chair form"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a bulky group is axial, its electron cloud repels the electron clouds of the other axial hydrogens located two carbons away (at the 3 and 5 positions)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Half-chair' conformation?",
        "options": [
          "The highest energy transition state during a ring-flip",
          "The most stable form of cyclohexane",
          "A conformation with no torsional strain",
          "A planar hexagon"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The half-chair is an unstable, high-energy transition state formed momentarily as the ring twists from a chair to a twist-boat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a cyclohexane chair, if the axial bond on Carbon-1 points 'up', what is the direction of the axial bond on Carbon-2?",
        "options": [
          "Down",
          "Up",
          "Left",
          "Right"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Axial bonds alternate 'up' and 'down' as you move around the ring (Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is tert-butylcyclohexane almost exclusively found with the tert-butyl group in the equatorial position?",
        "options": [
          "The group is so bulky that the 1,3-diaxial strain in the axial position is extremely high",
          "The tert-butyl group is too heavy for the axial bond to support",
          "The axial position is only large enough for hydrogen atoms",
          "Tert-butyl groups are polar and prefer the exterior of the ring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tert-butyl is so large that the steric repulsion in the axial position is essentially 'locking' the ring in the equatorial conformation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The energy difference between the chair and boat conformations is approximately:",
        "options": [
          "29 kJ/mol",
          "0 kJ/mol",
          "100 kJ/mol",
          "5 kJ/mol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The boat conformation is roughly $29 \\text{ kJ/mol}$ higher in energy than the chair, making the chair the dominant form at equilibrium."
