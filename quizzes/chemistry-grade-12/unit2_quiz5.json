          "A platinum metal catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Energy from UV light or heat is necessary to undergo homolytic fission of the halogen-halogen bond to create reactive radicals."
      },
      {

      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the mechanism of chlorination of methane, the step $\\text{Cl} \\cdot + \\text{CH}_{4} \\rightarrow \\text{HCl} + \\cdot \\text{CH}_{3}$ is an example of:",

        "question": "What occurs during the 'Initiation' step of the free radical mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "The formation of radicals from a non-radical species",
          "The reaction of two radicals to form a stable molecule",
          "The removal of a hydrogen atom from the alkane",
          "The formation of the final halogenated product"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Initiation is the starting step where a halogen molecule ($X_{2}$) absorbs energy and splits into two halogen radicals ($2X \\cdot$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following reaction steps would result in 'Termination'?",
        "options": [
          "$\\cdot \\text{CH}_{3} + \\text{Cl} \\cdot \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{Cl}$",
          "$\\text{Cl} \\cdot + \\text{CH}_{4} \\rightarrow \\cdot \\text{CH}_{3} + \\text{HCl}$",
          "$\\cdot \\text{CH}_{3} + \\text{Cl}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{Cl} + \\text{Cl} \\cdot$",
          "$\\text{Cl}_{2} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cl} \\cdot$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Termination occurs when any two radicals collide and combine to form a stable molecule, ending that specific chain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the chlorination of methane often produce a mixture of products like $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{Cl}$, $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{Cl}_{2}$, $\\text{CHCl}_{3}$, and $\\text{CCl}_{4}$?",
        "options": [
          "The product molecules can continue to react with chlorine radicals",
          "The reaction is endothermic and reverses easily",
          "Multiple initiation steps occur simultaneously",
          "Methane naturally contains these impurities"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As chloromethane forms, it can also be attacked by chlorine radicals, leading to further substitution until all hydrogens are replaced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which intermediate is formed when a chlorine radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from an ethane molecule?",
        "options": [
          "Ethyl radical ($\\cdot \\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{5}$)",
          "Ethyl carbocation ($\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{5}^{+}$)",
          "Ethane radical cation ($\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{6}^{\\cdot +}$)",
          "Chloride ion ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The abstraction of a hydrogen atom leaves an unpaired electron on the carbon chain, creating an alkyl radical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction of excess methane with a small amount of chlorine, the major organic product is:",
        "options": [
          "Chloromethane",
          "Tetrachloromethane",
          "Chloroform",
          "Ethane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using an excess of the alkane increases the probability of radicals hitting methane rather than the product, favoring mono-substitution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the role of the 'dots' in the notation $\\text{Cl} \\cdot$ or $\\cdot \\text{CH}_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "They represent a single unpaired electron",
          "They represent a lone pair of electrons",
          "They indicate a negative charge",
          "They indicate a double bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The dot notation is used in radical chemistry to explicitly show the unpaired valence electron that makes the species highly reactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a likely 'minor' byproduct of the chlorination of methane due to a termination step between two alkyl radicals?",

          "Propane",
          "Hydrogen gas",
          "Dichloromethane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If two methyl radicals ($\\cdot \\text{CH}_{3}$) collide, they form ethane ($\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{6}$), which is a characteristic evidence for the radical mechanism."
