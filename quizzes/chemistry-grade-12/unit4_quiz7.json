    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which pathway is virtually guaranteed for a primary ($1^{\\circ}$) haloalkane reacting with a small, strong nucleophile like $\\text{NaOH}$ at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$",
          "$\\text{E}2$",
          "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$",
          "$\\text{E}1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Primary halides have very little steric hindrance, making them ideal for $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$. Unless a bulky base or high heat is used, substitution dominates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does using a bulky base, such as potassium tert-butoxide ($t\\text{-BuOK}$), affect the competition in a primary haloalkane?",
        "options": [
          "It favors $\\text{E}2$ over $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$",
          "It favors $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ over $\\text{E}2$",
          "It forces the reaction to go via $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$",
          "It has no effect on the outcome"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bulky bases are too large to attack the carbon atom ($\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$) easily, so they prefer to pick off an accessible peripheral proton, favoring $\\text{E}2$ elimination."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Tertiary ($3^{\\circ}$) haloalkanes reacting with a strong base like $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{O}^{-}$ will primarily undergo:",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{E}2$",
          "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$",
          "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$",
          "No reaction"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ is impossible for $3^{\\circ}$ substrates due to steric hindrance. Since the base is strong, it will force a bimolecular reaction ($\\text{E}2$) rather than waiting for ionization ($\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the competition between substitution and elimination as the reaction temperature is increased?",
        "options": [
          "Elimination is favored over substitution",
          "Substitution is favored over elimination",
          "The mechanisms switch from bimolecular to unimolecular",
          "Temperature has no effect on this specific competition"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elimination increases the number of species in solution (higher entropy). Because $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, the $T\\Delta S$ term makes elimination more favorable at higher temperatures."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which conditions favor an $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$/$\\text{E}1$ mix for a secondary or tertiary substrate?",
        "options": [
          "Weak nucleophile/base (like $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ or $\\text{ROH}$) and a polar protic solvent",
          "Strong, concentrated base and high heat",
          "Strong, bulky base in an aprotic solvent",
          "Primary substrate in a non-polar solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak nucleophiles are not strong enough to force a bimolecular reaction, so the molecule waits to ionize, leading to a mix of $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ and $\\text{E}1$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a secondary ($2^{\\circ}$) haloalkane reacts with a strong, non-bulky base/nucleophile like $\\text{OH}^{-}$, what is the likely outcome?",
        "options": [
          "A mixture of $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ and $\\text{E}2$",
          "Exclusively $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$",
          "Exclusively $\\text{E}1$",
          "A mixture of $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ and $\\text{E}1$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Secondary substrates are the most competitive. A strong base/nucleophile will drive bimolecular processes, resulting in both substitution and elimination products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a 'good nucleophile' but a 'weak base', favoring substitution over elimination?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{I}^{-}$",
          "$\\text{OH}^{-}$",
          "$\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{O}^{-}$",
          "$\\text{NH}_{2}^{-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iodide (and other halides) are excellent nucleophiles due to their polarizability but are very weak bases (conjugate bases of strong acids), so they favor substitution."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the expected major product for the reaction of 2-bromo-2-methylbutane with water at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "2-methylbutan-2-ol ($\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$)",
          "2-methylbut-2-ene ($\\text{E}2$)",
          "2-bromo-2-methylbutane (No reaction)",
          "1-bromo-2-methylbutane (Isomerization)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With a $3^{\\circ}$ substrate and a weak nucleophile/solvent (solvolysis), $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$ is the dominant pathway at room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the competition between $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ and $\\text{E}2$, why does the 'strength' of the base matter more for $\\text{E}2$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{E}2$ requires the removal of a proton, which is an acid-base reaction",
          "$\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$ does not involve any negative charges",
          "Bases only react with halogens, not carbons",
          "$\\text{E}2$ is only possible if the base is larger than the substrate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Elimination is fundamentally a Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction (removing $\\text{H}^{+}$), whereas substitution is a Lewis acid-base reaction (attacking carbon)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a factor in determining the $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}1$/ $\\text{S}_{\\text{N}}2$/ $\\text{E}1$/ $\\text{E}2$ competition?",
        "options": [
          "The color of the starting haloalkane",
          "The structure of the alkyl group ($1^{\\circ}$, $2^{\\circ}$, $3^{\\circ}$)",
          "The strength and size of the nucleophile/base",
          "The polarity of the solvent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Physical properties like color do not influence the kinetic pathway of a chemical reaction."
