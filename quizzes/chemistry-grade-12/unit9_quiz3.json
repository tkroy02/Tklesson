          "To increase the resistance of the cell."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The salt bridge allows for the migration of anions and cations to balance the charge buildup that occurs as electrons flow through the wire."

          "Toward the more negative electrode."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation occurs at the anode, releasing electrons which then travel through the wire to the cathode where reduction occurs."

          "The reaction is spontaneous as written."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative cell potential indicates that the reaction requires an external energy source to proceed (electrolytic) and is not spontaneous."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the cathode, $Cu^{2+}$ ions are reduced to $Cu(s)$, which deposits onto the electrode, increasing its mass."
