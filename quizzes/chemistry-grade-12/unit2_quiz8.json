    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Cyclic alkane properties and nomenclature",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct general molecular formula for a monocyclic cycloalkane containing $n$ carbon atoms?",
        "options": [
          "$C_{n}H_{2n}$",
          "$C_{n}H_{2n+2}$",
          "$C_{n}H_{2n-2}$",
          "$C_{n}H_{n}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Connecting the ends of a carbon chain to form a ring requires the loss of two hydrogen atoms compared to an open-chain alkane, making them isomeric with alkenes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In IUPAC nomenclature, what prefix is added to the name of the corresponding alkane to indicate a ring structure?",
        "options": [
          "cyclo-",
          "ring-",
          "iso-",
          "trans-"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The prefix 'cyclo-' is the standard IUPAC designation used to indicate that the carbon atoms are arranged in a closed loop."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct IUPAC name for a saturated five-carbon ring?",
        "options": [
          "Cyclopentane",
          "Cyclohexane",
          "Pentane",
          "Methylcyclobutane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A five-carbon parent is 'pentane', and the cyclic nature requires the 'cyclo-' prefix to distinguish it from the straight-chain isomer."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When naming a cycloalkane with only one substituent, such as methylcyclohexane, why is the locant '1-' typically omitted?",
        "options": [
          "All positions on a mono-substituted ring are chemically equivalent",
          "Cycloalkanes do not follow numbering rules",
          "Methyl groups never require locants in cyclic systems",
          "The substituent is assumed to be at the top carbon by default"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because of the ring's symmetry, the substituted carbon is always carbon-1. Including the number '1' is considered redundant in IUPAC rules for mono-substituted rings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct IUPAC name for a four-carbon ring that has two methyl groups on the first and third carbons?",
        "options": [
          "1,3-dimethylcyclobutane",
          "2,4-dimethylcyclobutane",
          "1,3-methylcyclobutane",
          "1-methyl-3-methylcyclobutane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The four-carbon ring is cyclobutane. The two methyl groups are indicated by 'dimethyl', and the locants 1 and 3 provide the lowest possible numbering set."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a cycloalkane ring has fewer carbons than an attached alkyl chain (e.g., a cyclopropyl group on a pentane chain), how is it named?",
        "options": [
          "The ring is treated as a 'cycloalkyl' substituent on the alkane chain",
          "The ring is always the parent name regardless of chain length",
          "The names are combined with a hyphen",
          "The molecule is named as a 'bicyclo' compound"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the open chain is longer than the ring, IUPAC rules state the chain is the parent and the ring is a substituent (e.g., 1-cyclopropylpentane)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do the boiling points of cycloalkanes generally compare to their straight-chain alkane counterparts with the same number of carbons?",
        "options": [
          "Cycloalkanes have higher boiling points",
          "Cycloalkanes have lower boiling points",
          "They have identical boiling points because they are isomers",
          "Cycloalkanes decompose rather than boil"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rigid ring shape allows for more efficient molecular packing and greater surface area contact, which increases London dispersion forces compared to flexible chains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the solubility of cycloalkanes?",
        "options": [
          "Insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents",
          "Highly soluble in water due to ring tension",
          "Only soluble in liquid metals",
          "Universally soluble in all polar and non-polar liquids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like all hydrocarbons, cycloalkanes are non-polar. They cannot form hydrogen bonds with water and follow the 'like dissolves like' rule for organic solvents."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for a six-carbon ring with an ethyl group and a methyl group on the same carbon atom?",
        "options": [
          "1-ethyl-1-methylcyclohexane",
          "1-methyl-1-ethylcyclohexane",
          "Ethylmethylcyclohexane",
          "1-ethyl-1-methylhexane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substituents must be listed alphabetically (ethyl before methyl). Both require the locant '1' to show they are on the same carbon of the cyclohexane ring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the smallest possible cycloalkane?",
        "options": [
          "Cyclopropane",
          "Cyclomethane",
          "Cycloethane",
          "Cyclobutane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A minimum of three carbon atoms is geometrically required to close a loop and form a ring."
