    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following defines a 'strong acid'?",
        "options": [
          "An acid that ionizes 100% in aqueous solution.",
          "An acid with a very high concentration.",
          "An acid that reacts slowly with bases.",
          "An acid with a $pH$ between 4 and 6."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Strength is defined by the extent of ionization, not molarity. Strong acids have equilibrium positions that lie effectively 100% to the right."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a weak acid $HA$, what is the correct expression for the acid dissociation constant ($K_{a}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{a} = \\frac{[H_{3}O^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$",
          "$K_{a} = [H_{3}O^{+}][A^{-}]$",
          "$K_{a} = \\frac{[HA]}{[H_{3}O^{+}][A^{-}]}$",
          "$K_{a} = \\frac{[H_{3}O^{+}]}{[OH^{-}]}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equilibrium constant follows the Law of Mass Action: products over reactants. Water is excluded as it is the solvent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is a common strong acid?",
        "options": [
          "$HClO_{4}$",
          "$CH_{3}COOH$",
          "$HF$",
          "$H_{3}PO_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Perchloric acid ($HClO_{4}$) is one of the standard strong acids. $HF$ and $CH_{3}COOH$ are weak."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If Acid X has $K_{a} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ and Acid Y has $K_{a} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$, which is stronger?",
        "options": [
          "Acid X",
          "Acid Y",
          "They are equal in strength.",
          "It depends on the concentration."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A larger $K_{a}$ indicates a greater degree of ionization. $10^{-2}$ is 1000 times larger than $10^{-5}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the relationship between $K_{a}$ and $pK_{a}$?",
        "options": [
          "$pK_{a} = -\\log(K_{a})$",
          "$pK_{a} = \\ln(K_{a})$",
          "$pK_{a} = 1 / K_{a}$",
          "$pK_{a} = K_{a} / K_{w}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like $pH$, the 'p' notation indicates the negative base-10 logarithm."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The conjugate base of a very strong acid is:",
        "options": [
          "A very weak base.",
          "A very strong base.",
          "Neutral.",
          "Amphiprotic."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If an acid ionizes completely, its conjugate base has negligible affinity for protons, making it a very weak base."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the behavior of a weak base in water?",
        "options": [
          "It reacts partially with water to produce $OH^{-}$.",
          "It ionizes completely to produce $OH^{-}$.",
          "It always contains a hydroxide group in its formula.",
          "It neutralizes acids to produce a $pH$ of 1."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Weak bases like $NH_{3}$ establish an equilibrium where only a small fraction of molecules accept a proton from water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a conjugate acid-base pair, what does $K_{a} \\times K_{b}$ equal at 25°C?",
        "options": [
          "$1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$",
          "$1.0 \\times 10^{-7}$",
          "$1.0$",
          "$14.0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The product of the dissociation constants for a conjugate pair is equal to the water autoionization constant ($K_{w}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor increases the percent ionization of a weak acid?",
        "options": [
          "Decreasing the initial concentration of the acid.",
          "Increasing the initial concentration of the acid.",
          "Adding more of the conjugate base.",
          "Lowering the temperature for an endothermic dissociation."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "According to Le Chatelier's principle, dilution (adding water) shifts the equilibrium toward the side with more particles (the ions)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is $HF$ a weak acid despite Fluorine's high electronegativity?",
        "options": [
          "The $H-F$ bond is very strong.",
          "Fluorine is too small to hold a charge.",
          "It does not dissolve in water.",
          "It is a liquid at room temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The bond enthalpy of the $H-F$ bond is high enough that it does not easily break in water compared to $HCl$ or $HBr$."
