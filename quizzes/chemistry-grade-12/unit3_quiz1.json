    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the hybridization of the carbon atoms involved in a carbon-carbon double bond in an alkene?",
        "options": [
          "sp2",
          "sp3",
          "sp",
          "dsp2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an alkene, each double-bonded carbon is bonded to three other atoms, requiring three sp2 hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized p orbital for the pi bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the ideal bond angles around a double-bonded carbon atom in an alkene?",
        "options": [
          "120°",
          "109.5°",
          "180°",
          "90°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sp2 hybridization results in a trigonal planar geometry with bond angles of approximately 120°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A carbon-carbon double bond consists of:",
        "options": [
          "One sigma (σ) bond and one pi (π) bond",
          "Two sigma (σ) bonds",
          "Two pi (π) bonds",
          "One sigma (σ) bond and two pi (π) bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first bond is a sigma bond formed by head-on orbital overlap; the second is a pi bond formed by lateral overlap of unhybridized p orbitals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is rotation restricted around a carbon-carbon double bond compared to a single bond?",
        "options": [
          "Rotation would break the parallel overlap of the p orbitals in the pi bond",
          "The sigma bond is too strong to allow rotation",
          "The hydrogen atoms are too large to pass each other",
          "The double bond is too short for rotation to occur"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pi bond is formed by the side-to-side overlap of p orbitals. Rotating the bond would reduce this overlap to zero, effectively breaking the bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general molecular formula for an acyclic alkene with one double bond?",
        "options": [
          "CnH2n",
          "CnH2n+2",
          "CnH2n-2",
          "CnHn"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The presence of one double bond means the molecule has two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding alkane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In terms of bond length, how does a C=C double bond compare to a C-C single bond?",
        "options": [
          "The double bond is shorter and stronger",
          "The double bond is longer and stronger",
          "The double bond is shorter and weaker",
          "The double bond is longer and weaker"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The additional electron density in a double bond pulls the nuclei closer together, resulting in a shorter, stronger bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecular geometry is associated with the carbons in ethene (C2H4)?",
        "options": [
          "Trigonal planar",
          "Tetrahedral",
          "Linear",
          "Bent"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With sp2 hybridization and no lone pairs, the geometry around each carbon is trigonal planar, making the entire ethene molecule flat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The pi (π) bond in an alkene is formed by the overlap of which type of orbitals?",
        "options": [
          "Unhybridized p orbitals",
          "sp2 hybrid orbitals",
          "s orbitals",
          "sp3 hybrid orbitals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pi bonds are formed by the lateral (side-by-side) overlap of p orbitals that were not used in the hybridization process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the presence of a pi bond affect the reactivity of alkenes compared to alkanes?",
        "options": [
          "It makes them more reactive because the pi electrons are more accessible",
          "It makes them less reactive because double bonds are stronger",
          "It has no effect on chemical reactivity",
          "It makes them only reactive toward noble gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The pi electrons reside above and below the plane of the molecule, making them highly accessible to electron-seeking reagents (electrophiles)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the simplest alkene?",
        "options": [
          "Ethene",
          "Methene",
          "Propene",
          "Butene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethene (C2H4) is the smallest alkene; 'methene' cannot exist because a double bond requires at least two carbon atoms."
