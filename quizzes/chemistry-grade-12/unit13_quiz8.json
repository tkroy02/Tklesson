        "explanation": "The $S_{N}1$ (Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular) mechanism depends only on the concentration of the substrate during the slow formation of the carbocation."

          "The formation of a meso compound."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the nucleophile attacks from the 'backside' opposite the leaving group, the stereochemistry is inverted."
      },

        "question": "Markovnikov's rule is best explained by which of the following?",
        "options": [

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrophilic addition follows the path that produces the most stable carbocation (tertiary > secondary > primary)."

          "Strong, bulky base and high temperature.",
          "Weak nucleophile and low temperature.",

          "High concentration of a weak acid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bulky bases (like potassium tert-butoxide) are poor nucleophiles due to steric hindrance, favoring proton abstraction over substitution."

        "question": "In the nitration of benzene, what acts as the electrophile?",

          "Nitrous acid ($HNO_{2}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Sulfuric acid reacts with nitric acid to generate the $NO_{2}^{+}$ ion, which then attacks the electron-rich benzene ring."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The conversion of an alcohol to an alkene using concentrated $H_{2}SO_{4}$ is an example of:",

          "Bromide radical"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The formation of a cyclic bromonium ion prevents carbocation rearrangement and leads to anti-addition stereochemistry."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Nucleophilic acyl substitution is the characteristic mechanism for which functional group?",

          "Aromatic hydrocarbons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carbonyl carbon is electrophilic, allowing nucleophiles to replace leaving groups like $-OR$ or $-NH_{2}$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product of an elimination reaction is the one that is:",

          "The most highly substituted alkene.",
          "The least highly substituted alkene.",
          "The most polar molecule.",
          "The one with the lowest boiling point."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "More substituted alkenes are generally more thermodynamically stable due to hyperconjugation."
