    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the hybridisation of the carbon atom in a carbonyl group?",
        "options": [
          "$sp^{2}$",
          "$sp^{3}$",
          "$sp$",
          "$dsp^{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carbonyl carbon is bonded to three other atoms (one oxygen and two others) with one pi bond, giving it a trigonal planar geometry and $sp^{2}$ hybridisation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the structural difference between an aldehyde and a ketone?",
        "options": [
          "Aldehydes have at least one hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon; ketones have two alkyl/aryl groups.",
          "Ketones have a hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon; aldehydes do not.",
          "Aldehydes contain a nitrogen atom; ketones do not.",
          "Ketones are only cyclic; aldehydes are always straight chains."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An aldehyde ($R-CHO$) always has the carbonyl at the end of a chain, while a ketone ($R-CO-R'$) has it between two carbon groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC suffix used for naming aldehydes?",
        "options": [
          "-al",
          "-one",
          "-ol",
          "-oic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aldehydes use the suffix '-al'. For example, a two-carbon aldehyde is ethanal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct IUPAC name for $CH_{3}COCH_{2}CH_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "Butan-2-one",
          "Butanal",
          "Ethyl methyl ketone",
          "Propanone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The longest chain has four carbons, and the carbonyl group is at position 2, making it butan-2-one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The bond angles around the carbonyl carbon are approximately:",
        "options": [
          "120°",
          "109.5°",
          "180°",
          "90°"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to its $sp^{2}$ hybridisation and trigonal planar shape, the bond angles are approximately 120°."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the common name for the simplest aldehyde, methanal?",
        "options": [
          "Formaldehyde",
          "Acetaldehyde",
          "Formic acid",
          "Acetone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methanal is widely known by its common name, formaldehyde."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct IUPAC name for $C_{6}H_{5}CHO$?",
        "options": [
          "Benzaldehyde",
          "Benzenone",
          "Phenylmethanol",
          "Benzyl aldehyde"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Benzaldehyde is the standard IUPAC name for an aldehyde group attached directly to a benzene ring."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the parent chain numbered in an aldehyde?",
        "options": [
          "The carbonyl carbon is always assigned as carbon-1",
          "Numbering starts from the end furthest from the carbonyl",
          "The chain is numbered to give substituents the lowest possible numbers",
          "Aldehydes do not require numbering"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the aldehyde group is always terminal, the carbonyl carbon is automatically C1."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the general formula for a saturated acyclic aldehyde or ketone?",
        "options": [
          "$C_{n}H_{2n}O$",
          "$C_{n}H_{2n+2}O$",

          "$C_{n}H_{n}O$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because they contain one double bond ($C=O$), they have two fewer hydrogens than an alcohol, resulting in $C_{n}H_{2n}O$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a molecule contains both a ketone and an alcohol group, which group takes priority for the suffix in naming?",
        "options": [
          "The ketone group",
          "The alcohol group",
          "The group closer to the end of the chain",
          "The group with more carbons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ketones and aldehydes have higher IUPAC priority than alcohols. The alcohol becomes a 'hydroxy' substituent."
