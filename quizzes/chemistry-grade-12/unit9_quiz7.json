        "question": "Which of the following best defines a fuel cell?",
        "options": [
          "A cell that converts chemical energy from a continuous external supply of fuel into electricity.",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike batteries, fuel cells do not run down or require recharging; they produce electricity as long as fuel (like hydrogen) and an oxidant (like oxygen) are supplied."

        "question": "In a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell with an alkaline electrolyte, what is the half-reaction at the anode?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}(g) + 2OH^{-}(aq) \\rightarrow 2H_{2}O(l) + 2e^{-}$",

          "Nitrogen oxides ($NO_{x}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The overall reaction is $2H_{2} + O_{2} \\rightarrow 2H_{2}O$. This makes fuel cells an exceptionally clean energy source."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are fuel cells considered more efficient than internal combustion engines?",
        "options": [
          "They convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy, bypassing heat-engine limitations.",
          "They operate at much higher temperatures.",
          "They utilize the nitrogen in the air as a secondary fuel source.",
          "They do not require a catalyst to function."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fuel cells are not limited by the Carnot cycle efficiency because they avoid the multi-step process of burning fuel to create heat and mechanical work."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which material is typically used as a catalyst on the electrodes of a fuel cell?",
        "options": [
          "Platinum ($Pt$)",
          "Lead ($Pb$)",
          "Iron ($Fe$)",
          "Copper ($Cu$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Platinum is the most effective catalyst for both hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction, though its cost is a major barrier to widespread adoption."
      },

        "question": "What occurs at the cathode of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell?",
        "options": [
          "Oxygen gas is reduced.",
          "Hydrogen gas is oxidized.",
          "Water is split into its elements.",
          "Hydroxide ions are converted into hydrogen peroxide."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The cathode is the site of reduction; oxygen gas from the air gains electrons to form hydroxide ions (in alkaline cells) or water (in acidic cells)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary role of the electrolyte in a fuel cell?",
        "options": [
          "To allow ions to move between electrodes while blocking electrons.",
          "To provide a source of fuel for the reaction.",
          "To act as a heat sink to prevent the cell from melting.",
          "To catalyze the reaction of oxygen gas."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The electrolyte must conduct ions to complete the internal circuit but must be an insulator for electrons to force them through the external circuit."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A major disadvantage of using hydrogen fuel cells in vehicles is:",

          "The high emission of greenhouse gases during operation.",
          "The inability of the cells to produce high voltage.",
          "The fact that they produce too much noise compared to engines."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density, requiring high-pressure tanks or cryogenic storage, which presents engineering and safety challenges."

          "Electrons ($e^{-}$)",
          "Oxygen atoms ($O$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Fuel cells are often used in spacecraft because:",

          "They work better in a vacuum than batteries.",
          "They can be used as a primary structural component of the ship.",
          "They do not require any oxygen to operate."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the only byproduct is water, NASA has used fuel cells for decades to provide power and potable water simultaneously."
