    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following defines a 'polyprotic' acid?",
        "options": [
          "An acid that can donate more than one proton ($H^{+}$) per molecule.",
          "An acid that contains multiple hydroxide groups.",
          "An acid that is composed of many different elements.",
          "An acid that ionizes only in non-aqueous solvents."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polyprotic acids, such as $H_{2}SO_{4}$ or $H_{3}PO_{4}$, have multiple ionizable hydrogen atoms that they donate in successive steps."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a diprotic acid $H_{2}A$, which relationship between the dissociation constants is generally true?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{a1} \\gg K_{a2}$",
          "$K_{a1} = K_{a2}$",
          "$K_{a1} \\ll K_{a2}$",
          "$K_{a1} + K_{a2} = K_{w}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The first proton is always much easier to remove than the second because it is harder to pull a positive proton away from a negatively charged anion ($HA^{-}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a $0.1$ M solution of $H_{3}PO_{4}$, which species is present in the lowest concentration at equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "$PO_{4}^{3-}$",
          "$H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}$",
          "$HPO_{4}^{2-}$",
          "$H_{3}PO_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because $K_{a1} > K_{a2} > K_{a3}$, the extent of ionization decreases with each step, leaving the fully deprotonated species in the smallest amount."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common diprotic acid?",
        "options": [
          "$H_{2}CO_{3}$",
          "$HCl$",
          "$HNO_{3}$",
          "$CH_{3}COOH$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbonic acid ($H_{2}CO_{3}$) can donate two protons, forming bicarbonate ($HCO_{3}^{-}$) and then carbonate ($CO_{3}^{2-}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the pH of a typical weak polyprotic acid solution usually calculated using only $K_{a1}$?",
        "options": [
          "The protons from the second ionization are negligible compared to the first.",
          "The second ionization does not occur in water.",
          "$K_{a2}$ is always zero for weak acids.",
          "The concentration of the acid increases after the first step."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since $K_{a1}$ is significantly larger than $K_{a2}$, the hydronium produced in the first step suppresses the second ionization via the common ion effect."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which species is the conjugate base of $H_{2}C_{2}O_{4}$ (oxalic acid)?",
        "options": [
          "$HC_{2}O_{4}^{-}$",
          "$C_{2}O_{4}^{2-}$",
          "$H_{3}C_{2}O_{4}^{+}$",
          "$CO_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conjugate base is formed by removing the first proton ($H^{+}$) from the polyprotic acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is unique about sulfuric acid ($H_{2}SO_{4}$) compared to most other polyprotic acids?",
        "options": [
          "Its first ionization is strong (100%), but its second is weak.",
          "It is the only acid that can donate four protons.",
          "Both of its ionizations are strong.",
          "It only ionizes at temperatures above 100°C."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$H_{2}SO_{4}$ is a strong acid in its first step, but $HSO_{4}^{-}$ is a weak acid with a measurable $K_{a2}$ value ($1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a triprotic acid has $pK_{a1} = 2.1$, $pK_{a2} = 7.2$, and $pK_{a3} = 12.3$, at which pH would the species $HPO_{4}^{2-}$ be most dominant?",
        "options": [
          "pH 9.7",
          "pH 2.1",
          "pH 4.6",
          "pH 14.0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A species is dominant when the pH is between its surrounding $pK_{a}$ values. For $HPO_{4}^{2-}$, that range is between $7.2$ and $12.3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the stepwise dissociation of $H_{2}S$, what is the second equilibrium constant expression?",
        "options": [
          "$K_{a2} = \\frac{[H_{3}O^{+}][S^{2-}]}{[HS^{-}]}$",
          "$K_{a2} = \\frac{[H_{3}O^{+}][HS^{-}]}{[H_{2}S]}$",
          "$K_{a2} = \\frac{[H_{3}O^{+}]^{2}[S^{2-}]}{[H_{2}S]}$",
          "$K_{a2} = [H_{3}O^{+}][S^{2-}]$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The second dissociation step involves the removal of a proton from the intermediate ion, $HS^{-}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following factors makes the second ionization of a polyprotic acid more difficult?",
        "options": [
          "Electrostatic attraction between the positive proton and negative anion.",
          "The decrease in molar mass of the acid.",
          "The increase in the volume of the solution.",
          "The presence of oxygen atoms in the molecule."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It requires more energy to remove a positive $H^{+}$ ion from a negatively charged species ($HA^{-}$) than from a neutral molecule ($H_{2}A$)."
