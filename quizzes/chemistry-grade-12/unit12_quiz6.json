    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following defines a transition metal according to the IUPAC definition?",
        "options": [
          "An element whose atom has a partially filled d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell.",
          "Any element located in the d-block of the periodic table.",
          "An element that only exists in the solid state at room temperature.",
          "An element that has a full s sub-shell and a full d sub-shell."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This definition excludes Group 12 elements like Zinc, which have full d-shells in both their atomic and common ionic states."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct ground-state electron configuration for Chromium (Cr, Z=24)?",
        "options": [
          "[Ar] 4s¹ 5d⁵",
          "[Ar] 4s² 3d⁴",
          "[Ar] 4s¹ 3d⁵",
          "[Ar] 3d⁶"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chromium is an exception to the Aufbau principle; it gains stability by having a half-filled 4s and 3d sub-shell."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When transition metals form ions, which electrons are lost first?",
        "options": [
          "The ns electrons",
          "The (n-1)d electrons",
          "The np electrons",
          "The inner core electrons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Even though the (n-1)d sub-shell is filled after the ns sub-shell, the ns electrons are at a higher energy level in the atom and are removed first during ionization."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transition metals are known for having multiple oxidation states. This is primarily because:",
        "options": [
          "The energy levels of the ns and (n-1)d sub-shells are very close together.",
          "They have high electronegativity values.",
          "Their atomic radii are the largest in their respective periods.",
          "They can only form covalent bonds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the 4s and 3d electrons are close in energy, varying numbers of them can be involved in chemical bonding."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following properties is NOT typical of transition metals?",
        "options": [
          "Formation of colorless compounds only.",
          "Catalytic activity.",
          "Paramagnetism in many of their compounds.",
          "Formation of complex ions."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Transition metal compounds are famous for their vibrant colors due to d-d electronic transitions; colorless compounds (like Sc³⁺ or Zn²⁺) are the exception."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Paramagnetism in transition metal complexes is caused by:",
        "options": [
          "The presence of unpaired electrons in the d-orbitals.",
          "The rapid movement of the metal atom in the crystal lattice.",
          "The paired electrons in the s-orbitals.",
          "The high density of the metal nucleus."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unpaired electrons have a net magnetic moment. Substances with unpaired electrons are attracted to magnetic fields."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which element is often considered a 'd-block element' but not a 'transition metal'?",
        "options": [
          "Zinc (Zn)",
          "Iron (Fe)",
          "Copper (Cu)",
          "Manganese (Mn)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zinc has a configuration of [Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰. Its only common ion is Zn²⁺ ([Ar] 3d¹⁰). Since it never has an incomplete d-shell, it technically fails the IUPAC transition metal definition."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the most common oxidation state for the first-row transition metals (Sc through Zn)?",
        "options": [
          "+2",
          "+1",
          "+7",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most transition metals (except Scandium) commonly form a +2 ion by losing their two 4s electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which transition metal can reach the highest oxidation state in the first row?",
        "options": [
          "Manganese (Mn)",
          "Iron (Fe)",
          "Chromium (Cr)",
          "Vanadium (V)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Manganese can reach a +7 oxidation state (as seen in the permanganate ion, MnO₄⁻) by using all seven of its valence electrons (4s² 3d⁵)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Transition metals are effective catalysts because they can:",
        "options": [
          "Change oxidation states easily to facilitate electron transfer.",
          "Solidify the reactants into a single mass.",
          "Increase the temperature of the surrounding solution.",
          "Lower the concentration of the reactants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states allows them to act as efficient 'shuttles' for electrons in redox-active mechanisms."
