    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key difference between a galvanic cell and an electrolytic cell?",
        "options": [
          "An electrolytic cell requires an external power source to drive a non-spontaneous reaction.",
          "Oxidation occurs at the cathode in an electrolytic cell.",
          "An electrolytic cell produces electrical energy from chemical reactions.",
          "Electrolytic cells do not require an electrolyte."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Galvanic cells produce energy from spontaneous reactions, whereas electrolytic cells consume energy to force non-spontaneous reactions to occur."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an electrolytic cell, the anode is assigned which charge?",
        "options": [
          "Positive",
          "Negative",
          "Neutral",
          "Variable depending on the metal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the external power source 'pulls' electrons from the anode, it is the positive electrode in an electrolytic cell (though oxidation still occurs there)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the products of the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride ($NaCl$)?",

          "Sodium metal and Chlorine gas",
          "Sodium hydroxide and Hydrogen gas",
          "Hydrogen gas and Chlorine gas",
          "Sodium metal and Oxygen gas"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a molten salt (no water), the only available ions are $Na^{+}$ (reduced to $Na$ at the cathode) and $Cl^{-}$ (oxidized to $Cl_{2}$ at the anode)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "During the electrolysis of aqueous $Na_{2}SO_{4}$, why is hydrogen gas produced at the cathode instead of sodium metal?",
        "options": [
          "Water is more easily reduced than $Na^{+}$ ions.",
          "Sodium ions are too heavy to move to the cathode.",
          "The sulfate ions prevent sodium from reacting.",
          "Sodium metal is a gas at room temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reduction potential of water is less negative than that of $Na^{+}$, so water is reduced to $H_{2}$ gas preferentially in aqueous solutions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the process of electroplating a silver spoon with gold, where should the spoon be placed?",
        "options": [
          "At the cathode",
          "At the anode",
          "In the salt bridge",
          "Outside the circuit"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The object to be plated must be the cathode so that metal ions ($Au^{3+}$) in the solution are reduced and deposited onto its surface."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What gas is produced at the anode during the electrolysis of dilute sulfuric acid ($H_{2}SO_{4}$)?",
        "options": [
          "Oxygen ($O_{2}$)",
          "Hydrogen ($H_{2}$)",
          "Sulfur dioxide ($SO_{2}$)",
          "Hydrogen sulfide ($H_{2}S$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In dilute acidic solutions, water is oxidized at the anode to produce oxygen gas and $H^{+}$ ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an industrial application of electrolysis?",
        "options": [
          "The production of Aluminum from Bauxite (Hall-Héroult process).",
          "The combustion of gasoline in an engine.",
          "The fermentation of sugar into alcohol.",
          "The neutralization of an acid with a base."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aluminum is highly reactive and cannot be reduced by carbon; it must be extracted via the electrolysis of molten cryolite and alumina."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the electrolytic refining of copper, the pure copper deposits on:",
        "options": [
          "The cathode",
          "The anode",
          "The bottom of the tank as sludge",
          "The surface of the electrolyte"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Impure copper is oxidized at the anode, and pure $Cu^{2+}$ ions travel through the solution to be reduced back to solid metal at the cathode."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard cell potential ($E^{\\circ}_{cell}$) for an electrolytic process?",

          "Negative",
          "Positive",
          "Exactly zero",
          "Always greater than +1.10 V"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A negative $E^{\\circ}_{cell}$ indicates that the reaction is non-spontaneous and requires an external voltage at least equal to the cell potential to proceed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When electrolyzing aqueous $KI$, a brown color appears near the anode. This is due to the formation of:",

          "Potassium metal",
          "Oxygen gas",
          "Hydroxide ions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iodide ions ($I^{-}$) are oxidized at the anode to form molecular iodine ($I_{2}$), which appears brown in solution."
