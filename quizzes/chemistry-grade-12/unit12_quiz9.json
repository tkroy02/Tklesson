          "Ligands swap positions within a single coordination sphere."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In coordination isomerism, ligands are redistributed between the two complex ion parts of the salt."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydrate isomerism is a specific subtype of:",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrate isomerism involves the exchange of water molecules between the inner coordination sphere and the outer crystal structure."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'trans' isomer of $[Pt(NH_{3})_{2}Cl_{2}]$ (cisplatin/transplatin) is different from the 'cis' isomer because:",
        "options": [
          "Identical ligands are opposite (180°) to each other.",
          "Identical ligands are adjacent (90°) to each other.",
          "The chlorine atoms are replaced by water.",
          "The platinum atom is in a +4 oxidation state."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In trans isomers, the identical groups are positioned at opposite poles of the metal center."

          "They possess a plane of symmetry.",
          "They have too many ligands.",
          "The bond angles are always 109.5°.",
          "The ligands are too small."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Square planar molecules are flat (2D), meaning the molecular plane itself acts as a plane of symmetry, preventing chirality."
