    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the best definition of a 'state function' in thermodynamics?",
        "options": [
          "A property that depends only on the current state of the system, not on the path taken to reach it.",
          "A property that only changes when the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) changes.",
          "A process that occurs at constant atmospheric pressure.",
          "A function that describes the work done by a system on its surroundings."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "State functions like enthalpy, internal energy, and entropy are independent of the path. Heat (q) and work (w) are path functions, not state functions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, what is the change in internal energy ($\\Delta U$) of a system?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta U = q + w$",
          "$\\Delta U = q - w$",
          "$\\Delta U = H - TS$",
          "$\\Delta U = mc\\Delta T$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The internal energy change is the sum of the heat added to the system and the work done on the system (using IUPAC convention)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What defines an 'isolated system'?",
        "options": [
          "A system that can exchange neither matter nor energy with its surroundings.",
          "A system that exchanges energy but not matter.",
          "A system that exchanges both matter and energy.",
          "A system kept at a constant temperature of 298 K."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An isolated system, like a perfectly insulated thermos, prevents the transfer of both mass and thermal energy."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an intensive property?",
        "options": [
          "Temperature",
          "Mass",
          "Volume",
          "Enthalpy"
"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of matter present. Temperature remains the same whether you have a cup of water or a gallon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a system performs work on the surroundings and absorbs heat, what are the signs for $w$ and $q$ respectively?",
        "options": [
          "$q > 0$ and $w < 0$",
          "$q < 0$ and $w > 0$",
          "$q > 0$ and $w > 0$",
          "$q < 0$ and $w < 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat absorbed is positive ($+q$), and work done by the system is negative ($-w$) because the system is losing energy to the surroundings."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these is NOT a state function?",
        "options": [
          "Heat ($q$)",
          "Enthalpy ($H$)",
          "Entropy ($S$)",
          "Internal Energy ($U$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heat and work are path functions because their values depend on the specific transition used to move between states."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the thermodynamic definition of 'surroundings'?",
        "options": [
          "Everything in the universe outside of the system being studied.",
          "The laboratory equipment used in an experiment.",
          "The solvent in which a reaction takes place.",
          "The atmosphere at 1 atm of pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In thermodynamics, the Universe is divided into two parts: the System (the part we are interested in) and the Surroundings (everything else)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a process occurring at constant volume, the heat change ($q_{v}$) is equal to the change in:",
        "options": [
          "Internal energy ($\\Delta U$)",
          "Enthalpy ($\\Delta H$)",
          "Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G$)",
          "Entropy ($\\Delta S$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When volume is constant, work ($P\\Delta V$) is zero, so the first law simplifies to $\\Delta U = q_{v}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If $\\Delta U$ for a process is zero, what can be said about $q$ and $w$?",
        "options": [
          "$q = -w$",
          "$q = w$",
          "$q = 0$ and $w = 0$",
          "The process must be adiabatic."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If the change in internal energy is zero, any heat absorbed must be exactly balanced by work done by the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed?",
        "options": [
          "The First Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Second Law of Thermodynamics",
          "The Third Law of Thermodynamics",
          "Hess's Law"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The First Law is the principle of conservation of energy applied to thermodynamic systems."
