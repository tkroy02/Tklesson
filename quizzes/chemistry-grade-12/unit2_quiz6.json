    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which halogen is the most reactive toward alkanes, often reacting explosively even in the dark?",
        "options": [
          "Fluorine",
          "Chlorine",
          "Bromine",
          "Iodine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Fluorine is extremely reactive and unselective; its reactions with hydrocarbons are highly exothermic and difficult to control."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which halogen is the least reactive toward alkanes, typically resulting in a reaction that is endothermic and does not proceed to completion?",
        "options": [
          "Iodine",
          "Bromine",
          "Chlorine",
          "Fluorine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Iodine is largely unreactive with alkanes because the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by an iodine radical is thermodynamically unfavorable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the bromination of propane, why is 2-bromopropane the major product instead of 1-bromopropane?",
        "options": [
          "Secondary radicals are more stable than primary radicals",
          "The primary carbons are more sterically hindered",
          "Bromine is more reactive than chlorine",
          "Propane only has secondary hydrogens available"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bromine is highly selective. It prefers to form the more stable secondary radical intermediate over the less stable primary radical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The stability of alkyl radicals follows which general trend?",
        "options": [
          "Tertiary > Secondary > Primary > Methyl",
          "Methyl > Primary > Secondary > Tertiary",
          "Primary > Secondary > Tertiary > Methyl",
          "All alkyl radicals have identical stability"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Radical stability increases with the degree of substitution due to hyperconjugation and the inductive effect of neighboring carbon groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which halogen is known for being 'moderately selective,' meaning it produces a mixture of products but favors more substituted carbons?",
        "options": [
          "Chlorine",
          "Fluorine",
          "Iodine",
          "Astatine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorine is more reactive than bromine but less selective, usually resulting in a mixture of isomers where the statistical probability of collisions plays a larger role."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When comparing chlorination and bromination, which process is more likely to be used in a lab to synthesize a specific, pure isomer?",
        "options": [
          "Bromination",
          "Chlorination",
          "Both are equally effective",
          "Neither, halogens never produce specific isomers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because bromine is highly selective for the most substituted carbon (tertiary > secondary > primary), it yields a higher percentage of a single major product."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reason that tertiary radicals are more stable than primary radicals?",
        "options": [
          "Delocalization of the unpaired electron through hyperconjugation",
          "The tertiary carbon has a higher electronegativity",
          "Tertiary carbons are smaller than primary carbons",
          "Tertiary radicals cannot undergo termination steps"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The unpaired electron can be somewhat stabilized by the overlapping of adjacent C-H or C-C sigma bonds, a process known as hyperconjugation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the chlorination of isobutane (2-methylpropane), a significant amount of 1-chloro-2-methylpropane is formed despite the lower stability of primary radicals. Why?",
        "options": [
          "There are nine primary hydrogens and only one tertiary hydrogen",
          "Primary radicals are actually more stable during chlorination",
          "The tertiary carbon is too crowded for chlorine to reach",
          "UV light only activates primary carbons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorine is less selective than bromine; therefore, the statistical abundance of primary hydrogens (9 vs 1) allows the primary product to compete with the more stable tertiary one."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you react an alkane with an excess of halogen, the reaction will likely proceed to form:",
        "options": [
          "Polyhalogenated products",
          "Monohalogenated products only",
          "No reaction will occur",
          "The alkane will break into small pieces of soot"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With excess halogen, the probability of replacing multiple hydrogen atoms increases, eventually leading to fully halogenated molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the bond dissociation energy required to form a tertiary radical compared to a primary radical?",
        "options": [
          "Tertiary requires less energy",
          "Primary requires less energy",
          "Both require the same energy",
          "Radicals do not require bond dissociation energy"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the tertiary radical is more stable (lower energy), it takes less energy to break the C-H bond and form it."
