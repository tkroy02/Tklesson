    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the structure of phenol?",
        "options": [
          "A hydroxyl group bonded directly to a benzene ring",
          "A hydroxyl group bonded to a cyclohexane ring",
          "A benzene ring with an ether linkage",
          "An aldehyde group on a benzene ring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phenol (also known as carbolic acid) consists of a phenyl group ($-C_{6}H_{5}$) attached to a hydroxyl group ($-OH$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the acidity of phenol compare to that of ethanol?",
        "options": [
          "Phenol is much more acidic than ethanol",
          "Ethanol is much more acidic than phenol",
          "They have identical $pK_{a}$ values",
          "Neither phenol nor ethanol can act as an acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phenol ($pK_{a} \\approx 10$) is roughly a million times more acidic than ethanol ($pK_{a} \\approx 16$) because the resulting phenoxide ion is stabilized by resonance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the phenoxide ion ($C_{6}H_{5}O^{-}$) more stable than an ethoxide ion ($CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$)?",
        "options": [
          "The negative charge is delocalized into the aromatic pi system",
          "The phenoxide ion is larger",
          "The ethoxide ion has resonance stabilization",
          "The oxygen in phenol is more electronegative than in ethanol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the phenoxide ion, the negative charge on the oxygen is shared with the ortho and para positions of the benzene ring through resonance, lowering the energy of the ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Phenol reacts with aqueous sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$) to form:",
        "options": [
          "Sodium phenoxide and water",
          "Sodium ethoxide and hydrogen",
          "Benzene and sodium hydroxide",
          "No reaction occurs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike alcohols, phenols are acidic enough to react with strong bases like $NaOH$ to form water-soluble salts."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following reagents can be used to distinguish phenol from ethanol in the lab?",
        "options": [
          "Neutral Ferric Chloride ($FeCl_{3}$)",
          "Sodium metal",
          "Litmus paper",
          "Water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Phenols react with neutral $FeCl_{3}$ to produce a characteristic violet or purple complex, whereas simple alcohols do not."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How do electron-withdrawing groups (like $-NO_{2}$) on the benzene ring affect the acidity of phenol?",
        "options": [
          "They increase the acidity",
          "They decrease the acidity",
          "They have no effect on acidity",
          "They turn phenol into a base"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electron-withdrawing groups help stabilize the negative charge of the phenoxide ion further by pulling electron density away from the ring, making it easier for the phenol to lose a proton."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which molecule is the most acidic?",
        "options": [
          "$2,4,6$-trinitrophenol (Picric acid)",
          "Phenol",
          "$p$-nitrophenol",
          "Cyclohexanol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With three strongly electron-withdrawing nitro groups, picric acid is a very strong organic acid ($pK_{a} \\approx 0.38$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the physical state of pure phenol at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "A crystalline solid",
          "A colorless gas",
          "A non-polar liquid",
          "A blue solution"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Pure phenol is a white crystalline solid at room temperature, though it often turns pink/red over time due to oxidation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Does phenol react with sodium bicarbonate ($NaHCO_{3}$)?",
        "options": [
          "No, it is not a strong enough acid to release $CO_{2}$",
          "Yes, it produces sodium phenoxide and $CO_{2}$ gas",
          "Yes, but only in the presence of a catalyst",
          "Only if the phenol is liquid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While phenol is more acidic than alcohols, it is weaker than carbonic acid ($H_{2}CO_{3}$). Therefore, it cannot displace $CO_{2}$ from bicarbonate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does phenol have a higher boiling point than benzene?",
        "options": [
          "Presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding",
          "Phenol has a higher molar mass",
          "Phenol is a symmetrical molecule",
          "Benzene is a liquid and phenol is a solid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $-OH$ group in phenol allows for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, significantly increasing the energy required to vaporize the substance."
