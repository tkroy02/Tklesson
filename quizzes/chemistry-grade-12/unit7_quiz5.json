    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following ranks the acid derivatives in order of decreasing reactivity toward nucleophilic attack?",
        "options": [
          "Acyl chloride > Acid anhydride > Ester > Amide",
          "Amide > Ester > Acid anhydride > Acyl chloride",
          "Ester > Amide > Acyl chloride > Acid anhydride",
          "Acyl chloride > Amide > Ester > Acid anhydride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reactivity depends on the leaving group's ability to stabilize a negative charge and the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. Chlorine is the best leaving group here, while the amino group is the poorest."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are acyl chlorides the most reactive carboxylic acid derivatives?",
        "options": [
          "The chlorine atom is strongly electron-withdrawing and is a very stable leaving group ($Cl^{-}$).",
          "The chlorine atom donates electron density to the carbonyl via resonance.",
          "They are the only derivatives that are liquids at room temperature.",
          "They have the highest molar mass."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chlorine's high electronegativity makes the carbonyl carbon very positive (electrophilic), and $Cl^{-}$ is a very weak base, making it an excellent leaving group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Amides are the least reactive acid derivatives because:",
        "options": [
          "The nitrogen lone pair strongly delocalizes into the carbonyl group via resonance.",
          "Nitrogen is more electronegative than oxygen.",
          "The carbon-nitrogen bond is a triple bond.",
          "They cannot undergo nucleophilic substitution."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The resonance donation from the nitrogen lone pair ($N-C=O ↔ N^{+}=C-O^{-}$) significantly reduces the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon, making it less attractive to nucleophiles."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which factor primarily determines the leaving group ability in an acyl substitution reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The basicity of the leaving group (weaker bases are better leaving groups).",
          "The size of the alkyl chain attached to the carbonyl.",
          "The boiling point of the derivative.",
          "The number of hydrogen bonds the group can form."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A good leaving group must be able to support a negative charge. Weaker bases (the conjugate bases of strong acids) are better leaving groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements about acid anhydrides is true?",
        "options": [
          "They are more reactive than esters but less reactive than acyl chlorides.",
          "They are less reactive than amides.",
          "They are the most stable of all acid derivatives.",
          "They only react in the presence of a strong reducing agent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carboxylate leaving group of an anhydride is better than an alkoxide (ester) but not as good as a chloride ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the leaving group when an ester undergoes a substitution reaction?",
        "options": [
          "An alkoxide ion ($RO^{-}$)",
          "A hydroxide ion ($OH^{-}$)",
          "A carboxylate ion ($RCOO^{-}$)",
          "A chloride ion ($Cl^{-}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In esters ($R-CO-OR'$), the $-OR'$ group leaves as an alkoxide ion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Inductive effects and resonance effects often compete in derivatives. In which derivative does resonance provide the most significant stabilization?",
        "options": [
          "Amides",
          "Acyl chlorides",
          "Esters",
          "Acid anhydrides"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, so it is more 'willing' to share its lone pair through resonance, making amides very stable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these derivatives is most likely to fume in moist air due to a rapid reaction with water vapor?",
        "options": [
          "Ethanoyl chloride",
          "Ethyl ethanoate",
          "Ethanamide",
          "Ethanoic anhydride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethanoyl chloride is so reactive that it reacts with moisture in the air to produce $HCl$ gas, which appears as white fumes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "To convert a less reactive derivative into a more reactive one (e.g., an ester into an acyl chloride) directly:",
        "options": [
          "Is generally not possible; one must usually go back to the carboxylic acid first.",
          "Is easily done by adding $NaCl$.",
          "Requires only a mild base catalyst.",
          "Happens spontaneously at room temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In organic synthesis, you can easily go from 'more reactive' to 'less reactive', but going 'uphill' usually requires converting the compound back to a carboxylic acid first."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Steric hindrance affects reactivity. Which ester would be the slowest to undergo hydrolysis?",
        "options": [
          "Methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate",
          "Methyl ethanoate",
          "Methyl propanoate",
          "Methyl butanoate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'bulky' tert-butyl group in 2,2-dimethylpropanoate blocks the approach of the nucleophile to the carbonyl carbon."
