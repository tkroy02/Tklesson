    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the mathematical relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}$) and the standard cell potential ($E^{\\circ}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -nFE^{\\circ}$",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = nFE^{\\circ}$",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln E^{\\circ}$",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\frac{-E^{\\circ}}{nF}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The work done by an electrochemical cell is equal to the decrease in Gibbs free energy. The negative sign ensures that a positive cell potential corresponds to a negative (spontaneous) $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a reaction to be spontaneous under standard conditions, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": [
          "$E^{\\circ} > 0$ and $\\Delta G^{\\circ} < 0$",
          "$E^{\\circ} < 0$ and $\\Delta G^{\\circ} > 0$",
          "$E^{\\circ} > 0$ and $\\Delta G^{\\circ} > 0$",
          "$E^{\\circ} = 0$ and $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = 0$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Spontaneity requires a release of free energy (negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$) and a positive cell potential to drive the electron flow."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the equation $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -nFE^{\\circ}$, what does the Faraday constant ($F$) represent?",
        "options": [
          "The charge of one mole of electrons.",
          "The energy of one photon of light.",
          "The number of atoms in a gram of metal.",
          "The resistance of the electrolyte."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Faraday constant is approximately 96,485 Coulombs per mole, representing the total electric charge carried by one mole of electrons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the equilibrium constant ($K$) related to the standard cell potential ($E^{\\circ}$) at 298 K?",
        "options": [
          "$E^{\\circ} = \\frac{0.0592}{n} \\log K$",
          "$E^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K$",
          "$K = -nFE^{\\circ}$",
          "$E^{\\circ} = K \\times nF$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is derived by setting $E = 0$ in the Nernst equation at equilibrium. It shows that a large positive $E^{\\circ}$ corresponds to a very large $K$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a redox reaction has a very large equilibrium constant ($K \\gg 1$), what can be predicted about its standard cell potential?",
        "options": [
          "It will be positive.",
          "It will be negative.",
          "It will be exactly zero.",
          "It cannot be determined from $K$ alone."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A large $K$ means the reaction favors products at equilibrium, which is consistent with a spontaneous forward reaction and a positive $E^{\\circ}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the unit of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ typically used when calculating it from $E^{\\circ}$ (using $F = 96485 C/mol$)?",
        "options": [
          "Joules ($J$)",
          "Volts ($V$)",
          "Watts ($W$)",
          "Amperes ($A$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The product of Coulombs ($C$) and Volts ($V$) is Joules ($J$). This is usually converted to $kJ$ for final thermodynamic reporting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When $E^{\\circ}_{cell} = 0$, what is the state of the chemical system?",
        "options": [
          "The system is at equilibrium.",
          "The reaction is moving rapidly forward.",
          "The reaction is moving rapidly backward.",
          "The system has reached absolute zero temperature."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At equilibrium, there is no net change in free energy and no potential difference to drive a current, meaning both $\\Delta G$ and $E$ are zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is non-spontaneous ($\\Delta G^{\\circ} > 0$), what is the sign of $E^{\\circ}$?",
        "options": [
          "Negative",
          "Positive",
          "Zero",
          "The sign depends on the pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Based on $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -nFE^{\\circ}$, if $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is positive, $E^{\\circ}$ must be negative."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which variable in the thermodynamic equations links the chemical stoichiometry to the electrical charge?",

          "$R$",
          "$T$",
          "$K$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$n$ represents the moles of electrons transferred per mole of reaction, acting as the bridge between chemistry and electricity."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'dead' battery in thermodynamic terms?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta G = 0$ and $E = 0$",
          "$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = 0$ and $E^{\\circ} = 0$",
          "$Q = 1$ and $E = E^{\\circ}$",
          "The entropy has reached zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A dead battery has reached chemical equilibrium; the actual free energy change and the actual potential are both zero, regardless of the standard values."
