    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The rate of a chemical reaction is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time.",
          "The time it takes for a reaction to reach equilibrium.",
          "The total amount of energy released during a reaction.",
          "The ratio of the product coefficients to reactant coefficients."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reaction rate is a measure of how quickly concentrations change, typically expressed in $M/s$ or $mol\\ L^{-1}\\ s^{-1}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For the reaction $A + B \\rightarrow C$, if doubling the concentration of $A$ quadruples the rate, the order with respect to $A$ is:",
        "options": [
          "Second order",
          "First order",
          "Zero order",
          "Third order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If $2^{n} = 4$, then $n = 2$. The rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of $A$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about the rate constant ($k$) is true?",
        "options": [
          "Its value depends on the temperature of the reaction.",
          "Its value depends on the initial concentration of reactants.",
          "It is always a dimensionless constant.",
          "It remains the same even if a catalyst is added."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rate constant $k$ is specific to a reaction at a specific temperature. It changes with temperature and the presence of a catalyst, but not with concentration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a rate law expression $Rate = k[A]^{m}[B]^{n}$, the values of $m$ and $n$ must be determined by:",
        "options": [
          "Experimentation only.",
          "The stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced equation.",
          "The molar masses of the reactants.",
          "The state of matter of the products."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate laws cannot be predicted from the overall balanced equation; they must be determined experimentally using methods like the initial rates method."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the units of $k$ for a overall zero-order reaction?",
        "options": [
          "$M\\ s^{-1}$",
          "$s^{-1}$",
          "$M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}$",
          "$M^{-2}\\ s^{-1}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For zero order, $Rate = k$. Since Rate is in $M/s$, $k$ must also be in $M/s$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a reaction is first-order with respect to $[X]$ and zero-order with respect to $[Y]$, doubling the concentration of both $X$ and $Y$ will:",
        "options": [
          "Double the rate.",
          "Quadruple the rate.",
          "Have no effect on the rate.",
          "Increase the rate by 8 times."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The rate is independent of $[Y]$. Doubling $[X]$ results in a $2^{1}$ increase in rate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'method of initial rates' involves:",
        "options": [
          "Comparing rates from multiple experiments with varying starting concentrations.",
          "Measuring the time it takes for a reaction to stop.",
          "Calculating the average rate over the entire duration of the reaction.",
          "Using a spectrometer to find the equilibrium constant."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By varying one reactant concentration while keeping others constant, the effect on the initial rate reveals the partial order of that reactant."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "For a reaction with the rate law $Rate = k[A][B]^{2}$, what is the overall reaction order?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "2",
          "1",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The overall order is the sum of the individual exponents: $1 + 2 = 3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A reaction rate usually decreases over time because:",
        "options": [
          "The concentration of reactants decreases as they are consumed.",
          "The rate constant $k$ decreases as the reaction proceeds.",
          "The products act as inhibitors to the forward reaction.",
          "The activation energy increases during the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most reactions depend on reactant concentration. As reactants turn into products, there are fewer collisions, and the rate slows down."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the units of $k$ for a second-order reaction?",
        "options": [
          "$L\\ mol^{-1}\\ s^{-1}$ (or $M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}$)",
          "$mol\\ L^{-1}\\ s^{-1}$",
          "$s^{-1}$",
          "$L^{2}\\ mol^{-2}\\ s^{-1}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For second order, $M/s = k(M^{2})$. Solving for $k$ gives $M^{-1}s^{-1}$."
