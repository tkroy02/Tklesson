    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which mathematical expression represents the Arrhenius Equation?",
        "options": [
          "$k = Ae^{-E_{a}/RT}$",
          "$k = Ae^{E_{a}/RT}$",
          "$\\ln(k) = E_{a}/RT + A$",
          "$PV = nRT$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The equation shows that the rate constant $k$ depends exponentially on the negative ratio of activation energy to the thermal energy ($RT$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the Arrhenius equation, what does the 'frequency factor' ($A$) represent?",
        "options": [
          "The frequency of collisions with the correct orientation.",
          "The average speed of the molecules.",
          "The energy barrier of the reaction.",
          "The total number of moles in the system."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$A$ (or the pre-exponential factor) accounts for the frequency of collisions and the probability that they occur with the proper orientation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'activation energy' ($E_{a}$) of a reaction is defined as:",
        "options": [
          "The minimum energy required for a collision to result in a reaction.",
          "The total energy released as heat during the reaction.",
          "The average kinetic energy of the reactant molecules.",
          "The energy difference between products and reactants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Activation energy is the 'hill' that reactants must overcome to reach the transition state and form products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A plot of $\\ln(k)$ versus $1/T$ results in a straight line. What is the slope of this line?",
        "options": [
          "$-E_{a}/R$",
          "$E_{a}/R$",
          "$-R/E_{a}$",
          "$\\ln(A)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Taking the natural log of the Arrhenius equation gives $\\ln(k) = (-E_{a}/R)(1/T) + \\ln(A)$, which is the linear form $y = mx + b$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the rate constant ($k$) if the temperature ($T$) of a reaction is increased?",
        "options": [
          "It increases because a larger fraction of molecules have enough energy to react.",
          "It decreases because molecules move too fast to collide properly.",
          "It remains constant; only concentration affects the rate.",
          "It increases only if the reaction is endothermic."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Higher temperatures increase the average kinetic energy, shifting the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution so more molecules exceed the $E_{a}$ threshold."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If two reactions have the same $A$ factor, but Reaction 1 has a higher $E_{a}$ than Reaction 2, which will be faster at the same temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Reaction 2",
          "Reaction 1",
          "They will have the same rate.",
          "It depends on the pressure."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A lower activation energy means a smaller barrier to overcome, leading to a larger rate constant $k$ and a faster reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the value of the gas constant ($R$) typically used in the Arrhenius equation?",
        "options": [
          "8.314 J/(mol·K)",
          "0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)",
          "1.987 cal/(mol·K)",
          "6.022 \times 10^{23}"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since energy ($E_{a}$) is usually given in Joules or kiloJoules, the SI units for $R$ (8.314) must be used."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to collision theory, why do most collisions NOT lead to a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "They lack either sufficient energy or correct orientation.",
          "The molecules are too far apart.",
          "The pressure is usually too high.",
          "Reactants are naturally repelled by each other."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A 'successful' collision requires both the energy to break bonds (overcoming $E_{a}$) and the correct spatial alignment of the atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the temperature of a reaction is increased from 300 K to 310 K, the rate often doubles. This is primarily due to:",
        "options": [
          "The exponential increase in the number of molecules with energy $\\ge E_{a}$.",
          "The 3% increase in collision frequency.",
          "The decrease in activation energy at higher temperatures.",
          "The increase in the frequency factor $A$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While collisions increase slightly, the number of molecules with enough energy to cross the barrier increases drastically (exponentially)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When using the two-point Arrhenius equation, $\\ln(k_{2}/k_{1}) = (E_{a}/R)(1/T_{1} - 1/T_{2})$, what temperature scale must be used?",
        "options": [
          "Kelvin (K)",
          "Celsius (°C)",
          "Fahrenheit (°F)",
          "Any scale as long as it is consistent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Thermodynamic equations require absolute temperature (Kelvin) to maintain mathematical validity."
