    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following are the primary products of the **complete** combustion of any hydrocarbon in excess oxygen?",
        "options": [
          "Carbon dioxide and water",
          "Carbon monoxide and water",
          "Carbon (soot) and water",
          "Methane and oxygen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an environment with sufficient oxygen, all carbon atoms are oxidized to $\\text{CO}_{2}$ and all hydrogen atoms to $\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Incomplete combustion occurs when there is a limited supply of oxygen. Which highly toxic, colorless, and odorless gas is a common product of this process?",
        "options": [
          "Carbon monoxide",
          "Carbon dioxide",
          "Sulfur dioxide",
          "Nitrogen dioxide"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carbon monoxide ($\\text{CO}$) forms when there isn't enough oxygen to fully oxidize carbon to carbon dioxide. It is dangerous because it binds strongly to hemoglobin."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Combustion reactions of alkanes are characterized by the release of significant amounts of heat energy. This means these reactions are:",
        "options": [
          "Exothermic",
          "Endothermic",
          "Isothermic",
          "Adiabatic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Exothermic reactions release energy to the surroundings, which is why alkanes are used globally as fuels."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct balanced equation for the complete combustion of propane ($\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{8}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{8} + 5\\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow 3\\text{CO}_{2} + 4\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$",
          "$\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{8} + 3\\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow 3\\text{CO}_{2} + 4\\text{H}_{2}$",
          "$\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{8} + 5\\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow 3\\text{CO} + 4\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$",
          "$\\text{C}_{3}\\text{H}_{8} + \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{C}_{3} + 4\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Balancing 3 carbons gives $3\\text{CO}_{2}$, 8 hydrogens gives $4\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$. Total oxygen needed is $(3 \\times 2) + 4 = 10$ atoms, which is $5\\text{O}_{2}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which physical observation is often associated with the incomplete combustion of long-chain alkanes, such as in a candle flame?",
        "options": [
          "A yellow flame and the production of soot",
          "A clean blue flame",
          "The formation of white crystals",
          "The absence of any visible flame"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Soot (unburnt carbon particles) glows yellow when heated in a flame and can deposit as a black solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the 'enthalpy of combustion' (energy released per mole) change as the number of carbon atoms in an alkane increases?",
        "options": [
          "It increases",
          "It decreases",
          "It remains constant",
          "It becomes zero"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the chain length increases, there are more $\\text{C-H}$ and $\\text{C-C}$ bonds to react, releasing more total energy per mole of fuel."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of internal combustion engines, what is the environmental concern regarding the byproduct nitrogen oxides ($\\text{NO}_{x}$)?",
        "options": [
          "They contribute to acid rain and photochemical smog",
          "They are the primary cause of global warming",
          "They deplete the ozone layer in the troposphere",
          "They have no environmental impact"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While not a product of the alkane itself, the high temperatures of combustion cause nitrogen and oxygen from the air to react, forming $\\text{NO}_{x}$ pollutants."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Methane is the primary component of natural gas. What is the ratio of $\\text{O}_{2}$ molecules to $\\text{CH}_{4}$ molecules required for complete combustion?",
        "options": [
          "$2:1$",
          "$1:1$",
          "$3:1$",
          "$5:2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The balanced equation is $\\text{CH}_{4} + 2\\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_{2} + 2\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is required to initiate the combustion of an alkane, despite the reaction being highly favorable?",
        "options": [
          "Activation energy (e.g., a spark or flame)",
          "A liquid water solvent",
          "Absolute zero temperature",
          "A noble gas catalyst"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkanes are stable at room temperature; an initial input of energy is required to break the first bonds and start the self-sustaining chain reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the oxidation state of carbon during the combustion of methane to carbon dioxide?",
        "options": [
          "It increases from $-4$ to $+4$",
          "It decreases from $+4$ to $-4$",
          "It stays the same at $0$",
          "It increases from $0$ to $+2$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In $\\text{CH}_{4}$, carbon is $-4$. In $\\text{CO}_{2}$, carbon is $+4$. This loss of electrons confirms that combustion is an oxidation process."
