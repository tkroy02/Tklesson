        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alcohols are essentially alkanes where one $H$ atom is replaced by an $-OH$ group. The formula is $C_{n}H_{2n+1}OH$ or $C_{n}H_{2n+2}O$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is a 'secondary' (2°) alcohol defined?",
        "options": [
          "The $-OH$ group is attached to a carbon bonded to two other carbons",
          "The molecule contains exactly two $-OH$ groups",
          "The $-OH$ group is the second substituent on the chain",
          "The alcohol has two carbon atoms in its parent chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Classification (1°, 2°, 3°) depends on the number of alkyl groups attached to the 'carbinol' carbon (the carbon holding the $-OH$ group)."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the classification of 2-methylpropan-2-ol?",

          "Phenol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In 2-methylpropan-2-ol, the $-OH$ is on the central carbon, which is bonded to three methyl groups, making it tertiary."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In IUPAC naming, which suffix is used to indicate the presence of an alcohol group?",

          "-ol",
          "-al",
          "-one",
          "-oic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The terminal '-e' of the alkane name is replaced with '-ol' (e.g., ethane becomes ethanol)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct IUPAC name for $CH_{3}CH(OH)CH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{3}$?",

          "Isopentyl alcohol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The longest chain is five carbons. Numbering begins from the end closest to the $-OH$ group, giving it locant 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A molecule containing two hydroxyl groups is specifically referred to as a:",

          "Triol",
          "Dimer",
          "Dialdehyde"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Diols, such as ethane-1,2-diol (ethylene glycol), contain two alcohol functional groups."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an 'allylic' alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "$CH_{2}=CH-CH_{2}OH$",
          "$CH_{2}=CH-OH$",

          "$CH_{3}CH_{2}OH$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In an allylic alcohol, the $-OH$ group is attached to an $sp^{3}$ carbon that is adjacent to a $C=C$ double bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which group takes priority for numbering the parent chain: an alkyl group or a hydroxyl group?",
        "options": [
          "The hydroxyl group",
          "The alkyl group",
          "They have equal priority; use alphabetical order",
          "The heavier group"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Functional groups like alcohols have higher priority than alkyl or halogen substituents in IUPAC nomenclature."
