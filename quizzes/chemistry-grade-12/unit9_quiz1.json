    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Redox fundamentals, oxidation numbers, and half-reactions",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of redox reactions, what is the definition of oxidation?",
        "options": [
          "The loss of electrons and an increase in oxidation number.",
          "The gain of electrons and a decrease in oxidation number.",
          "The gain of protons and an increase in mass.",
          "The loss of oxygen atoms from a compound."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation is defined by the loss of electrons (OIL RIG), which results in a more positive (increased) oxidation state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the oxidation number of sulfur in the thiosulfate ion ($S_{2}O_{3}^{2-}$)?",
        "options": [
          "+2",
          "+4",
          "+6",
          "-2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxygen is -2. For $S_{2}O_{3}^{2-}$, $2(x) + 3(-2) = -2$. Solving for $x$ gives $2x = 4$, so $x = +2$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a redox reaction, the oxidizing agent is the substance that:",
        "options": [
          "Is reduced and gains electrons.",
          "Is oxidized and loses electrons.",
          "Increases its oxidation number.",
          "Acts as the anode in a cell."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The oxidizing agent causes another species to be oxidized by taking its electrons; therefore, the agent itself is reduced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Identify the species being oxidized in the reaction: $Zn(s) + Cu^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + Cu(s)$.",
        "options": [
          "$Zn(s)$",
          "$Cu^{2+}(aq)$",
          "$Zn^{2+}(aq)$",
          "$Cu(s)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zinc metal changes from an oxidation state of 0 to +2, indicating a loss of electrons (oxidation)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the oxidation state of Manganese in the permanganate ion ($MnO_{4}^{-}$)?",
        "options": [
          "+7",
          "+5",
          "+4",
          "+2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "With four oxygens at -2 each (total -8) and an overall charge of -1, Manganese must be +7 ($x - 8 = -1$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When balancing half-reactions in acidic solution, what is used to balance oxygen atoms?",
        "options": [
          "Water ($H_{2}O$)",
          "Hydroxide ions ($OH^{-}$)",
          "Hydrogen ions ($H^{+}$)",
          "Oxygen gas ($O_{2}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In acidic conditions, $H_{2}O$ is added to balance oxygens, and then $H^{+}$ is used to balance the resulting hydrogens."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a disproportionation reaction?",
        "options": [
          "The same element is simultaneously oxidized and reduced.",
          "Two different metals swap places in a compound.",
          "Electrons are transferred from the cathode to the anode.",
          "A compound breaks down into its constituent elements."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Disproportionation occurs when a single species acts as both the oxidizing and reducing agent, forming two different products with different oxidation states."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the half-reaction $Cr_{2}O_{7}^{2-} \rightarrow 2Cr^{3+}$, how many electrons must be added to balance the charge?",
        "options": [
          "6 electrons on the left side",
          "3 electrons on the right side",
          "6 electrons on the right side",
          "14 electrons on the left side"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The oxidation state of $Cr$ changes from +6 (in dichromate) to +3. Since there are two $Cr$ atoms, a total of 6 electrons must be gained (reduction)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following always stays the same for an atom in its elemental form (e.g., $O_{2}$, $P_{4}$, $Fe$)?",
        "options": [
          "Its oxidation number is 0.",
          "It always acts as a reducing agent.",
          "It is always in a gaseous state.",
          "Its oxidation number is +1."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By definition, the oxidation number of any element in its native, uncombined state is zero."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the oxidation number of a reducing agent during a reaction?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reducing agent loses electrons (is oxidized), so its oxidation number becomes more positive (increases)."
