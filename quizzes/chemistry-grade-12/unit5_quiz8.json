    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following reagents is strong enough to cleave the $C-O$ bond in a simple ether?",
        "options": [
          "Concentrated $HI$ or $HBr$ at high temperature",
          "Dilute $NaOH$ at room temperature",
          "Sodium metal in dry ether",
          "Potassium permanganate ($KMnO_4$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethers are relatively inert but can be cleaved by strong nucleophilic acids ($HI$ or $HBr$). The acid protonates the oxygen, making it a better leaving group for the halide ion to attack."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When one mole of diethyl ether reacts with one mole of cold, concentrated $HI$, what are the products?",
        "options": [
          "Ethanol and iodoethane",
          "Two moles of iodoethane",
          "Two moles of ethanol",
          "Ethene and water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In cold conditions with limited acid, the ether is cleaved once to produce one molecule of alcohol and one molecule of alkyl halide."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens if an ether is heated with an excess of concentrated $HI$?",
        "options": [
          "The initial alcohol formed is further converted into an alkyl iodide",
          "The reaction stops after forming an alcohol",
          "The ether is oxidized to a carboxylic acid",
          "The mixture explodes immediately"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Excess acid will react with the intermediate alcohol to form a second mole of alkyl halide. The net reaction is $R-O-R + 2HI \\rightarrow 2R-I + H_2O$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the cleavage of an unsymmetrical ether ($R-O-R'$) involving a primary and a secondary group via an $S_N2$ mechanism, where does the halide ion attack?",
        "options": [
          "The less hindered (smaller) alkyl group",
          "The more hindered (larger) alkyl group",
          "The oxygen atom directly",
          "It attacks both groups equally"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Under $S_N2$ conditions, the halide nucleophile prefers the less sterically hindered carbon atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What makes epoxides (oxiranes) significantly more reactive than regular ethers?",
        "options": [
          "Ring strain in the three-membered ring",
          "The oxygen atom is more electronegative in a ring",
          "They have no carbon-hydrogen bonds",
          "They are always ionic compounds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The bond angles in a three-membered ring are approx $60^{\\circ}$, far from the ideal $109.5^{\\circ}$. This 'ring strain' makes epoxides very eager to undergo ring-opening reactions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the product of the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of ethylene oxide with water?",
        "options": [
          "Ethane-1,2-diol (Ethylene glycol)",
          "Ethanol",
          "Diethyl ether",
          "Ethanal"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acid-catalyzed hydration of an epoxide opens the ring to form a vicinal diol (a glycol)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When a Grignard reagent ($R-MgX$) reacts with ethylene oxide followed by acid workup, the product is:",
        "options": [
          "A primary alcohol with two additional carbons",
          "A secondary alcohol with one additional carbon",
          "A ketone",
          "An alkane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The nucleophilic $R$ group attacks one of the carbons of the epoxide, opening the ring. This adds a $-CH_2CH_2OH$ unit to the $R$ group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the base-catalyzed ring-opening of an unsymmetrical epoxide, which carbon does the nucleophile attack?",
        "options": [
          "The less substituted carbon atom",
          "The more substituted carbon atom",
          "The oxygen atom",
          "The nucleophile does not attack epoxides in base"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In basic conditions (where steric hindrance dominates), the nucleophile attacks the least hindered carbon ($S_N2$ behavior)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the stereochemistry of epoxide ring-opening?",
        "options": [
          "Anti-addition (the nucleophile and the OH end up trans)",
          "Syn-addition (the nucleophile and the OH end up cis)",
          "Complete racemization",
          "Retention of configuration at both carbons"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the nucleophile attacks from the back side of the $C-O$ bond, the resulting groups are positioned 'anti' to each other."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Ethylene oxide is industrially important as a precursor to which of the following?",
        "options": [
          "Polyester and Antifreeze",
          "Table salt",
          "Natural gas",
