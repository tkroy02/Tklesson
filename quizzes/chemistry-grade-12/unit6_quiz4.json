    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the common name for the product formed when water adds to an aldehyde or ketone?",
        "options": [
          "A hydrate (or gem-diol)",
          "An acetal",
          "An enol",
          "A cyanohydrin"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A hydrate is also known as a geminal diol (gem-diol) because it features two hydroxyl groups attached to the same carbon atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The formation of a hydrate from a carbonyl compound is best described as:",
        "options": [
          "A reversible equilibrium reaction.",
          "An irreversible combustion reaction.",
          "A dehydration reaction.",
          "A substitution reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrate formation is a reversible process where the position of the equilibrium depends heavily on the structure of the carbonyl compound."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following compounds exists almost entirely as a hydrate in an aqueous solution?",
        "options": [
          "Methanal (Formaldehyde)",
          "Propanone (Acetone)",
          "Benzaldehyde",
          "Butan-2-one"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methanal is very small and lacks electron-donating groups to stabilize the carbonyl carbon, making it highly reactive toward water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect do electron-withdrawing groups (like chlorine) have on hydrate stability?",
        "options": [
          "They increase the stability of the hydrate.",
          "They decrease the stability of the hydrate.",
          "They have no effect on hydrate formation.",
          "They prevent the reaction from occurring entirely."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electron-withdrawing groups destabilize the original carbonyl (by making the carbon even more positive) and stabilize the hydrate, shifting the equilibrium toward the hydrate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Chloral hydrate ($Cl_{3}CCH(OH)_{2}$) is a rare example of a stable solid hydrate. Why is it so stable?",
        "options": [
          "The three chlorine atoms strongly withdraw electron density from the carbonyl carbon.",
          "The chlorine atoms form hydrogen bonds with the water solvent.",
          "The molecule is non-polar.",
          "Chlorine acts as a catalyst for the reverse reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The strong inductive effect of the three chlorine atoms makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic, favoring the hydrate form."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the acid-catalyzed mechanism of hydrate formation, what is the purpose of the acid?",
        "options": [
          "To protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbon more electrophilic.",
          "To act as a nucleophile and attack the carbon.",
          "To deprotonate the water molecule.",
          "To shift the equilibrium by removing the product."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acids protonate the $C=O$ oxygen, which increases the positive charge on the carbon and allows the weak nucleophile (water) to attack more easily."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does propanone (acetone) favor the carbonyl form over the hydrate form at equilibrium?",
        "options": [
          "The two methyl groups provide inductive stabilization and steric bulk.",
          "Acetone is a liquid and water is a liquid.",
          "Ketones cannot form hydrates.",
          "Acetone is too polar to react with water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The alkyl groups in ketones release electron density toward the carbonyl carbon, making it less 'hungry' for nucleophiles like water compared to aldehydes."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the 'geminal' part of a gem-diol?",
        "options": [
          "Two functional groups are attached to the same carbon atom.",
          "Two functional groups are attached to adjacent carbon atoms.",
          "The molecule contains a double bond and an alcohol.",
          "The molecule is a cyclic ether."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'Geminal' (from the Latin 'gemini' for twins) refers to two groups on the same carbon, whereas 'vicinal' refers to groups on adjacent carbons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Base-catalyzed hydrate formation involves which species acting as the nucleophile?",
        "options": [
          "Hydroxide ion ($OH^{-}$)",
          "Water molecule ($H_{2}O$)",
          "Hydronium ion ($H_{3}O^{+}$)",
          "The carbonyl oxygen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In basic conditions, $OH^{-}$ is a much stronger nucleophile than neutral water and attacks the carbonyl carbon directly."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the hybridisation of the central carbon in a formaldehyde hydrate molecule?",
        "options": [
          "$sp^{3}$",
          "$sp^{2}$",
          "$sp$",
          "$dsp^{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Once the hydrate is formed, the carbon is bonded to four groups (two $-H$ and two $-OH$) in a tetrahedral arrangement, making it $sp^{3}$ hybridised."
