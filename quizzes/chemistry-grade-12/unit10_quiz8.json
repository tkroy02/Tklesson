        "question": "When using the equation $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$, what is the most common unit conversion error?",
        "options": [
          "Failing to convert $\\Delta S$ from J/mol·K to kJ/mol·K.",

        "question": "Calculate $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for a reaction at 298 K where $\\Delta H^{\\circ} = -95.0\\ kJ/mol$ and $\\Delta S^{\\circ} = -120\\ J/mol\\cdot K$.",
