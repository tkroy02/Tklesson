      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the minimum number of carbon atoms required for an alkane to exhibit chain isomerism?",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methane, ethane, and propane have only one possible arrangement. Butane ($\\text{C}_{4}\\text{H}_{10}$) is the first to have two isomers: n-butane and isobutane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Stereoisomers differ from structural isomers because they have:",

          "Different functional groups",
          "A different number of carbon atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Stereoisomers have atoms connected in the same order, but their orientation in three-dimensional space is different."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Geometric isomerism (cis/trans) is most commonly found in which type of molecules?",

          "Small noble gas molecules"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $\\pi$ bond in alkenes prevents free rotation, allowing for distinct 'cis' and 'trans' arrangements of substituents."

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enantiomers are a type of optical isomerism occurring when a molecule has a chiral center, typically a carbon with four different groups attached."
