    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a coordination complex, the bond between the metal ion and the ligand is best described as a:",
        "options": [
          "Coordinate covalent bond",
          "Ionic bond",
          "Metallic bond",
          "Hydrogen bond"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A coordinate covalent bond (or dative bond) occurs when one atom (the ligand) provides both electrons for the shared pair."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'Lewis Base' in coordination chemistry is represented by:",
        "options": [
          "The ligand",
          "The central metal ion",
          "The counter-ion",
          "The solvent molecule"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ligands have lone pairs of electrons that they donate to the metal ion; therefore, they act as Lewis bases."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the coordination number of the metal in $[Fe(CN)_{6}]^{4-}$?",
        "options": [
          "6",
          "4",
          "2",
          "-4"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coordination number is the total number of coordinate bonds formed with the metal. Here, six cyanide ligands each form one bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a 'bidentate' ligand?",
        "options": [
          "Ethylenediamine (en)",
          "Ammonia ($NH_{3}$)",
          "Chloride ($Cl^{-}$)",
          "Water ($H_{2}O$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bidentate ligands have two donor atoms that can coordinate to the metal simultaneously. Ethylenediamine uses two nitrogen atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the oxidation state of Cobalt in $[Co(NH_{3})_{5}Cl]Cl_{2}$?",
        "options": [
          "+3",
          "+2",
          "+1",
          "+5"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The complex ion is $[Co(NH_{3})_{5}Cl]^{2+}$ because there are two $Cl^{-}$ counter-ions. $x + 5(0) + 1(-1) = +2 \\Rightarrow x = +3$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which term describes a ligand that can wrap around a metal ion and bind using six donor atoms?",
        "options": [
          "Hexadentate",
          "Monodentate",
          "Chelating agent",
          "Ambidentate"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "EDTA is a classic example of a hexadentate ligand. It is also a chelating agent, but 'hexadentate' specifically defines the number of bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A 'chelate' is most likely to be more stable than a similar complex with monodentate ligands due to:",
        "options": [
          "The chelate effect (entropy increase)",
          "Stronger ionic attraction",
          "The absence of d-orbitals",
          "Lower temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chelating ligands displace more individual molecules (like water) from the metal, increasing the disorder (entropy) of the system."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the coordination number of Ag in $[Ag(NH_{3})_{2}]^{+}$?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "1",
          "3",
          "0"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Silver(I) typically forms linear complexes with two monodentate ligands, giving it a coordination number of 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the formula $[Ni(en)_{3}]Cl_{2}$, which part constitutes the 'coordination sphere'?",
        "options": [
          "$[Ni(en)_{3}]$",
          "$Cl_{2}$",
          "The entire formula",
          "Only the Ni ion"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The coordination sphere consists of the central metal and the ligands directly attached to it, usually enclosed in square brackets."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following ligands is 'ambidentate'?",
        "options": [
          "Thiocyanate ($SCN^{-}$)",
          "Oxalate ($C_{2}O_{4}^{2-}$)",
          "Ethylenediamine",
          "Ammine ($NH_{3}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ambidentate ligands can bond through more than one atom (e.g., S or N in $SCN^{-}$), but they only use one atom at a time."
