    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary structural requirement for a monomer to undergo addition polymerization?",
        "options": [
          "It must contain a carbon-carbon double bond ($C=C$).",
          "It must have two different functional groups.",
          "It must be a saturated hydrocarbon.",
          "It must be able to eliminate a water molecule."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Addition polymerization (chain-growth) involves the 'opening' of pi bonds in unsaturated monomers like alkenes to form long saturated chains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement correctly describes the change in empirical formula during addition polymerization?",
        "options": [
          "The empirical formula of the polymer is the same as the monomer.",
          "The polymer has fewer hydrogen atoms than the monomer.",
          "The polymer has a higher carbon-to-hydrogen ratio.",
          "The empirical formula changes as small molecules are lost."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In addition polymerization, no atoms are lost. The polymer is simply a repeat of the monomer unit, so the empirical formula remains identical."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the three distinct stages of the chain-growth mechanism?",

          "Activation, Elongation, and Fragmentation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The process begins with an initiator (Initiation), continues as monomers add to the active center (Propagation), and ends when two active chains meet or an inhibitor is added (Termination)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Poly(chloroethene), also known as PVC, is formed from which monomer?",
        "options": [
          "Vinyl chloride ($CH_{2}=CHCl$)",
          "Ethene ($CH_{2}=CH_{2}$)",
          "Tetrafluoroethene ($CF_{2}=CF_{2}$)",
          "Propene ($CH_{2}=CHCH_{3}$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chloroethene (commonly called vinyl chloride) polymerizes to form Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)."
      },

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a common initiator used in free-radical addition polymerization?",
        "options": [
          "Organic peroxides ($R-O-O-R$)",
          "Concentrated sulfuric acid",
          "Sodium hydroxide",
          "Noble gases"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Peroxides contain a weak $O-O$ bond that easily undergoes homolytic fission to produce free radicals that start the chain reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does the presence of side chains (branching) affect the properties of poly(ethene)?",
        "options": [
          "It lowers the density and melting point by preventing close packing.",
          "It increases the strength and crystallinity of the plastic.",
          "It makes the polymer chemically reactive with water.",
          "It changes the polymer from a thermoplastic to a thermoset."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Branching prevents the polymer chains from packing closely together, resulting in Low-Density Polyethene (LDPE), which is more flexible and has a lower melting point."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the repeat unit of poly(propene)?",
        "options": [
          "$-[CH_{2}-CH(CH_{3})]-$",
          "$-[CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}]-$",
          "$-[CH(CH_{3})-CH(CH_{3})]-$",
          "$-[CH=CHCH_{3}]-$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The repeat unit reflects the two carbons of the original double bond, with the methyl group treated as a side chain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which polymer is produced by the polymerization of tetrafluoroethene?",

          "Polystyrene",
          "Polypropylene",
          "Poly(methyl methacrylate)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tetrafluoroethene ($CF_{2}=CF_{2}$) forms Polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE), known for its non-stick properties and chemical resistance."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the context of polymers, what does 'thermoplastic' mean?",
        "options": [
          "The polymer can be melted and reshaped multiple times.",
          "The polymer decomposes immediately upon heating.",
          "The polymer contains permanent cross-links between chains.",
          "The polymer is only formed at very high temperatures."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Addition polymers are typically thermoplastics because the chains are held together by weak intermolecular forces that can be overcome by heat."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would be the result of a 'termination' step in radical polymerization?",
        "options": [
          "Two radicals combine to form a stable covalent bond.",
          "A radical reacts with a monomer to extend the chain.",
          "A peroxide bond breaks to form two radicals.",
          "The polymer chain dissolves in a solvent."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Termination occurs when the concentration of free radicals decreases because they react with each other to form a stable non-radical species."
