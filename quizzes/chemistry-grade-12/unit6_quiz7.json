    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Redox reactions of aldehydes and ketones",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the primary product when an aldehyde is oxidized?",
        "options": [
          "A carboxylic acid",
          "A secondary alcohol",
          "A ketone",
          "An ester"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aldehydes are easily oxidized because of the hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is replaced by an -OH group to form a carboxylic acid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are ketones generally resistant to mild oxidation?",
        "options": [
          "They lack a hydrogen atom attached directly to the carbonyl carbon.",
          "The carbonyl carbon is already in its highest oxidation state.",
          "The alkyl groups are too bulky for oxygen to approach.",
          "Ketones are non-polar and do not react with aqueous oxidants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Oxidation of a carbonyl requires the breaking of a C-H bond on the carbonyl carbon. Since ketones are $R-CO-R$, they only have C-C bonds, which are much harder to break."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which reagent is commonly used to reduce an aldehyde to a primary alcohol?",
        "options": [
          "$NaBH_{4}$ (Sodium borohydride)",
          "$KMnO_{4}$ (Potassium permanganate)",
          "$K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$ (Potassium dichromate)",
          "$O_{3}$ (Ozone)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$NaBH_{4}$ is a common hydride-donating reducing agent that converts aldehydes to primary alcohols and ketones to secondary alcohols."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Reducing a ketone with $LiAlH_{4}$ followed by water produces:",
        "options": [
          "A secondary alcohol",
          "A primary alcohol",
          "An aldehyde",
          "A carboxylic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since the carbonyl carbon in a ketone is bonded to two other carbons, adding two hydrogens (via reduction) results in a secondary alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these reagents would successfully oxidize propanal to propanoic acid?",
        "options": [
          "Acidified $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$",
          "$LiAlH_{4}$",
          "$H_{2}$ with a Nickel catalyst",
          "$NaBH_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acidified potassium dichromate is a strong oxidizing agent that readily converts aldehydes into carboxylic acids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reduction of a carbonyl group, the hydride ion ($H^{-}$) acts as a(n):",
        "options": [
          "Nucleophile",
          "Electrophile",
          "Acid",
          "Leaving group"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The $H^{-}$ ion from $NaBH_{4}$ or $LiAlH_{4}$ is electron-rich and attacks the electrophilic (δ+) carbonyl carbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement correctly compares $LiAlH_{4}$ and $NaBH_{4}$?",
        "options": [
          "$LiAlH_{4}$ is a stronger reducing agent and reacts violently with water.",
          "$NaBH_{4}$ is a stronger reducing agent and is used in anhydrous ethers.",
          "Both reagents can reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols.",
          "$LiAlH_{4}$ can only reduce aldehydes, not ketones."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "$LiAlH_{4}$ is much more reactive and must be used in dry solvents; $NaBH_{4}$ is milder and can be used in ethanol or water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the result of the 'Clemmensen Reduction' (Zn(Hg) and HCl) on a ketone?",
        "options": [
          "The carbonyl group is reduced all the way to a $CH_{2}$ group (alkane).",
          "The ketone is oxidized to an ester.",
          "The ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol.",
          "The ketone is converted into a cyanohydrin."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Clemmensen reduction is a specialized method to completely remove the oxygen and turn the $C=O$ into a $CH_{2}$ group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When propanone is treated with $NaBH_{4}$, the product is:",

          "Propan-1-ol",
          "Propanal",
          "Propanoic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Propanone is a ketone; reduction of a ketone yields the corresponding secondary alcohol, which is propan-2-ol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Catalytic hydrogenation (using $H_{2}$ and $Pt$ or $Ni$) of an aldehyde yields:",

          "A primary alcohol",
          "A carboxylic acid",
          "An ether",
          "A ketone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like alkenes, the $C=O$ bond can be hydrogenated across the double bond to produce an alcohol."
