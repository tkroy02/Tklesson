    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the number of signals (peaks) in a proton ($^{1}$H) NMR spectrum represent?",
        "options": [
          "The number of different environments of hydrogen atoms.",
          "The total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.",
          "The number of carbon atoms in the molecule.",
          "The number of double bonds present."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each distinct chemical environment for hydrogen atoms produces a separate signal in the NMR spectrum. Equivalent hydrogens appear as a single peak."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The 'chemical shift' ($\delta$) in NMR is measured in which units?",
        "options": [
          "Parts per million (ppm)",
          "Hertz (Hz)",
          "Wavenumbers ($cm^{-1}$)",
          "Mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Chemical shift is a relative measure of the resonance frequency compared to a reference standard, expressed in ppm to remain independent of the magnetic field strength."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which substance is commonly used as the internal standard (reference) in $^{1}$H NMR, set at 0 ppm?",
        "options": [
          "Tetramethylsilane (TMS)",
          "Deuterated chloroform ($CDCl_{3}$)",
          "Benzene",
          "Water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "TMS is used because its 12 hydrogens are all equivalent, highly shielded, and produce a single sharp peak that is well away from most organic signals."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In NMR, what does the area under a signal (integration) tell us?",
        "options": [
          "The relative number of hydrogen atoms in that specific environment.",
          "The distance of the hydrogens from the oxygen atom.",
          "The boiling point of the substance.",
          "The purity of the sample."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The integration or 'step height' of a peak is directly proportional to the number of protons contributing to that signal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to the $n+1$ rule, if a proton has 2 neighboring protons on an adjacent carbon, what will its signal look like?",
        "options": [
          "A triplet",
          "A doublet",
          "A quartet",
          "A singlet"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The splitting pattern follows the $n+1$ rule, where $n$ is the number of neighboring protons. For 2 neighbors, $2+1=3$ (a triplet)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "A signal that appears as a 'quartet' indicates that the adjacent carbon atom has how many hydrogens?",
        "options": [
          "3",
          "4",
          "2",
          "1"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A quartet ($1:3:3:1$ ratio) is caused by $3$ neighboring protons ($3+1=4$)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does 'shielding' refer to in the context of NMR?",
        "options": [
          "Electrons circulating around the nucleus that oppose the external magnetic field.",
          "The use of lead containers to prevent radiation leakage.",
          "The presence of an oxygen atom directly bonded to the hydrogen.",
          "The protection of the sample from light."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electrons create local magnetic fields that 'shield' the nucleus from the full strength of the external magnet, moving the signal 'upfield' (lower ppm)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following would cause a 'deshielding' effect, moving a proton signal 'downfield' (higher ppm)?",
        "options": [
          "An electronegative atom like Oxygen or Chlorine nearby.",
          "A large number of neighboring methyl groups.",
          "The addition of more TMS to the sample.",
          "Decreasing the frequency of the radio waves."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Electronegative atoms pull electron density away from the hydrogen nucleus, leaving it more exposed (deshielded) to the external magnetic field."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How many signals would you expect to see in the $^{1}$H NMR spectrum of propanone ($CH_{3}COCH_{3}$)?",
        "options": [
          "One",
          "Two",
          "Three",
          "Six"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Propanone is symmetrical, and all six hydrogens are in identical chemical environments; therefore, they produce only one singlet."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are deuterated solvents (like $CDCl_{3}$ or $D_{2}O$) used instead of regular solvents in NMR?",
        "options": [
          "Deuterium ($^{2}$H) does not produce a signal in the range where $^{1}$H NMR is measured.",
          "Deuterium is more soluble in organic compounds.",
          "Deuterated solvents are cheaper and easier to dispose of.",
          "Regular solvents would react violently with the magnetic field."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If we used regular $CHCl_{3}$, the solvent's own hydrogen signal would be so huge it would swamp the signals from the sample we are trying to measure."
