    "subtitle": "2.1: Alkanes Properties",
    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Alkane structure and characteristics",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Alkanes are known as 'paraffins' because they exhibit very low reactivity toward most chemical reagents. This is primarily due to:",
        "options": [
          "The high strength and non-polarity of $\\text{C-C}$ and $\\text{C-H}$ bonds",
          "The presence of unstable $\\pi$ bonds",
          "Their ability to form strong hydrogen bonds",
          "The low electronegativity of carbon compared to hydrogen"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alkanes consist entirely of $\\sigma$ bonds. The small difference in electronegativity between $\\text{C}$ and $\\text{H}$ makes the bonds non-polar and very stable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the general physical state of the first four straight-chain alkanes (methane through butane) at room temperature?",
        "options": [
          "Gases",
          "Liquids",
          "Solids",
          "Aqueous solutions"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Low molecular weight alkanes have very weak London dispersion forces, meaning they lack enough intermolecular attraction to condense into liquids at room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As the number of carbon atoms in an alkane chain increases, how do the boiling point and density typically change?",
        "options": [
          "Both boiling point and density increase",
          "Boiling point increases while density decreases",
          "Boiling point decreases while density increases",
          "Both boiling point and density remain constant"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased surface area leads to stronger London dispersion forces (higher boiling point), and increased molar mass leads to higher density."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are alkanes considered 'hydrophobic' when mixed with water?",
        "options": [
          "They are non-polar and cannot form hydrogen bonds with water",
          "They react violently with water molecules",
          "They are more polar than water and repel it",
          "They contain hydroxyl groups that repel water"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water is highly polar and forms hydrogen bonds. Alkanes are non-polar and only exhibit dispersion forces, making them insoluble in water ('like dissolves like')."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the homologous series of alkanes, what is the exact molar mass increase (in $\\text{g/mol}$) between successive members?",
        "options": [
          "$14.03 \\text{ g/mol}$",
          "$12.01 \\text{ g/mol}$",
          "$16.05 \\text{ g/mol}$",
          "$2.02 \\text{ g/mol}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Each member differs by a methylene group ($\\text{CH}_{2}$). One carbon ($12.01$) plus two hydrogens ($2.02$) equals approximately $14.03 \\text{ g/mol}$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following alkane isomers would you expect to have the **lowest** boiling point?",
        "options": [
          "2,2-dimethylpropane (neopentane)",
          "2-methylbutane (isopentane)",
          "n-pentane",
          "n-hexane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Increased branching makes a molecule more spherical, reducing its surface area and weakening the London dispersion forces compared to straight-chain isomers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The melting points of alkanes generally increase with molecular mass, but they show a 'sawtooth' pattern because:",
        "options": [
          "Alkanes with an even number of carbons pack more efficiently in a crystal lattice",
          "Alkanes with an odd number of carbons are more polar",
          "Even-numbered alkanes have more double bonds",
          "Odd-numbered alkanes are always gaseous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Symmetry and packing efficiency in the solid state affect melting points. Even-numbered chains fit together better than odd-numbered ones."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which statement about the solubility of alkanes is correct?",
        "options": [
          "Alkanes are soluble in organic solvents like benzene or ether",
          "Alkanes are highly soluble in all polar solvents",
          "Solubility in water increases as the chain length increases",
          "Alkanes are only soluble in liquid metals"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Non-polar alkanes dissolve well in other non-polar or weakly polar organic solvents due to similar intermolecular forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the hybridization and bond angle of every carbon atom in a saturated alkane chain?",
        "options": [
          "$sp^{3}$ and $109.5^{\\circ}$",
          "$sp^{2}$ and $120^{\\circ}$",
          "$sp$ and $180^{\\circ}$",
          "$dsp^{2}$ and $90^{\\circ}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Saturated alkanes contain only single bonds, meaning each carbon is bonded to four other atoms in a tetrahedral geometry."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Alkanes are primarily obtained on a large scale from which natural source?",
        "options": [
          "Petroleum (crude oil) and natural gas",
          "Fermentation of sugars",
          "Oxidation of alcohols",
          "Reduction of carboxylic acids"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, mostly alkanes, which are separated by fractional distillation for use as fuels and lubricants."
