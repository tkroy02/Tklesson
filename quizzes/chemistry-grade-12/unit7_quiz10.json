          "Butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Glycerol is a three-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group on every carbon, making it propane-1,2,3-triol."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a saturated fatty acid?",
        "options": [
          "A long-chain carboxylic acid with no $C=C$ double bonds.",

          "An acid that has been dissolved in a saturated solution.",
          "A short-chain acid like ethanoic acid."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Saturated fats contain only $C-C$ single bonds in their hydrocarbon tails, allowing them to pack tightly and usually remain solid at room temperature."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Vegetable oils are often converted into solid fats (like margarine) through which process?",
        "options": [
          "Catalytic hydrogenation",
          "Saponification",
          "Esterification",
          "Fermentation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hydrogenation adds hydrogen across the $C=C$ double bonds of unsaturated oils, increasing their melting point and making them solid."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does soap have cleaning properties in water?",
        "options": [
          "It has a hydrophilic 'head' and a hydrophobic 'tail'.",
          "It is highly acidic and dissolves dirt.",
          "It reacts chemically with grease to form water.",
          "It lowers the temperature of the water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The non-polar tail dissolves in grease (hydrophobic), while the ionic head stays in the water (hydrophilic), forming micelles that wash away dirt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens when soap is used in 'hard water' containing $Ca^{2+}$ or $Mg^{2+}$ ions?",
        "options": [
          "An insoluble 'scum' or precipitate is formed.",
          "The soap becomes more effective at cleaning.",
          "The soap dissolves into a gas.",
          "The water turns into a solid gel."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Calcium and magnesium ions react with the soap carboxylates to form insoluble salts, which reduces the soap's effectiveness and leaves a residue."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a byproduct of the soap-making industry?",

          "Glycerol",
          "Ethanol",
          "Ethanoic acid",
          "Methane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When the three ester bonds of a triglyceride are broken, one molecule of glycerol is released for every three molecules of soap produced."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Unsaturated fats (oils) tend to be liquids at room temperature because:",
        "options": [
          "The 'kinks' in their chains caused by $C=C$ double bonds prevent tight packing.",
          "They have lower molecular weights than solid fats.",
          "They cannot form van der Waals forces.",
          "They are more polar than saturated fats."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cis-double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids create bends in the chain, preventing the molecules from stacking closely together, which lowers the melting point."
