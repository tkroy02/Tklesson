    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the '2' in the term SN2 stand for?",
        "options": [
          "Bimolecular: two molecules are involved in the rate-determining step",
          "Two-step: the reaction occurs in two distinct stages",
          "Secondary: the reaction only happens on secondary haloalkanes",
          "Second-order: the reaction rate depends only on the nucleophile"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "SN2 stands for Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular. Both the substrate and the nucleophile are involved in the single, rate-determining step."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the mechanism of an SN2 reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Concerted: bond-breaking and bond-forming occur simultaneously",
          "Stepwise: a carbocation is formed first",
          "Radical: involves the formation of unpaired electrons",
          "Elimination: involves the removal of a proton"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "SN2 is a concerted reaction, meaning it happens in one motion without any intermediates."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From which direction does the nucleophile attack the carbon atom in an SN2 reaction?",
        "options": [
          "From the side directly opposite the leaving group (back-side attack)",
          "From the same side as the leaving group (front-side attack)",
          "From a 90° angle relative to the leaving group",
          "The attack direction is random"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The nucleophile must attack from the back side to avoid electron repulsion from the leaving group and to overlap with the empty anti-bonding orbital."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the stereochemical outcome of an SN2 reaction at a chiral center?",
        "options": [
          "Inversion of configuration (Walden inversion)",
          "Racemization",
          "Retention of configuration",
          "Formation of a meso compound"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Due to the back-side attack, the three remaining groups on the carbon 'flip' like an umbrella in the wind, resulting in an inverted configuration."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following haloalkanes is the MOST reactive in an SN2 reaction?",
        "options": [
          "CH3Br (Methyl bromide)",
          "CH3CH2Br (Ethyl bromide)",
          "(CH3)2CHBr (Isopropyl bromide)",
          "(CH3)3CBr (tert-Butyl bromide)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "SN2 is highly sensitive to steric hindrance. Methyl and primary halides are most reactive because they offer the least resistance to the incoming nucleophile."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the rate law for an SN2 reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Rate = k[Substrate][Nucleophile]",
          "Rate = k[Substrate]",
          "Rate = k[Nucleophile]",
          "Rate = k[Substrate]^2"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The reaction is second-order overall because both the substrate and nucleophile are part of the single transition state."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the structure of the transition state in an SN2 reaction?",
        "options": [
          "Pentacoordinate: carbon is temporarily bonded to five groups",
          "Tricocoordinate: a planar carbocation",
          "Dicoordinate: a linear radical",
          "It is a stable molecule with no charge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the transition state, the nucleophile is partially bonded and the leaving group is partially detached, creating a fleeting 5-bonded carbon arrangement."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which type of solvent is generally preferred for SN2 reactions?",
        "options": [
          "Polar aprotic solvents (e.g., DMSO, acetone)",
          "Polar protic solvents (e.g., water, ethanol)",
          "Non-polar solvents (e.g., benzene)",
          "Acidic solvents"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Polar aprotic solvents do not 'cage' the nucleophile with hydrogen bonds, leaving the nucleophile more 'naked' and reactive."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are tertiary (3°) haloalkanes virtually unreactive via the SN2 pathway?",
        "options": [
          "Steric hindrance prevents the nucleophile from reaching the carbon",
          "They cannot form stable carbocations",
          "The C-X bond is too strong to break in one step",
          "Tertiary carbons are not electronegative enough"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The three bulky alkyl groups surrounding the alpha-carbon physically block the nucleophile from attacking the back side."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the concentration of the nucleophile is tripled and the concentration of the substrate is doubled, how does the SN2 reaction rate change?",
        "options": [
          "The rate increases by a factor of 6",
          "The rate increases by a factor of 5",
          "The rate increases by a factor of 2",
          "The rate remains the same"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rate = $k[2][3] = 6k$. Since the reaction is first-order with respect to both components, the effects are multiplicative."
