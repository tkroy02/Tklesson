    "subject": "Chemistry",
    "topic": "Structure, bonding, and physical properties of carboxylic acids",
    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which functional groups combine to form the 'carboxyl' group?",
        "options": [
          "Carbonyl and hydroxyl",
          "Carbonyl and ether",
          "Hydroxyl and alkoxy",
          "Carbonyl and amino"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The name 'carboxyl' is a portmanteau of carbonyl ($C=O$) and hydroxyl ($-OH$), which are both bonded to the same carbon atom."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Carboxylic acids have higher boiling points than alcohols of similar molar mass because:",
        "options": [
          "They can form stable dimers via two hydrogen bonds per pair of molecules.",
          "They are non-polar and have high London dispersion forces.",
          "They contain more carbon atoms in their parent chain.",
          "They cannot form hydrogen bonds with water."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Carboxylic acids form dimeric structures in the liquid and even gas phase, effectively doubling their molecular size and increasing the energy required to boil them."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are carboxylic acids much stronger acids than alcohols?",
        "options": [
          "The resulting carboxylate ion is resonance-stabilized.",
          "The oxygen in an alcohol is more electronegative than in an acid.",
          "The $O-H$ bond in an acid is shorter and stronger than in an alcohol.",
          "Carboxylic acids are more soluble in water than alcohols."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a carboxylic acid loses a proton, the negative charge is delocalized over both oxygen atoms through resonance, making the carboxylate ion very stable."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for the simplest carboxylic acid, $HCOOH$?",
        "options": [
          "Methanoic acid",
          "Ethanoic acid",
          "Formic acid",
          "Carbonic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Methanoic acid is the IUPAC name for a one-carbon acid. Formic acid is its common name."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the hybridisation of the carboxyl carbon atom?",
        "options": [
          "$sp^{2}$",
          "$sp^{3}$",
          "$sp$",
          "$dsp^{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like aldehydes and ketones, the carboxyl carbon is bonded to three other atoms with one pi bond, resulting in a trigonal planar geometry and $sp^{2}$ hybridisation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the solubility trend of carboxylic acids in water?",
        "options": [
          "Solubility decreases as the length of the hydrocarbon chain increases.",
          "Solubility increases as the length of the hydrocarbon chain increases.",
          "All carboxylic acids are completely miscible in water.",
          "Carboxylic acids are only soluble in non-polar solvents."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Smaller acids (up to 4 carbons) are miscible in water due to hydrogen bonding, but as the hydrophobic alkyl chain grows, solubility drops sharply."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What effect does an electron-withdrawing group (like Chlorine) have on the acidity of a carboxylic acid?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the acidity by stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate ion.",
          "It decreases the acidity by making the $O-H$ bond stronger.",
          "It has no effect on the $pKa$ value.",
          "It makes the molecule a strong base."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Inductive electron withdrawal pulls electron density away from the $O-H$ bond and the resulting negative charge, making it easier for the proton to leave."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for a benzene ring directly attached to a carboxyl group?",
        "options": [
          "Benzoic acid",
          "Phenylmethanoic acid",
          "Benzenoic acid",
          "Carboxybenzene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Benzoic acid is the standard IUPAC name for $C_{6}H_{5}COOH$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following acids would you expect to be the strongest?",
        "options": [
          "Trichloroethanoic acid",
          "Ethanoic acid",
          "Chloroethanoic acid",
          "Dichloroethanoic acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The more electron-withdrawing groups attached to the alpha-carbon, the more the carboxylate ion is stabilized, making trichloroethanoic acid the strongest of the list."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the naming of a carboxylic acid, where does the numbering of the parent chain always start?",
        "options": [
          "At the carboxyl carbon",
          "At the end furthest from the carboxyl group",
          "At the first substituent",
          "It depends on the number of double bonds"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carboxyl carbon is always C1 because it is a terminal functional group with the highest priority in IUPAC nomenclature."
