    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the IUPAC name of a coordination compound, which part is listed first?",
        "options": [
          "The cation",
          "The anion",
          "The central metal",
          "The ligands in alphabetical order"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Just like simple ionic salts (e.g., sodium chloride), the cation is always named before the anion."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How are ligands ordered within the name of a complex ion?",
        "options": [
          "Alphabetically by ligand name",
          "By the charge of the ligand",
          "By the size of the ligand",
          "Metal first, then ligands"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ligands are listed in alphabetical order regardless of their charge. Numerical prefixes (di-, tri-, etc.) are ignored for alphabetizing."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for the $H_{2}O$ ligand in a coordination complex?",

          "Aquo"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Water is named 'aqua'. Other special neutral names include 'ammine' for $NH_{3}$ and 'carbonyl' for $CO$."

        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Anionic ligands ending in '-ide' are changed to end in:",

          "-o",
          "-ide",
          "-ate",
          "-ic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Anionic ligands change their suffix to -o. For example, chloride becomes chloro, and cyanide becomes cyano."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the complex ion has a negative net charge (anionic complex), the metal name must end in:",
        "options": [
          "-ate",
          "-ide",
          "-ium",
          "-ic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In anionic complexes, the metal name is modified with the suffix -ate. For example, cobalt becomes cobaltate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for the complex $[Co(NH_{3})_{6}]Cl_{3}$?",

          "Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride",
          "Hexaamminecobalt chloride(III)",

          "Hexaamminecobaltate(III) chloride"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ligand (hexaammine) + metal (cobalt) + oxidation state (III) + counter-ion (chloride)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which prefix is used for a bidentate ligand like ethylenediamine if there are two of them present?",
        "options": [
          "Bis-",
          "Di-",
          "Bi-",
          "Tris-"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For ligands that already contain a numerical prefix (like ethylenediamine) or are complex, bis-, tris-, and tetrakis- are used instead of di-, tri-, and tetra-."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the metal Iron in an anionic complex?",

          "Ferrate",
          "Ironate",
          "Ferric",
          "Ferrous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Some metals use their Latin roots in anionic complexes. Iron becomes ferrate, copper becomes cuprate, and lead becomes plumbate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What does the Roman numeral in parentheses indicate in the name 'Tetrachlorocuprate(II)'?",
        "options": [
          "The oxidation state of the central metal",
          "The net charge of the complex ion",
          "The number of ligands attached",
          "The coordination number"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Roman numeral specifies the oxidation state of the central metal atom/ion."

          "Platinum(II) diamminedichloro"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Alphabetical order: ammine comes before chloro. The complex is neutral, so the metal name remains platinum."
