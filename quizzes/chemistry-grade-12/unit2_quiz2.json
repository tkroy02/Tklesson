    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When naming a branched alkane, if two different carbon chains have the same maximum length, which one should be selected as the parent chain?",
        "options": [
          "The chain with the greater number of substituents",
          "The chain that contains the fewest branches",
          "The chain that is drawn in a straight horizontal line",
          "The chain with the highest molar mass"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IUPAC rules specify that the chain with more branches is the parent to ensure the substituents remain as simple as possible."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct IUPAC name for an alkane with a seven-carbon parent chain and two methyl groups located on the second and fourth carbons?",
        "options": [
          "2,4-dimethylheptane",
          "2-methyl-4-methylheptane",
          "4,6-dimethylheptane",
          "2,4-methylethylheptane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The prefix 'di-' indicates two methyl groups, and the locants 2 and 4 mark their positions on the heptane chain. Numbering starts from the end giving the lowest locant set."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the name 4-ethyl-2,2-dimethylhexane, why is 'ethyl' listed before 'dimethyl'?",
        "options": [
          "Alphabetizing is based on the name of the substituent, ignoring numerical prefixes like 'di-'",
          "The ethyl group is heavier than a single methyl group",
          "The locant 4 has a higher priority than the locant 2",
          "Ethyl groups always take priority over methyl groups in any numbering system"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For alphabetical ordering, 'e' in ethyl is compared to 'm' in methyl; multiplicity prefixes like 'di' are not part of the alphabetizing process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following alkyl groups is a branched substituent containing four carbon atoms attached to the parent chain via a secondary carbon?",
        "options": [
          "sec-butyl",
          "isobutyl",
          "tert-butyl",
          "n-butyl"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'sec-' prefix indicates the attachment point is the second (secondary) carbon of a four-carbon chain."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for the following structure: $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3})\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "3-methylhexane",
          "2-ethylpentane",
          "4-methylhexane",
          "Isoheptane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The longest continuous chain contains six carbons. The methyl group is on the third carbon when numbering from the end closest to the branch."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When numbering a chain where a substituent is equidistant from both ends, how is the starting end determined?",
        "options": [
          "The end that gives the first-listed alphabetical substituent the lower number",
          "Always start from the left side of the drawing",
          "The end closer to the larger substituent",
          "The end with fewer hydrogen atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If numbering is identical from both ends, alphabetical priority of the substituents acts as the tie-breaker."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for a six-carbon parent chain with a methyl group on carbon 2 and an ethyl group on carbon 4?",
        "options": [
          "4-ethyl-2-methylhexane",
          "2-methyl-4-ethylhexane",
          "3-ethyl-5-methylhexane",
          "4-ethyl-2-methylheptane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This name correctly lists ethyl before methyl alphabetically and provides the lowest locant set (2,4 is lower than 3,5)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which prefix is used in alphabetizing if it is considered part of the substituent name rather than a multiplier?",
        "options": [
          "iso-",
          "di-",
          "sec-",
          "tri-"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike italicized prefixes (sec-, tert-) or multipliers (di-, tri-), 'iso-' is considered part of the substituent's base name for alphabetical sorting."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{2}\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_{3})\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "2,2,3-trimethylpentane",

          "2-tert-butylbutane",
          "2,2-dimethyl-3-methylpentane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The five-carbon chain (pentane) has three methyl groups. Numbering from the left gives the lowest possible set of locants: (2, 2, 3)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the name 2,3,5-trimethylheptane, how many carbon atoms are there in the entire molecule?",
        "options": [
          "$10$",
          "$7$",
          "$13$",
          "$9$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Heptane (7 carbons) + three methyl groups (3 carbons) = 10 total carbon atoms."
