    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why do alcohols have significantly higher boiling points than alkanes of similar molar mass?",
        "options": [
          "They can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds",
          "They have stronger London dispersion forces",
          "The $C-O$ bond is stronger than the $C-C$ bond",
          "Alcohols are always found as solids at room temperature"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The highly electronegative oxygen atom creates a strong dipole. Hydrogen atoms attached to oxygen can form hydrogen bonds with lone pairs on neighboring oxygen atoms, requiring more energy to overcome."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the solubility of small-chain alcohols (like methanol and ethanol) in water?",
        "options": [
          "Completely miscible (infinite solubility)",
          "Slightly soluble",
          "Completely insoluble",
          "Soluble only at temperatures above $100^{\\circ}C$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Small alcohols can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, allowing them to mix in all proportions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What happens to the water solubility of alcohols as the length of the alkyl chain increases?",
        "options": [
          "Solubility decreases",
          "Solubility increases",
          "Solubility remains constant",
          "Solubility depends only on the number of oxygen atoms"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the non-polar (hydrophobic) hydrocarbon chain grows, it overrides the polar effect of the $-OH$ group, making the molecule less compatible with water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Comparing $1$-propanol and propane, which statement is true?",
        "options": [
          "$1$-propanol is a liquid at room temperature while propane is a gas",
          "Propane has a higher boiling point because it is non-polar",
          "Both have identical boiling points due to similar mass",
          "$1$-propanol is less dense than propane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Propane ($BP \\approx -42^{\\circ}C$) lacks hydrogen bonding, whereas $1$-propanol ($BP \\approx 97^{\\circ}C$) is held together by strong intermolecular forces."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Among isomeric alcohols, how does branching affect the boiling point?",
        "options": [
          "Branching decreases the boiling point",
          "Branching increases the boiling point",
          "Branching has no effect on boiling point",
          "Branching only affects the melting point"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Similar to alkanes, branching reduces the surface area available for London dispersion forces, leading to a lower boiling point for branched isomers compared to straight chains."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which alcohol would you expect to have the highest boiling point?",
        "options": [
          "Ethane-$1,2$-diol (Ethylene glycol)",
          "Ethanol",
          "Methanol",
          "Propane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Ethane-$1,2$-diol has two $-OH$ groups, allowing for more extensive hydrogen bonding per molecule than ethanol or methanol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The $-OH$ group in alcohols is described as being:",
        "options": [
          "Hydrophilic (water-loving)",
          "Hydrophobic (water-fearing)",
          "Non-polar",
          "Ionic"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hydroxyl group is hydrophilic because it can participate in hydrogen bonding with water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary intermolecular force between molecules of ethanol?",
        "options": [
          "Hydrogen bonding",
          "Ionic bonding",
          "Covalent bonding",
          "Metallic bonding"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "While ethanol has London forces and dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding is the dominant force determining its physical properties."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is true regarding the density of most simple alcohols?",
        "options": [
          "They are generally less dense than water",
          "They are significantly denser than water",
          "They have the same density as liquid mercury",
          "They are only dense in the gas phase"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Most liquid alcohols have densities between $0.78$ and $0.85$ g/mL, making them lighter than water ($1.00$ g/mL)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does $1$-butanol have a higher boiling point than diethyl ether, despite having the same molecular formula ($C_{4}H_{10}O$)?",
        "options": [
          "$1$-butanol can form hydrogen bonds; diethyl ether cannot",
          "Diethyl ether is a much larger molecule",
          "$1$-butanol is an ionic compound",
          "The ether oxygen is not electronegative"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Isomeric ethers do not have a hydrogen atom bonded directly to oxygen, so they cannot form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with themselves, resulting in lower boiling points."
