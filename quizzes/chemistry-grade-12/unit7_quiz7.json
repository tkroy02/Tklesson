    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The base-promoted hydrolysis of an ester is commonly known as:",
        "options": [
          "Saponification",
          "Esterification",
          "Hydration",
          "Condensation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Saponification is the process of breaking down an ester with a strong base (like $NaOH$) to produce an alcohol and a carboxylate salt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why is the base-promoted hydrolysis of an ester essentially irreversible?",
        "options": [
          "The carboxylic acid produced is immediately deprotonated to form a stable carboxylate ion.",
          "The alcohol produced evaporates instantly.",
          "The base acts as a permanent catalyst that prevents the reverse reaction.",
          "The reaction is exothermic and cannot be reversed by heating."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In basic conditions, the carboxylic acid reacts with the base to form a resonance-stabilized carboxylate ion ($RCOO^-$), which is a poor electrophile and cannot be attacked by the alcohol."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What are the products of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl ethanoate?",
        "options": [
          "Ethanoic acid and methanol",
          "Methanoic acid and ethanol",
          "Sodium ethanoate and methanol",
          "Ethanoic acid and methane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acid hydrolysis splits the ester back into its constituent acid (ethanoic acid) and alcohol (methanol)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Compared to esters, the hydrolysis of amides generally requires:",
        "options": [
          "More vigorous conditions (stronger acid/base and prolonged heating).",
          "Milder conditions and no catalyst.",
          "Lower temperatures to prevent decomposition.",
          "An anhydrous environment."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Amides are the most stable acid derivatives due to resonance; therefore, they require more energy and stronger reagents to break the $C-N$ bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the acid hydrolysis of an amide, what is the final form of the nitrogen-containing product?",
        "options": [
          "An ammonium salt ($NH_4^+$)",
          "Ammonia gas ($NH_3$)",
          "Nitrogen gas ($N_2$)",
          "An amine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The ammonia or amine released during hydrolysis is a base, which immediately reacts with the acid catalyst to form a salt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hydrolysis of an ester using aqueous $NaOH$ yields an alcohol and a:",
        "options": [
          "Carboxylate salt",
          "Carboxylic acid",
          "Second alcohol",
          "Ketone"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Because the solution is basic, the acid produced is neutralized into its salt form (e.g., sodium ethanoate)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is a key difference between acid-catalyzed and base-promoted ester hydrolysis?",
        "options": [
          "Acid hydrolysis is reversible, while base-promoted hydrolysis is not.",
          "Base-promoted hydrolysis is reversible, while acid hydrolysis is not.",
          "Only acid hydrolysis requires heating.",
          "Only base-promoted hydrolysis produces an alcohol."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is an equilibrium process. Base-promoted hydrolysis goes to completion because the acid product is converted to a salt."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The hydrolysis of a primary amide in a basic solution produces a carboxylate salt and:",
        "options": [
          "Ammonia ($NH_3$)",
          "An ammonium salt ($NH_4^+$)",
          "An amine",
          "Nitric acid"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In basic conditions, the nitrogen is released as free ammonia ($NH_3$), which may be detected by its smell or by turning red litmus paper blue."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes the role of water in the hydrolysis mechanism?",
        "options": [
          "It acts as a nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl carbon.",
          "It acts as a catalyst that speeds up the reaction.",
          "It acts as an electrophile that attracts the oxygen lone pairs.",
          "It is a solvent and does not participate in the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In hydrolysis, water (or hydroxide) is the nucleophilic species that adds to the carbonyl to begin the substitution process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you hydrolyze N-methylethanamide in acidic conditions, the organic products are:",
        "options": [
          "Ethanoic acid and methylammonium ion",
          "Methanoic acid and ethylammonium ion",
          "Ethanoic acid and ammonia",
          "Ethanol and methanamine"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'ethan-' part becomes ethanoic acid, and the 'N-methyl' part becomes the methylammonium salt ($CH_3NH_3^+$)."
