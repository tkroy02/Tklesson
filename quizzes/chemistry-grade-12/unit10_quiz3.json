      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following statements best describes 'Bond Enthalpy'?",
        "options": [
          "The energy required to break one mole of a specific bond in the gaseous state.",
          "The energy released when a solid crystal lattice forms from ions.",
          "The energy required to melt one mole of a substance at its melting point.",
          "The total internal energy of a molecule at absolute zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond enthalpy (or bond dissociation energy) is always defined for gaseous species and refers to the energy required to overcome the attraction between atoms."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Is bond breaking an exothermic or endothermic process?",
        "options": [
          "Endothermic (positive $\\Delta H$)",
          "Exothermic (negative $\\Delta H$)",
          "It depends on the electronegativity of the atoms.",
          "It is always zero for covalent bonds."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Breaking a bond always requires an input of energy to pull the atoms apart, making it an endothermic process."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which formula is used to estimate the enthalpy of a reaction ($\\Delta H_{rxn}$) using bond enthalpies?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum(Bond\\ enthalpies\\ of\\ reactants) - \\sum(Bond\\ enthalpies\\ of\\ products)$",
          "$\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum(Bond\\ enthalpies\\ of\\ products) - \\sum(Bond\\ enthalpies\\ of\\ reactants)$",
          "$\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum(Bond\\ enthalpies\\ of\\ reactants) + \\sum(Bond\\ enthalpies\\ of\\ products)$",
          "$\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\frac{\\sum Bond\\ enthalpies}{n}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unlike enthalpies of formation, when using bond enthalpies, we calculate 'broken minus formed' (Reactants minus Products)."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why are calculations using 'average bond enthalpies' often slightly different from experimentally determined $\\Delta H$ values?",
        "options": [
          "Average bond enthalpies are derived from many different compounds and ignore specific molecular environments.",
          "Average bond enthalpies ignore the state of the substance (solid/liquid/gas).",
          "Bond enthalpies only apply to ionic compounds.",
          "Experimental values are always wrong due to heat loss."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The strength of a $C-H$ bond can vary slightly depending on the rest of the molecule; an 'average' is just a generalized estimate."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following bonds is expected to have the highest bond enthalpy?",
        "options": [
          "$C \\equiv C$ (Triple bond)",
          "$C = C$ (Double bond)",
          "$C - C$ (Single bond)",
          "All $C-C$ bonds have the same enthalpy."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Triple bonds share more electrons and have a shorter bond length, requiring significantly more energy to break than double or single bonds."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the energy released during bond formation is greater than the energy required for bond breaking, the reaction is:",
        "options": [
          "Exothermic",
          "Endothermic",
          "At equilibrium",
          "Non-spontaneous"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A net release of energy (products more stable than reactants) results in an exothermic reaction."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the reaction $H_{2}(g) + Cl_{2}(g) \\rightarrow 2HCl(g)$, which bonds must be broken?",
        "options": [
          "One $H-H$ bond and one $Cl-Cl$ bond.",
          "Two $H-Cl$ bonds.",
          "One $H-Cl$ bond.",
          "No bonds are broken in this reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reactants must be broken into atoms before they can rearrange; here, the $H-H$ and $Cl-Cl$ single bonds are broken."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "As bond length decreases, what generally happens to the bond enthalpy?",
        "options": [
          "It increases.",
          "It decreases.",
          "It remains constant.",
          "It drops to zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Shorter bonds typically indicate a stronger electrostatic attraction between the nuclei and the shared electrons, requiring more energy to break."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is required for a bond enthalpy value to be valid in a calculation?",
        "options": [
          "All species must be in the gaseous state.",
          "All species must be at 0 K.",
          "The reaction must involve a metal catalyst.",
          "The atoms must have the same electronegativity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Bond enthalpy is defined specifically for the gas phase to avoid complications from intermolecular forces like those in liquids or solids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Calculate $\\Delta H$ for $H_{2} + F_{2} \\rightarrow 2HF$ given: $H-H = 436$, $F-F = 158$, $H-F = 565$ (all in kJ/mol).",

          "-536 kJ",
          "+536 kJ",
          "-1130 kJ",
          "+29 kJ"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Broken: $436 + 158 = 594$. Formed: $2 \\times 565 = 1130$. $\\Delta H = 594 - 1130 = -536$ kJ."
