    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which principle forms the theoretical basis for Hess's Law?",
        "options": [
          "The First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy).",
          "The Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy increases).",
          "The Third Law of Thermodynamics (Absolute zero).",
          "Le Chatelier's Principle."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hess's Law is a specific application of the Law of Conservation of Energy; since enthalpy is a state function, the total energy change is independent of the path."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "According to Hess's Law, if a reaction is carried out in a series of steps, the $\\Delta H$ for the overall reaction is:",
        "options": [
          "The sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps.",
          "The product of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps.",
          "The average of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps.",
          "Always zero."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The total enthalpy change is simply the algebraic sum of the changes for each intermediate step."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If you reverse a chemical equation, what must you do to its $\\Delta H$ value?",
        "options": [
          "Change the sign of $\\Delta H$.",
          "Take the reciprocal of $\\Delta H$.",
          "Keep $\\Delta H$ exactly the same.",
          "Square the value of $\\Delta H$."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a forward reaction is exothermic (negative), the reverse process must be endothermic (positive) by the same amount."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When using Hess's Law, if an equation is multiplied by a coefficient (e.g., 2), what happens to the $\\Delta H$ value?",
        "options": [
          "It is also multiplied by that coefficient.",
          "It remains the same.",
          "It is raised to the power of that coefficient.",
          "It is divided by that coefficient."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Enthalpy is an extensive property; doubling the amount of reactants doubles the total heat released or absorbed."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given: $A \\rightarrow B$ ($\\Delta H_{1}$) and $B \\rightarrow C$ ($\\Delta H_{2}$), what is the $\\Delta H$ for the reaction $A \\rightarrow C$?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta H_{1} + \\Delta H_{2}$",
          "$\\Delta H_{1} - \\Delta H_{2}$",
          "$\\Delta H_{2} - \\Delta H_{1}$",
          "$\\Delta H_{1} \\times \\Delta H_{2}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By adding the two equations, $B$ cancels out, and the total enthalpy change is the sum of the individual steps."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the standard formula for calculating $\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{rxn}$ using standard enthalpies of formation ($\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$)?",
        "options": [
          "$\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{rxn} = \\sum \\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(products) - \\sum \\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(reactants)$",
          "$\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{rxn} = \\sum \\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(reactants) - \\sum \\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(products)$",
          "$\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{rxn} = \\sum \\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(products) + \\sum \\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(reactants)$",
          "$\\Delta H^{\\circ}_{rxn} = \\sum Bond\\ energies(reactants) - \\sum Bond\\ energies(products)$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a direct application of Hess's Law, subtracting the energy 'invested' in the reactants from the energy 'stored' in the products."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Hess's Law is particularly useful for finding enthalpy changes for reactions that:",
        "options": [
          "Are difficult or impossible to measure directly in a calorimeter.",
          "Occur very quickly.",
          "Only occur at absolute zero.",
          "Involve only liquid reactants."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Many reactions are too slow, incomplete, or dangerous to measure directly; Hess's Law allows us to calculate their energy using known steps."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Given the reactions:\n1. $C(s) + O_{2}(g) \\rightarrow CO_{2}(g)$ ($\\Delta H = -393.5\\ kJ$)\n2. $CO(g) + 1/2 O_{2}(g) \\rightarrow CO_{2}(g)$ ($\\Delta H = -283.0\\ kJ$)\nFind $\\Delta H$ for $C(s) + 1/2 O_{2}(g) \\rightarrow CO(g)$.",
        "options": [
          "$-110.5\\ kJ$",
          "$-676.5\\ kJ$",
          "$+110.5\\ kJ$",
          "$-393.5\\ kJ$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Reverse reaction 2 ($+283.0$) and add to reaction 1 ($-393.5$): $-393.5 + 283.0 = -110.5\\ kJ$."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In an enthalpy cycle, what does the 'path independence' of enthalpy imply?",
        "options": [
          "The change in enthalpy depends only on the initial and final states.",
          "The enthalpy change depends on the speed of the reaction.",
          "Catalysts change the total enthalpy of a reaction.",
          "Energy is lost as friction during the chemical path."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Like displacement in physics, enthalpy is a state function; how you get from point A to point B does not change the total energy difference."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why must the physical states (s, l, g) be specified in Hess's Law equations?",
        "options": [
          "Phase changes involve their own enthalpy changes (latent heats).",
          "Solids don't have enthalpy.",
          "The gas constant $R$ changes between phases.",
          "To determine the color of the reaction."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The enthalpy of $H_{2}O(l)$ is different from $H_{2}O(g)$ due to the energy required for vaporization; ignoring states leads to inaccurate sums."
