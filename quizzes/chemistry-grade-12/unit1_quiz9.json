        "explanation": "Because they share the same functional group, the types of reactions they undergo (their chemical behavior) are essentially the same."
      },
      {

        "question": "As the molar mass of members in a homologous series increases, what general trend is observed in their boiling points?",

          "Boiling points fluctuate randomly"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Larger molecules have more electrons, leading to stronger intermolecular London dispersion forces that require more energy to overcome."

          "$C_{n}H_{n}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The presence of one double bond reduces the hydrogen count by two compared to the corresponding saturated alkane."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "The trend where physical properties change gradually within a homologous series is primarily due to the increase in:",

          "Intermolecular forces",
          "Intramolecular bond strength",
          "The number of functional groups",
          "Nuclear charge"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The increase in molecular surface area and electron count as chains grow leads to stronger London dispersion forces between molecules."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If the third member of a homologous series is $C_{3}H_{7}Cl$, what is the molecular formula of the fourth member?",
        "options": [
          "$C_{4}H_{9}Cl$",
          "$C_{4}H_{8}Cl$",

          "$C_{5}H_{11}Cl$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adding one $\\text{CH}_{2}$ unit to $C_{3}H_{7}Cl$ results in $C_{4}H_{9}Cl$."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which homologous series is characterized by the general formula $C_{n}H_{2n}O_{2}$ and contains a carboxyl group?",

          "Carboxylic acids",
          "Alcohols",
          "Aldehydes",
          "Ethers"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The carboxyl group ($\\text{-COOH}$) contains two oxygen atoms and follows the $C_{n}H_{2n}O_{2}$ pattern for saturated mono-acids."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the solubility of alcohols in water decrease as the length of the carbon chain increases?",
        "options": [
          "The non-polar part of the molecule becomes more dominant",
          "The hydroxyl group becomes less polar",
          "The molar mass becomes too heavy for water to carry",
          "Longer chains form stronger hydrogen bonds with each other"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "As the hydrophobic alkyl chain grows, the molecule's overall ability to interact with polar water molecules through hydrogen bonding is outweighed by its non-polar character."
