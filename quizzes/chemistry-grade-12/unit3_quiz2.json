    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When naming an alkene, how is the principal carbon chain selected?",
        "options": [
          "The longest continuous chain that contains the double bond",
          "The longest continuous chain of carbon atoms regardless of functional groups",
          "The chain with the most methyl substituents",
          "The chain that is drawn horizontally in the structure"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IUPAC rules require the parent chain to include the functional group (the double bond), even if a longer chain exists without it."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "From which end should the numbering of the parent chain begin in an alkene?",
        "options": [
          "The end closer to the double bond",
          "The end closer to the first substituent",
          "The end that results in the highest numerical locants",
          "Always from the left side to the right side"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The double bond takes priority over alkyl substituents in numbering, so it must receive the lowest possible locant number."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What suffix is used to indicate the presence of a carbon-carbon triple bond in a hydrocarbon?",
        "options": [
          "-yne",
          "-ene",
          "-ane",
          "-ol"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The '-yne' suffix is the systematic IUPAC designation for alkynes, which are hydrocarbons containing at least one triple bond."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for a four-carbon chain with a double bond between the first and second carbons?",
        "options": [
          "But-1-ene",
          "But-2-ene",
          "Prop-1-ene",
          "But-1-yne"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "'But-' represents four carbons, and '-1-ene' indicates the double bond starts at the first carbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How is the name formatted if a molecule contains two double bonds?",
        "options": [
          "The suffix becomes -adiene",
          "The suffix becomes -ene-ene",
          "The prefix 'di-' is added to the start of the whole name",
          "The name ends in -yne to show increased unsaturation"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The multiplier 'di' is added before the 'ene' to show two double bonds, and an 'a' is added to the stem (e.g., butadiene) for ease of pronunciation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In a molecule containing both a double bond and a methyl group, how is the numbering determined?",
        "options": [
          "The double bond is given the lowest number possible",
          "The methyl group is given the lowest number possible",
          "Numbering starts from the end that gives the lowest sum of all locants",
          "They are given equal priority and numbered alphabetically"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Unsaturation (double/triple bonds) has a higher nomenclature priority than alkyl branching."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for $CH_{3}-C\\equiv C-CH_{2}-CH_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "Pent-2-yne",
          "Pent-3-yne",
          "Hex-2-yne",
          "Pent-2-ene"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The parent chain has five carbons (pent-). Numbering from the left gives the triple bond the lower locant of 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following describes a 'vinyl' group as a substituent?",
        "options": [
          "An ethenyl group ($-CH=CH_{2}$)",
          "A propenyl group ($-CH_{2}-CH=CH_{2}$)",
          "A methyl group with a double bond",
          "A saturated two-carbon chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Vinyl is the common name for the ethenyl group, which is a two-carbon unsaturated substituent."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When naming a cyclic alkene (cycloalkene), where are the carbon-1 and carbon-2 positions located?",
        "options": [
          "Across the double bond",
          "At the carbon with the largest substituent",
          "At any carbon in the ring",
          "Carbon-1 is always at the top of the ring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a cycloalkene, the double bond must be contained between C1 and C2 to ensure the primary functional group has the lowest numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a molecule contains both a double bond and a triple bond, and numbering from either end gives them the same locants (e.g., 1 and 4), which one takes priority for the lower number?",
        "options": [
          "The double bond (alkene)",
          "The triple bond (alkyne)",
          "The alphabetical order of the substituents",
          "Priority is given to the larger group"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a tie occurs in numbering between a double and triple bond, IUPAC rules assign the lower number to the double bond."
