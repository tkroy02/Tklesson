      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the rusting of iron, which part of the metal acts as the anode?",
        "options": [
          "A region of the iron surface where oxidation occurs ($Fe \\rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^{-}$).",
          "The water droplet sitting on the surface.",
          "The region with the highest concentration of dissolved oxygen.",
          "The layer of pre-existing rust."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "At the anodic site, iron atoms lose electrons and enter the solution as $Fe^{2+}$ ions."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the primary reduction reaction that occurs at the cathode during the atmospheric corrosion of iron in acidic conditions?",
        "options": [
          "$O_{2}(g) + 4H^{+}(aq) + 4e^{-} \\rightarrow 2H_{2}O(l)$",
          "$Fe^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Fe(s)$",
          "$2H_{2}O(l) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow H_{2}(g) + 2OH^{-}(aq)$",
          "$Fe(s) \\rightarrow Fe^{3+}(aq) + 3e^{-}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In the presence of moisture and acid (often from dissolved $CO_{2}$), oxygen is reduced to water at the cathodic site."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Why does the presence of salt (like $NaCl$) accelerate the rusting of iron?",
        "options": [
          "It increases the conductivity of the electrolyte solution.",
          "It reacts directly with iron to form iron chloride gas.",
          "It acts as a catalyst by lowering the activation energy.",
          "It prevents oxygen from reaching the metal surface."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Salt provides ions that increase the conductivity of the water film, allowing ions and electrons to move more freely between anodic and cathodic sites."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is 'sacrificial protection' (galvanic protection)?",
        "options": [
          "Coating iron with a more reactive metal that oxidizes in its place.",
          "Coating iron with a less reactive metal like gold.",
          "Painting the metal to prevent contact with air.",
          "Using a plastic film to wrap the metal."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A more active metal (with a more negative reduction potential) is attached to the iron. The active metal oxidizes (is sacrificed) while the iron remains the cathode and does not corrode."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the process of galvanization, iron is coated with which metal?",
        "options": [
          "Zinc ($Zn$)",
          "Copper ($Cu$)",
          "Tin ($Sn$)",
          "Lead ($Pb$)"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Zinc is used because it is more reactive than iron. Even if the coating is scratched, the zinc will still provide sacrificial protection."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is an example of an 'impressed current' cathodic protection?",
        "options": [
          "Connecting the metal to the negative terminal of a DC power source.",
          "Painting the metal with an oil-based enamel.",
          "Wrapping the metal in aluminum foil.",
          "Alloying the metal with chromium to make stainless steel."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "By applying an external DC current, the structure to be protected is forced to be the cathode, preventing oxidation."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the chemical formula for the hydrated iron(III) oxide commonly known as rust?",
        "options": [
          "$Fe_{2}O_{3} \\cdot xH_{2}O$",
          "$FeO$",
          "$Fe(OH)_{2}$",
          "$Fe_{3}O_{4}$"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Rust is a complex mixture, but its primary component is hydrated iron(III) oxide, formed when $Fe^{2+}$ is further oxidized to $Fe^{3+}$ in the presence of oxygen and water."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "How does 'passivation' protect metals like Aluminum from deep corrosion?",
        "options": [
          "A thin, tough, impermeable oxide layer forms on the surface.",
          "The metal reacts with nitrogen to form a protective nitride.",
          "The metal dissolves slowly into the air.",
          "The metal becomes radioactive and repels oxygen."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Aluminum reacts quickly with oxygen to form $Al_{2}O_{3}$, which sticks tightly to the surface and prevents further oxygen from reaching the underlying metal."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Tin-plating is used for food cans. What happens if the tin coating is scratched?",
        "options": [
          "The iron corrodes faster because iron is more reactive than tin.",
          "The tin provides sacrificial protection to the iron.",
          "The scratch heals itself through a chemical reaction.",
          "Nothing, as tin and iron have the same reactivity."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Tin is less reactive than iron. If the coating is broken, the iron becomes the anode in the electrochemical cell and corrodes even more rapidly than if it were alone."
