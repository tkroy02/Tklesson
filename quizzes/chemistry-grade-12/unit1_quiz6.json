    "duration": 15,
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct IUPAC name for a straight-chain alkane consisting of eight carbon atoms?",
        "options": [
          "Octane",
          "Heptane",
          "Nonane",
          "Hexane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The prefix 'oct-' corresponds to eight carbon atoms, and the suffix '-ane' indicates it is a saturated hydrocarbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for the following structure: $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_{3})\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$?",

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The longest chain has four carbons (butane). Numbering from the left gives the methyl group the lowest locant, which is 2."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of the following is the correct name for an alkane with a four-carbon parent chain and two methyl groups on the second carbon?",

          "Dimethylbutane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IUPAC rules require a locant number for every substituent, even if they are on the same carbon, separated by a comma."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the name of the alkyl substituent with the structure $-\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$?",

          "Propyl",
          "Isopropyl"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A two-carbon substituent is derived from ethane and is named an 'ethyl' group."

      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "When naming 3-ethyl-2-methylhexane, why is 'ethyl' listed before 'methyl'?",
        "options": [
          "Because 'e' comes before 'm' alphabetically",
          "Because the ethyl group is larger",
          "Because 2 is a lower number than 3",
          "Because ethyl is further from the end of the chain"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Substituents must be listed in alphabetical order in the final name, regardless of their position numbers."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the IUPAC name for a cyclic alkane containing five carbon atoms?",

          "Cyclopentane",
          "Pentane",
          "Cyclohexane",
          "Methylcyclobutane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "For ring structures, the prefix 'cyclo-' is added to the parent alkane name."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is the correct name for $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{2}\\text{CH}_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "2,2-dimethylpropane",
          "Tetramethylmethane",

          "Neopentane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The longest continuous chain is three carbons (propane) with two methyl groups on the second carbon."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "In the molecule 4-isopropylheptane, what does the 'iso' prefix in the substituent name indicate?",
        "options": [
          "The three-carbon chain is attached via its middle carbon",
          "The substituent is a straight three-carbon chain",
          "The substituent contains a double bond",
          "The substituent is part of a ring"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An isopropyl group is a 'branched' branch where the attachment point is the secondary carbon of the propyl group."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "Which of these represents the correct IUPAC name for $\\text{CH}_{3}( \\text{CH}_{2} )_{4}\\text{CH}_{3}$?",
        "options": [
          "Hexane",
          "Pentane",
          "Heptane",
          "Butane"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Summing the carbons: $1 \\text{ (initial methyl)} + 4 \\text{ (methylene groups)} + 1 \\text{ (terminal methyl)} = 6$ carbons."
      },
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "If a substituent is found at position 3 counting from the left, and position 4 counting from the right, which numbering is correct?",
        "options": [
          "Numbering from the left",
          "Numbering from the right",
          "Either is acceptable",
          "Neither, the chain must be renamed"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IUPAC rules dictate that the chain must be numbered to give substituents the lowest possible locant at the first point of difference."
