  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the **Principle of Relativity** (Galilean version)?", answer: "The laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames of reference." },
    { question: "What is an **inertial reference frame**?", answer: "A frame of reference that is not accelerating." },
    { question: "What is the first postulate of **Special Relativity**?", answer: "The laws of physics are the same for all observers in all inertial frames of reference." },
    { question: "What is the second postulate of **Special Relativity**?", answer: "The speed of light in a vacuum ($$c$$) is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the light source." },
    { question: "What is the speed of light in a vacuum?", answer: "$$c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$$" },
    { question: "What is **time dilation**?", answer: "The phenomenon where time appears to slow down for an object moving at a high speed relative to an observer." },
    { question: "What is the formula for time dilation?", answer: "$$t' = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \\gamma t$$" },
    { question: "What is the **Lorentz factor** ($$\\gamma$$)?", answer: "$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$" },
    { question: "When is the Lorentz factor significant?", answer: "When the speed of an object ($$v$$) is a significant fraction of the speed of light ($$c$$)." },
    { question: "What is **length contraction**?", answer: "The phenomenon where the length of a moving object appears to shrink in the direction of its motion, as observed from an inertial frame." },
    { question: "What is the formula for length contraction?", answer: "$$L' = L\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{L}{\\gamma}$$" },
    { question: "Does length contraction occur perpendicular to the direction of motion?", answer: "No, it only occurs in the direction of motion." },
    { question: "What is **rest energy**?", answer: "The energy an object has just by virtue of its mass, according to $$E = mc^2$$." },
    { question: "What is the formula for mass-energy equivalence?", answer: "$$E = mc^2$$" },
    { question: "What is **relativistic momentum**?", answer: "The momentum of an object taking into account the effects of special relativity." },
    { question: "What is the formula for relativistic momentum?", answer: "$$p = \\gamma mv$$" },
    { question: "What is a **spacetime diagram**?", answer: "A diagram that plots an object's position on one axis and its time on another, showing its trajectory through spacetime." },
    { question: "What is a **world line**?", answer: "The path of an object in a spacetime diagram." },
    { question: "What is a **light cone**?", answer: "A cone-shaped region on a spacetime diagram that represents all possible future and past positions of a particle that can travel at or below the speed of light." },
    { question: "What is the **twin paradox**?", answer: "A thought experiment where one twin travels at near the speed of light and returns to find their stay-at-home twin has aged more." },
    { question: "What is the resolution to the twin paradox?", answer: "The traveling twin is not in an inertial frame (they accelerate and decelerate), so the two twins' experiences are not symmetrical." },
    { question: "What is the **Principle of Equivalence** (General Relativity)?", answer: "The effects of gravity are indistinguishable from the effects of uniform acceleration." },
    { question: "How does **General Relativity** explain gravity?", answer: "Gravity is not a force but a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy." },
    { question: "What is the phenomenon of **gravitational lensing**?", answer: "The bending of light from a distant source as it passes a massive object, acting like a lens." },
    { question: "How does mass affect time?", answer: "Time appears to slow down in a stronger gravitational field, a phenomenon called **gravitational time dilation**." },
    { question: "Where is gravitational time dilation most pronounced?", answer: "Near very massive objects, like black holes." },
    { question: "What is a **black hole**?", answer: "A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape." },
    { question: "What is the **event horizon** of a black hole?", answer: "The boundary beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer." },
    { question: "What does the **escape velocity** of an object need to be to become a black hole?", answer: "The escape velocity must be equal to or greater than the speed of light." },
    { question: "What is a **geodesic**?", answer: "The shortest path between two points in curved spacetime, which is what objects follow under the influence of gravity." },
    { question: "What is the difference between an inertial frame and a non-inertial frame?", answer: "An inertial frame is not accelerating, while a non-inertial frame is accelerating and requires fictitious forces to explain motion." },
    { question: "According to Special Relativity, is mass a conserved quantity?", answer: "No, mass is a form of energy and can be created or destroyed, but mass-energy ($$E=mc^2$$) is conserved." },
    { question: "What happens to the kinetic energy of a particle as it approaches the speed of light?", answer: "Its kinetic energy approaches infinity." },
    { question: "Can a massive object ever reach the speed of light?", answer: "No, because its relativistic mass and kinetic energy would become infinite, requiring an infinite amount of energy to accelerate." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the total energy of a particle?", answer: "$$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$$" },
    { question: "What is the **rest mass** ($$m_0$$)?", answer: "The mass of an object when it is at rest relative to an observer." },
    { question: "What is a **gravitational redshift**?", answer: "The increase in the wavelength of light as it moves away from a gravitational source." },
    { question: "What is a **singularit**y in a black hole?", answer: "A point of infinite density at the center of a black hole where the laws of physics as we know them break down." },
    { question: "What is **spacetime**?", answer: "A four-dimensional continuum combining the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time." },
    { question: "How does the clock on a GPS satellite behave relative to a clock on Earth?", answer: "It runs slightly faster due to being in a weaker gravitational field, an effect corrected by special and general relativity." }
