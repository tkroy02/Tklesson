  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the key difference between **classical physics** and **modern physics**?", answer: "Classical physics describes macroscopic objects and low speeds, while modern physics explains the universe at very high speeds and on an atomic or subatomic scale." },
    { question: "What does **Relativity** address?", answer: "The relationship between mass, energy, space, and time, especially for objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light." },
    { question: "Who is the primary figure associated with Relativity?", answer: "Albert Einstein." },
    { question: "What is **time dilation**?", answer: "The phenomenon where time passes more slowly for an object in motion relative to a stationary observer." },
    { question: "What is **length contraction**?", answer: "The phenomenon where an object's length appears shorter in the direction of motion relative to a stationary observer." },
    { question: "What does the equation $$E=mc^2$$ mean?", answer: "It describes the equivalence of mass and energy. A small amount of mass can be converted into a very large amount of energy, and vice versa." },
    { question: "What does **Quantum Mechanics** address?", answer: "The physics of the very small, dealing with the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels." },
    { question: "What is a **quantum**?", answer: "A discrete, indivisible packet of energy or other physical property." },
    { question: "What is the **photoelectric effect**?", answer: "The emission of electrons from a metal when light is shined on it." },
    { question: "How does the photoelectric effect support the idea that light is a particle?", answer: "It shows that light is made of discrete packets of energy called photons. An electron is emitted only if a photon has enough energy to knock it loose." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the energy of a photon?", answer: "$$E = hf$$ where $$h$$ is Planck's constant and $$f$$ is frequency." },
    { question: "What does the **de Broglie hypothesis** state?", answer: "All particles, like electrons and protons, have wave-like properties. Their wavelength is related to their momentum ($$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$$)." },
    { question: "What is **wave-particle duality**?", answer: "The concept that every particle or quantum entity may be described as either a particle or a wave." },
    { question: "What does the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** state?", answer: "It is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and the exact momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy." },
    { question: "What did the **Bohr Model of the atom** propose?", answer: "That electrons can only exist in specific, discrete orbits or energy levels around the nucleus." },
    { question: "How did the Bohr model explain the stability of atoms?", answer: "It proposed that electrons in these specific energy levels do not lose energy by radiating light." },
    { question: "What is a **blackbody**?", answer: "An idealized object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it and emits thermal radiation." },
    { question: "How did Max Planck's work on blackbody radiation lay the foundation for quantum mechanics?", answer: "He proposed that energy is quantized, meaning it can only be emitted or absorbed in discrete packets." },
    { question: "What is the **strong nuclear force**?", answer: "The force that binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom." },
    { question: "What is the **weak nuclear force**?", answer: "A fundamental force involved in radioactive decay." },
    { question: "What does **nuclear fusion** involve?", answer: "The process by which two or more light atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single, heavier nucleus." },
    { question: "What does **nuclear fission** involve?", answer: "The process by which a large atomic nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy." },
    { question: "What is a **chain reaction**?", answer: "A self-sustaining process in which one fission event triggers additional fission events." },
    { question: "What is a **photon**?", answer: "A quantum of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation." },
    { question: "How are photons and electrons different?", answer: "A photon is a massless particle of light, while an electron is a particle of matter with mass." },
    { question: "What is the **Standard Model** of particle physics?", answer: "A theory that describes the fundamental particles and forces of the universe." },
    { question: "What is an **elementary particle**?", answer: "A particle that has no known substructure." },
    { question: "What are the two major classes of particles in the Standard Model?", answer: "Fermions and Bosons." },
    { question: "What is a **fermion**?", answer: "A type of particle that makes up matter, such as quarks and leptons (e.g., electrons)." },
    { question: "What is a **boson**?", answer: "A type of particle that mediates forces, such as photons and gluons." },
    { question: "How does Einstein's General Relativity differ from Special Relativity?", answer: "General Relativity extends the theory to include gravity and accelerated reference frames, describing gravity as a curvature of spacetime." },
    { question: "What is the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**?", answer: "No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously." },
    { question: "What is the **Schrödinger Equation**?", answer: "A fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes the wave function of a quantum system over time." },
    { question: "What is a **wave function**?", answer: "A mathematical function that describes the quantum state of a particle or system." },
    { question: "What is the probability of finding a particle in a certain region according to quantum mechanics?", answer: "The probability is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the wave function in that region." },
    { question: "What is a **semiconductor**?", answer: "A material with electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator, a key component in modern electronics." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a conductor and an insulator?", answer: "A conductor has freely moving electrons that can easily carry a current, while an insulator's electrons are tightly bound." },
    { question: "What is the difference between nuclear fission and fusion in terms of energy release?", answer: "Both processes release immense energy, but fission releases energy by splitting large atoms, while fusion releases energy by combining small atoms." },
    { question: "What is **radioactive decay**?", answer: "The process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation." },
    { question: "What is the **half-life** of a radioactive isotope?", answer: "The time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay." }
