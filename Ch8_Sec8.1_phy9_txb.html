      <h2>Section 8.1: The Nature of Waves</h2>
      <p>
        Waves are disturbances that transfer energy from one place to another without the transfer of matter. 
        They are all around us — in sound, light, water, and even invisible forms like radio signals. 
        Understanding waves helps us explain much of the natural world and the technology we use daily.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Definition of a Wave -->
    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>Definition of a Wave</h3>
      <p>
        A <em>wave</em> is a repeating disturbance or vibration that moves through a medium or space, 
        carrying energy without the transport of matter. 
        For example, when you drop a stone in water, ripples spread outward, but the water itself doesn’t move away with the ripple; 
        only the <em>energy</em> moves.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Categorization 1: By Medium Requirement -->
<div class="content-box">
  <h3>Types of Waves by Medium Requirement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Mechanical Waves:</strong> 
      These waves require a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel. Without a medium, mechanical waves cannot pass energy along. For example, sound cannot travel in space because there is no air to carry it.  
      <br><em>Examples:</em> 
      sound waves,  
      water waves,  
      seismic waves.  
      <br>They cannot travel in a vacuum.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Electromagnetic Waves:</strong> 
      These waves do not require a medium to travel or propagate.  
      They can travel through the vacuum of space.  
      <br><em>Examples:</em> 
      light,  
      radio waves,  
      microwaves,  
      infrared,  
      X-rays.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

   <!-- Categorization 2: By Particle Motion -->
<div class="content-box">
  <h3>Types of Waves by Particle Motion</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Transverse Waves:</strong> 
      The particles of the medium vibrate <em>perpendicular</em> 
      to the direction the wave travels. Hence, if the wave moves in the rightward direction, the particles vibrate up and down.  
      <br><em>Examples:</em> 
      water surface waves (mechanical),  
      electromagnetic waves like light (non-mechanical but transverse waves).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Longitudinal Waves:</strong> 
      The particles of the medium vibrate <em>parallel</em> 
      to the direction the wave travels. Hence, the wave moves in the same direction as the vibrating particles.  
      <br><em>Examples:</em> 
      sound waves,  
      compression waves in a spring.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

    <!-- What Waves Do -->
    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>What Do Waves Do?</h3>
      <p>
        Waves are the carriers of energy and information. They:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow us to hear (sound waves in air).</li>
        <li>Enable us to see (light waves from the Sun or bulbs).</li>
        <li>Transmit information (radio and communication waves).</li>
        <li>Transfer energy (seismic waves causing earthquakes, water waves moving ships).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Why Waves Matter -->
    <div class="content-box">
      <h3>Why Are Waves Important?</h3>
      <p>
        Without waves, life as we know it would be impossible. 
        No sound for communication, no light for vision, no warmth from the Sun reaching Earth, 
        and no technology like phones, WiFi, or TV signals. 
        Waves connect people, transfer energy across vast distances, and explain some of nature’s greatest mysteries.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Reflective Thought -->
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>
        <strong>What is life without waves?</strong><br>
        A silent, dark, and disconnected world. 
        Waves are not just physical phenomena; they are the bridge between people, nature, and technology. 
        From a friend’s voice over the phone, to the sunlight that makes plants grow, 
        waves are at the very heart of existence.
