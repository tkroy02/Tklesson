  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What are the three stages of **cell signaling**?", answer: "Reception, transduction, and response." },
    { question: "What is a **ligand** in cell communication?", answer: "A signaling molecule that binds to a specific receptor on or in a cell." },
    { question: "What is **transduction**?", answer: "A series of steps in a signal transduction pathway that converts the signal to a form that can bring about a cellular response." },
    { question: "What are **second messengers**?", answer: "Small, non-protein, water-soluble molecules or ions that relay a signal inside the cell (e.g., cAMP and calcium ions)." },
    { question: "What is the function of **protein kinases**?", answer: "Enzymes that transfer phosphate groups from ATP to other proteins, a process called phosphorylation." },
    { question: "What is the function of **protein phosphatases**?", answer: "Enzymes that remove phosphate groups from proteins, a process called dephosphorylation, to turn off a signal." },
    { question: "What is the **cell cycle**?", answer: "The life of a cell from the time it is first formed from a dividing parent cell until its own division into two daughter cells." },
    { question: "What are the two main phases of the cell cycle?", answer: "**Interphase** (growth and DNA replication) and the **mitotic (M) phase** (cell division)." },
    { question: "What are the three subphases of Interphase?", answer: "G1 (Gap 1), S (Synthesis), and G2 (Gap 2)." },
    { question: "What happens during the **S phase**?", answer: "The cell's DNA is replicated (synthesized)." },
    { question: "What are **chromosomes**?", answer: "Structures of DNA and protein that contain a cell's genetic information." },
    { question: "What are **sister chromatids**?", answer: "Two identical copies of a chromosome joined together at a centromere." },
    { question: "What are the four main stages of **mitosis**?", answer: "Prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase." },
    { question: "What happens during **prophase**?", answer: "Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and the mitotic spindle begins to form." },
    { question: "What happens during **metaphase**?", answer: "The chromosomes align at the metaphase plate (the cell's equator)." },
    { question: "What happens during **anaphase**?", answer: "Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell." },
    { question: "What happens during **telophase**?", answer: "Chromosomes decondense, nuclear envelopes reform around the two sets of chromosomes, and cytokinesis begins." },
    { question: "What is **cytokinesis**?", answer: "The division of the cytoplasm to form two separate daughter cells." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of **cell cycle checkpoints**?", answer: "They are control points where the cell stops and assesses its progress before proceeding to the next stage of the cycle." },
    { question: "What are the two main regulatory proteins of the cell cycle?", answer: "Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)." },
    { question: "How do cyclins and Cdks work together?", answer: "Cyclins activate Cdks by binding to them, forming an active complex (MPF) that triggers cell cycle progression." },
    { question: "What is **apoptosis**?", answer: "Programmed cell death, a controlled process for eliminating old or damaged cells." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a benign tumor and a malignant tumor?", answer: "A benign tumor remains at its original site; a malignant tumor invades surrounding tissues and can metastasize." },
    { question: "What is **cancer**?", answer: "A disease caused by uncontrolled cell growth due to a failure in cell cycle regulation." },
    { question: "What is the G1 checkpoint responsible for?", answer: "Deciding whether the cell should proceed to the S phase or enter the G0 phase (a non-dividing state)." },
    { question: "What is the M checkpoint responsible for?", answer: "Ensuring all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle fibers before anaphase begins." },
    { question: "What is **reception** in cell signaling?", answer: "A signaling molecule (ligand) binds to a receptor protein, causing it to change shape." },
    { question: "What is a common type of cell surface receptor?", answer: "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)." },
    { question: "How do water-soluble signaling molecules usually transmit their signal?", answer: "They bind to cell-surface receptors and trigger a signal transduction pathway inside the cell." },
    { question: "How do lipid-soluble signaling molecules usually transmit their signal?", answer: "They can diffuse through the plasma membrane and bind to intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of **phosphorylation cascades** in transduction?", answer: "They amplify the signal and provide more opportunities for regulation." },
    { question: "How does **quorum sensing** work in bacteria?", answer: "Bacteria secrete signaling molecules that allow them to coordinate their behavior in response to population density." },
    { question: "What is the difference between paracrine and endocrine signaling?", answer: "Paracrine signaling targets nearby cells; endocrine signaling uses hormones to target distant cells via the bloodstream." },
    { question: "What is the role of **mitosis**?", answer: "To produce two genetically identical daughter cells for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction." },
    { question: "What is a **mutation**?", answer: "A change in the DNA sequence that can affect the function of a protein, potentially leading to cancer if it affects cell cycle regulation." },
    { question: "What is the role of **p53** in the cell cycle?", answer: "A tumor suppressor gene that halts the cell cycle and can initiate apoptosis if DNA damage is detected." },
    { question: "What is the final result of mitosis?", answer: "Two genetically identical diploid cells from a single diploid parent cell." },
    { question: "What is the main role of the **G2 checkpoint**?", answer: "To ensure all chromosomes have been replicated correctly before the cell enters mitosis." },
    { question: "What happens to the chromosomes in **metaphase**?", answer: "They are lined up along the metaphase plate, with their centromeres facing opposite poles." },
    { question: "How is cell division regulated in healthy cells?", answer: "Through a complex system of internal and external signals, including growth factors, checkpoints, and cyclin/Cdk complexes." }
