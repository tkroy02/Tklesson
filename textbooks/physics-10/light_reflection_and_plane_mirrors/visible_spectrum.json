  "summary": "The visible spectrum encompasses electromagnetic radiation from 380-700 nm that human vision detects through specialized cone photoreceptors with peak sensitivities at ~420 nm (S-cones, blue), ~534 nm (M-cones, green), and ~564 nm (L-cones, red). Color perception arises from wavelength-dependent cone responses and opponent neural processing creating red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white channels. Color measurement systems include CIE XYZ (tristimulus values based on human color matching), RGB (additive display primaries), and CMYK (subtractive printing primaries). Key phenomena include metamerism (different spectra producing same color perception) and color constancy (stable perception under varying illumination). Applications span display technologies (LCD, OLED), digital imaging, scientific measurement, and industrial quality control, all leveraging the physical properties of visible light and human color vision physiology to communicate information, enhance aesthetics, and enable scientific discovery."
