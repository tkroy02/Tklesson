  "expanded_description": "This section explores the visible spectrum - the narrow band of electromagnetic radiation that human eyes can detect. Students will learn about the range of colors, their corresponding wavelengths and frequencies, and how this spectrum relates to the broader electromagnetic spectrum.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The visible spectrum is the small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that human eyes can perceive, ranging from violet light with the shortest wavelengths to red light with the longest wavelengths.",
    "explanation": "What we perceive as different colors are actually electromagnetic waves of different frequencies. Our eyes contain specialized receptors (cones) that are sensitive to different ranges within this visible band, allowing us to distinguish colors."

  "summary": "The visible spectrum is the narrow band of electromagnetic radiation from approximately 380 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red) that human eyes can detect. This range represents less than 0.0035% of the known electromagnetic spectrum. Different wavelengths correspond to different colors, with violet light having almost twice the photon energy of red light. Natural phenomena like rainbows demonstrate dispersion, where different wavelengths bend by different amounts in materials. Human color vision uses three types of cone cells with different wavelength sensitivities that the brain combines to create color perception. Common misconceptions include thinking color is an intrinsic property of light, that rainbows contain exactly seven distinct colors, and that all animals see the same colors humans do."
