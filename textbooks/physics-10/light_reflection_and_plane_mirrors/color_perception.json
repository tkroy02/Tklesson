Neural processing creates opponent color channels: red-green (L vs M), blue-yellow (S vs L+M), and luminance (L+M), enabling efficient coding and enhanced discrimination. Color constancy mechanisms maintain stable color perception across changing illumination through adaptation, spatial comparisons, and cognitive compensation. Individual variations include common red-green color deficiencies (protan, deutan) affecting ~8% of males, and rare blue-yellow (tritan) or complete color blindness. Applications of color perception knowledge include inclusive design (accommodating color deficiencies), effective visual communication, safety systems with redundant coding, and technologies that match human color vision capabilities. The system transforms physical light spectra into rich color experiences while maintaining remarkable stability and adaptability across viewing conditions."
