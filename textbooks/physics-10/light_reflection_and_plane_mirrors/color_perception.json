  "expanded_description": "This section explores how humans perceive color, from the physics of light wavelengths to the biology of our visual system and the psychology of color interpretation. Students will learn why we see colors, how color vision works, and what happens when it doesn't work normally.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Color perception is a three-stage process: physical light of specific wavelengths enters the eye, biological receptors in the retina respond to different wavelengths, and the brain interprets these signals as subjective color experiences.",
    "explanation": "What we experience as 'color' is not a property of light itself but rather our brain's interpretation of different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. The same physical light can be perceived as different colors depending on context, and different people may see colors slightly differently."

  "summary": "Color perception involves physics (light wavelengths), biology (retinal cone cells), and psychology (brain interpretation). Humans have trichromatic vision using S, M, and L cones sensitive to different wavelength ranges. The same color perception can be created by different physical stimuli (metamers). Color constancy allows us to perceive consistent colors under varying lighting conditions. Color vision deficiencies occur when cone types are missing or defective. Common misconceptions include thinking colors are inherent properties of objects, that there's only one set of primary colors, and that all animals see colors the same way humans do. Color perception is a complex process that transforms physical light wavelengths into subjective experiences through our biological visual system."
