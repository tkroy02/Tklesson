  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A plane mirror forms a virtual image that is the same size as the object, located as far behind the mirror as the object is in front, and reversed left-to-right.",
    "explanation": "The image appears to be behind the mirror because our brain extrapolates light rays backward in straight lines. Since no light actually comes from behind the mirror, the image is called 'virtual' - it cannot be projected on a screen."

  "summary": "Plane mirrors form virtual images that are upright, the same size as the object, located as far behind the mirror as the object is in front, and laterally inverted. The image is virtual because light rays don't actually come from the apparent image location. Ray diagrams using the law of reflection demonstrate why images appear where they do. The minimum mirror height needed to see one's full height is half the person's height. The perceived left-right reversal is actually a front-back reversal relative to the mirror surface. Common misconceptions include thinking the image exists on the mirror surface, that mirrors specially reverse left-right, and that larger mirrors create larger images."
