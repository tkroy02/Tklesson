  "summary": "Plane mirrors form virtual images that are upright, same-sized ($m = 1$), and located as far behind the mirror as the object is in front ($d_i = d_o$). Images exhibit lateral inversion (left-right reversal) but maintain top-bottom orientation. Ray tracing demonstrates that all rays from an object point reflect according to $\\theta_i = \\theta_r$ and appear to diverge from a common virtual image point behind the mirror. Multiple mirrors produce multiple images following predictable patterns: two mirrors at angle θ create $N = 360/θ - 1$ images when object is symmetric. Special configurations include perpendicular mirrors (90°, 3 images), parallel mirrors (infinite images), and corner cube reflectors (three perpendicular mirrors providing perfect retroreflection). Applications range from everyday mirrors to periscopes (viewing around obstacles), interferometers (precision measurement), kaleidoscopes (symmetric patterns), and laser systems (beam steering). Plane mirrors provide the foundation for understanding more complex optical systems while enabling both simple viewing aids and sophisticated scientific instruments."
