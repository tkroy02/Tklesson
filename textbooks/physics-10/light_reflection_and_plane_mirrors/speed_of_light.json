  "topic": "8.2 Speed of Light",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores the speed of light as a fundamental constant of nature. Students will learn about its immense value, its role in special relativity, the historical methods used to measure it, and why it represents the ultimate speed limit in the universe.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The speed of light in a vacuum, denoted by c, is a universal constant with a value of approximately 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s. It is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the universe can travel.",
    "explanation": "Unlike sound or other mechanical waves, the speed of light in vacuum is constant and independent of the motion of the source or observer. This constancy led to Einstein's theory of special relativity and has profound implications for our understanding of space and time."

  "summary": "The speed of light in vacuum, c = 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s, is a fundamental constant of nature that represents the ultimate speed limit for information and matter in the universe. It is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion, which led to Einstein's theory of special relativity and effects like time dilation and length contraction. While c is the vacuum speed, light travels slower in materials according to v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. Historical measurements evolved from Rømer's astronomical method to modern laser techniques. Common misconceptions include thinking light speed is infinite, that motion affects measured light speed, and overgeneralizing what cannot exceed c."
