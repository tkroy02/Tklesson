  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on the fundamental law governing how light reflects from surfaces. Students will learn to apply the law of reflection to predict the paths of reflected light rays and understand how this principle enables image formation in mirrors.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The law of reflection states that when a light ray reflects off a surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Both angles are measured from the normal, a line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence.",
    "explanation": "This law applies to all types of waves, including light, sound, and water waves, when they reflect from smooth surfaces. It is a consequence of the conservation of momentum and energy at the boundary between two media."

  "summary": "The law of reflection states that when light reflects from a surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection (θᵢ = θᵣ), with both angles measured from the normal (perpendicular line) at the point of incidence. The incident ray, normal, and reflected ray all lie in the same plane. This fundamental law enables prediction of light paths in mirrors and optical systems, verification through simple experiments, and design of practical devices like periscopes. Common errors include measuring angles from the surface instead of the normal, misapplying the law to rough surfaces, and misunderstanding how reflection affects light properties. The law applies to all wave types and forms the foundation for understanding image formation in mirrors."
