This fundamental law can be derived from Fermat's principle (path of least time), Huygens' principle (wavefront construction), or electromagnetic theory. Reflection types include specular (smooth surfaces, preserves images) and diffuse (rough surfaces, scatters light), both obeying the law locally but differing in macroscopic appearance due to surface roughness. Applications range from simple plane mirrors (virtual, upright images) to complex optical systems like periscopes (viewing around obstacles), reflecting telescopes (astronomical observation), corner cube reflectors (precise distance measurement), and interferometers (ultra-precise metrology). The law applies universally to all wave phenomena and enables predictable light control in numerous technologies through systematic application of the simple geometric relationship $\\theta_i = \\theta_r$."
