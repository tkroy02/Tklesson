  "topic": "8.7 Specular vs Diffuse Reflection",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores the two fundamental types of reflection: specular (mirror-like) and diffuse (scattered). Students will learn how surface texture at microscopic levels determines which type of reflection occurs and how this affects what we see.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Specular reflection occurs from smooth surfaces where parallel incident rays remain parallel after reflection, forming clear images. Diffuse reflection occurs from rough surfaces where parallel incident rays scatter in many directions, preventing image formation.",
    "explanation": "The key difference lies in surface regularity at scales comparable to light's wavelength. Smooth surfaces have organized reflection that preserves image information, while rough surfaces randomize light directions, destroying image formation but enabling us to see most objects around us."

  "summary": "Specular reflection occurs from smooth surfaces where parallel light rays remain parallel after reflection, enabling clear image formation as in mirrors. Diffuse reflection occurs from rough surfaces where parallel light rays scatter in many directions, preventing image formation but allowing objects to be visible from any angle. The key difference lies in surface regularity at microscopic scales compared to light's wavelength. Both types obey the law of reflection locally, but surface geometry determines the overall light distribution. Most everyday objects are diffuse reflectors, which enables consistent color perception and object recognition. Common misconceptions include thinking diffuse surfaces violate reflection laws, equating shininess with reflectivity, and attributing reflection type to material rather than surface properties."
