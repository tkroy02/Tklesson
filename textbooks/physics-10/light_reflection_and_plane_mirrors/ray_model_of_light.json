  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the ray model of light as a simplified but powerful tool for understanding how light travels and interacts with objects. Students will learn to represent light as straight-line rays and use this model to predict light behavior in various situations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The ray model represents light as traveling in straight-line paths called rays. This model is particularly useful for understanding reflection, refraction, and image formation when light interacts with objects much larger than its wavelength.",
    "explanation": "While light actually exhibits wave properties, the ray model provides an excellent approximation for many practical situations involving shadows, mirrors, lenses, and basic optical systems. It simplifies complex wave behavior into manageable geometric constructions."

        "definition": "**Key Assumptions of the Ray Model:**\n\n1.  **Rectilinear Propagation:** Light travels in straight lines in a uniform medium.\n2.  **Independence:** Light rays do not interact with each other (they cross without affecting each other).\n3.  **Reversibility:** Light paths are reversible - if light can go from A to B, it can go from B to A.\n4.  **Infinite Speed Approximation:** For many applications, we treat light speed as infinite.\n\n**A light ray is an imaginary line representing the direction of light energy flow.**",
        "context": "This model works best when dealing with objects and openings much larger than light's wavelength (~500 nm). For very small openings or precise wave effects, the full wave model is needed."

  "summary": "The ray model represents light as traveling in straight-line paths called rays, providing a powerful geometric approach to understanding light behavior. It assumes rectilinear propagation, ray independence, and path reversibility. Ray diagrams using standardized conventions allow prediction of image locations, shadow sizes, and optical system behavior. The model works excellently for situations involving objects much larger than light's wavelength but fails to explain diffraction, interference, and other wave phenomena. Common misconceptions include thinking rays are physical entities, that the model explains all light behavior, and that only drawn rays contain light. The ray model is the foundation for geometric optics and is essential for understanding mirrors, lenses, and basic optical instruments."
