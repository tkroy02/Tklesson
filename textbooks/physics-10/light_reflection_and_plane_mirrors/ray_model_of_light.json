Mirrors form images through reflection: plane mirrors create virtual upright images, concave mirrors create real or virtual images depending on object position, and convex mirrors always create virtual reduced images. Lenses use refraction: converging lenses focus light with focal length $f > 0$, diverging lenses spread light with $f < 0$. The thin lens equation $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$ and magnification $m = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}$ quantify image relationships. Ray tracing with principal rays (parallel to axis, through focus, through center) locates images geometrically. Applications include cameras (lens forming real images), telescopes (angular magnification $M = -f_{obj}/f_{eye}$), microscopes (high magnification of small objects), and vision correction (lenses compensating eye defects). The model works when features are much larger than light wavelength, with Fermat's principle of least time providing the fundamental basis for light path selection."
