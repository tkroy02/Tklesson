  "summary": "Light exhibits wave-particle duality, behaving as electromagnetic waves in contexts like interference and diffraction, and as particles (photons) in contexts like the photoelectric effect. This dual nature is resolved in quantum mechanics through the complementarity principle - both descriptions are necessary for a complete understanding. Photons are discrete packets of electromagnetic energy with E = hf and p = h/λ. Historical theories evolved from Newton's corpuscular theory to Maxwell's wave theory to the modern quantum understanding. Common misconceptions include visualizing photons as classical particles, thinking light needs a medium, and misunderstanding duality as alternating states rather than complementary descriptions."
