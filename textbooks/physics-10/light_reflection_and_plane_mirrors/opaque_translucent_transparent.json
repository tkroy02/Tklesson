Translucent materials transmit light diffusely through multiple scattering events (Rayleigh scattering from small particles, Mie scattering from comparable-size particles) described by transport mean free path $l^* = 1/[\\mu_s(1-g)]$. Transparent materials transmit light clearly with minimal absorption ($\\alpha < 1$ cm$^{-1}$) and scattering, requiring large band gaps ($E_g > 3.1$ eV) and structural homogeneity. Key principles include the Beer-Lambert law $I = I_0 e^{-\\alpha x}$ for intensity decay, Fresnel equations for interface reflection, and scattering anisotropy $g$ for directionality. Applications range from windows and lenses (transparent) to diffusers and privacy screens (translucent) to shields and absorbers (opaque), with material selection based on required optical properties and transmission characteristics."
