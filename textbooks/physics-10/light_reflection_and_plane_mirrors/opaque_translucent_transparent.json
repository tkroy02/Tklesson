  "topic": "8.4 Opaque, Translucent, Transparent",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores how different materials interact with light based on their ability to transmit, absorb, or reflect light. Students will learn to classify materials as opaque, translucent, or transparent based on their light-transmission properties and understand the physical reasons for these behaviors.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Materials are classified based on how they interact with light: transparent materials transmit light clearly, translucent materials transmit light diffusely, and opaque materials block light transmission entirely.",
    "explanation": "These differences arise from how materials interact with photons at the atomic and molecular level - whether light is absorbed, reflected, or allowed to pass through with minimal scattering."

  "summary": "Materials are classified as transparent (clear transmission), translucent (diffuse transmission), or opaque (no transmission) based on how they interact with light. Transparent materials allow clear image formation, translucent materials transmit light but scatter it, and opaque materials block light entirely. These properties depend on atomic structure, surface quality, thickness, and light wavelength. Practical applications include windows (transparent), lamp shades (translucent), and walls (opaque). Common misconceptions include thinking all clear materials are transparent to all wavelengths, that opaque materials don't interact with light, and that translucency is merely imperfect transparency rather than a useful property in its own right."
