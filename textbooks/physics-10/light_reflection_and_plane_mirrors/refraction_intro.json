  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the phenomenon of refraction - the bending of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another. Students will learn why light changes direction, how to predict the direction of bending, and explore everyday examples of refraction.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Refraction occurs when light changes speed as it passes between different media, causing the light ray to change direction. The amount of bending depends on the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of the two materials.",
    "explanation": "Light travels at different speeds in different materials. When light enters a new medium at an angle, one part of the wave front slows down first, causing the entire wave to change direction, similar to a marching band changing direction when they hit mud."

  "summary": "Refraction is the bending of light that occurs when it passes between media with different refractive indices, caused by the change in light speed. Snell's Law (n₁sinθ₁ = n₂sinθ₂) quantitatively describes this bending. Light bends toward the normal when entering a higher-n medium and away from the normal when entering a lower-n medium. Everyday effects include apparent depth illusions, broken pencil appearances, and mirages. At the critical angle (sinθ_c = n₂/n₁), light refracts at 90°, and beyond this angle, total internal reflection occurs. Common misconceptions include thinking light bends purposefully, that frequency changes during refraction, and that refraction only occurs at sharp boundaries."
