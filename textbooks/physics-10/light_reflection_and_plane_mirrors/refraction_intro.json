Light bends toward the normal when entering higher-index media (slowing down) and away from normal when entering lower-index media (speeding up). The refractive index $n = c/v$ quantifies light slowing in materials, ranging from ~1.00 for air to ~2.42 for diamond. Refraction causes apparent depth ($d_{apparent} = d_{actual}/n$) and lateral shifts for objects viewed through interfaces. Natural phenomena include mirages (atmospheric refraction), rainbows (dispersion in droplets), and stellar aberration. Applications include lenses (focusing light), prisms (separating colors), fiber optics (light guidance), and vision correction. Dispersion causes wavelength-dependent refraction, creating chromatic effects in prisms and requiring achromatic lens designs for color correction."
