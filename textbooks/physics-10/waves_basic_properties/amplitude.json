  "summary": "Amplitude represents the maximum displacement from equilibrium in wave motion and serves as the primary determinant of wave energy through the fundamental relationship $E \\propto A^2$. This square law means doubling amplitude quadruples energy, explaining why small amplitude increases can cause dramatic effects. Amplitude measurement varies by wave type: crest height for transverse waves, particle displacement for longitudinal waves, field strength for electromagnetic waves. Human perception follows logarithmic scales (decibels, magnitudes) that compress enormous physical ranges into manageable experiences. Practical applications span hearing conservation, structural design, laser safety, and environmental monitoring, where amplitude control prevents damage while enabling optimal system performance. Understanding amplitude-energy relationships enables prediction of wave effects, design of protection systems, and development of technologies that harness wave energy safely and efficiently across diverse fields from medicine to engineering to environmental science."
