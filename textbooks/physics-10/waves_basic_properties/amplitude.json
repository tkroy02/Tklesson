  "expanded_description": "This section explores the concept of amplitude, the maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium position. Students will learn that amplitude is the primary factor determining the energy carried by a wave and its perceived intensity.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Amplitude measures the maximum magnitude of a wave's disturbance and is directly related to the energy the wave carries.",
    "explanation": "A larger amplitude means a greater disturbance from equilibrium. For a mechanical wave, this requires the source to do more work to create the wave, resulting in more energy being transferred. This energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude."

        "definition": "**Amplitude (A):** The maximum displacement of a particle in the medium from its equilibrium (rest) position as a wave passes through.\n\n**Measurement:**\n- **Transverse Waves:** Measured vertically from the equilibrium line to a crest or trough.\n- **Longitudinal Waves:** Measured as the maximum displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position along the direction of wave travel. It is also related to the maximum pressure change from normal atmospheric pressure.",

  "summary": "Amplitude is the maximum displacement of particles in a medium from their equilibrium position as a wave passes. It is the primary factor determining the energy carried by a wave, with the relationship being E ∝ A² (energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude). This means doubling the amplitude quadruples the wave's energy. Amplitude directly affects our perception of waves: for sound, it determines loudness; for light, it determines brightness. The initial amplitude is set by the energy of the source, but it decreases over distance due to damping and wave spreading. Common errors include confusing amplitude with wavelength, thinking amplitude affects wave speed, mis-measuring amplitude as the full trough-to-crest height, and assuming a linear instead of quadratic relationship between amplitude and energy."
