  "topic": "6.7 Frequency and Period",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive exploration of the temporal characteristics of waves: frequency and period. Students will learn that these are two different, inversely related ways to describe the oscillation rate of a wave, with frequency being determined solely by the source.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Frequency measures the number of wave cycles occurring per unit time, while period measures the duration of one complete cycle. They provide a complete description of a wave's behavior in time.",
    "explanation": "A high-frequency wave is 'fast' in time, with oscillations rapidly succeeding one another. A low-frequency wave is 'slow' in time. The period is the 'clock' of a single oscillation, and the frequency is how many times that clock ticks per second."

  "summary": "Frequency (f) is the number of wave cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Period (T) is the time for one complete cycle, measured in seconds. They are inversely related by f = 1/T. Frequency is a fundamental property determined solely by the wave source and remains constant when a wave passes between different media; any change in wave speed is accompanied by a corresponding change in wavelength. Frequency directly determines sensory perceptions: for sound, it is pitch (high f = high pitch); for light, it is color (high f = blue/violet). A common misconception is that frequency changes in a new medium; in reality, it is the invariant property, while wavelength and speed adjust. Angular frequency (ω = 2πf) is a related quantity used for mathematical convenience in describing oscillatory motion."
