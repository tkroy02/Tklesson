  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on longitudinal waves, where the particle oscillation is parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Students will learn to visualize and describe these waves, which are less intuitive than transverse waves but are fundamental to understanding sound and seismic activity.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a longitudinal wave, the particles of the medium oscillate back and forth along the same direction that the wave travels.",
    "explanation": "The energy transfer and the wave pattern move in one direction, and the individual particles of the medium oscillate parallel to that direction. This creates regions of compression and rarefaction (spreading) that travel through the medium."

        "definition": "**Directional Relationship:**\n\n- **Wave Velocity:** The direction the wave pattern and energy move.\n- **Particle Velocity:** The instantaneous velocity of a single particle in the medium as it oscillates.\n\n**For a pure longitudinal wave:**\nParticle Velocity is parallel to Wave Velocity.\n\nThe particle velocity is parallel (or anti-parallel) to the direction of wave propagation.",

The wave of 'stopping' moves backward.",

        "definition": "**Standard Terminology:**\n\nUnlike transverse waves, longitudinal waves are not easily drawn as a wiggly line. They are best understood by their density variations:\n\n- **Compression:** A region where the particles are momentarily close together. This corresponds to high pressure and density.\n- **Rarefaction:** A region where the particles are momentarily far apart. This corresponds to low pressure and density.\n- **Wavelength:** The distance between two successive compressions (or two successive rarefactions).\n- **Amplitude:** The maximum displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position. Related to the pressure difference between compressions and rarefactions.",

  "summary": "A longitudinal wave is characterized by particle oscillation that is parallel to the direction of wave propagation. This creates a traveling pattern of compressions (high-density, high-pressure regions) and rarefactions (low-density, low-pressure regions). The wavelength is the distance between successive compressions, and the amplitude is related to the maximum particle displacement and the pressure variation. Key examples include sound waves in all media and seismic P-waves. These waves are often represented graphically by plotting density or pressure versus position, which produces a transverse-like wave form that should not be misinterpreted as the physical shape of the medium. Common misconceptions include believing sound is transverse, thinking air molecules travel with a sound wave, and misinterpreting the graphical representations of compressions and rarefactions."
