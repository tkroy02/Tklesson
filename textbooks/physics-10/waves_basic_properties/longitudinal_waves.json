Time-of-flight measurements locate defects precisely. Used for weld inspection in pipelines and structures, aircraft component testing, and quality control in manufacturing. Can detect sub-millimeter flaws in critical components, preventing catastrophic failures. Thickness gauging measures material thickness through echo timing in corrosion monitoring applications."

Telephones, public address systems, and hearing aids amplify and transmit sound. Noise-canceling headphones use destructive interference to reduce ambient noise. Architectural acoustics designs rooms and auditoriums for optimal sound quality.

Travel through solids, liquids, and gases. Wave speed increases with depth: 5-8 km/s in crust and mantle. Used to locate earthquake epicenters through triangulation. P-wave shadow zone (104°-140° from epicenter) reveals core size and properties. Provide information about rock density and elastic properties through amplitude and waveform analysis. Used in earthquake early warning systems to detect earthquakes seconds before damaging waves arrive."

Acoustic leak detection identifies gas or liquid leaks through the sound they generate. Flow measurement uses ultrasonic time-of-flight techniques to measure fluid velocity in pipes.

  "summary": "Longitudinal waves are characterized by particle oscillations parallel to the direction of energy propagation, creating alternating regions of compression (high pressure and density) and rarefaction (low pressure and density). These waves include sound waves in air, water, and solids; seismic P-waves; and ultrasonic waves used in medical and industrial applications. The parallel oscillation enables efficient energy transfer through all states of matter, with wave speed determined by the medium's bulk modulus and density. Mathematically, longitudinal waves are described by displacement functions $s(x,t) = s_0\\sin(kx - \\omega t)$ and pressure functions $\\Delta P(x,t) = \\Delta P_0\\cos(kx - \\omega t)$, with pressure variations 90° out of phase with particle displacements. Applications span from everyday audio communication and medical ultrasound imaging to seismic exploration and industrial process monitoring, demonstrating the fundamental importance of longitudinal wave principles across science, technology, and daily life. The universal medium compatibility of longitudinal waves makes them indispensable for applications requiring energy transfer through material substances."
