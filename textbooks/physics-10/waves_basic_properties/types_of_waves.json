  "summary": "Waves are fundamentally divided into mechanical waves, which require a material medium and transfer energy through particle interactions, and electromagnetic waves, which propagate through vacuum via oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Mechanical waves include sound and seismic waves, with speeds determined by medium properties like elasticity and density. Electromagnetic waves encompass the entire spectrum from radio to gamma rays, all traveling at light speed in vacuum ($3\\times10^8$ m/s) but interacting differently with matter based on frequency. While both wave types obey the universal wave equation $v = f\\lambda$ and exhibit reflection, refraction, and interference, their medium requirements, speed characteristics, and polarization behaviors differ fundamentally. This classification determines their technological applications: mechanical waves excel in medical ultrasound and material testing where medium interaction is essential, while electromagnetic waves dominate communication, imaging, and sensing applications requiring vacuum operation and high-speed propagation. Understanding these distinctions enables appropriate technology selection across diverse physical environments and applications."
