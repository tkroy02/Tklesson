  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive exploration of wavelength, the fundamental spatial property of a wave. Students will learn to define, measure, and apply the concept of wavelength, understanding its role as the spatial period of a wave and its critical relationship with frequency and wave speed.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Wavelength is the spatial distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is the distance between consecutive points that are in phase, representing one complete cycle of the wave in space.",
    "explanation": "Just as the period (T) is the time for one complete cycle, the wavelength (λ) is the *distance* for one complete cycle. It is the spatial analog of the temporal period, connecting how a wave behaves in space to how it behaves in time."

  "summary": "Wavelength (λ) is the spatial period of a wave, defined as the distance between two successive, identical points (e.g., crest-to-crest). It is a fundamental property that determines how a wave interacts with its environment, influencing phenomena like diffraction and resonance. Wavelength is inversely related to frequency for a given wave speed ($v = f\\lambda$). It is crucial to distinguish wavelength from amplitude (a vertical measurement) and period (a temporal measurement). A common error is to assume wavelength is constant; when a wave enters a new medium, its frequency stays the same but its wavelength changes with the wave speed. The entire electromagnetic spectrum is classified by wavelength, from long radio waves to short gamma rays."
