Ultrasonic thickness gauges measure echo time in materials. Laser rangefinders measure distance through light travel time. GPS systems use signal timing for positioning. Ocean acoustic tomography measures sound travel times for ocean temperature mapping. These applications demonstrate how wavelength can be determined indirectly through timing measurements when wave speed is known, enabling distance measurement and remote sensing."

  "summary": "Wavelength (λ) represents the spatial period of a wave - the distance between successive identical points in the wave pattern, fundamentally connected to frequency and speed through $v = f\\lambda$. This relationship means wavelength changes when waves enter different media while frequency remains constant. Wavelength determines key wave behaviors: diffraction occurs when obstacle size ≈ λ, resolution is limited to ~λ/2, and resonance requires system dimensions = nλ/2. Measurement techniques include interferometry, diffraction grating spectroscopy, and resonance methods. Applications span communications (fiber optics using specific λ for minimum loss), medicine (imaging modalities using different λ for various tissue penetrations), remote sensing (multispectral imaging using characteristic λ for material identification), and materials processing (lasers using λ matched to material absorption). Understanding wavelength enables prediction of wave behavior, design of wave-based technologies, and exploitation of wavelength-dependent phenomena across science and engineering."
