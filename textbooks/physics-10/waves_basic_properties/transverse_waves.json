  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on transverse waves, where the particle oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Students will learn to visualize, describe, and analyze these waves, which include common examples like waves on a string and all electromagnetic radiation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a transverse wave, the particles of the medium oscillate in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels.",
    "explanation": "The energy transfer and the wave pattern move in one direction, while the individual particles of the medium move back and forth at right angles to that direction. This creates the characteristic 'up-and-down' or 'side-to-side' pattern we associate with many waves."

The wave is the moving pattern, not the moving people.\n\n**Slinky Demo:**\n- Lay a slinky on a table.\n- Flick the end side-to-side.\n- A pulse travels along the slinky.\n- Each coil moves left-and-right, but the pulse moves forward.\n- The coil motion (left-right) is perpendicular to the pulse travel (forward).",

  "summary": "A transverse wave is characterized by particle oscillation that is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. This creates a waveform with identifiable features: crests (high points), troughs (low points), amplitude (maximum displacement), and wavelength (spatial period). The wave pattern and energy travel through the medium, but the particles themselves only oscillate around fixed points. Key examples include waves on a string (mechanical) and all electromagnetic radiation. Common misconceptions involve confusing the transport of energy with the transport of matter, equating wave speed with particle speed, and misinterpreting the motion of particles at different points in the wave cycle. The traveling wave equation provides a complete mathematical description of the wave's behavior in both space and time."
