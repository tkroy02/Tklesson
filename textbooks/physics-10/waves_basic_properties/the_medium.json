Low density enables easy particle motion but provides weak coupling, limiting speed. Attenuation: moderate due to viscosity and thermal conduction. Frequency dependence: minimal dispersion for audible frequencies. Examples: Air (343 m/s at 20°C), helium (965 m/s), carbon dioxide (259 m/s). Temperature effects significant: +0.6 m/s per °C for air. Pressure independence: speed depends on temperature, not pressure, for ideal gases.

Low compressibility enables efficient energy transfer. Transverse waves possible only at interfaces (surface waves) or with very high frequency/viscosity. Attenuation: generally low, enabling long-distance propagation. Examples: Water (1480 m/s), mercury (1450 m/s), oil (1300 m/s). Temperature dependence complex: water speed increases to 74°C then decreases. Pressure effects: speed increases with pressure due to increased bulk modulus.

Examples: Steel (5050 m/s longitudinal, 3190 m/s transverse), aluminum (5090/3100 m/s), glass (5200/3400 m/s). Anisotropy: crystals have direction-dependent speeds.

Deep water waves: v = √(gλ/2π) - longer waves travel faster. Seismic surface waves disperse, with different frequencies arriving at different times.

  "summary": "The medium is the physical substance or field through which waves propagate, with its properties fundamentally determining wave behavior. Mechanical waves require material media (solids, liquids, gases) and propagate through elastic deformation, while electromagnetic waves can travel through vacuum via field oscillations. Wave speed depends on medium properties through v = √(elastic property/density), with bulk modulus governing fluids, Young's modulus for solids, and shear modulus for transverse waves. Media characteristics including density, elasticity, homogeneity, and anisotropy control wave speed, attenuation, mode support, and boundary interactions. Practical applications range from acoustic material design and composite development to medical imaging and geophysical exploration, where medium engineering enables optimized wave behavior for specific technologies. Understanding wave-medium interactions provides the foundation for predicting wave phenomena, designing wave-based systems, and extracting information about materials through wave measurements across scientific, medical, and engineering disciplines."
