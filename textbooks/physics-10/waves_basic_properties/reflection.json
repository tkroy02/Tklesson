  "expanded_description": "This section explores the phenomenon of wave reflection, where waves bounce off barriers or interfaces between different media. Students will learn the principles governing how waves reflect, including the law of reflection and how the nature of the boundary affects the phase of the reflected wave.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Reflection occurs when a wave encounters a boundary between two different media and bounces back into the original medium. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the nature of the boundary determines whether the wave inverts upon reflection.",
    "explanation": "When a wave hits an obstacle or boundary, some or all of its energy is sent back into the medium from which it came. This fundamental behavior explains echoes, mirrors, radar, and many other everyday phenomena."

        "definition": "**Law of Reflection:**\n\nFor any wave reflecting off a boundary, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n\n**Key Definitions:**\n- **Angle of Incidence (θᵢ):** The angle between the incoming wave front (or ray) and the normal (perpendicular) to the reflecting surface.\n- **Angle of Reflection (θᵣ):** The angle between the reflected wave front (or ray) and the normal.\n- **The Law:** θᵢ = θᵣ\n\n**The incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane.**",
        "context": "This law applies to all types of waves—mechanical, electromagnetic, and matter waves—when reflecting off smooth surfaces. It is a consequence of the conservation of momentum and energy at the boundary."

  "summary": "Reflection occurs when waves bounce off boundaries between media. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection (θᵢ = θᵣ), measured from the normal to the surface. The nature of the boundary determines phase behavior: fixed/rigid boundaries cause phase inversion (wave flips), while free/open boundaries cause reflection without inversion. Reflection can be specular (mirror-like from smooth surfaces) or diffuse (scattered from rough surfaces). At boundaries between different media, energy is typically divided between reflected and transmitted waves. Common errors include measuring angles from the surface instead of the normal, misunderstanding when phase inversion occurs, and thinking rough surfaces violate the law of reflection. Understanding reflection is essential for explaining phenomena ranging from echoes and room acoustics to mirror images and radar systems."
