Doppler radar: measure frequency shift for speed. Applications: Air traffic control, weather monitoring, speed enforcement, military surveillance. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR): creates detailed images from aircraft or satellites. The 3.33 μs delay for 1 km distance (round trip) requires precise timing. Different frequencies: L-band (1-2 GHz) for foliage penetration, X-band (8-12 GHz) for high resolution."

  "summary": "Wave reflection is the bouncing of waves off surfaces and boundaries, governed by the fundamental law that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence (θ_r = θ_i). The intensity of reflection is determined by the reflection coefficient R = [(Z₂-Z₁)/(Z₂+Z₁)]², which depends on the impedance mismatch between media. Reflection can be specular (smooth surfaces, preserving image formation) or diffuse (rough surfaces, scattering waves). Phase changes upon reflection depend on boundary conditions, with fixed boundaries typically causing 180° phase inversion. Applications span from everyday mirrors and echoes to advanced technologies including radar (radio wave reflection for detection), sonar (sound reflection for underwater mapping), medical ultrasound (tissue boundary reflection for imaging), and seismic exploration (subsurface layer reflection for resource detection). Reflection principles also explain natural phenomena like rainbows, mirages, and the operation of optical fibers through total internal reflection. Understanding wave reflection enables the design of imaging systems, communication technologies, and measurement instruments across the electromagnetic and mechanical wave spectra."
