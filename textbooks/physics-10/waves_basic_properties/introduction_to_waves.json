  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the fundamental concepts of wave motion. Students will learn that a wave is a disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another without transferring matter, and they will be introduced to the basic terminology used to describe all types of waves.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A wave is a traveling disturbance that carries energy through a medium or through space, while the particles of the medium itself oscillate around a fixed point.",
    "explanation": "Waves are nature's way of transferring energy without the bulk transport of material. Think of a crowd wave in a stadium: the people (the medium) move up and down but don't move horizontally with the wave; it's the *pattern* and *energy* that travel around the stadium."

        "definition": "**Wave Definition:** A wave is a disturbance that propagates through space and time, usually with the transfer of energy.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- **Energy Transfer:** Waves carry energy.\n- **No Mass Transfer:** The medium does not travel with the wave.\n- **Disturbance:** A change from the equilibrium state.\n- **Propagation:** The disturbance moves through the medium or space.",
        "context": "Waves are everywhere: sound, light, water ripples, earthquakes. Understanding this basic definition is the first step to analyzing all wave phenomena."

          "process": "**Identifying Wave Motion:**\n\n**Example 1: Slinky Wave**\n- You flick one end of a slinky.\n- A pulse travels along it.\n- Each coil moves back and forth but returns to its original position.\n- **Energy is transferred** from your hand to the other end.\n\n**Example 2: Sound Wave**\n- A speaker diaphragm vibrates.\n- It disturbs air molecules, which collide with their neighbors.\n- A region of high pressure (compression) travels through the air.\n- **Energy is transferred** to your eardrum, but the air from the speaker does not reach you.\n\n**The medium oscillates locally; the wave and its energy propagate.**",

The people are the medium.\n\n**Electromagnetic Wave Examples:**\n- **Sunlight:** Travels 150 million km through the vacuum of space to reach Earth.\n- **Wi-Fi Signal:** Radio waves that travel through the air (but don't need it) and walls.\n- **X-ray at hospital:** EM waves that travel through the air and into your body.",

  "summary": "A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy without transferring matter. Waves are primarily classified as mechanical (require a medium, like sound) or electromagnetic (do not require a medium, like light). They can also be described as transverse (particle motion perpendicular to wave travel) or longitudinal (particle motion parallel to wave travel, creating compressions and rarefactions). A wave can be a single pulse or a continuous periodic wave. The basic anatomy of a transverse wave includes the crest (high point), trough (low point), amplitude (maximum displacement, related to energy), and wavelength (distance for one complete cycle). The most common misconception is that waves carry matter; they carry energy. Understanding these fundamental concepts and terms provides the foundation for all further study of wave phenomena."
