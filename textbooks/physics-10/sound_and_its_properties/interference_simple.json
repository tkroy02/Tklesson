  "expanded_description": "This section explores wave interference, the phenomenon that occurs when two or more sound waves overlap in space. Students will learn about constructive and destructive interference and how these principles explain beats, noise-canceling headphones, and the acoustic design of spaces.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Wave interference occurs when two or more waves overlap, combining to form a resultant wave. The principle of superposition states that the net displacement at any point equals the sum of the displacements of the individual waves.",
    "explanation": "When waves meet, they don't collide like particles but pass through each other. At points where crests align with crests, they reinforce (constructive interference). Where crests align with troughs, they cancel (destructive interference)."

        "definition": "**Superposition Principle:**\n\nWhen two or more waves overlap in the same medium, the resultant displacement at any point equals the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves at that point.\n\n**Mathematically:**\n$$y_{total}(x,t) = y_1(x,t) + y_2(x,t) + \\cdots$$\n\nThis principle applies to all linear waves, including sound waves.",

At each point along the x-axis, add the y-values (displacements) of both waves.\n3. Plot the sum to get the resultant wave.\n\n**Simple Case - Two Identical Waves:**\n- If they are in phase (crests align): Resultant amplitude = 2A (constructive)\n- If they are out of phase (crest meets trough): Resultant amplitude = 0 (destructive)\n\n**The waves temporarily combine but then continue unchanged after passing through each other.**",

  "summary": "Wave interference occurs when two or more waves overlap and combine according to the superposition principle. Constructive interference (waves in phase) increases amplitude, while destructive interference (waves out of phase) decreases amplitude. Beats are the periodic loudness variations that occur when two waves of slightly different frequencies interfere, with beat frequency equal to the difference between the frequencies. Standing waves are stationary interference patterns formed by waves traveling in opposite directions, characterized by nodes (no displacement) and antinodes (maximum displacement). These principles explain phenomena from noise-canceling headphones to musical instrument tones. Common misconceptions include thinking destructive interference destroys energy, confusing beat frequency with heard pitch, and misunderstanding the nature of standing waves."
