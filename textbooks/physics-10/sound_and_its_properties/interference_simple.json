  "summary": "Wave interference occurs when multiple sound waves combine through superposition, creating reinforcement (constructive interference) where waves are in phase and cancellation (destructive interference) where waves are out of phase. Constructive interference requires path differences of nλ, destructive interference requires (n+½)λ, creating spatial intensity patterns following I = 4I₀cos²(πΔr/λ). Beats represent temporal interference between similar frequencies, with beat frequency f_beat = |f₁-f₂| creating amplitude modulation. Standing waves form through interference with reflections, creating stationary nodes and antinodes determined by boundary conditions. Applications include active noise cancellation (using destructive interference), musical instruments (exploiting standing waves), acoustic beamforming (using constructive interference), and precision measurement (using interferometric techniques). Interference demonstrates fundamental wave properties while enabling technologies that control sound distribution, reduce noise, and extract detailed acoustic information through careful manipulation of wave combination effects."
