  "summary": "Echoes are distinct sound reflections perceived as separate from the original sound when time delays exceed approximately 50 ms (path differences >17 m). Sound reflection follows the law of reflection with strength determined by acoustic impedance mismatch $R = \\left(\\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}\\right)^2$, causing nearly complete reflection at air-water interfaces. Echo ranging uses $d = \\frac{c\\cdot\\Delta t}{2}$ for distance measurement, enabling technologies from sonar to medical ultrasound. Architectural configurations create specific echo phenomena: flutter echoes between parallel surfaces, whispering gallery effects along curved surfaces, and focusing in concave structures. Natural environments produce distinctive echoes from cliffs, water surfaces, and complex terrain. Applications span medical imaging (ultrasound), industrial testing (non-destructive evaluation), environmental monitoring (seismic profiling), and consumer devices (parking sensors). Echo phenomena demonstrate fundamental wave principles while providing practical tools for visualization, measurement, and navigation in environments where direct observation is impossible."
