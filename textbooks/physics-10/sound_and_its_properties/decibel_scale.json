  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the decibel scale, the logarithmic unit used to measure sound intensity levels. Students will learn why this scale is necessary, how to use it, and how it relates to both physical sound intensity and human loudness perception.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The decibel (dB) scale is a logarithmic measurement system that compresses the enormous range of human hearing into manageable numbers and closely matches how we perceive changes in loudness.",
    "explanation": "Because human hearing can detect sound intensities ranging over 12 orders of magnitude (a trillion-fold range), a linear scale would be impractical. The logarithmic decibel scale converts this enormous range into numbers from 0 to 120 dB that correspond to our subjective loudness experience."

This is impractical for everyday use.\n\n**Solution:** A logarithmic scale compresses this range to 0-120 dB.",

  "summary": "The decibel scale is a logarithmic measurement system that compresses the enormous range of human hearing (10⁻¹² to 1 W/m²) into manageable numbers from 0 to 120 dB. It is defined as β = 10 log₁₀(I/I₀) dB, where I₀ = 10⁻¹² W/m² is the threshold of hearing. Key benchmarks include: 0 dB (hearing threshold), 60 dB (normal conversation), 85 dB (8-hour safety limit), and 120 dB (pain threshold). Each +10 dB increase represents a tenfold intensity increase and approximately doubles the perceived loudness. When adding sound sources, two identical sounds produce a +3 dB increase, not double the dB level. Common errors include treating the scale as linear, misunderstanding 0 dB as silence, and incorrectly adding dB values arithmetically."
