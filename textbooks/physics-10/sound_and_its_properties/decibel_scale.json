  "summary": "The decibel scale provides a logarithmic measurement system for sound intensity and pressure, compressing the enormous $10^{12}:1$ range of human hearing into a manageable 0-120 dB scale. Using the formulas $L_I = 10\\log_{10}(I/I_0)$ dB for intensity and $L_p = 20\\log_{10}(p/p_0)$ dB for pressure with references $I_0 = 10^{-12}$ W/m² and $p_0 = 20$ μPa, decibels preserve multiplicative relationships where each 10 dB increase represents 10× more intensity and each 3 dB increase represents 2× more intensity. Multiple sound sources combine logarithmically rather than arithmetically, with identical sources adding +3 dB per doubling. Frequency weightings (A, C, Z) approximate human hearing sensitivity for different applications, with dBA used for environmental and occupational noise assessment. Standardized measurement instruments (Class 0, 1, 2) provide calibrated accuracy for scientific, regulatory, and engineering applications. The decibel scale's mathematical elegance enables practical computation of complex acoustic scenarios while matching the logarithmic nature of human auditory perception across diverse applications from noise control to audio engineering."
