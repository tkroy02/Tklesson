  "summary": "Noise pollution represents unwanted environmental sound that adversely affects human health and natural ecosystems through excessive amplitude, inappropriate timing, or disruptive character. Health impacts include noise-induced hearing loss from excessive levels (>80-85 dBA chronic exposure) and non-auditory effects like cardiovascular disease, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment via stress pathways. Ecological impacts involve disrupted animal communication, navigation, and behavior. Regulation uses metrics like L_eq (equivalent continuous level), L_dn (day-night level with +10 dB night penalty), and L_den (day-evening-night level) with A-weighting for human response. Mitigation follows source-path-receiver hierarchy: source control (quieter technologies), path interruption (barriers, distance), and receiver protection (building insulation, hearing protection). Effective noise management combines technological solutions, urban planning, regulatory frameworks, and public education to reduce environmental noise impact while maintaining economic and social functions."
