  "expanded_description": "This section examines noise pollution as an environmental and public health issue. Students will learn to define noise pollution, understand its sources and effects, and explore methods for its control and mitigation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Noise pollution is the presence of unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities that disrupts natural soundscapes and has adverse effects on human health and environmental quality.",
    "explanation": "Unlike general sound, noise is typically defined as 'unwanted sound.' When this unwanted sound becomes persistent and pervasive in the environment, it becomes pollution that can damage hearing, cause stress, and disrupt ecosystems."

      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "**Key Characteristics of Noise Pollution:**\n\n1.  **Unwantedness:** Sound that is intrusive, annoying, or disruptive to desired activities.\n2.  **Harmful Levels:** Sound intensity exceeding safe exposure limits (typically >85 dB for prolonged exposure).\n3.  **Environmental Disruption:** Sound that masks natural soundscapes or interferes with animal communication.\n4.  **Persistence:** Continuous or frequently recurring noise that prevents recovery.\n\n**Noise is subjective - what is music to one person may be noise to another, but pollution occurs at objectively harmful levels.**",
        "context": "The transition from 'sound' to 'noise' to 'pollution' depends on both objective measurements (decibel levels) and subjective experience (unwantedness)."

  "summary": "Noise pollution is the presence of unwanted or harmful outdoor sound that adversely affects human health and environmental quality. Major sources include transportation, industrial activities, and community noise. Health impacts range from noise-induced hearing loss to cardiovascular disease, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Ecological effects include disrupted animal communication, altered predator-prey relationships, and habitat abandonment. Control strategies follow a hierarchy: source reduction, path interruption, and receiver protection. Effective management requires regulations at international, national, and local levels combined with community action. Common misconceptions include thinking people adapt to harmful noise, that hearing damage is temporary, and that noise is merely an annoyance rather than a serious health hazard."
