Particle displacement: s(x,t) = s₀cos(kx - ωt), with s₀ = ΔP₀/(ρvω). The pressure and displacement are 90° out of phase - maximum pressure occurs at zero displacement (equilibrium position), zero pressure at maximum displacement. Example: Sound with ΔP₀ = 0.1 Pa (moderate sound), f = 1000 Hz, in air (ρ=1.2 kg/m³, v=343 m/s): s₀ = 0.1/(1.2×343×6283) = 3.86×10⁻⁸ m = 38.6 nm.

Sound intensity level: SIL = 10log₁₀(I/I₀) dB, where I₀ = 10⁻¹² W/m² (threshold of hearing). Example: Sound with ΔP₀ = 0.1 Pa in air: I = (0.1)²/(2×1.2×343) = 1.21×10⁻⁵ W/m², SIL = 10log(1.21×10⁻⁵/10⁻¹²) = 70.8 dB.

Example: Ambulance approaching at 30 m/s, v = 343 m/s: f' = f(343/(343-30)) = 1.096f (9.6% increase). When receding: f' = f(343/(343+30)) = 0.920f (8.0% decrease).

Calibration: using pistonphones (124 dB at 250 Hz) or sound calibrators (94 dB at 1 kHz). Microphone arrays: for sound source localization and beamforming. Acoustic cameras: visualize sound fields. Hydrophones: underwater microphones for ocean monitoring. These instruments enable precise sound measurement for environmental monitoring, product testing, scientific research, and regulatory compliance with traceable calibration standards."

  "summary": "Sound consists of longitudinal mechanical waves that propagate through material media as alternating regions of compression (high pressure) and rarefaction (low pressure). These waves transfer energy while particles oscillate about equilibrium positions without net mass transport. Sound requires a material medium for propagation, with speed determined by v = √(B/ρ) where B is bulk modulus and ρ is density - faster in stiff, low-density materials. Mathematically described by pressure variation ΔP(x,t) = ΔP₀sin(kx - ωt) and intensity I = (ΔP₀)²/(2ρv), sound exhibits characteristic behaviors including reflection, refraction, interference, and the Doppler effect. Human perception involves logarithmic relationships, with loudness measured in decibels and pitch related to frequency. Biological hearing employs sophisticated mechanical and neural processing for frequency analysis and dynamic range compression, while technological detection uses various transducer principles. Understanding sound as waves explains diverse phenomena from musical acoustics to ultrasound imaging to environmental noise propagation, providing the foundation for audio technology, acoustic design, and hearing science."
