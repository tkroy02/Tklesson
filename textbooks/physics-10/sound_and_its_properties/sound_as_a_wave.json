              "explanation": "Bats: ultrasonic hearing (20-200 kHz) for echolocation, with specialized cochlea for high frequencies. Dolphins: underwater hearing up to 150 kHz, using jawbone conduction. Elephants: infrasound detection (14-35 Hz) for long-distance communication. Owls: asymmetric ears for precise sound localization. Moths: ultrasonic hearing to detect bat predators. These adaptations demonstrate how hearing evolves for specific ecological niches, with frequency ranges, sensitivity, and directional capabilities matched to survival needs."

  "summary": "Sound consists of longitudinal mechanical waves that propagate through material media as alternating regions of compression (high pressure) and rarefaction (low pressure). These waves transfer energy while particles oscillate about equilibrium positions without net mass transport. Sound requires a material medium for propagation, with speed determined by $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{B}{\\rho}}$ where $B$ is bulk modulus and $\\rho$ is density - faster in stiff, low-density materials. Mathematically described by pressure variation $\\Delta P(x,t) = \\Delta P_0\\sin(kx - \\omega t)$ and intensity $I = \\frac{(\\Delta P_0)^2}{2\\rho v}$, sound exhibits characteristic behaviors including reflection, refraction, interference, and the Doppler effect. Human perception involves logarithmic relationships, with loudness measured in decibels and pitch related to frequency. Biological hearing employs sophisticated mechanical and neural processing for frequency analysis and dynamic range compression, while technological detection uses various transducer principles. Understanding sound as waves explains diverse phenomena from musical acoustics to ultrasound imaging to environmental noise propagation, providing the foundation for audio technology, acoustic design, and hearing science."
