  "expanded_description": "This section explores resonance, the phenomenon where a system vibrates with maximum amplitude when driven at its natural frequency. Students will learn how resonance explains the amplification of sound in musical instruments, the collapse of bridges, and many other physical phenomena.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Resonance occurs when a system is driven by a periodic force at its natural frequency, causing the amplitude of oscillations to increase dramatically due to efficient energy transfer.",
    "explanation": "Every physical object has natural frequencies at which it 'prefers' to vibrate. When external vibrations match these natural frequencies, even small driving forces can produce large amplitude vibrations because energy builds up efficiently in the system."

        "definition": "**Key Definitions:**\n\n**Natural Frequency:** The specific frequency at which a system oscillates when disturbed and then allowed to vibrate freely. Depends on the system's physical properties (mass, elasticity, dimensions).\n\n**Forced Vibration:** When an external periodic force drives a system to vibrate.\n\n**Resonance:** The special case where the driving frequency equals the natural frequency, resulting in maximum energy transfer and amplitude.\n\n**All objects have natural frequencies - from guitar strings to skyscrapers.**",
        "context": "Resonance is why a child on a swing reaches maximum height when pushed at the right timing, and why opera singers can shatter wine glasses with their voice."

      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "**Why Resonance Causes Large Amplitudes:**\n\n**Energy Transfer Efficiency:**\n- At non-resonant frequencies, the driving force works against the system's natural motion.\n- At resonant frequency, the driving force is perfectly synchronized with the system's natural motion.\n- Each push adds energy constructively, like perfectly timed pushes on a swing.\n\n**The driver 'rides with' the natural rhythm of the system, allowing energy to accumulate rather than being wasted fighting the system's natural tendencies.**",
        "context": "This efficient energy transfer is what makes resonance so powerful - small inputs can produce large outputs when the timing is right."

      "examples": [
        {
          "process": "**The Swing Analogy:**\n\n**Poor Timing (Off-Resonance):**\n- You push when the swing is coming toward you\n- Your push fights the swing's motion\n- Little height gain, much effort wasted\n\n**Perfect Timing (Resonance):**\n- You push just as the swing reaches its lowest point and starts moving away\n- Your push perfectly assists the swing's natural motion\n- Maximum height gain with minimal effort\n\n**This is exactly how resonance works in all vibrating systems - perfect timing equals maximum effect.**",

  "summary": "Resonance occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency, causing large amplitude vibrations due to efficient energy transfer. Every physical system has natural frequencies determined by its properties (mass, elasticity, dimensions). Resonance explains musical instrument operation, where bodies amplify specific frequencies, but also poses engineering dangers, as seen in bridge collapses and earthquake damage. The large amplitudes in resonance come from accumulated energy input, not energy creation, and are limited by damping in real systems. Common misconceptions include thinking resonance creates energy, that any vibration causes resonance, or that resonant amplitudes can grow without limit."
