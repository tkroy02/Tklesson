The amplitude response follows A(ω) = F₀/m / √((ω₀²-ω²)² + (γω)²) with maximum at resonance frequency ω₀ = √(k/m). Quality factor Q = ω₀/γ quantifies resonance sharpness, with high-Q systems having narrow bandwidth Δω = ω₀/Q. Musical instruments exploit resonance through standing waves in strings (f_n = nv/2L) and air columns (f_n = nv/2L open-open, f_n = nv/4L open-closed). Engineering applications include beneficial uses (quartz timing, sensors) and harmful resonance control (tuned mass dampers, vibration isolation). Resonance demonstrates efficient energy transfer at specific frequencies while requiring careful management to prevent destructive vibrations in structures and machinery."
