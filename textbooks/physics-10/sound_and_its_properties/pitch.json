  "summary": "Pitch is the perceptual attribute of sound that corresponds to frequency, enabling ordering from low to high on a musical scale. While primarily determined by fundamental frequency, pitch perception involves complex biological processing including place coding (tonotopic organization along basilar membrane) and temporal coding (neural phase locking to waveform periodicity). Mathematical relationships show pitch follows logarithmic scales like mels and Barks rather than linear frequency, with musical intervals based on frequency ratios (octave = 2:1, semitone = 2^(1/12)). Key phenomena include the missing fundamental effect (perceiving pitch from harmonics alone), pitch-intensity interactions, and cultural influences on absolute vs relative pitch. Applications span music technology (autotune, synthesis), speech processing (recognition, synthesis), and hearing assistance (cochlear implants, hearing aids), all leveraging understanding of human pitch perception mechanisms. Pitch perception demonstrates the remarkable ability of biological systems to extract meaningful patterns from physical vibrations, enabling rich auditory experiences of music, speech, and environmental sounds."
