  "topic": "7.4 Pitch",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores pitch, the perceptual quality of sound that allows us to distinguish between high and low sounds. Students will learn that pitch is primarily determined by the frequency of a sound wave and how this relationship manifests in music and everyday listening.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Pitch is the human perception of a sound's frequency. Higher frequency sounds are perceived as higher pitches, while lower frequency sounds are perceived as lower pitches.",
    "explanation": "While frequency is an objective physical measurement (Hz), pitch is the subjective, psychological experience of how 'high' or 'low' a sound seems. The two are directly correlated but not identical, as other factors like intensity and timbre can influence pitch perception."

        "definition": "**Direct Correlation:**\n\n**Frequency (f):** Physical measurement of vibrations per second (Hz).\n**Pitch:** Perceptual quality of how 'high' or 'low' a sound appears.\n\n**The Relationship:**\n- **High Frequency → High Pitch** (e.g., whistle, soprano singer)\n- **Low Frequency → Low Pitch** (e.g., bass drum, tuba)\n\n**This is why shortening a guitar string (increasing its natural frequency) produces a higher pitch.**",
        "context": "This relationship is the foundation of all musical scales and instrument design. Musicians and instrument makers manipulate physical properties to control frequency and therefore pitch."

Most people will feel vibration rather than hear a clear pitch.\n3. Play a middle-range note (e.g., 440 Hz). This is clearly audible as a musical pitch.\n4. Play a very high note (e.g., 15,000 Hz). Younger people will hear it as a high pitch; many adults over 40 may not hear it at all.\n\n**This demonstrates both the range and limits of human pitch perception.**",

  "summary": "Pitch is the perceptual quality of how high or low a sound appears, primarily determined by the sound wave's frequency. Higher frequencies produce higher pitches, and lower frequencies produce lower pitches. The human audible range is approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, with greatest sensitivity in the 2,000-5,000 Hz range. While frequency is the main physical determinant of pitch, other factors like sound intensity and timbre can influence pitch perception. In music, specific frequency ratios create musical intervals that form the basis of scales and harmony. Common misconceptions include confusing pitch with loudness, assuming human hearing is equally sensitive to all frequencies, and thinking that sounds beyond one's hearing range don't physically exist."
