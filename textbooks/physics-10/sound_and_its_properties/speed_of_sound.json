  "expanded_description": "This section examines the factors that determine how fast sound travels through different materials. Students will learn that the speed of sound is not constant but depends on the properties of the medium, primarily its elasticity and density.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The speed of sound in a medium is determined by the medium's elastic properties and its density. Sound travels faster in media that are more rigid (stiffer) and less dense.",
    "explanation": "A stiffer medium transmits the 'push' of a compression wave more quickly because the particles are more strongly coupled. A less dense medium is easier to accelerate, allowing the disturbance to propagate faster."

  "summary": "The speed of sound in a medium is determined by the square root of the ratio of an elastic property to density (v = √(elasticity/density)). It travels fastest in stiff, low-density materials like solids, and slowest in compliant, high-density materials. In gases, sound speed increases with temperature (v ≈ 331 + 0.6T_C m/s) and decreases with molecular mass. The speed is independent of the sound's frequency or amplitude in most common situations. The Mach number (M = v_object/v_sound) compares object speed to sound speed. Common misconceptions include thinking denser materials always slow sound, that frequency affects speed, and that all gases transmit sound at similar speeds."
