              "explanation": "Tissue characterization: different tissues have characteristic speeds (fat 1450 m/s, muscle 1580 m/s, bone 3500 m/s). Image formation: assumes average speed (1540 m/s) for timing calculations. Elastography: measures speed variations for stiffness mapping. Applications: Diagnostic imaging, tissue characterization, cancer detection. Examples: Identifying tumors (often different sound speed), measuring liver fibrosis, monitoring thermal ablation. Sound speed variations provide contrast in medical images and enable tissue characterization beyond conventional imaging."

  "summary": "Sound speed is determined by the fundamental relationship $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{elastic modulus}}{\\rho}}$, with different elastic moduli applying to different states of matter: bulk modulus for fluids, Young's modulus for solids. This creates systematic speed progression: gases (300-1300 m/s) < liquids (1400-1600 m/s) < solids (2000-13000 m/s). Temperature dramatically affects gases through $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma RT}{M}}$, with air following $v = 331 + 0.6T_\\text{°C}$ m/s. Pressure has minimal effect on ideal gases but influences liquids and high-pressure systems. Composition affects speed through molecular weight in gases and material properties in condensed matter. Measurement techniques include time-of-flight, resonance, and interferometric methods, with applications in material characterization, medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and industrial process control. Understanding sound speed factors enables prediction of acoustic behavior, extraction of material properties, and development of technologies from ultrasonic testing to climate monitoring."
