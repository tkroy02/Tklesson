At 1% atmospheric pressure ($\\sim$1 kPa), sound is 40 dB quieter. At 0.1% pressure, essentially inaudible. These measurements confirm the theoretical relationship and show that even trace gases can carry some sound, but practical silence occurs well before perfect vacuum. The data matches gas kinetic theory predictions for mean free path and collision frequency effects on sound propagation."

  "summary": "Sound absolutely requires a material medium for propagation because it relies on particle interactions and elastic deformation to transfer energy through compression and rarefaction waves. In vacuum, the absence of particles makes sound transmission physically impossible, as demonstrated by classic experiments like the bell jar demonstration where sound fades to silence as air is removed. This fundamental requirement distinguishes mechanical waves like sound from electromagnetic waves like light, which can propagate through vacuum via field oscillations. The understanding evolved from ancient philosophical concepts through experimental verification to comprehensive theoretical explanation, with modern applications in space technology (where radio replaces acoustic communication), acoustic engineering (vacuum insulation for soundproofing), and scientific research. The medium requirement explains why space is silent, why sound behaves differently at high altitudes, and why some waves work in environments where others fail, providing crucial insight into wave phenomena and enabling appropriate technology selection for different environments."
