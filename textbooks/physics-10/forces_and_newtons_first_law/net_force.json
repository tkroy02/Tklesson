  "summary": "Net force is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object, determining its acceleration through F_net = ma. Forces combine using vector addition methods, either graphically (tip-to-tail) or analytically (component method). Balanced forces (net force = 0) result in no acceleration, maintaining constant velocity or rest. Unbalanced forces cause acceleration in the net force direction. Friction creates unbalanced forces that decelerate moving objects, while air resistance opposes gravity during falling, increasing with speed until it balances weight at terminal velocity. Understanding net force allows prediction and analysis of motion in diverse real-world applications from transportation to sports to natural phenomena."
