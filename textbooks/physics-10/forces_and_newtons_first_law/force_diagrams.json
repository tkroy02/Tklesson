  "summary": "Force diagrams are essential tools for visualizing and analyzing force interactions in physics. They show all forces acting on an object as vectors, with arrow direction indicating force direction and length representing relative magnitude. Key scenarios include stationary objects (balanced vertical and horizontal forces), objects on inclined planes (weight resolved into parallel and perpendicular components), and objects being pulled (tension with horizontal and vertical components affecting both motion and normal force). Advanced applications involve multiple objects, pulleys, and circular motion. Mastering force diagrams enables solving complex physics problems and has practical applications in engineering, safety analysis, and everyday situations. The systematic approach involves isolating objects, identifying all forces, drawing accurate vectors, and applying Newton's laws to predict motion and equilibrium conditions."
