  "summary": "Gravitational force, manifested as weight ($W = mg$), is fundamentally different from mass. Mass measures the amount of matter and remains constant throughout the universe, while weight is the gravitational force on that matter and varies with location. This explains why objects have different weights on different planets while maintaining the same mass. Measurement instruments reflect this distinction: balance scales measure mass directly through comparison, while spring scales measure weight force and depend on local gravity. Apparent weight changes during acceleration, such as in elevators, where upward acceleration makes objects feel heavier ($F_N = m(g + a)$) and downward acceleration makes them feel lighter ($F_N = m(g - a)$). Understanding these principles explains diverse phenomena from amusement park rides to space travel, demonstrating the universal applicability of gravitational physics."
