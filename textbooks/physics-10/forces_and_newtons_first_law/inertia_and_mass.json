  "summary": "Inertia is the fundamental property of matter that resists changes in motion, quantitatively measured by mass. The direct relationship between mass and inertia explains why massive objects require larger forces for acceleration and why stopping distances increase with both speed and mass. Critical safety applications demonstrate that physics prevents instant stopping - motorcycles cannot avoid sudden road hazards, trains cannot stop for vehicles on tracks, and unrestrained passengers continue moving during sudden braking. Understanding these inertial limitations is essential for safe vehicle operation, emphasizing prevention over reaction and respecting the physical laws that govern all motion. Proper safety systems like seatbelts, airbags, and crumple zones work with physics to manage inertial effects during emergencies."
