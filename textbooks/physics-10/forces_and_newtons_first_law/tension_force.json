  "summary": "Tension is the pulling force transmitted through ropes, strings, and cables. In vertical motion, tension adjusts to provide net force for acceleration ($T - mg = ma$). In horizontal motion, tension overcomes friction to cause motion ($T - f = ma$). Pulley systems redirect tension forces while maintaining constant tension in ideal massless ropes. Complex arrangements require resolving tension into components and solving simultaneous equilibrium equations. Real-world applications must consider rope mass, elasticity, friction, and breaking strengths. Key principles include: tension always pulls, never pushes; in ideal massless strings, tension is constant throughout; and tension provides the connection force between objects in multi-body systems. Mastering tension analysis enables understanding of diverse systems from simple hanging objects to complex engineering structures."
