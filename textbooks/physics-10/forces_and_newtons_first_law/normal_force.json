  "summary": "The normal force is the perpendicular contact force that surfaces exert to support objects and prevent penetration. On level surfaces with only vertical forces, normal force equals weight ($F_N = mg$). On inclined planes, normal force equals the perpendicular component of weight ($F_N = mg\\cos\\theta$) and decreases as the slope steepens. When additional forces act, normal force adjusts to maintain perpendicular equilibrium ($F_N = mg\\cos\\theta + \\Sigma F_{other\\perp}$). Important limitations include: normal force cannot be negative (objects lose contact if $F_N < 0$), it exists only during surface contact, and surfaces have maximum support capacity. Understanding normal force is crucial for analyzing friction (since $f_{max} = \\mu F_N$), apparent weight in elevators, and various engineering applications. Systematic problem-solving involves drawing free-body diagrams, choosing appropriate coordinates, resolving forces, and applying perpendicular equilibrium conditions."
