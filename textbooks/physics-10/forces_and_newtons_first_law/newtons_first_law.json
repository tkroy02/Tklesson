  "summary": "Newton's First Law establishes that objects naturally maintain their state of motion - either rest or constant velocity - unless acted upon by unbalanced external forces. This principle of inertia explains why objects resist changes in motion and why forces are needed to start, stop, or change direction. While ideal inertial motion is rarely observed in everyday life due to friction, air resistance, and other dissipative forces, the First Law provides the fundamental framework for understanding motion. Practical applications range from transportation safety systems (seatbelts, airbags) to sports techniques and vehicle design, all managing the effects of inertia in our force-filled world."
