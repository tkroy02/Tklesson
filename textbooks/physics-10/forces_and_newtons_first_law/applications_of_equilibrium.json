  "summary": "Real-world equilibrium applications demonstrate how force and torque balance principles scale from everyday objects to engineering marvels. Bridges achieve equilibrium through careful distribution of loads to supports and foundations. Cranes use counterweights and boom geometry to balance lifting torques while maintaining base stability. Buildings transfer dead loads, live loads, and environmental forces through structural systems to foundations. Ladders maintain equilibrium through friction at the base and normal forces at wall and ground. Object stability depends on the relationship between center of gravity position and base area. Advanced applications in aerospace and biomechanics push equilibrium principles to their limits. In all cases, successful equilibrium requires satisfying both $\\Sigma F = 0$ and $\\Sigma \\tau = 0$ while considering material limits, safety factors, and potential failure modes. Mastering these applications connects fundamental physics to practical engineering and everyday safety."
