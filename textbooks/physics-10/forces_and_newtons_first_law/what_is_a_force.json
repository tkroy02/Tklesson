  "summary": "Forces are pushes or pulls that can change an object's motion or shape. They are vector quantities measured in Newtons. Forces are categorized as contact forces (requiring physical touch) or non-contact forces (acting at a distance). Friction is a crucial contact force that opposes motion and exists due to microscopic surface irregularities and molecular adhesion. There are four main types of friction: static (prevents starting motion), kinetic (sliding friction), rolling (wheel-like motion), and fluid (air/water resistance). While friction is essential for walking, gripping, and stopping, it also causes energy loss, wear, and heat generation. Engineers manage friction by increasing it where needed (rough surfaces, high-friction materials) and decreasing it where problematic (lubrication, ball bearings, streamlining)."
