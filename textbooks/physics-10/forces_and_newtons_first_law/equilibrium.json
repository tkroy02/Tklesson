  "summary": "Equilibrium occurs when all forces balance perfectly, resulting in zero acceleration. Static equilibrium describes stationary objects ($\\Sigma F = 0$ and $v = 0$), while dynamic equilibrium describes objects moving with constant velocity ($\\Sigma F = 0$ and $v = \\text{constant}$). Vertical equilibrium requires upward and downward forces to cancel ($\\Sigma F_y = 0$), horizontal equilibrium requires leftward and rightward forces to balance ($\\Sigma F_x = 0$), and rotational equilibrium requires torques to cancel ($\\Sigma \\tau = 0$). Complete equilibrium satisfies all three conditions simultaneously, ensuring no translation and no rotation. Understanding equilibrium is essential for analyzing structures, mechanical systems, and everyday situations where forces balance to maintain motion states."
