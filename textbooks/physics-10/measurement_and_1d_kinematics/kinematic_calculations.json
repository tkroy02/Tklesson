Each equation contains four of five variables (u, v, a, s, t). To solve problems: identify three known variables, determine which you don't need, select the equation missing that variable. Special conditions simplify: 'from rest' means u = 0, 'stops' means v = 0. For free fall, use a = g ≈ 10 m/s². Average velocity for uniform acceleration = ½(u + v). Always check units, signs, and physical reasonableness of answers.",
