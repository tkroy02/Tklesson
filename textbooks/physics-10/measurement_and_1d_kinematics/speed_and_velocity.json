  "summary": "Speed and velocity both describe rates of motion but differ fundamentally: speed is scalar (magnitude only), velocity is vector (magnitude + direction). Average speed = total distance ÷ total time; average velocity = total displacement ÷ total time. Uniform velocity requires both constant speed and constant direction (straight-line motion). Non-uniform velocity occurs when speed changes, direction changes, or both. Relative velocity describes motion from different reference frames and requires vector addition. Common applications include transportation (speedometers show speed, GPS uses velocity), sports performance analysis, and navigation. Understanding when to use speed versus velocity depends on whether direction information is needed for the specific application."
