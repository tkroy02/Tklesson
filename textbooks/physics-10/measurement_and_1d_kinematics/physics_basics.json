  "summary": "Physics is the fundamental science that studies matter, energy, and their interactions through space and time. It employs the scientific method - a systematic process of observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, and conclusion drawing - to build reliable knowledge about the natural world. Physics is divided into classical branches (mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics) that describe everyday phenomena and modern branches (quantum mechanics, relativity) that explain behavior at extreme scales and speeds. The field advances through the complementary work of theoretical physicists, who develop mathematical models and explanations, and experimental physicists, who test these models through observation and measurement. Empirical evidence provides the essential foundation for physical knowledge, while peer review ensures quality and reliability. Despite its specialization into different branches, physics represents a unified quest to understand the fundamental principles governing our universe."
