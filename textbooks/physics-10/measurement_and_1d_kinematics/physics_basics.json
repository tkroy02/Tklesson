  "summary": "Physics is the scientific study of matter, energy, and their interactions through space and time. Major branches include mechanics (motion), electromagnetism (electricity and magnetism), thermodynamics (heat and energy), and optics (light). Classical physics describes everyday-scale phenomena accurately, while modern physics (quantum mechanics and relativity) addresses atomic scales and high speeds. The scientific method involves observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation with control groups, analysis, and communication through peer review. Theoretical physics develops mathematical models while experimental physics provides empirical verification through measurement and observation. These complementary approaches work together to advance our understanding of physical phenomena."
