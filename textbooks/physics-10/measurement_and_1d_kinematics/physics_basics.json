  "summary": "Physics is the fundamental science that studies matter, energy, and their interactions using mathematical models and experimental verification. The scientific method provides a systematic approach involving observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, analysis, and communication. Physics deals with fundamental quantities (length, mass, time, etc.) and derived quantities, often expressing conservation principles like energy and momentum conservation. Mathematics serves as the language of physics, enabling precise description of relationships and predictions. Physics principles underlie most technological innovations, from transportation and communication to medicine and energy systems. Careers using physics knowledge range from research and engineering to finance and education. Laboratory work requires strict safety protocols and proper use of measurement instruments. Effective scientific communication through laboratory reports and proper data presentation is essential for knowledge sharing and verification."
