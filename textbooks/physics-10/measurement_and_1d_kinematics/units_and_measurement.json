  "summary": "Unit conversion is a fundamental skill in physics that requires understanding the relationships between different units. Use the conversion factor method: multiply by fractions equal to 1 to cancel unwanted units. Remember key relationships: 1 km = 1000 m, 1 h = 3600 s, 1 m² = 10,000 cm², 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³. For speed conversions: km/h to m/s (divide by 3.6), m/s to km/h (multiply by 3.6). Area conversions require SQUARING the linear factor, volume conversions require CUBING it. Always track units through calculations using dimensional analysis - if units don't work out correctly, your calculation is wrong. Practice systematic problem-solving: identify given and required units, plan conversions, execute carefully, and verify reasonableness.",
