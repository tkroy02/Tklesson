Significant figures represent measurement precision: all non-zero digits, zeros between them, and trailing zeros after decimals are significant, while leading zeros are not. Mathematical operations follow specific precision rules: multiplication/division use fewest significant figures, addition/subtraction use fewest decimal places. Measurement uncertainty includes absolute (± value) and relative (percentage) forms, propagating through calculations with specific rules. Engineering notation uses exponents that are multiples of 3 for compatibility with metric prefixes. Practical applications require proper uncertainty analysis in density, velocity, and other physical calculations. Common errors include incorrect significant figure application and premature rounding, while best practices emphasize unit consistency, appropriate precision, and physical sense-checking. Mastering these concepts ensures accurate, meaningful scientific communication and calculation reliability."
