  "summary": "Scientific notation (A × 10ⁿ) is the universal language for expressing very large and very small numbers in physics. When multiplying or dividing, add or subtract exponents respectively. For addition and subtraction, convert to the same exponent first. Significant figures communicate the precision of measurements: non-zero digits always count, leading zeros never count, captive zeros always count, and trailing zeros count only with a decimal point. In calculations, multiplication and division use the fewest sig figs from inputs, while addition and subtraction use the fewest decimal places. Understanding these concepts is essential for accurate scientific communication and problem-solving.",
