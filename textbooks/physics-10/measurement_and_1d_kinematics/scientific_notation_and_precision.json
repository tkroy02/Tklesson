Doing math with scientific notation is often easier - multiply/divide the number parts and add/subtract the exponents. For addition/subtraction, make exponents match first. Significant figures help us be honest about how precise our measurements really are. Different measuring tools have different limits, and we shouldn't pretend we measured more precisely than we actually did. When doing calculations, multiplication/division use fewest significant figures, while addition/subtraction use fewest decimal places. Always check if your answers make sense in the real world - this catches most mistakes! These skills help us do science accurately and communicate our results clearly."
