  "summary": "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time, measured in m/s². It is a vector quantity that can be positive (speeding up), negative (slowing down/deceleration), or zero (constant velocity). The equations of motion (v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², v² = u² + 2as, s = ½(u + v)t) describe relationships between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time for constant acceleration. Gravity causes approximately 9.8 m/s² downward acceleration near Earth's surface. Circular motion involves centripetal acceleration toward the center, changing direction but not speed. Understanding acceleration is crucial for analyzing motion in transportation, sports, and natural phenomena. Common mistakes include sign confusion, gravity direction errors, and misapplying equations to non-constant acceleration situations."
