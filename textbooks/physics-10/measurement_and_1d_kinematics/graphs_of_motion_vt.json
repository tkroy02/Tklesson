  "summary": "Velocity-time graphs plot velocity (y-axis) against time (x-axis) and provide two key pieces of information: the slope of the line equals acceleration, and the area under the curve equals displacement. Straight lines indicate uniform (constant) acceleration - positive slope for positive acceleration, negative slope for negative acceleration (deceleration), and horizontal lines for constant velocity (zero acceleration). Curved lines indicate non-uniform acceleration where the rate of velocity change is itself changing. To find acceleration, calculate the slope using rise/run. To find displacement, calculate the area between the curve and the time axis using geometric formulas (rectangles, triangles, trapezoids). Areas above the time axis represent positive displacement (forward motion), while areas below represent negative displacement (backward motion). The net displacement is the algebraic sum of all areas, while total distance is the sum of absolute values. V-t graphs are distinct from d-t graphs: on v-t graphs, slope = acceleration and area = displacement, whereas on d-t graphs, slope = velocity and area has no meaning.",
