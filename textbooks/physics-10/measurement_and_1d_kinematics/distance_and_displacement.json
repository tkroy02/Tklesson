  "summary": "Distance and displacement are fundamental concepts in describing motion. Distance is a scalar quantity representing the total path length traveled, always positive or zero, and calculated by simple arithmetic addition of all segments. Displacement is a vector quantity representing the change in position from start to finish, requiring both magnitude and direction, and calculated by vector addition of movement segments. Key relationships include: distance ≥ |displacement|, with equality only for straight-line motion without direction changes. Closed paths (returning to start) yield zero displacement but positive distance. Both use the same length units (meters, kilometers), but displacement requires direction specification. Understanding when to use each quantity is crucial: distance for route planning, fuel calculation, and exercise tracking; displacement for navigation, positioning, and physics calculations involving velocity and acceleration."
