  "summary": "Scalars and vectors represent two fundamental classes of physical quantities. Scalars have magnitude only and follow ordinary arithmetic rules (mass, time, distance). Vectors have both magnitude and direction and require special addition methods (displacement, velocity, force). Parallel vectors add numerically; anti-parallel vectors subtract numerically; perpendicular vectors add using the Pythagorean theorem (R = √(A² + B²)) with direction given by θ = tan⁻¹(opposite/adjacent). Common mistakes include treating vectors as scalars, direction confusion, and misapplying the Pythagorean theorem. Recognizing whether a quantity is scalar or vector determines the correct mathematical approach for combining quantities in physics problems."
