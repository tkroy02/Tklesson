  "summary": "Displacement-time graphs provide visual representations of motion where displacement is plotted against time. The slope (gradient) of the graph at any point equals the instantaneous velocity at that moment. Straight lines indicate uniform (constant) velocity, with positive slopes for forward motion and negative slopes for backward motion. Curved lines indicate non-uniform velocity (acceleration), with increasing slope showing positive acceleration and decreasing slope showing negative acceleration. Horizontal segments represent stationary periods, while peaks and valleys indicate direction changes. Average velocity over an interval equals the slope of the chord connecting the start and end points. Graphical analysis allows extraction of detailed motion information including when objects are stationary, maximum velocities, direction changes, and acceleration patterns. Understanding these graphs develops intuition about motion and complements algebraic problem-solving methods."
