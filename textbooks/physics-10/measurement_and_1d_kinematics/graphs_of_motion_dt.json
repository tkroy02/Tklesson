  "summary": "Displacement-time graphs provide visual representations of motion where displacement is plotted against time. The slope (gradient) of the graph at any point equals the instantaneous velocity at that moment. Straight lines indicate uniform (constant) velocity: positive slopes for forward motion, negative slopes for backward motion, and horizontal (zero slope) for stationary objects. Curved lines indicate non-uniform velocity (acceleration): increasing slope shows positive acceleration (speeding up) and decreasing slope shows negative acceleration (slowing down). Average velocity over an interval equals the slope of the chord connecting the start and end points of that interval. Horizontal segments represent stationary periods where velocity is zero. Peaks and valleys indicate direction changes where velocity instantaneously becomes zero before reversing. Understanding these graphs develops intuition about motion and complements algebraic problem-solving methods. Always remember: on d-t graphs, slope = velocity (not acceleration), and the height of the graph shows position (not speed).",
