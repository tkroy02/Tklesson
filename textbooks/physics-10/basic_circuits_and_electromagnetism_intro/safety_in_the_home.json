However, higher voltage can drive more current through the body: $I = \\frac{V}{R}$",
        "context": "The let-go current (6-30 mA) is particularly dangerous because victims cannot release the conductor. Body resistance varies from ~100,000Ω (dry skin) to ~1,000Ω (wet skin)."

  "summary": "Electrical safety requires understanding that current, not voltage, causes injury, with effects ranging from tingling (1-5 mA) to fatal ventricular fibrillation (>100 mA). Key protective devices include circuit breakers (overcurrent protection), GFCIs (shock protection, trips at ~5 mA), and AFCIs (fire protection). Safe work practices involve de-energizing circuits before work, using the one-hand rule, proper tools, and PPE. Common household hazards include overloaded circuits, damaged cords, and water proximity. Emergency response for electrical shocks requires not touching the victim, shutting off power, and using non-conductive materials for rescue. Dangerous misconceptions include believing low voltage is always safe (current matters most), that GFCIs provide complete protection (they only protect against ground faults), and that removing ground prongs is acceptable (it eliminates critical safety protection). Electrical safety depends on multiple layers of protection and informed, cautious behavior."
