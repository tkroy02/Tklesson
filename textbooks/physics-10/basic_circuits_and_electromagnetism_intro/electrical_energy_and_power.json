  "summary": "Electrical power (P) is the rate of energy conversion, calculated as $P = V \\times I$, $P = I^2 \\times R$, or $P = V^2 / R$, and measured in Watts. Electrical energy (E) is the total energy converted over time, calculated as $E = P \\times t$, with practical measurements in kilowatt-hours (1 kWh = 3,600,000 J) for utility billing. Devices have power ratings that indicate their maximum safe operating limits and energy efficiency. Most electrical energy ultimately converts to heat, with varying percentages converted to useful work like light, motion, or sound. Common misconceptions include confusing power and energy (power is rate, energy is total), believing 100% efficiency is possible (all real conversions have losses), and assuming higher wattage devices always use more energy (energy depends on both power and time). Understanding these concepts enables calculating energy costs and selecting appropriate components for electrical systems."
