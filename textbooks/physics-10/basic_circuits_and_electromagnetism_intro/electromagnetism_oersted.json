  "summary": "Oersted's discovery revealed that electric current creates magnetic fields, fundamentally connecting electricity and magnetism. The magnetic field around a current-carrying conductor forms concentric circles, with direction determined by the right-hand rule (thumb points with conventional current, fingers curl with field direction). Solenoids (coils) produce much stronger and more uniform magnetic fields than straight wires, with field strength proportional to both current and number of turns. Adding a ferromagnetic core can increase field strength by hundreds or thousands of times. Common misconceptions include thinking magnetic fields exist around all wires (only current-carrying wires), confusing hand rules for different current conventions (always use right hand for conventional current), and believing AC and DC create fundamentally different fields (they create the same field type, just with different time behaviors). This principle enables electromagnets, motors, generators, and many essential technologies."
