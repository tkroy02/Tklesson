  "summary": "Circuit calculations involve systematic approaches to solve for unknown voltages, currents, and resistances in complex circuits. The four-step method (simplify, solve, expand, verify) uses series and parallel simplification to reduce complex circuits to equivalent simpler circuits. Kirchhoff's Laws provide fundamental tools: KCL states that the sum of currents at any junction is zero, and KVL states that the sum of voltages around any closed loop is zero. Power calculations serve both practical purposes (determining energy consumption and heat dissipation) and verification of results. Special configurations like loaded voltage dividers require careful analysis as loading affects circuit behavior. Common errors include misidentifying series/parallel relationships, making sign errors in KVL equations, and using incorrect power formulas. Systematic approaches with careful verification ensure accurate circuit analysis."
