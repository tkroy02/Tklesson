  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a parallel circuit, all components are connected between the same two points, so the same voltage appears across every component. The total current is the sum of the branch currents, and the total resistance is less than the smallest individual resistance.",
    "explanation": "Parallel circuits follow specific rules: voltage remains constant across all branches, currents add up to the total current, and conductances (inverse of resistance) sum together. This creates independent paths where one branch failing doesn't affect the others."

  "summary": "Parallel circuits have all components connected between the same two points, causing the same voltage to appear across every component. The total current equals the sum of branch currents ($I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + \\cdots$), and the total resistance is calculated using the reciprocal formula ($\\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\cdots$). Current divides inversely with resistance, with smaller resistors receiving larger current shares. Parallel circuits are preferred for most practical applications because they allow independent operation of components - one failed branch doesn't affect others. Common misconceptions include thinking voltage divides in parallel circuits (voltage is the same across all branches), that adding resistors in parallel increases total resistance (it always decreases total resistance), and that current is the same in all parallel branches (current divides according to branch resistance)."
