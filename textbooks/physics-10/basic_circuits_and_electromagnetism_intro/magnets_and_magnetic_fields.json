  "expanded_description": "This section explores the fundamental properties of permanent magnets and magnetic fields. Students will learn about magnetic poles, field lines, magnetic materials, and the forces between magnetic objects.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Magnets are objects that produce magnetic fields, which exert forces on other magnetic materials and moving charges. Every magnet has two poles (north and south) where the magnetic field is strongest, and like poles repel while unlike poles attract.",
    "explanation": "Magnetic fields are created by the motion of electric charges at the atomic level. In permanent magnets, the magnetic domains are aligned, creating a persistent magnetic field. Magnetic field lines emerge from the north pole and enter at the south pole, forming continuous loops."

  "summary": "Magnets have two poles (north and south) that always occur together, with like poles repelling and unlike poles attracting. Magnetic fields are represented by field lines that emerge from the north pole and enter at the south pole, with closer lines indicating stronger fields. Materials are classified as ferromagnetic (strongly attracted, can be permanent magnets), paramagnetic (weakly attracted), or diamagnetic (weakly repelled). Magnetic domains are regions within ferromagnetic materials where atomic magnetic moments are aligned; magnetization involves aligning these domains. Earth has a magnetic field that enables compass navigation but has magnetic poles offset from geographic poles. Common misconceptions include thinking magnetic monopoles exist (they don't - poles always come in pairs), that all metals are magnetic (only ferromagnetic metals are strongly magnetic), and that magnetic field lines are physical entities (they are visualization tools). Understanding magnetic principles explains everyday phenomena from refrigerator magnets to compass navigation."
