  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a series circuit, all components are connected in a single path so the same current flows through every component. The total resistance is the sum of individual resistances, and the total voltage is divided among the components.",
    "explanation": "Series circuits follow specific rules: current remains constant throughout, voltages add up to the source voltage, and resistances sum together. This creates a 'chain' where breaking one connection stops all current flow."

  "summary": "Series circuits have all components connected in a single path, causing the same current to flow through every component. The total resistance is the sum of individual resistances ($R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + \\cdots$), and the total voltage equals the sum of individual voltage drops ($V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 + \\cdots$). Voltage divides proportionally to resistance, with larger resistors receiving larger voltage drops. Series circuits are simple but have the major disadvantage that one failed component (open circuit) stops all current flow. Common misconceptions include thinking current gets used up in components (charge is conserved, current remains constant), that voltage is the same throughout the circuit (voltage drops across each component), and that adding resistors in series reduces total resistance (resistance always increases in series)."
