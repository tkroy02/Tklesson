  "summary": "Electromagnets are temporary magnets created by passing electric current through a coil of wire wrapped around a ferromagnetic core. Their magnetic field exists only while current flows and can be precisely controlled. Key factors affecting strength include the current ($B \\propto I$), number of turns ($B \\propto N$), and core material (ferromagnetic cores can amplify fields 100-1000×). Electromagnets offer significant advantages over permanent magnets: controllable strength, on/off capability, pole reversal, and immunity to demagnetization. Applications range from industrial cranes and MRI machines to speakers and electric motors. Common misconceptions include thinking electromagnets become permanent (they use soft magnetic materials that demagnetize quickly), that any core material works (only ferromagnetic materials provide significant enhancement), and that voltage directly controls strength (current is the fundamental variable, with $I = V/R$). Electromagnets enable technologies that require dynamic magnetic control impossible with permanent magnets."
