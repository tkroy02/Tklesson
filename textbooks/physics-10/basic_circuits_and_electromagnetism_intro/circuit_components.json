  "summary": "Circuit components are the fundamental building blocks of electrical systems. Power sources like batteries and power supplies provide energy. Control components like resistors and switches manage current flow. Output devices like LEDs, motors, and buzzers convert electrical energy into light, motion, and sound. Protection devices like fuses and circuit breakers ensure safety by preventing overcurrent damage. Measurement tools like voltmeters and ammeters allow circuit testing and troubleshooting. Each component has a standardized schematic symbol for circuit diagrams. Common misconceptions include thinking batteries supply constant current (they supply constant voltage), that LEDs work in both directions (they're polarized), and that switches can gradually control voltage (they're binary on/off devices). Understanding component functions and symbols is essential for both analyzing and designing electrical circuits."
