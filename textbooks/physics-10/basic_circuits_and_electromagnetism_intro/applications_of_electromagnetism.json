  "summary": "Electromagnetic applications enable conversion between electrical energy and other forms. Electric motors convert electrical to mechanical energy using the motor effect - current-carrying conductors experience force in magnetic fields. Key components include stator (fixed magnets), rotor (rotating electromagnet), and commutator (current reversal device). Electric generators operate on electromagnetic induction - conductors moving in magnetic fields have induced voltages, converting mechanical to electrical energy. Loudspeakers convert electrical audio signals to sound using a voice coil in a permanent magnet's field, creating mechanical vibrations that produce sound waves. These devices are often reversible - the same machine can operate as motor or generator. Common misconceptions include thinking motors and generators are fundamentally different (they're often the same device operating in reverse), that generators create energy (they convert mechanical to electrical energy), and that speakers use electromagnets for their main field (they use permanent magnets with only the voice coil being electromagnetic). Understanding these applications demonstrates the practical importance of electromagnetic principles in modern technology."
