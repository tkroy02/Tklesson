  "summary": "Friction is the force that opposes relative motion between surfaces, described by $f = \\mu N$ where $\\mu$ is the coefficient of friction and $N$ is the normal force. Key factors affecting friction include the materials in contact, surface roughness, and normal force, but friction is generally independent of contact area. The advantages of friction are numerous and essential: it enables walking, vehicle control, braking, fastening, and structural stability. However, friction also has significant disadvantages including energy waste, material wear, heat generation, and reduced efficiency in mechanical systems. Effective friction management involves increasing friction where needed for safety and control (through surface texturing, material selection, and contaminant removal) while decreasing friction where it causes problems (through lubrication, smoothing, and rolling elements). Understanding and controlling friction is crucial for transportation safety, mechanical efficiency, and countless everyday applications."
