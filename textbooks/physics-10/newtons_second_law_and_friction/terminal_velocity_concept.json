  "summary": "Terminal velocity is the constant maximum speed reached by falling objects when air resistance force upward equals gravitational force downward, resulting in zero net force and zero acceleration. This occurs because air resistance increases with the square of velocity ($F_{air} \\propto v^2$), eventually balancing the constant weight ($mg$). The terminal velocity formula $v_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{C \\rho A}}$ shows that heavier, more compact objects (high mass-to-area ratio) fall faster, while light, spread-out objects fall slower. Objects approach terminal velocity asymptotically, with characteristic time $\\tau = v_t/g$, typically reaching 95% of terminal velocity within 3-4 time constants. Real-world terminal velocities vary dramatically: dust particles (~0.01 m/s), raindrops (2-9 m/s), human skydivers (200-320 km/h), and meteoroids (km/s). Understanding terminal velocity has crucial applications in parachute design, falling injury analysis, particle separation, and biological adaptations for dispersal and survival."
