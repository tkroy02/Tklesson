  "summary": "Newton's Second Law ($F_{net} = ma$) establishes the fundamental relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. The law states that acceleration is directly proportional to net force (when mass is constant) and inversely proportional to mass (when force is constant). This vector relationship means acceleration always occurs in the direction of the net force. Problem-solving involves identifying all forces, calculating the net force, and applying the appropriate form of the equation. While extremely effective for everyday situations, Newton's Second Law has limitations at relativistic speeds, quantum scales, and in non-inertial reference frames. Mastering this law enables prediction and analysis of motion across countless real-world applications from vehicle dynamics to sports performance."
