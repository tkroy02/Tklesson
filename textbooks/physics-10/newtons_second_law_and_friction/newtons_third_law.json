  "summary": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. These force pairs always act on different objects simultaneously and have exactly the same magnitude but opposite directions. Common examples include walking (foot pushes ground back, ground pushes foot forward), sitting (body pushes chair down, chair pushes body up), and rocket propulsion (rocket pushes exhaust down, exhaust pushes rocket up). Despite equal forces, objects accelerate differently due to their different masses ($a = F/m$). Third Law misconceptions often involve confusing action-reaction pairs with balanced forces on the same object. The law has applications across engineering (propulsion systems, structures), biology (animal locomotion), and fundamental physics (all interactions obey Third Law, leading to momentum conservation). Understanding that forces always occur in pairs between interacting objects is crucial for analyzing motion and designing mechanical systems."
