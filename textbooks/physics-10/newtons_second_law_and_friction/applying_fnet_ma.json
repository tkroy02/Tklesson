  "summary": "Applying $F_{net} = ma$ to systems of multiple masses involves recognizing that connected objects accelerate together with a common acceleration determined by $a = \\frac{F_{net\\,external}}{m_{total}}$. The systematic problem-solving approach begins with whole-system analysis to find this common acceleration, then proceeds to individual component analysis to determine internal forces like tensions and normal forces. Vertically stacked masses exhibit varying normal forces between layers, while horizontally connected masses show tension variations along chains. Complex systems can be analyzed through subsystem decomposition and constraint equations. These principles have practical applications in transportation safety, elevator design, and engineering systems where predicting forces and accelerations in multi-mass arrangements is essential for both functionality and safety."
