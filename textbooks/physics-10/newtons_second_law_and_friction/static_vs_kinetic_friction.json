  "summary": "The three main types of friction exhibit distinct characteristics and applications. Static friction ($f_s \\leq \\mu_s N$) prevents motion from starting and matches applied forces up to its maximum value. Kinetic friction ($f_k = \\mu_k N$) opposes sliding motion with constant magnitude once movement begins, typically being 20-40% weaker than maximum static friction. Rolling friction ($f_r = \\mu_r N$) resists wheel-like motion and is dramatically smaller than sliding friction (10-100× less), explaining the efficiency of wheels. The hierarchy $\\mu_s > \\mu_k >> \\mu_r$ means starting motion requires the most force, sliding requires less, and rolling requires the least. Understanding these differences enables optimal design choices: utilizing static friction for stability and traction, managing kinetic friction for controlled stopping, and minimizing rolling friction for efficient transportation. Real-world applications range from vehicle dynamics and brake design to sports performance and industrial processes, all relying on proper management of these fundamental friction types."
