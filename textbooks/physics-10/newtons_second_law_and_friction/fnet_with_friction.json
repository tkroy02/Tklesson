  "summary": "Calculating net force with friction involves $F_{net} = \\Sigma F_{applied} - f_{friction}$, where friction always opposes motion or attempted motion. The resulting acceleration $a = F_{net}/m$ is always less than it would be without friction. On horizontal surfaces, $F_{net} = F_{applied} - \\mu mg$, while on inclines, components must be resolved and $F_{net} = mg\\sin\\theta - \\mu mg\\cos\\theta$ for motion down the incline. Static friction presents special cases where $f_s$ matches applied forces up to $\\mu_s N$ at impending motion. Complex systems with multiple objects require analyzing the whole system to find common acceleration, then individual components to determine internal forces. A systematic problem-solving approach—using free-body diagrams, identifying friction type, calculating normal forces, determining net force, and finding acceleration—ensures accurate solutions across all friction scenarios."
