  "summary": "Ohm's Law states the fundamental relationship $V = I \\times R$ between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits. It can be rearranged as $I = V/R$ to find current or $R = V/I$ to find resistance. This law applies specifically to ohmic materials, which maintain constant resistance regardless of voltage or current. Non-ohmic materials like diodes, transistors, and light bulbs do not obey Ohm's Law because their resistance changes with operating conditions. Ohm's Law is essential for circuit analysis, current limiting calculations, and determining power dissipation using derived formulas like $P = I^2R$ and $P = V^2/R$. Common misconceptions include thinking Ohm's Law applies to all electrical devices (it doesn't), confusing the causal relationship between variables (it's a relationship, not necessarily causation), and misapplying it to superconductors (where R=0 allows current without voltage)."
