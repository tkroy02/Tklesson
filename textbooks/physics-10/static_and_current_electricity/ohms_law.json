This causes high inrush current when first turned on - for a bulb with $15\\Omega$ cold resistance, initial current is $\\frac{120V}{15\\Omega}=8A$, dropping to $1A$ when hot. This non-ohmic behavior must be considered in circuit protection design. The resistance follows approximately $R(T) = R_0[1 + \\alpha(T-T_0)]$ with $\\alpha \\approx 0.0045/°C$ for tungsten."

For precision circuits, this requires temperature compensation or use of low-TCR materials. Example: A $100\\Omega$ copper wire at $20°C$ has resistance $100\\Omega$. At $70°C$ ($50°C$ rise), resistance increases to $100\\Omega \\times (1 + 0.004 \\times 50) = 120\\Omega$. This $20\\%$ change significantly affects circuit operation. Precision resistors use alloys like manganin ($\\alpha \\approx 0.00001/°C$) or constantan ($\\alpha \\approx 0.00002/°C$) for stability."

For copper at $60Hz$, skin depth is about $8.5mm$, but at $1MHz$, it's only $0.066mm$. A $2mm$ diameter wire has negligible skin effect at $60Hz$ but significant effect at $1MHz$. Proximity effect from nearby conductors further increases AC resistance. These effects make AC resistance higher than DC resistance, requiring derating in high-frequency applications. Ohm's Law still applies but with frequency-dependent resistance."

A typical copper-to-copper connection might add $0.0001$-$0.001\\Omega$. While small, this can be significant in high-current or precision circuits. Example: A $100A$ circuit with $0.001\\Omega$ contact resistance dissipates $P = I^2R = (100A)^2 \\times 0.001\\Omega = 10W$ at each connection, causing heating and potential failure. Gold plating reduces oxidation, higher contact pressure improves connection, but these resistances are often unpredictable and non-ohmic."

Voltmeters have finite input resistance (typically $1$-$10M\\Omega$) that can load high-impedance circuits. Ammeters have small but significant internal resistance ($0.01$-$1\\Omega$) that affects low-voltage circuits. Four-wire (Kelvin) measurement eliminates lead resistance errors for precision low-resistance measurement. Example: Measuring $0.1\\Omega$ with $0.01\\Omega$ lead resistance gives $10\\%$ error with two-wire measurement but negligible error with four-wire technique. Understanding these limitations ensures accurate Ohm's Law applications."

  "summary": "Ohm's Law ($V = I \\times R$) establishes the fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits, providing the foundation for DC circuit analysis. This linear relationship holds for ohmic materials where resistance remains constant, enabling prediction of any one variable when the other two are known. Ohm's Law combines with Kirchhoff's Laws to solve complex circuits through systematic application to individual components while satisfying conservation principles. Practical applications include circuit design, component selection, power calculation, and troubleshooting. However, many real-world components exhibit non-ohmic behavior where resistance changes with voltage, current, temperature, or frequency, requiring recognition of Ohm's Law limitations. Despite these constraints, Ohm's Law remains the cornerstone of electrical engineering, enabling both simple calculations and sophisticated circuit analysis when applied with understanding of its assumptions and boundaries."
