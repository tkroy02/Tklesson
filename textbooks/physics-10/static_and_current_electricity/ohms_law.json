A silicon diode has nearly infinite resistance below 0.6V forward bias, then resistance drops dramatically above this threshold. Transistors have complex, non-linear relationships between terminal voltages and currents. LEDs have specific forward voltage drops (1.8-3.3V depending on color) with steep current increase above this voltage. Zener diodes maintain nearly constant voltage over a wide current range in reverse breakdown. These devices require specialized analysis beyond simple Ohm's Law."

A 100W, 120V incandescent bulb has hot resistance of 144Ω (from P=V²/R), but cold resistance may be only 10-20Ω. This causes high inrush current when first turned on - for a bulb with 15Ω cold resistance, initial current is 120V/15Ω=8A, dropping to 1A when hot. This non-ohmic behavior must be considered in circuit protection design. The resistance follows approximately R(T) = R₀[1 + α(T-T₀)] with α ≈ 0.0045/°C for tungsten."

A typical NTC thermistor might change from 10Ω at 100°C to 10kΩ at 0°C. PTC thermistors increase resistance sharply above a critical temperature, used for overcurrent protection. Varistors (MOVs) have high resistance below breakdown voltage but conduct heavily above it, used for surge protection. These components have highly non-linear V-I characteristics that provide specific protective functions but cannot be analyzed with simple Ohm's Law."

Fluorescent lamps exhibit negative resistance characteristics once ionized, requiring ballast resistors to stabilize operation. Arc welders maintain approximately constant voltage despite large current variations. These devices rely on plasma conduction mechanisms completely different from metallic conduction, resulting in complex V-I relationships that require specialized analysis methods beyond Ohm's Law."

For precision circuits, this requires temperature compensation or use of low-TCR materials. Example: A 100Ω copper wire at 20°C has resistance 100Ω. At 70°C (50°C rise), resistance increases to 100Ω × (1 + 0.004 × 50) = 120Ω. This 20% change significantly affects circuit operation. Precision resistors use alloys like manganin (α ≈ 0.00001/°C) or constantan (α ≈ 0.00002/°C) for stability."

              "explanation": "At high frequencies, skin effect causes current to concentrate near conductor surfaces, increasing effective resistance. For copper at 60Hz, skin depth is about 8.5mm, but at 1MHz, it's only 0.066mm. A 2mm diameter wire has negligible skin effect at 60Hz but significant effect at 1MHz. Proximity effect from nearby conductors further increases AC resistance. These effects make AC resistance higher than DC resistance, requiring derating in high-frequency applications. Ohm's Law still applies but with frequency-dependent resistance."

A typical copper-to-copper connection might add 0.0001-0.001Ω. While small, this can be significant in high-current or precision circuits. Example: A 100A circuit with 0.001Ω contact resistance dissipates P = I²R = (100A)² × 0.001Ω = 10W at each connection, causing heating and potential failure. Gold plating reduces oxidation, higher contact pressure improves connection, but these resistances are often unpredictable and non-ohmic."

Voltmeters have finite input resistance (typically 1-10MΩ) that can load high-impedance circuits. Ammeters have small but significant internal resistance (0.01-1Ω) that affects low-voltage circuits. Four-wire (Kelvin) measurement eliminates lead resistance errors for precision low-resistance measurement. Example: Measuring 0.1Ω with 0.01Ω lead resistance gives 10% error with two-wire measurement but negligible error with four-wire technique. Understanding these limitations ensures accurate Ohm's Law applications."

  "summary": "Ohm's Law (V = I × R) establishes the fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits, providing the foundation for DC circuit analysis. This linear relationship holds for ohmic materials where resistance remains constant, enabling prediction of any one variable when the other two are known. Ohm's Law combines with Kirchhoff's Laws to solve complex circuits through systematic application to individual components while satisfying conservation principles. Practical applications include circuit design, component selection, power calculation, and troubleshooting. However, many real-world components exhibit non-ohmic behavior where resistance changes with voltage, current, temperature, or frequency, requiring recognition of Ohm's Law limitations. Despite these constraints, Ohm's Law remains the cornerstone of electrical engineering, enabling both simple calculations and sophisticated circuit analysis when applied with understanding of its assumptions and boundaries."
