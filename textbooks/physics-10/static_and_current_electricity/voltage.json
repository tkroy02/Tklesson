  "expanded_description": "This section introduces voltage as the 'electrical push' that causes charges to move and current to flow. Students will learn that voltage is a measure of the energy difference per charge between two points, which is the fundamental driver of electric current.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Voltage, or electric potential difference, is the work done per unit charge to move a charge between two points in an electric field. It is the energy difference that causes electric charge to flow in a circuit.",
    "explanation": "A voltage source, like a battery, creates a potential difference across its terminals by doing work to separate positive and negative charges. This establishes an electric field, and when a conducting path is provided, charges flow from high potential to low potential, releasing energy."

        "definition": "**Visualizing Voltage as Water Pressure:**\n\n- **Voltage (V)** is analogous to **Water Pressure**.\n- A high water pressure (like at the bottom of a full tank or from a powerful pump) can push water strongly through a pipe, driving a water wheel with great force.\n- Similarly, a high voltage (like from a powerful battery) can push electric charge strongly through a wire, causing a bright light in a bulb or a strong rotation in a motor.\n- **No pressure difference, no flow.** No voltage, no current.\n\n**Absolute vs. Relative:** It's the *difference* in water height (or pressure) between two points that matters, not the absolute height. Similarly, it's the *potential difference* that drives current.",

However, from Ohm's Law ($I = V/R$), for a given body resistance (R), a **higher voltage (V) will cause a higher current (I)**. Static electricity has very high voltage (1000s of V) but very low stored charge, so it can't sustain a dangerous current.

  "summary": "Voltage, or electric potential difference, is the energy per unit charge ($V = E/q$) measured in Volts ($1 \\text{V} = 1 \\text{J/C}$). It is the 'electrical pressure' that causes charges to move and current to flow. A voltage source, like a battery, creates and maintains this potential difference by doing work to separate charges. Voltage is always measured between two points. In the water analogy, voltage corresponds to water pressure. Voltage is measured with a voltmeter connected in parallel across a component. Common misconceptions include thinking that voltage flows (it doesn't; current does), confusing the dangers of high voltage versus high current (current through the body is the danger, but it depends on voltage and resistance), and not realizing that voltage is 'dropped' or decreases across components in a circuit as electrical energy is transformed into other forms."
