Used in medicine (diagnostic imaging, cancer treatment), archaeology (carbon dating), and industry (tracers, thickness gauges)."

  "summary": "All matter is composed of atoms, which contain three fundamental subatomic particles: protons (positive charge) and neutrons (neutral) in the dense central nucleus, and electrons (negative charge) in orbitals surrounding the nucleus. The number of protons defines the atomic number and elemental identity, while the sum of protons and neutrons gives the mass number. Variations in neutron number create isotopes of the same element, while gain or loss of electrons creates ions with positive (cations) or negative (anions) charge. The periodic table organizes elements by atomic number and reveals periodic patterns in chemical properties based on electron configurations. This atomic structure understanding explains chemical bonding, material properties, and enables applications ranging from medical imaging using radioisotopes to technological devices relying on controlled electron flow. The incredible diversity of matter emerges from different combinations and arrangements of just these three fundamental particles governed by quantum mechanical principles."
