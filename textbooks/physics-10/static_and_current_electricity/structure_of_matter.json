  "summary": "All matter is composed of atoms containing protons (positive) and neutrons (neutral) in a tiny nucleus, surrounded by electrons (negative) in orbital shells. The number of protons determines the element, while the number and arrangement of electrons determine electrical properties. Valence electrons in the outermost shell are crucial for electrical conduction - conductors have 1-3 loosely bound valence electrons, while insulators have 5-8 tightly bound valence electrons. Ions form when atoms gain or lose electrons, creating net positive (cations) or negative (anions) charges. Common misconceptions include the planetary model of electron orbits, thinking atoms are solid spheres, and overestimating protons' role in electrical phenomena. Understanding atomic structure is fundamental to explaining all electrical behavior."
