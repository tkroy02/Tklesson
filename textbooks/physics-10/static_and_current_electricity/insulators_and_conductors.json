  "summary": "Materials are fundamentally classified as conductors or insulators based on their atomic structure and how electrons behave within them. Conductors, typically metals, have high electron mobility due to metallic bonding that creates a 'sea' of delocalized electrons capable of moving freely throughout the material. Insulators, including plastics, ceramics, and glass, have low electron mobility because electrons are either tightly bound to individual atoms or localized in specific chemical bonds. This fundamental difference in electron behavior creates vastly different electrical properties: conductors allow easy charge flow with low resistance, while insulators strongly resist charge movement with high resistance. These complementary properties enable all electrical technologies, with conductors providing pathways for desired current flow and insulators preventing leakage, short circuits, and safety hazards. Understanding this atomic-level foundation explains why specific materials are chosen for different electrical applications and how we can control electricity in modern technology."
