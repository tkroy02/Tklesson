  "summary": "Conductors allow easy charge movement due to loosely bound valence electrons that form a 'sea of electrons,' while insulators resist charge movement because electrons are tightly bound to atoms. This difference stems from atomic structure and band gaps in materials. Common conductors include metals like copper and aluminum, while common insulators include rubber, glass, and plastics. Both are essential in electrical systems - conductors carry current where needed, while insulators provide safety and prevent short circuits. Material conductivity can change with temperature, moisture, and impurities. Common misconceptions include thinking all conductors are equivalent, that the human body is a good insulator, and that air always prevents electrical flow. Understanding these material properties is fundamental to electrical engineering and safety."
