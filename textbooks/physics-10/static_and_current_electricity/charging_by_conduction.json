  "summary": "Charging by conduction occurs when a charged object makes direct physical contact with a neutral or differently charged object, transferring charge between them until they reach the same electric potential. This process requires at least one conductor to allow charge movement and results in both objects acquiring the same type of charge (both positive or both negative). The final charge distribution follows mathematical relationships based on charge conservation and capacitance ratios, allowing precise prediction of outcomes. Conduction charging is characterized by its rapid charge transfer, requirement for physical contact, and production of objects with identical charge types. Compared to friction and induction charging, conduction provides more predictable and controllable results, making it valuable for laboratory research, educational demonstrations, and practical applications like capacitor charging and static control systems. Understanding conduction charging completes the foundation of electrostatic charging methods, revealing how direct contact enables controlled charge sharing between objects."
