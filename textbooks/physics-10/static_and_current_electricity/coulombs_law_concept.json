  "topic": "9.6 Coulomb's Law Concept (Electric Force Relationship)",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Coulomb's Law, the fundamental principle that quantifies the electrostatic force between two charged particles. Students will learn how this force depends on the amount of charge and the distance between them, drawing parallels to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Coulomb's Law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force acts along the line joining the two charges.",
    "explanation": "This is an inverse-square law, meaning the force weakens rapidly as the distance increases. Like charges repel each other, resulting in a positive, repulsive force. Unlike charges attract each other, resulting in a negative, attractive force in vector terms."

The force's magnitude is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (\\( F = k |q_1 q_2| / r^2 \\)). The force is repulsive for like charges and attractive for unlike charges. It is an inverse-square law, meaning the force decreases rapidly with distance (e.g., doubling the distance makes the force 1/4 as strong). Coulomb's Law is mathematically similar to Newton's Law of Gravitation but is vastly stronger and can be either attractive or repulsive. Common errors include misusing charge signs in the magnitude calculation, misunderstanding the large size of Coulomb's constant, and misapplying the law to non-point charges."
