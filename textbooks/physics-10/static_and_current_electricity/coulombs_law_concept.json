  "summary": "Coulomb's Law provides the fundamental quantitative relationship for electric forces between charged objects, establishing that force magnitude is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. For systems with multiple charges, the principle of superposition allows calculating net forces through vector addition of all pairwise interactions, enabling analysis of complex configurations like three-charge systems where q₁ experiences forces from both q₂ and q₃. This inverse-square relationship, mathematically expressed as F = k|q₁q₂|/r² with k = 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C², reveals electric forces to be enormously stronger than gravitational forces but with the crucial difference that they can be either attractive or repulsive depending on charge signs. The law has been experimentally verified across an immense range of scales and finds applications throughout physics, chemistry, engineering, and technology. While sharing mathematical similarities with Newton's Law of Gravitation, Coulomb's Law governs the electrostatic interactions that determine atomic structure, chemical bonding, and most modern technological devices. Its predictive power and experimental confirmation make it one of the most reliable and widely applied relationships in all of science."
