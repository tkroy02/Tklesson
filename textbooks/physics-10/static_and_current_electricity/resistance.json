Silver has the lowest resistivity (1.59 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m), followed by copper (1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m), making them excellent conductors. Aluminum (2.82 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m) is lighter and cheaper, used for power lines. Iron (1.0 × 10⁻⁷ Ω·m) has higher resistivity. Insulators like glass (10¹² Ω·m) have extremely high resistivity. Semiconductors like silicon (varies with doping) have intermediate values. Resistivity depends on charge carrier density and mobility - materials with many free electrons (metals) have low resistivity, while insulators have bound electrons."

Doubling the wire length doubles the resistance, as there are twice as many atomic collisions. This explains why extension cords have measurable resistance that increases with length, causing voltage drop. In integrated circuits, long conductive traces can have significant resistance affecting signal timing. Power transmission lines must consider length when calculating efficiency losses. The linear relationship makes resistance calculations straightforward for uniform conductors."

              "explanation": "Resistance decreases with increasing cross-sectional area because larger areas provide more parallel paths for current flow. Doubling the area halves the resistance, analogous to adding a second identical pipe parallel to the first for water flow. This principle guides wire sizing in electrical installations - higher current applications require thicker wires to minimize resistance and heating. The American Wire Gauge (AWG) system standardizes wire diameters, with smaller gauge numbers indicating larger diameters and lower resistance. Proper wire sizing prevents excessive voltage drop and overheating."

              "process": "Temperature Effects",
              "explanation": "Most conductors increase resistance with temperature due to increased atomic vibrations that scatter electrons more effectively. Copper resistance increases about 0.4% per °C rise. This effect causes incandescent lamp filaments to have much higher resistance when hot than when cold. Some materials like carbon and electrolytes decrease resistance with temperature. Thermistors exploit temperature dependence for temperature sensing. Precision resistors use special alloys like manganin with minimal temperature coefficient. Understanding temperature effects is crucial for designing stable electronic circuits and calculating actual operating resistance."

Wirewound resistors use resistance wire wound on cores for high power (up to 1000W) but have inductance that limits high-frequency use.

Resistance depends on material resistivity (ρ), length (L), and cross-sectional area (A) through the relationship R = ρL/A. Conductors like copper and silver have low resistivity, insulators have very high resistivity, and semiconductors have intermediate values that can be controlled. Resistance increases with temperature for most metals due to increased atomic vibrations. Discrete resistors provide controlled resistance values with specified tolerances and power ratings. Resistance serves essential circuit functions including current limiting, voltage division, timing control, and signal conditioning. The conversion of electrical energy to heat through resistance (Joule heating) enables heating applications but requires careful thermal management in electronic systems. Understanding resistance principles is fundamental to designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting electrical and electronic circuits."
