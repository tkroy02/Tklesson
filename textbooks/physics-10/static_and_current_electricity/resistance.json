  "expanded_description": "This section introduces resistance as the property that opposes the flow of electric current. Students will learn how material properties, dimensions, and temperature affect resistance, and how this concept explains why different circuit components behave differently.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Resistance is a measure of how much a material opposes the flow of electric current. It is the ratio of the voltage applied across a material to the current that flows through it.",
    "explanation": "When electrons move through a conductor, they collide with atoms and other electrons, converting electrical energy into heat. This opposition to electron flow is what we call resistance. Good conductors have low resistance; good insulators have very high resistance."

  "summary": "Resistance is the opposition to current flow, defined by Ohm's Law as $R = V/I$ and measured in Ohms (Ω). It depends on the material's resistivity (ρ), length (L), and cross-sectional area (A) through the formula $R = ρL/A$. Conductors have low resistivity, insulators have high resistivity, and semiconductors have intermediate values. Resistance generally increases with temperature for metals but decreases for semiconductors. Superconductors have zero resistance below their critical temperature. Common misconceptions include thinking resistance uses up current (it converts energy to heat), that all materials obey Ohm's Law (only ohmic materials do), and confusing perfect conductors with perfect insulators (conductors have near-zero resistance, insulators have near-infinite resistance)."
