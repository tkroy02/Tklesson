  "summary": "Charging by friction, known scientifically as the triboelectric effect, occurs when two different materials rub together and transfer electrons between them. This process follows the fundamental laws of electrostatics: like charges repel, unlike charges attract, and electric charge is conserved. Materials can be arranged in a triboelectric series based on their tendency to gain or lose electrons, allowing prediction of which material becomes positive or negative during friction. Common demonstrations like balloons sticking to walls or hair standing up show these electrostatic principles in action. While often demonstrated as simple classroom experiments, triboelectric charging has important practical applications in photocopiers, air pollution control, and industrial painting, as well as significant safety implications in fuel handling, electronics manufacturing, and explosive environments. Understanding both the beneficial uses and potential hazards of static electricity enables the development of technologies that harness its power while preventing dangerous situations."
