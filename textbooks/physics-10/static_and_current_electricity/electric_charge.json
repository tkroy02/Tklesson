Like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract, following Coulomb's Law which states that the force between charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Charge is quantized in units of 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ coulombs (the elementary charge) and is conserved in isolated systems. Electrostatics, the study of stationary charges, reveals that materials behave differently based on their ability to conduct charge: conductors allow free charge movement, insulators restrict charge movement, and semiconductors have controllable conductivity. These principles explain everyday phenomena like static cling and lightning, while forming the foundation for technologies ranging from photocopiers to modern electronics. Understanding charge interactions and material responses provides the essential foundation for all electrical phenomena and applications."
