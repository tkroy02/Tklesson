  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the fundamental concept of electric charge, the physical property of matter that causes it to experience forces in electromagnetic fields. Students will learn about the two types of charge, conservation of charge, and how charged objects interact.",

    "principle": "Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that comes in two types - positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, while unlike charges attract.",
    "explanation": "Charge is quantized, meaning it comes in discrete packets equal to the charge of one proton or electron. The fundamental unit of charge is e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ coulombs. Charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between objects."

  "summary": "Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter with two types: positive (protons) and negative (electrons). Like charges repel, unlike charges attract. Charge is quantized in units of e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C and conserved in all interactions. Only electrons move during ordinary charging processes; protons remain fixed in atomic nuclei. Conductors allow charge movement leading to surface distribution, while insulators hold charges in place. Common misconceptions include thinking rubbing creates charge, that protons can transfer between objects, and that neutral objects don't interact with charges. Understanding these fundamental concepts provides the foundation for all of electricity and electromagnetism."
