              "process": "Arc Flash Dangers",
              "explanation": "High-current faults can create arc flashes - explosive discharges through air that reach temperatures of 20,000°C, vaporizing metal and creating pressure waves. Arc flashes can cause severe burns, blindness from ultraviolet light, hearing damage from explosions, and injuries from shrapnel. These hazards require special protective equipment and procedures when working on energized high-power equipment."

              "process": "Safety Systems and Protocols",
              "explanation": "Multiple protection layers ensure electrical safety: Insulation prevents contact with live parts. Grounding provides safe current paths during faults. Circuit breakers and fuses interrupt overloads. Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) detect leakage currents as small as 5mA and disconnect power quickly. Safe work practices include de-energizing equipment before working, using lockout/tagout procedures, maintaining safe distances from live parts, and using appropriate personal protective equipment."

  "summary": "Electric current represents the organized flow of electric charge through conductors, quantitatively defined as the rate of charge transfer (I = Q/t) and measured in amperes. Current flow requires a complete circuit path with a driving voltage and encounters resistance that opposes flow, following Ohm's Law (I = V/R). While conventional current direction is defined as positive to negative, actual electron flow in metals occurs in the opposite direction. Current enables virtually all modern technology through heating effects, electromagnetic interactions, and electronic control, but also poses significant hazards including electrical shock, fire risks, and arc flash dangers. Understanding current magnitude, path, and duration is crucial for both technological applications and safety. Proper circuit design, protective devices, and safe work practices manage these risks while harnessing current's tremendous utility in powering civilization's electrical infrastructure and electronic devices."
