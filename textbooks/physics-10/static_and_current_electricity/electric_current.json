  "expanded_description": "This section transitions from electrostatics (stationary charges) to current electricity (moving charges). Students will learn that electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge, establishing the foundational concept for understanding electric circuits.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Electric current is the net rate of flow of electric charge past a point in a circuit. It is defined as the amount of charge passing through a cross-section of a conductor per unit time.",
    "explanation": "For a current to exist, there must be a complete path (circuit) and a source of potential difference (voltage). In conductors, it is the negatively charged electrons that flow, but by convention, current is defined as the direction a positive charge would move."

        "definition": "**The Historical Convention:**\n\n- **Conventional Current:** Defined as the direction in which **positive charges** would flow. It is the standard used in circuit diagrams, schematics, and all electronic symbols.\n  - Direction: From the **positive terminal** of a battery to the **negative terminal**.\n\n- **Electron Flow (Physical Reality):** The direction in which **electrons** actually move in a conductor.\n  - Direction: From the **negative terminal** of a battery to the **positive terminal**.\n\n**Key Point:** The two are opposite in direction. Conventional current is a historical artifact that was established before the discovery of the electron. For most circuit analysis, the convention works perfectly, as the effects of positive charge moving one way are identical to negative charge moving the other.",

  "summary": "Electric current (I) is the rate of flow of electric charge, defined by the equation \\( I = \\Delta Q / \\Delta t \\) and measured in Amperes (A), where 1 A = 1 C/s. Conventional current is defined as the flow of positive charge from the positive to the negative terminal of a source, which is opposite to the actual electron flow in a metal wire. A sustained current requires a closed conducting path (a circuit) and a source of potential difference (voltage). Current can be Direct (DC), flowing in one direction, or Alternating (AC), periodically reversing direction. Common misconceptions include thinking current is 'used up' in a circuit (it is not; charge is conserved), confusing the slow drift velocity of electrons with the fast speed of the electrical signal, and mixing up the concepts of charge (the quantity) and current (the flow rate)."
