  "summary": "Momentum is defined as mass in motion, calculated as $p = m \\times v$, with units of $\\text{kg·m/s}$. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. Momentum changes when velocity changes ($\\Delta p = m \\times \\Delta v$), with larger changes occurring when objects reverse direction. When objects bounce off walls perfectly, their momentum changes by $-2m \\times v$ - twice the change of simply stopping because the direction reverses. Understanding momentum helps explain why heavy or fast-moving objects are difficult to stop, why collisions can be dangerous, and how safety systems work by managing momentum changes. Real-world examples from sports to transportation demonstrate momentum principles in action."
