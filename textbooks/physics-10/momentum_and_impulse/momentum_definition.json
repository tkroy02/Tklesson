    "principle": "Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity. It represents the quantity of motion an object possesses and is a measure of how difficult it is to stop the object.",
    "explanation": "Momentum combines both how much matter is moving (mass) and how fast it's moving (velocity). A heavy object moving slowly can have the same momentum as a light object moving quickly, and both would be equally difficult to stop."

  "summary": "Momentum is defined as $\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$, representing the quantity of motion or 'mass in motion.' It is a vector quantity measured in kg·m/s, with the same direction as velocity. Key characteristics include: combines both mass and velocity; measures how difficult it is to stop a moving object; follows vector addition rules; and differs fundamentally from kinetic energy (momentum is vector, linear in velocity; KE is scalar, quadratic in velocity). For systems of multiple objects, total momentum is the vector sum of individual momenta. Common errors include treating momentum as a scalar, confusing momentum with energy, misinterpreting units, and assuming large mass alone guarantees large momentum. Understanding momentum provides the foundation for analyzing collisions, explosions, and many other physical interactions."
