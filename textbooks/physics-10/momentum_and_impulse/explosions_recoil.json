  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In an explosion or separation event, the internal forces cause parts of a system to fly apart. The total momentum of the system remains zero if it started at rest, meaning the vector sum of the momenta of all fragments must cancel out.",
    "explanation": "An explosion is a perfectly inelastic collision run in reverse. While kinetic energy is clearly not conserved (it increases dramatically due to chemical or stored energy), momentum is always conserved. The fragments gain equal and opposite momenta, causing them to move in different directions."

  "summary": "Explosions and recoil are processes where a single system separates into multiple parts. They are governed by conservation of momentum. If the system starts at rest, the total momentum remains zero, meaning the vector sum of the momenta of all fragments must be zero. This results in fragments flying apart in different directions with momenta that cancel out. Recoil is a specific case where a larger object (e.g., a gun) projects a smaller object (e.g., a bullet) forward, causing the larger object to move backward with equal and opposite momentum. Rocket propulsion is a continuous application of this principle. While kinetic energy is not conserved (it increases due to the release of stored energy), momentum always is. Common misconceptions include thinking larger fragments move faster, ignoring the vector nature of momentum in multi-fragment explosions, misattributing recoil to air pressure, and believing explosions create net momentum."
