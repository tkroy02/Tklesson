A superball dropped from 1 meter can rebound to 80-90 cm height, indicating only 10-20% energy loss per bounce. The high elasticity comes from the material's ability to store impact energy as elastic potential energy and efficiently return it as kinetic energy. Superballs can also exhibit surprising spin reversal and trajectory changes due to their high elasticity combined with friction effects."

Typical results show the velocity exchange within 3-5% error, with discrepancies explainable by rotational energy and sound losses."

For high-quality steel ball collisions, students typically measure 95-98% energy conservation, confirming the near-elastic behavior while quantifying the small inevitable losses."

  "summary": "Elastic collisions are interactions where objects bounce apart while conserving both momentum and kinetic energy. This dual conservation makes elastic collisions uniquely predictable and efficient. The mathematics reveals elegant solutions, particularly for equal-mass collisions where objects exchange velocities perfectly. While perfectly elastic collisions are an idealization for macroscopic objects, many systems like billiard balls, steel bearings, and superballs approximate this behavior closely with coefficients of restitution approaching 1. At microscopic scales, collisions between gas molecules and fundamental particles are truly elastic, forming the basis for kinetic theory and much of modern physics. Experimental verification shows that all collisions conserve momentum, but only elastic collisions (or near-elastic approximations) also conserve kinetic energy. Understanding elastic collisions provides crucial insights into energy transfer efficiency, reversible processes, and the fundamental behavior of matter at both macroscopic and microscopic scales."
