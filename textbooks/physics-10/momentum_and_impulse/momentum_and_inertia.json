  "expanded_description": "This section explores the fundamental relationship between momentum and inertia, showing how momentum extends Newton's First Law concept to moving objects. Students will learn how momentum quantifies an object's tendency to maintain its state of motion.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Momentum is the quantitative measure of an object's inertia in motion. While inertia describes an object's resistance to changes in motion, momentum quantifies how much motion the object currently possesses.",
    "explanation": "Inertia (from Newton's First Law) tells us that objects resist changes to their motion state. Momentum tells us exactly how much 'motion' must be overcome to change that state. A large momentum means strong resistance to stopping or changing direction."

While inertia (from Newton's First Law) describes an object's inherent resistance to changes in motion state, momentum ($\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$) quantifies exactly how much motion must be overcome. Key relationships include: momentum extends the inertia concept to moving objects; larger momentum means greater resistance to stopping or changing direction; different mass-velocity combinations can produce equivalent momenta with different physical consequences; and rotational motion has analogous concepts (moment of inertia and angular momentum). Common misconceptions include confusing inertia with momentum, thinking stationary objects have momentum, underestimating velocity's role in stopping difficulty, and ignoring the vector nature of momentum. Understanding the momentum-inertia relationship provides the foundation for analyzing motion changes, collisions, and many practical engineering applications."
