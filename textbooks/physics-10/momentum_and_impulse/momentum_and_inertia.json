Newton's second law can be expressed as $F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$, showing that force equals the rate of momentum change. The impulse-momentum theorem ($J = \\Delta p = F \\Delta t$) provides a powerful tool for analyzing forces over time. Newton's third law ensures that in any interaction between two objects, the momentum changes are equal and opposite, leading to conservation of total momentum in isolated systems. This connection allows solving complex motion problems by focusing on momentum before and after interactions, often simplifying calculations that would be difficult using forces and accelerations directly. Practical applications include recoil problems, safety design through extended stopping times, and understanding propulsion systems."
