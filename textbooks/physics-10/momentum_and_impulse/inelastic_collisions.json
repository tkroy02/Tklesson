Well-engineered crumple zones can absorb 70-80% of this energy through planned deformation, converting it to heat and sound.

Upon striking a nail, minimal energy rebounds - most transfers to driving the nail into wood. The characteristic 'thud' sound and the hammer's lack of bounce-back demonstrate the inelastic nature.

The collision was perfectly inelastic - the meteorite transferred all its momentum to the Earth while its enormous kinetic energy (equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT) vaporized rock, created shock waves, and excavated the massive crater.

  "summary": "Collisions are interactions where objects exchange momentum through brief, strong forces. They are categorized primarily by how they handle kinetic energy: elastic collisions conserve both momentum and kinetic energy (objects bounce apart), while inelastic collisions conserve only momentum as kinetic energy transforms to heat, sound, and deformation. Perfectly inelastic collisions represent the extreme case where objects stick together and move with common final velocity $v_f = \\frac{m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2}$. These collisions maximize energy dissipation while maintaining perfect momentum conservation. Real-world applications range from vehicle safety systems and railroad operations to asteroid accretion and geological impacts. Understanding inelastic collisions provides crucial insights for engineering design, safety optimization, and natural process comprehension, revealing how objects combine and exchange motion in everything from carefully controlled laboratory experiments to dramatic natural phenomena."
