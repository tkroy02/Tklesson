  "topic": "5.7 Inelastic Collisions",
  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on a specific and common type of collision where the colliding objects stick together after impact. Students will learn that while momentum is conserved, kinetic energy is not, and this loss of energy defines the 'inelastic' nature of the collision.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a perfectly inelastic collision, the maximum amount of kinetic energy is lost consistent with the conservation of momentum. The objects stick together and move with a common final velocity.",
    "explanation": "Momentum is always conserved in an isolated system, but kinetic energy is not. In an inelastic collision, some kinetic energy is transformed into other forms, such as thermal energy, sound energy, and energy of deformation. The 'perfectly' inelastic case is defined by the objects sticking together, which results in the greatest possible kinetic energy loss for the given initial conditions."

While momentum is conserved ( $m_A v_{A,i} + m_B v_{B,i} = (m_A + m_B) v_f$ ), kinetic energy is not. The 'lost' kinetic energy is transformed into other forms like heat, sound, and permanent deformation. This type of collision results in the maximum possible loss of kinetic energy consistent with momentum conservation. The ballistic pendulum is a classic application that uses an inelastic collision followed by an energy-conserving swing to measure a projectile's initial speed. Common misconceptions include believing momentum is lost, assuming the final velocity is always zero, thinking all kinetic energy is lost, and failing to apply the 'sticking' condition in the momentum equation."
