              "explanation": "Air track gliders with opposite magnetic poles approach each other, accelerate toward collision due to magnetic attraction, then stick together upon contact. This demonstrates that inelastic collisions can occur with attractive forces and shows how the final velocity depends on both initial motion and the impulse during attraction."

  "summary": "Inelastic collisions occur when objects stick together after impact, moving with a common final velocity determined by momentum conservation: $v_f = \\frac{m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2}$. While total momentum is perfectly conserved in these collisions, significant kinetic energy is lost, transforming into heat, sound, and permanent deformation. These collisions represent the maximum possible energy dissipation while still obeying momentum conservation. Real-world applications abound, from railroad car couplings and vehicle crash safety to asteroid accretion and geological impact processes. In transportation and engineering, inelastic collisions are deliberately utilized for their energy-absorbing properties and efficient momentum transfer. Laboratory experiments consistently verify momentum conservation in inelastic collisions with high precision while qualitatively demonstrating the various energy transformation processes. Understanding inelastic collisions provides crucial insights for safety design, natural process prediction, and fundamental physics principles, revealing how objects interact in situations ranging from carefully controlled engineering applications to violent natural phenomena."
