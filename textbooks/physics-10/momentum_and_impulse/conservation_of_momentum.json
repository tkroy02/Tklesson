  "topic": "5.6 Conservation of Momentum",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces one of the most fundamental and powerful principles in physics: the conservation of momentum. Students will learn that in any system free from external net force, the total momentum remains constant, providing a powerful tool for analyzing collisions, explosions, and other interactions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The total momentum of an isolated system (one with no net external force) remains constant.",
    "explanation": "This is a universal law. In any interaction between objects within a system, momentum can be transferred from one object to another, but the total amount of momentum never changes. It is 'conserved.' This holds true regardless of the complexity of the internal forces."

  "summary": "The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of an isolated system (net external force = 0) remains constant. This principle is derived from Newton's Third Law, as internal forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs that cancel out within the system. The conservation law is expressed mathematically as $\\sum \\vec{p}_{\\text{initial}} = \\sum \\vec{p}_{\\text{final}}$, and it is a vector equation, meaning momentum is conserved independently in the x, y, and z directions. This makes it an indispensable tool for analyzing collisions (where objects come together), explosions (where objects fly apart), and recoil. Successfully applying the law requires carefully defining the system, confirming it is isolated, and using proper vector component analysis. Common errors include confusing velocity with momentum, ignoring direction in 1D problems, mistakenly thinking it only applies to elastic collisions, and applying it to non-isolated systems where external forces are significant."
