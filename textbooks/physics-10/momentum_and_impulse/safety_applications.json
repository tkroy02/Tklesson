  "summary": "Crumple zones and airbags apply impulse-momentum principles to make crashes survivable by extending stopping time. Crumple zones work by controlled deformation of vehicle front/rear sections, extending crash duration from ~0.1s to ~0.5s while absorbing up to 80% of crash energy. This 5× time extension reduces average forces 5× for the same momentum change. Airbags create internal cushions that extend stopping time from ~0.01s (hard surface impact) to ~0.1s, reducing forces 10× while distributing impact over larger body areas. These systems work together with seatbelts in coordinated sequences: crumple zones manage vehicle deceleration, seatbelts keep occupants positioned, and airbags prevent internal impacts. Modern safety engineering has reduced traffic fatalities by 45-60% in frontal crashes by applying physics principles to manage the relationship $F_{avg} = \\frac{m \\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$ - reducing force by increasing time. These life-saving technologies demonstrate how understanding fundamental physics leads to practical applications that save thousands of lives annually."
