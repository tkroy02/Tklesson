  "expanded_description": "This section explores how the impulse-momentum theorem is applied in engineering to save lives. Students will learn how safety features like crumple zones and airbags are designed to manage the forces experienced during a collision by strategically increasing the time over which momentum changes occur.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Safety devices protect people by increasing the stopping time during a collision, which decreases the average net force experienced for a given change in momentum.",
    "explanation": "From the impulse-momentum theorem ($F_{avg} = \\Delta p / \\Delta t$), for a fixed change in momentum (determined by pre-crash speed and mass), a larger $\\Delta t$ results in a smaller $F_{avg}$. Safety features are engineered to maximize this $\\Delta t$ to keep forces below the threshold of human injury."

  "summary": "Vehicle safety systems are practical applications of the impulse-momentum theorem ($F_{avg} = \\Delta p / \\Delta t$). For a fixed change in momentum during a collision, increasing the stopping time ($\\Delta t$) is the only way to reduce the average force ($F_{avg}$) on occupants. Crumple zones achieve this by engineering the front/rear of the car to collapse gradually, extending the crash duration. Seat belts stretch slightly and distribute force across strong bones, while airbags provide a soft, deflating cushion that further increases the occupant's personal stopping distance and time. These systems work together in a timed sequence: crumple zones first, then seat belts, then airbags. Common misconceptions include viewing crumple zones as weakness, relying on airbags without seat belts, and misunderstanding the relative motion between occupants and the vehicle during a crash. The fundamental physics principle is that injury is caused by high forces, not the momentum change itself, and safety engineering focuses on managing how that momentum change occurs."
