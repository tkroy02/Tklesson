  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the concept of impulse as the product of force and time. Students will learn that impulse is the mechanism by which a force, acting over a duration, changes an object's momentum, providing the crucial link between Newton's Second Law and real-world interactions like collisions and pushes.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Impulse is the quantitative measure of the net force's effect over time. It is the cause of a change in an object's momentum.",
    "explanation": "A force must act for some amount of time to change an object's velocity. A small force acting for a long time can produce the same momentum change as a large force acting for a short time. Impulse (J) quantifies this combined effect of force and time."

  "summary": "Impulse is defined as the product of the average net force and the time interval over which it acts ($\\vec{J} = \\vec{F}_{avg} \\Delta t$). The impulse-momentum theorem states that the impulse on an object equals its change in momentum ($\\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p}$). This relationship reveals a fundamental force-time trade-off: for a given momentum change, increasing the contact time reduces the average force required (and vice-versa). Impulse can be calculated graphically as the area under a force-time curve. Common misconceptions include confusing impulse with force or momentum, misunderstanding average force, and ignoring the vector nature of impulse. Understanding impulse is crucial for analyzing collisions, safety engineering, and sports mechanics where forces act over limited time intervals."
