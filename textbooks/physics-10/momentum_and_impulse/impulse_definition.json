  "summary": "Impulse is defined as the product of average force and time interval: $J = F_{avg} \\times \\Delta t$, with units of newton-seconds (N·s). The impulse-momentum theorem states that impulse equals change in momentum: $J = \\Delta p$. This fundamental relationship shows that forces cause momentum changes when applied over time. The same impulse (and thus same momentum change) can be achieved with large force over short time or small force over long time. This principle drives safety applications where extending impact times reduces dangerous forces - seen in airbags, crumple zones, helmets, and padding. In sports, follow-through techniques extend contact times to maximize impulse transfer for better performance. Impulse calculations can be done directly from force and time, from momentum change, or graphically as the area under a force-time curve. Understanding impulse provides powerful tools for analyzing motion and designing systems that manage forces effectively."
