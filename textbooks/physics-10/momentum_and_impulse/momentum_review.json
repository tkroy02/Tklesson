  "summary": "This review synthesizes the entire momentum unit into a cohesive framework. The core idea is that momentum is a conserved vector quantity in isolated systems. Problem-solving requires a strategic choice: use the Impulse-Momentum Theorem when external forces are significant, and use Conservation of Momentum for collisions, explosions, and recoil in isolated systems. Key skills include classifying collision types (elastic, inelastic, perfectly inelastic), analyzing 2D situations through component-wise conservation, and tackling multi-step problems that combine momentum with energy or kinematics. Common synthesis errors include misidentifying the system, applying 1D formulas to 2D problems, confusing the roles of force and impulse, and underestimating the fundamental necessity of momentum conservation in collision analysis. Mastery of these concepts provides a powerful toolkit for predicting the outcomes of complex physical interactions."
