  "summary": "Work in physics is defined as energy transfer that occurs when a force causes displacement in the direction of the force component, calculated by $W = Fd\\cos\\theta$. Work requires three essential conditions: a force must be applied, the object must move, and the force must have a component parallel to the displacement direction. The unit of work is the joule (J), where 1 J = 1 N·m. Work is fundamentally connected to energy - it represents the process of energy transfer between systems or conversion between energy forms. Positive work transfers energy to an object, negative work removes energy, and zero work occurs when there's no displacement or the force is perpendicular to motion. Understanding work enables analysis of energy efficiency, mechanical systems, and physical limitations across countless practical applications from daily activities to engineering design."
