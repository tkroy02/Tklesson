  "summary": "Positive and negative work represent the direction of energy transfer in physical systems. Positive work ($W > 0$) occurs when the force has a component in the same direction as displacement ($0° \\leq \\theta < 90°$), transferring energy TO the object and increasing its kinetic or potential energy. Negative work ($W < 0$) occurs when the force opposes displacement ($90° < \\theta \\leq 180°$), transferring energy FROM the object and decreasing its mechanical energy, typically converting it to heat or other forms. The work sign is determined by $\\cos\\theta$ in the work formula $W = Fd\\cos\\theta$, with $\\cos\\theta > 0$ for positive work and $\\cos\\theta < 0$ for negative work. This distinction is crucial for understanding energy conservation, optimizing mechanical efficiency, designing safety systems, and solving practical problems across physics and engineering applications."
