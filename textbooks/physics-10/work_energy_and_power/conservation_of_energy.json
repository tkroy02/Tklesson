  "summary": "The Law of Energy Conservation states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In isolated systems, the total energy remains constant over time, though it may change between kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, electrical, and other forms. For systems with only conservative forces (gravity, ideal springs), mechanical energy (KE + PE) is conserved. Real systems always involve some energy dissipation through non-conservative forces like friction, converting useful mechanical energy to less useful thermal energy. Energy conservation applies universally across all physical scales and processes, from subatomic particles to cosmic phenomena. This fundamental principle emerged in the 19th century through work by Mayer, Joule, and Helmholtz, unifying diverse physical phenomena and providing a powerful tool for analyzing systems of all complexities. Energy conservation guides engineering design, explains why perpetual motion is impossible, and forms the basis for understanding energy efficiency and sustainability."
