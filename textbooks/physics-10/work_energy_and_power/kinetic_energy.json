  "summary": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, calculated as $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where mass is in kilograms and velocity in meters per second. The velocity squared relationship means kinetic energy increases exponentially with speed - doubling speed quadruples energy, making high speeds dramatically more dangerous. This principle explains why stopping distances increase with the square of speed and why collision severity grows rapidly with velocity. The Work-Energy Theorem ($W_{net} = \\Delta KE$) connects forces and motion through energy, providing powerful methods for solving motion problems. Understanding kinetic energy is crucial for transportation safety, sports performance, and energy management across countless real-world applications."
