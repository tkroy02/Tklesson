  "summary": "Power is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred, calculated as $P = \\frac{W}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta t}$ and measured in Watts (Joules per second). For mechanical systems, power can be calculated as $P = F \\cdot v$ when force and velocity are parallel, or $P = \\tau \\cdot \\omega$ for rotational motion. Electrical power is calculated as $P = IV$ (voltage × current), with $P = I^2R$ and $P = \\frac{V^2}{R}$ for resistive loads. Common power units include Watts (W), kilowatts (kW), megawatts (MW), and horsepower (hp, approximately 746 W). Power scales enormously across contexts: human sustained output ~100 W, car engines 50-300 kW, wind turbines 2-8 MW, and power plants 500-2000 MW. Understanding power is essential for analyzing energy efficiency, designing mechanical and electrical systems, and appreciating the energy demands of different activities and technologies."
