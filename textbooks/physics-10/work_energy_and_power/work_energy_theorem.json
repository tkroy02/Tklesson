  "summary": "The Work-Energy Theorem states that the net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy: $W_{net} = \\Delta KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$. This fundamental relationship provides an energy-based approach to solving motion problems that is often simpler than using Newton's Second Law directly, especially for variable forces, curved paths, or when only speeds matter. The theorem handles multiple forces through scalar addition of work contributions and extends to include rotational motion and potential energy changes. Power, defined as the rate of doing work ($P = \\frac{W}{\\Delta t}$ or $P = F \\cdot v$), connects work-energy concepts to time considerations. The Work-Energy Theorem serves as a powerful problem-solving tool across diverse physical scenarios from simple pushing to complex mechanical systems."
