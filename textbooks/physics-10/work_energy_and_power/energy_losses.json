  "summary": "Energy losses through friction and thermal dissipation are inevitable in all real systems. Friction converts useful mechanical energy to waste heat through work $W_{friction} = f_k \\cdot d$, while electrical resistance dissipates energy as heat via $P_{loss} = I^2R$. These losses represent energy quality degradation from organized forms (mechanical, electrical) to disorganized thermal energy, corresponding to entropy increase as described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The maximum possible efficiency for converting thermal energy to work is limited by the Carnot efficiency $\\eta_{max} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}$. While losses cannot be eliminated entirely, they can be minimized through strategies like lubrication, streamlining, higher-efficiency devices, and waste energy recovery. Energy losses have significant economic and environmental impacts, driving global efforts to improve energy efficiency across transportation, industry, and buildings. Understanding and quantifying energy losses is essential for designing efficient systems and promoting sustainable energy use."
