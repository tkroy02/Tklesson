  "summary": "Energy transformations are processes that convert energy between different forms while obeying the law of energy conservation. Mechanical transformations involve kinetic-potential exchanges through motion and forces. Thermal transformations occur through heat transfer and energy dissipation processes like friction and electrical resistance. Chemical transformations involve bond breaking/forming in combustion, batteries, and biological processes. Electrical transformations enable efficient conversion to/from other forms through devices like motors, generators, and electronic components. Real-world systems typically chain multiple transformations, with overall efficiency being the product of individual stage efficiencies. Understanding energy transformation pathways, mechanisms, and efficiencies is crucial for optimizing energy use, developing sustainable technologies, and appreciating how energy flows through natural and technological systems. While energy conservation ensures total quantity remains constant, transformation processes often reduce energy quality by converting high-quality forms to less useful thermal energy."
