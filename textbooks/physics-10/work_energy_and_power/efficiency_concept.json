  "summary": "Efficiency measures how effectively systems convert input energy into useful output energy, calculated as $\\eta = \\frac{E_{useful\\ out}}{E_{total\\ in}}$ and expressed as a decimal or percentage. Mechanical efficiency accounts for friction and other losses in machines, while thermal efficiency is fundamentally limited by the Carnot efficiency $\\eta_{Carnot} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}$ due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Electrical efficiency is generally higher than thermal efficiency, with devices like electric motors achieving 85-97% efficiency. Efficiency can be improved through strategies like reducing losses, recovering waste energy, optimizing operation, and upgrading technology. Understanding and improving efficiency is crucial for energy conservation, cost savings, and reducing environmental impacts across all energy-using systems."
