  "summary": "Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored in objects due to their height above a reference level, calculated as $GPE = mgh$ where m is mass in kg, g is gravitational field strength (9.8 m/s² on Earth), and h is height in meters. GPE represents work done against gravity and can convert to kinetic energy during falling, following $mgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ in frictionless cases. While absolute GPE values depend on arbitrary reference levels, GPE changes are physically meaningful and determine motion in gravitational systems. Real-world applications include hydroelectric power, pumped storage, clock mechanisms, and various mechanical systems that harness height-based energy storage and conversion. Understanding GPE enables analysis of energy transformations in diverse contexts from simple falling objects to complex engineered systems."
