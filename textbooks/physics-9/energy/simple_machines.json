  "expanded_description": "Simple machines are basic mechanical devices that change the magnitude or direction of forces, making work easier. While they cannot reduce the amount of work required (energy conservation), they can trade force for distance, allowing smaller forces to accomplish tasks that would otherwise require larger forces.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A simple machine is a basic mechanical device that changes the magnitude or direction of an applied force. The six classical simple machines are: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. Key principle: Simple machines redistribute work—they can reduce force required but only by increasing the distance over which force acts. Work in = Work out (ideally): $F_{\\text{in}} \\cdot d_{\\text{in}} = F_{\\text{out}} \\cdot d_{\\text{out}}$. Trading force for distance (or vice versa) makes tasks achievable with available force.",
    "explanation": "Simple machines are fundamental tools that have been used for thousands of years. They don't create energy or reduce the work required—that would violate conservation of energy. Instead, they make work easier by changing how force is applied. The core insight: Work = Force × Distance. If work is conserved (ideal machine, no friction), reducing force required means increasing distance traveled, and vice versa. Example: Ramp (inclined plane) allows lifting heavy object to height with smaller force than lifting straight up. The trade-off: must push object along longer path (ramp length > vertical height). Work is the same ($W = mgh$ regardless of path for conservative forces), but force is reduced. Simple machines enable humans to accomplish tasks beyond their direct strength: Lever can lift car (small force × long distance = large force × short distance). Pulley system can lift heavy loads with reduced force. Ramp allows wheeling refrigerator up stairs instead of lifting. All complex machines are combinations of simple machines: Car jack (screw + lever), bicycle (wheel and axle + lever + gears), crane (pulleys + levers). Understanding simple machines reveals: (1) How mechanical advantage works (force amplification via distance trade). (2) Why no machine can do more work output than work input (conservation of energy). (3) How real machines lose energy to friction (efficiency < 100%). (4) Design principles for tools and machines throughout history and modern engineering. Simple machines are not just historical curiosities—they remain essential in modern technology, from door hinges (lever) to car transmissions (gears—modified wheel and axle) to wheelchair ramps (inclined plane).",

  "summary": "Simple machines are basic mechanical devices that change force magnitude or direction: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. All complex machines are combinations of these six. Core principle: Simple machines trade force for distance (or vice versa) while conserving work (ideally): $W_{\\text{in}} = W_{\\text{out}}$ or $F_{\\text{in}} d_{\\text{in}} = F_{\\text{out}} d_{\\text{out}}$. Cannot reduce work required (violates energy conservation), but can reduce force needed by accepting increased distance. Lever: Rigid bar pivoting on fulcrum. Three classes: (1st) fulcrum between effort and load—changes direction, variable MA; (2nd) load between fulcrum and effort—always MA > 1, doesn't reverse direction; (3rd) effort between fulcrum and load—MA < 1, provides speed/distance advantage. MA = effort arm length / load arm length. Wheel and axle: Large wheel attached to smaller axle, rotating together. Force on wheel → torque multiplication at axle (MA = $r_{\\text{wheel}}/r_{\\text{axle}} > 1$). Force on axle → speed multiplication at wheel (MA < 1). Examples: screwdriver, steering wheel, gears. Pulley: Rope over wheel. Fixed pulley (MA = 1, changes direction only). Movable pulley (MA = 2, two rope segments support load). Block and tackle (MA = number of supporting rope segments, can reach high MA). Trade-off: pull more rope to lift load shorter distance. Inclined plane: Ramp reduces lifting force by increasing distance. Force needed = $W \\sin\\theta$ where $\\theta$ is ramp angle. Shallow angle → small force, long ramp. Work same as vertical lift: $mgh$. Applications: ramps, roads, wheelchair access. Wedge: Moving inclined plane (two inclined planes back-to-back). Converts small forward force over long distance into large splitting force over short distance. Examples: axe, knife, chisel, plow. Screw: Inclined plane wrapped around cylinder. Converts rotation (long circular distance) into linear motion (short distance). Very high MA possible (fine threads). Examples: bolts, jacks, vise, micrometer. Force-distance trade-off: Fundamental to all simple machines. Reduce force → must increase distance proportionally. Work conserved: $F_{\\text{small}} \\times d_{\\text{large}} = F_{\\text{large}} \\times d_{\\text{small}}$. Makes tasks achievable with available force (trade abundant resource—distance/time—for scarce resource—force). Real machines have friction: Efficiency < 100% always. Must do more input work than ideal to overcome friction (becomes heat). Typical efficiencies 50-95% for simple machines. Lubrication reduces friction, increases efficiency. Compound machines: Combinations of simple machines. Examples: bicycle (wheels, levers, gears), car jack (screw + lever), excavator (hydraulic pistons + levers + wedge). Total MA = product of individual MAs. Modern applications: Construction (cranes, excavators—pulleys, levers, hydraulics), Hand tools (scissors, pliers—levers and wedges), Accessibility (ramps, lever handles—inclines, levers), Manufacturing (robots, CNC—screws, wheels, levers). Historical importance: Egyptian pyramids (ramps to lift blocks), Greek engineering (Archimedes studied levers/pulleys/screws), Medieval construction (treadwheel cranes—wheels, pulleys), Roman aqueducts (gentle inclines transport water). Understanding simple machines reveals: How to accomplish tasks with limited force (trade distance), Why machines can't create energy (conservation law), How complex devices work (combinations of simple elements), Design principles for tools and machines throughout history and modern engineering."
