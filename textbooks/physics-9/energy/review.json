  "expanded_description": "Review questions consolidate understanding of energy concepts by testing comprehension and problem-solving skills across all topics in Chapter 5, from work and energy definitions to power, simple machines, mechanical advantage, and efficiency. Success requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative problem-solving ability.",

    "principle": "Chapter 5 review integrates work (force × distance), kinetic energy (½mv²), potential energy (mgh for gravitational, ½kx² for elastic), conservation of energy (total energy constant), power (work/time or force × velocity), simple machines (force-distance trade-off), mechanical advantage (force multiplication), and efficiency (useful output / total input). Mastery requires understanding energy transformations, applying conservation principles, calculating MA and efficiency, and recognizing real-world applications.",
    "explanation": "This review synthesizes all energy topics covered in Unit 5:<br><br>**Work (5.1)**: Energy transfer via force causing displacement. $W = Fd\\cos\\theta$. Positive work adds energy, negative work removes energy. Only force component parallel to displacement does work.<br><br>**Kinetic Energy (5.2)**: Energy of motion. $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Depends quadratically on speed (double speed → 4× KE). Work-energy theorem: $W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta KE$.<br><br>**Potential Energy (5.3)**: Stored energy from position/configuration. Gravitational: $PE_g = mgh$. Elastic: $PE_s = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Conservative forces allow PE definition. PE relative to chosen reference level.<br><br>**Conservation of Energy (5.4)**: Total energy constant in isolated system. For conservative forces only: $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$ (mechanical energy conserved). With friction: mechanical energy decreases (converts to heat), but total energy (including thermal) still conserved.<br><br>**Power (5.5)**: Rate of energy transfer. $P = W/t$ or $P = Fv$. Measured in watts (J/s). Same work done faster requires more power. Efficiency relates to power: $\\eta = P_{\\text{out}}/P_{\\text{in}}$.<br><br>**Simple Machines (5.6)**: Six basic devices that change force magnitude/direction: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, screw. All trade force for distance: reduce force needed by increasing distance traveled. Work conserved (ideally): $F_{\\text{in}}d_{\\text{in}} = F_{\\text{out}}d_{\\text{out}}$.<br><br>**Mechanical Advantage (5.7)**: Force multiplication ratio. $MA = F_{\\text{out}}/F_{\\text{in}}$. Ideal MA (IMA) from geometry. Actual MA (AMA) from measured forces. Efficiency: $\\eta = AMA/IMA$.<br><br>**Efficiency (5.8)**: Useful output / total input. $\\eta = E_{\\text{out}}/E_{\\text{in}} = W_{\\text{out}}/W_{\\text{in}}$. Always ≤ 100% due to friction, heat losses. Difference is wasted energy (usually heat).<br><br>Success requires understanding energy as unifying concept connecting force, motion, and transformations throughout physics.",

  "summary": "**Unit 5 Review Summary**: <br><br>**Work (5.1)**: Energy transfer via force causing displacement. $W = Fd\\cos\\theta$. Parallel force → maximum work ($Fd$). Perpendicular → zero work. Opposite → negative work ($-Fd$). Positive work adds energy, negative removes energy. Only force component along displacement does work. Units: joules (J) = N·m. <br><br>**Kinetic Energy (5.2)**: Energy of motion. $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Linear dependence on mass, quadratic on speed (double speed → 4× KE—critical for safety). Work-energy theorem: $W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta KE$. Net work equals KE change. Provides alternative to force analysis—compare initial/final energies instead of tracking forces. <br><br>**Potential Energy (5.3)**: Stored energy from position/configuration. Gravitational: $PE_g = mgh$ (relative to chosen reference level). Elastic: $PE_s = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ (spring compression/stretch). Conservative forces allow PE definition. Work by conservative force = $-\\Delta PE$. PE ↔ KE transformations fundamental. <br><br>**Conservation of Energy (5.4)**: Total energy constant in isolated system. For conservative forces only: $KE + PE = \\text{constant}$ (mechanical energy conserved). $\\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + mgh_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh_f$. With friction: mechanical energy decreases (converts to heat $Q = fd$), but total (mechanical + thermal) still conserved. Most powerful problem-solving principle—analyze initial/final states without tracking forces throughout. <br><br>**Power (5.5)**: Rate of energy transfer. $P = W/t$ (work per time) or $P = Fv$ (force × velocity). Units: watts (W) = J/s. Same work done faster requires more power. Distinguishes fast from slow processes. Energy from power: $E = Pt$. Electricity measured in kWh (kilowatt-hours = 3.6 MJ). Power ranges: human ~100-200 W, car engines ~100-300 kW, power plants ~500-1000 MW. <br><br>**Simple Machines (5.6)**: Six basic devices change force magnitude/direction: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, screw. Core principle: trade force for distance. Reduce force needed by increasing distance. Work conserved (ideal): $F_{\\text{in}}d_{\\text{in}} = F_{\\text{out}}d_{\\text{out}}$. Cannot reduce work (energy conservation), but make tasks achievable with available force. All complex machines are combinations of simple machines. <br><br>**Mechanical Advantage (5.7)**: Force multiplication ratio. $MA = F_{\\text{out}}/F_{\\text{in}}$. Ideal MA (IMA): from geometry, assumes frictionless. Formulas: Lever ($L_e/L_l$), Wheel/axle ($r_w/r_a$), Pulley ($n$ segments), Incline ($L/h$), Wedge ($L/t$), Screw ($2\\pi r/p$). Actual MA (AMA): from measured forces, always $AMA < IMA$ due to friction. Efficiency: $\\eta = AMA/IMA$ shows friction impact. <br><br>**Efficiency (5.8)**: Useful output / total input. $\\eta = E_{\\text{out}}/E_{\\text{in}} = W_{\\text{out}}/W_{\\text{in}} = P_{\\text{out}}/P_{\\text{in}}$. Always ≤ 100%. Waste: $E_{\\text{wasted}} = E_{\\text{in}}(1-\\eta)$, usually becomes heat. Typical ranges: Very high (>90%): electric motors, transformers. Moderate (40-70%): diesel engines, LEDs, power plants. Low (<40%): gasoline engines (~28%), incandescent bulbs (~5%). Improving efficiency: lubrication, better bearings, maintenance. Economic impact: higher efficiency → lower operating costs. Often pays for itself through energy savings. Environmental: less fuel → less pollution. <br><br>**Key Connections**: Work transfers energy. KE and PE store energy. Conservation constrains transformations (total constant). Power describes rate. Machines redistribute work (force-distance trade-off). MA quantifies force multiplication. Efficiency reveals losses. All interconnected through energy concept—unifying principle throughout physics. Success requires both conceptual understanding (why principles work) and problem-solving skills (applying formulas, calculating unknowns, interpreting results)."
