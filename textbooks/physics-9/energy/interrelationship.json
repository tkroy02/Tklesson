  "expanded_description": "Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred—how quickly energy changes from one form to another. Understanding power connects work and energy (quantities measured in joules) to time, revealing how fast processes occur and enabling analysis of engines, machines, and energy systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy: $P = \\frac{W}{t}$ (average power) or $P = \\frac{E}{t}$ (energy transfer rate) where $W$ is work (J), $E$ is energy (J), and $t$ is time (s). SI unit: watt (W), where 1 W = 1 J/s. Instantaneous power for constant force: $P = Fv$ where $F$ is force magnitude and $v$ is velocity in the force's direction.",
    "explanation": "Work and energy tell us *how much* energy is transferred or transformed—measured in joules. Power tells us *how fast* this transfer occurs—measured in watts (joules per second). Two machines might do the same work (lift same mass same height), but one does it faster—that machine has more power. High power means rapid energy transfer; low power means slow transfer. Example: Lifting 100 kg to 10 m height requires ~9800 J of work regardless of time. Person taking 60 seconds: power = 9800/60 ≈ 163 W. Crane taking 5 seconds: power = 9800/5 = 1960 W. Same work, very different power. Power is crucial for: (1) Rating machines and engines—car engines rated in horsepower or kilowatts (power output). (2) Electricity consumption—electrical devices rated in watts (power consumed). Electric bill based on energy (kilowatt-hours = power × time). (3) Athletic performance—sprinters have high power output (rapid energy conversion), marathon runners sustain lower power longer. (4) Engineering design—must ensure systems can deliver required power, not just total energy. The relationship $P = Fv$ (for constant force) connects power to mechanics: $P = \\frac{W}{t} = \\frac{Fd}{t} = F \\cdot \\frac{d}{t} = Fv$. Tells us: For same power, higher speed requires less force (or vice versa). Vehicle climbing hill slowly: low speed, can use lower gear (higher force, lower speed, same power). Accelerating on highway: high speed requires large force to maintain high power. Power determines performance limits: Maximum power available constrains how fast work can be done. Car engine's maximum power limits acceleration capability and top speed (at top speed, engine power exactly balances air resistance power drain).",

Common multiples: kilowatt (kW = 1000 W), megawatt (MW = 10⁶ W), gigawatt (GW = 10⁹ W). Alternative formula for constant force and velocity: $P = Fv$ (force × velocity in force direction). Higher force or velocity → higher power. Power distinguishes fast from slow energy transfer: Same work done quickly requires high power, slowly requires low power. Two machines doing same work but different times have different power outputs. Human power: Peak ~500-2000 W (seconds), sustained ~100-400 W (hours), long duration ~75-100 W. Athletes have higher power outputs. Power-to-weight ratio important for climbing, acceleration. Vehicles: Car engines 75-300 kW typical. Power determines acceleration and top speed. Top speed limited by power needed to overcome air resistance (power ∝ $v^3$ for drag). Electric motors more efficient (~90%) than gasoline engines (~25-30%). Electrical power: Appliances rated in watts (power consumption rate). Energy consumption = power × time. Electricity billed in kilowatt-hours (kWh): 1 kWh = 1000 W for 1 hour = 3.6 MJ. Higher wattage devices use energy faster but not necessarily more total (depends on usage time). Power plants: Range from kilowatts (small renewables) to gigawatts (large nuclear/hydro plants). Grid must balance generation and consumption constantly. Base load (constant) vs peak load (high-demand times) requires different generation strategies. Efficiency: Ratio of useful output to total input: $\\eta = P_{\\text{out}}/P_{\\text{in}}$ (or same for energy). Always <100% due to friction, heat losses, thermodynamic limits. Typical efficiencies: Electric motors 85-95% (excellent), LEDs 40-50%, incandescent bulbs 5% (terrible), gasoline engines 25-30%, power plants 33-40%. Waste energy = input × (1 - efficiency), usually becomes heat. Higher efficiency → less input needed for same output → lower energy costs. LED vs incandescent: 1/5 the power for same light due to 10× better efficiency. Power consumption and cost: Energy cost = power × time × electricity rate ($/kWh). High-power devices expensive to run if used long. Efficiency improvements save money—often pay for themselves quickly through reduced operating costs. Understanding power essential for: Rating machines and engines, calculating energy consumption and costs, comparing device efficiency, managing electrical grids, analyzing athletic performance. Power connects work/energy (quantities in joules) to time (how fast processes occur), providing complete picture of energy systems."
