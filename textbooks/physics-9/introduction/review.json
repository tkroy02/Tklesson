  "summary": "This review section consolidates the fundamental concepts from Chapter 1: Scientific Method. Key topics include: the definition and nature of science and physics, expressing numbers in scientific notation, applying significant figures rules in measurements and calculations, understanding the difference between accuracy and precision, creating and interpreting graphs with proper components and scales, and following a systematic problem-solving process. Success in physics requires mastery of these foundational skills. Practice each type of problem multiple times, show all your work, check your answers for reasonableness, and seek help when needed. These tools and methods will be used throughout your study of physics."
