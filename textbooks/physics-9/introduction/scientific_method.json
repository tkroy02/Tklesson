  "summary": "The scientific method represents a sophisticated hierarchy of knowledge building, from testable hypotheses to comprehensive theories and descriptive laws. Understanding the distinctions between these concepts—particularly that theories don't 'graduate' into laws but serve different explanatory purposes—is crucial for scientific literacy. Measurement quality, encompassing both accuracy (closeness to true value) and precision (consistency), underlies all reliable scientific work, with proper uncertainty analysis being essential for meaningful interpretation. Historical physics breakthroughs, from Newton's laws to the Higgs boson discovery, demonstrate how systematic application of the scientific method, combined with theoretical creativity and experimental innovation, has repeatedly expanded human understanding of fundamental physical principles. This framework continues to drive progress as new questions emerge from each answered inquiry, maintaining science as a self-correcting, evidence-based enterprise."
