It involves making careful observations, asking specific questions, conducting background research, forming testable hypotheses, designing controlled experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing evidence-based conclusions. Key to the process is understanding and properly controlling variables: the independent variable (what you change), the dependent variable (what you measure), and controlled variables (what you keep constant). A fair test changes only one variable at a time, uses multiple trials to ensure reliability, and bases conclusions on evidence rather than assumptions or bias. The scientific method ensures that scientific investigations are objective, reproducible, and self-correcting, making it a powerful tool for understanding the natural world. Through systematic application of these principles, physics has developed our understanding of motion, forces, energy, and all physical phenomena."
