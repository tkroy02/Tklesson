  "summary": "The scientific method represents a sophisticated hierarchy of knowledge building, from testable hypotheses to comprehensive theories and descriptive laws. Understanding the distinctions between these concepts—particularly that theories don't 'graduate' into laws but serve different explanatory purposes—is crucial for scientific literacy. Measurement quality, encompassing both accuracy (correctness) and precision (consistency), underlies all reliable scientific work. Historical physics breakthroughs demonstrate how systematic application of the scientific method, combined with creative insight, has repeatedly expanded human understanding of the universe, from Newton's celestial mechanics to the recent Higgs boson discovery. This framework continues to drive progress as new questions emerge from each answered inquiry."
