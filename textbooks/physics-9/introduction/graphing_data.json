  "summary": "Graphs are essential tools in physics for visualizing relationships between variables. The independent variable (what you control) goes on the x-axis, and the dependent variable (what you measure) goes on the y-axis. Every graph needs a descriptive title, labeled axes with units, appropriate scales that use most of the graph space, accurately plotted points, and a smooth line or curve of best fit. Graphs can show various relationships including direct proportion (straight line through origin), linear (straight line), inverse proportion (curve), and quadratic (parabola). You can use graphs to find values through interpolation (within the data range) or extrapolation (beyond the data range), and to calculate rates of change using the slope. Proper graphing technique and interpretation are fundamental skills for analyzing and communicating scientific data."
