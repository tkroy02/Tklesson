  "summary": "Data analysis is the crucial bridge between raw experimental measurements and meaningful scientific conclusions. Effective analysis begins with systematic data collection using appropriate methods for both quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (descriptive) observations. Organizing data into clear tables with proper units and formatting enables efficient analysis and error checking. Graphical representations like scatter plots and line graphs transform numerical data into visual patterns that reveal relationships between variables, with slope calculations providing quantitative measures of these relationships. Basic statistical tools like mean and range help assess measurement consistency and uncertainty. Finally, evidence-based conclusions must directly evaluate the original hypothesis, acknowledge experimental limitations, suggest improvements, and often generate new research questions. These data analysis skills enable students to transform observations into reliable scientific knowledge and develop critical thinking abilities applicable across all scientific disciplines."
