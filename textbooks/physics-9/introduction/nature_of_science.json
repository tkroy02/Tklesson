  "summary": "The scientific method provides a rigorous, systematic framework for investigating natural phenomena through observable, testable, and repeatable processes. Beginning with careful observation and question formulation, it progresses through hypothesis development, controlled experimentation with proper variables and controls, careful data collection and analysis, and evidence-based conclusions. This iterative process, characterized by skepticism, objectivity, and falsifiability, ensures that scientific knowledge remains reliable, verifiable, and continually refined through peer review and new evidence. Mastery of these fundamental skills prepares students for advanced scientific study and critical thinking in everyday life."
