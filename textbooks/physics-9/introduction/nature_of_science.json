  "summary": "Science is a systematic, evidence-based approach to understanding the natural world. In physics, it involves observing phenomena, asking testable questions, performing controlled experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and forming explanations that can be tested and refined over time. Scientific knowledge is characterized by being empirical (based on evidence), objective (independent of personal bias), tentative (open to revision with new evidence), and cumulative (building on previous discoveries). Physics applies this scientific approach to study matter, energy, motion, and forces, using both experimental observation and theoretical reasoning to understand the fundamental laws governing the universe. Both qualitative (descriptive) and quantitative (numerical) observations are valuable, but physics emphasizes quantitative measurements for precision. The scientific method, combining careful observation with controlled experimentation, provides a reliable way to distinguish what we wish were true from what actually is true about the physical world."
