  "summary": "Scientific notation expresses very large and very small numbers in the compact form a × 10ⁿ, where the coefficient 'a' lies between 1 and 10, and the exponent 'n' is an integer. Large numbers (≥10) have positive exponents and require moving the decimal left, while small numbers (<1) have negative exponents and require moving the decimal right. This system is essential in physics where quantities range from subatomic scales (10⁻³¹ kg for electron mass) to astronomical distances (10¹⁵ m for a light-year). Scientific notation simplifies calculations through systematic rules: multiply coefficients and add exponents when multiplying, divide coefficients and subtract exponents when dividing. It makes comparisons easier, reduces errors from writing many zeros, and is the universal language of scientific communication. Whether dealing with the speed of light (3.0 × 10⁸ m/s) or the size of an atom (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁰ m), scientific notation makes extreme values manageable and calculations practical."
