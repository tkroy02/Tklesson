  "expanded_description": "Motion with constant acceleration is one of the most important topics in kinematics. When acceleration is constant, we can use a set of powerful equations—the kinematic equations—to predict and analyze motion completely. This includes free fall, vehicles accelerating uniformly, and many other real-world situations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Constant acceleration motion occurs when an object's acceleration remains the same throughout its motion. This produces predictable patterns: velocity changes linearly with time, and position changes quadratically with time. Four kinematic equations describe all aspects of this motion, allowing calculation of any unknown quantity from known values.",
    "explanation": "When acceleration is constant (uniform acceleration), motion follows specific mathematical patterns that make analysis straightforward. The velocity-time graph is a straight line (constant slope), and the position-time graph is a parabola (curved). Five key variables describe the motion: initial velocity ($v_i$), final velocity ($v_f$), acceleration ($a$), time ($\\Delta t$), and displacement ($\\Delta x$). Four kinematic equations relate these variables in different combinations. Given any three variables, you can always find the other two. This systematic approach makes constant acceleration problems very solvable. Common examples include: free fall near Earth's surface (constant downward acceleration $g = 9.8$ m/s²), cars accelerating or braking uniformly, objects on inclined planes, and projectiles (vertical component has constant acceleration). Understanding constant acceleration is essential because it's the foundation for more complex motion analysis and appears throughout physics.",

  "summary": "Constant acceleration motion occurs when acceleration remains unchanged throughout motion. This produces linear velocity change ($v = v_i + at$) and quadratic position change (parabolic $x$-$t$ graph). Five variables describe motion: initial velocity ($v_i$), final velocity ($v_f$), acceleration ($a$), time interval ($\\Delta t$), and displacement ($\\Delta x$). Four kinematic equations relate these variables, each containing four of the five: (1) $v_f = v_i + a\\Delta t$ [omits $\\Delta x$], (2) $\\Delta x = v_i \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}a(\\Delta t)^2$ [omits $v_f$], (3) $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\\Delta x$ [omits $\\Delta t$], (4) $\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)\\Delta t$ [omits $a$]. Problem-solving strategy: (1) understand situation, (2) establish reference frame and sign convention, (3) list known variables, (4) choose equation that contains knowns and unknown while omitting variable you don't have/need, (5) solve algebraically first, (6) substitute values with units, (7) check reasonableness. Free fall is important application: all objects near Earth's surface fall with constant acceleration $g = 9.8$ m/s² downward (often approximated as 10 m/s²). With upward = positive convention: $a = -g = -9.8$ m/s² always. Key free fall concepts: acceleration constant throughout entire motion (up, peak, down); at peak velocity = 0 but acceleration still = $-g$ (not zero); symmetry for vertical throws (time up = time down, return speed = launch speed). Common mistakes to avoid: sign errors (most common—establish and follow sign convention), confusing $v_i$ and $v_f$, thinking $a = 0$ at peak (wrong—still $a = -g$), forgetting to square root when using equation (3), choosing wrong equation for given knowns/unknowns, inconsistent units. Always check answer for correct sign, reasonable magnitude, and proper units."
