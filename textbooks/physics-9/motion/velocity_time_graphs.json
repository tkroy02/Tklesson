    "principle": "A velocity-time graph plots velocity (vertical axis) versus time (horizontal axis). The slope of the line equals acceleration, and the area under the curve equals displacement. The graph's shape reveals whether an object is speeding up, slowing down, or moving at constant velocity.",
    "explanation": "Velocity-time graphs encode different information than position-time graphs. While position-time graphs show where an object is, velocity-time graphs show how fast and in what direction it's moving. The key relationships are: (1) slope = acceleration ($\\text{slope} = \\Delta v / \\Delta t = a$), and (2) area under curve = displacement ($\\text{area} = v \\times \\Delta t = \\Delta x$). Horizontal lines indicate constant velocity (uniform motion, zero acceleration). Sloped lines indicate changing velocity (accelerated motion). The steeper the slope, the greater the acceleration. Positive slopes indicate positive acceleration; negative slopes indicate negative acceleration. Understanding velocity-time graphs is essential for analyzing accelerated motion and forms the foundation for solving complex kinematics problems.",

  "summary": "Velocity-time graphs plot velocity (vertical axis) versus time (horizontal axis), directly showing how velocity changes over time. Two critical relationships: (1) slope of v-t graph equals acceleration ($a = \\Delta v / \\Delta t = \\text{slope}$), and (2) area under v-t curve equals displacement ($\\Delta x = \\text{area}$). Graph interpretation: horizontal line indicates constant velocity (uniform motion, zero acceleration), sloped straight line indicates constant acceleration (uniformly accelerated motion), positive slope indicates positive acceleration (velocity increasing if positive, or decreasing if negative), negative slope indicates negative acceleration (velocity decreasing if positive, or increasing magnitude if negative). The steeper the slope, the greater the acceleration. To calculate acceleration: find slope using any two points: $a = (v_2 - v_1)/(t_2 - t_1)$. Include units: m/s². To calculate displacement: find area under curve between curve and horizontal axis. For rectangles: area = base × height = $\\Delta t \\times v$. For triangles: area = $\\frac{1}{2}$ base × height. For trapezoids: area = $\\frac{1}{2}(v_1 + v_2) \\times \\Delta t$. Areas above horizontal axis are positive displacement (positive direction); areas below are negative displacement (negative direction). Total displacement = sum of signed areas. For multi-segment motion: sum areas of all segments. Line crossing horizontal axis indicates direction reversal (velocity changes sign, passes through zero). Velocity-time graphs connect to position-time graphs: slope of x-t graph = height of v-t graph (velocity), curvature of x-t graph relates to slope of v-t graph (acceleration), area under v-t curve = change in position shown on x-t graph. Understanding both graph types provides complete picture of motion: x-t graphs show where object is, v-t graphs show how fast and which direction it's moving."
