  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A position-time graph plots position (vertical axis) versus time (horizontal axis). The shape and slope of the line reveal the motion: slope equals velocity, steeper slope means faster speed, upward slope means positive velocity, downward slope means negative velocity, horizontal line means at rest, and curved line means changing velocity (acceleration).",
    "explanation": "Position-time graphs transform motion data into visual form, making patterns immediately apparent. Every point on the graph shows where an object is at a specific time. The slope at any point gives the velocity at that moment—this is the key relationship: $\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = v$. Straight lines indicate constant velocity (uniform motion), while curves indicate changing velocity (acceleration). By analyzing the graph's shape, slope, and features, you can determine position at any time, calculate velocities, identify when objects meet, and understand the complete story of the motion. These graphs are fundamental tools in kinematics and appear throughout physics.",

  "summary": "Position-time graphs plot position (vertical axis) versus time (horizontal axis), with each point showing where an object is at a specific time. The fundamental relationship: slope of the position-time graph equals velocity ($\\text{slope} = \\Delta x / \\Delta t = v$). Graph interpretation: straight line indicates constant velocity (uniform motion), curved line indicates changing velocity (acceleration), horizontal line indicates zero velocity (object at rest), upward slope indicates positive velocity (moving in positive direction), downward slope indicates negative velocity (moving in negative direction), steeper slope indicates faster speed. For straight lines, slope is constant everywhere; calculate using any two points: $\\text{slope} = (x_2 - x_1)/(t_2 - t_1)$. For curves, slope varies—steepening curve means increasing speed, flattening curve means decreasing speed. Concave up (∪) indicates speeding up; concave down (∩) indicates slowing down. The vertical intercept gives initial position ($x_i$); horizontal intercept shows when object passes through origin. When multiple objects appear on same graph, intersection points show when/where objects meet, relative slopes show relative velocities, vertical separation shows distance between objects. To create position-time graphs: identify initial position and velocity, determine if motion is uniform (straight) or accelerated (curved), plot key points, connect with appropriate line, verify slope matches velocity. Common mistakes to avoid: confusing position with distance (position can be negative), thinking steeper means farther (steeper means faster, not necessarily farther traveled), interpreting graph curve as object's path (graph shows position vs time, not physical trajectory), forgetting units in slope calculation, placing axes incorrectly. Position-time graphs are fundamental tools for visualizing motion, analyzing velocity changes, predicting future positions, and comparing different motions."
