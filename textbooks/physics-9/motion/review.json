    "explanation": "This section brings together all motion topics: describing motion using position, displacement, distance, speed, and velocity; understanding acceleration as rate of velocity change; interpreting position-time and velocity-time graphs (slopes, areas, shapes); applying uniform motion equations; and using kinematic equations for constant acceleration including free fall. Success requires understanding both concepts (why relationships work, what graphs mean) and procedures (how to calculate, which equations to use). The questions progress from basic recall to application and multi-step analysis, mirroring how motion skills are used in real physics problems.",

  "summary": "Chapter 3 review questions integrate all motion topics: fundamental concepts (position vs displacement, speed vs velocity, scalars vs vectors), acceleration understanding (rate of velocity change, sign interpretation for speeding up vs slowing down), graph interpretation (position-time: slope = velocity, velocity-time: slope = acceleration and area = displacement), graph shapes (straight lines = uniform motion, curves = acceleration, horizontal = constant or zero values), kinematic equations for constant acceleration (four equations relating $v_i$, $v_f$, $a$, $\\Delta t$, $\\Delta x$), problem-solving strategy (list knowns, choose appropriate equation, solve algebraically, check reasonableness), and free fall applications (constant $g = 9.8$ m/s² downward, at peak $v = 0$ but $a = -g$ still). Success requires understanding concepts (why relationships work, what signs mean, how graphs connect to motion) and mastering procedures (reading graphs, choosing correct equations, applying sign conventions, multi-step problem decomposition). Common skills tested: calculating velocity from position change or graph slope, finding acceleration from velocity change or graph slope, determining displacement from velocity-time area, using kinematic equations with proper equation selection, interpreting motion from graph shapes, solving free fall problems with gravity, analyzing multi-phase motion by breaking into segments, applying sign conventions consistently. The review emphasizes integration—using multiple concepts together to solve realistic problems, just as required in physics applications beyond this chapter."
