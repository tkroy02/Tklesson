  "expanded_description": "Speed and velocity describe how fast an object is moving. Though often used interchangeably in everyday language, they are distinct concepts in physics: speed is a scalar (magnitude only), while velocity is a vector (magnitude and direction).",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Speed measures how fast an object covers distance (rate of distance traveled). Velocity measures how fast an object's position changes and in what direction (rate of displacement). Speed is always positive; velocity can be positive, negative, or zero.",
    "explanation": "Both speed and velocity involve the concept of 'rate'—how much something changes per unit time. Speed = distance/time tells how much ground is covered per second, regardless of direction. Velocity = displacement/time tells how much position changes per second, including direction. A car going 60 km/h eastward has speed 60 km/h (scalar) and velocity 60 km/h east (vector). Understanding this distinction is crucial: objects can have the same speed but different velocities if moving in different directions. Average speed uses total distance; average velocity uses net displacement.",

  "summary": "Speed measures how fast an object covers distance: speed = distance/time. It is a scalar quantity (magnitude only) that is always positive or zero. Units include m/s, km/h, cm/s. Average speed uses total distance and total time; instantaneous speed is speed at a specific moment. Velocity measures how fast position changes including direction: $v = \\Delta x / \\Delta t = (x_f - x_i)/(t_f - t_i)$. It is a vector quantity (magnitude and direction) that can be positive (moving in positive direction), negative (moving in negative direction), or zero (stationary). Average velocity uses displacement and time interval; instantaneous velocity is velocity at a specific moment. Key distinctions: Speed uses distance (scalar, always positive), velocity uses displacement (vector, can be negative). Speed = |velocity| (magnitude of velocity). For straight-line motion in one direction, average speed = |average velocity|. For paths with direction changes or round trips, average speed > |average velocity|. Objects with same speed but different directions have different velocities. In physics problems, velocity is typically more useful because it includes directional information necessary for predicting future motion. Converting between units: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h (multiply by 3.6 to convert m/s to km/h; divide by 3.6 to convert km/h to m/s). Formula rearrangements: from $v = d/t$, get $d = vt$ or $t = d/v$. From $v = \\Delta x / \\Delta t$, get $\\Delta x = v \\Delta t$ or $\\Delta t = \\Delta x / v$."
