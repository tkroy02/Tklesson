    "explanation": "These three quantities answer different questions about motion. Position answers 'where is it?' Displacement answers 'how far and which way from start to finish?' Distance answers 'how far did it travel along its path?' Understanding the distinctions is crucial: an object that travels in a circle and returns to its starting point has traveled a distance equal to the circle's circumference, but has zero displacement. Position and displacement use + and - signs to indicate direction; distance is always positive.",

  "summary": "Position is the location of an object relative to a chosen origin, specified by coordinates in a reference frame. In one-dimensional motion, position $x$ is a single coordinate with sign indicating direction from origin. Position can be positive, negative, or zero. Displacement is the change in position: $\\Delta x = x_f - x_i$ (final position minus initial position). Displacement is a vector—it has magnitude and direction indicated by + or - sign. Displacement depends only on initial and final positions, not on the path taken. Distance is the total length of the path actually traveled—a scalar quantity that is always positive or zero. Distance accounts for every part of the journey, regardless of direction. Key distinctions: Position tells where an object is. Displacement tells the straight-line change from start to finish. Distance tells total path length traveled. Distance equals |displacement| only for straight-line motion without reversal. In all other cases (curves, back-and-forth, round trips), distance > |displacement|. For round trips returning to start: displacement = 0, but distance = total journey length. Understanding all three quantities provides complete description of where objects are and how they've moved. Position and displacement use reference frames with sign conventions; distance is always positive and doesn't require direction specification."
