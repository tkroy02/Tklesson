    "principle": "Motion is the change in position of an object with respect to a reference point over time. To describe motion completely, we need to specify both where an object is and when it is there.",
    "explanation": "Motion is relative—an object's motion depends on the observer's reference frame. A person sitting in a moving car is stationary relative to the car but moving relative to the ground. Understanding motion requires defining a coordinate system (reference frame), measuring positions, tracking how position changes over time, and distinguishing between different types of motion (uniform, accelerated, one-dimensional, multi-dimensional). This section establishes the vocabulary and conceptual framework for all later work in kinematics.",

  "summary": "Motion is the change in position of an object over time, always described relative to a reference frame. A reference frame consists of an origin (where position = 0), coordinate axes (with positive/negative directions defined), and a time reference (when t = 0). Motion is relative—the same object can be moving or stationary depending on the observer's reference frame. Motion quantities are either scalars (magnitude only: distance, speed, time) or vectors (magnitude and direction: position, displacement, velocity, acceleration). In one-dimensional motion, vectors use + and - signs to indicate direction. Scalars are added with ordinary arithmetic, while vectors require considering direction—opposite directions subtract. To describe motion completely, specify: (1) position (where the object is), (2) displacement (change in position), (3) velocity (rate of position change with direction), and (4) acceleration (rate of velocity change). Establishing a clear reference frame with labeled origin, positive direction, and units is essential before analyzing any motion. Different reference frame choices are valid but some make calculations simpler. In Grade 9/10 physics, we focus primarily on one-dimensional motion along straight lines, where direction is indicated by sign (+ or -) rather than angles or compass directions."
