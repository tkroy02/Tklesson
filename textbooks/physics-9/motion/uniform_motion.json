Position changes at a constant rate. Mathematically, for uniform motion: $v = \\text{constant}$, $a = 0$, and $x = x_i + v\\Delta t$. This type of motion is idealized—perfect uniform motion rarely occurs in real life due to friction, air resistance, and other forces—but it's an excellent approximation for many situations (car on cruise control, train on straight track, object sliding on ice). Understanding uniform motion is essential because it's the simplest case and provides a baseline for understanding accelerated motion.",

  "summary": "Uniform motion is motion at constant velocity—constant speed in a straight line with zero acceleration. Characteristics: (1) velocity is constant ($v = \\text{constant}$), (2) acceleration is zero ($a = 0$), (3) motion is in straight line (no turns), (4) equal displacements occur in equal time intervals, (5) position changes at constant rate. The fundamental equation is $x = x_i + vt$ (or $x = x_i + v\\Delta t$), which gives position as a linear function of time. For uniform motion: displacement equals velocity times time ($\\Delta x = v\\Delta t$), and distance traveled equals magnitude of displacement (for motion without direction reversal). Graphically: position-time graph is straight line with slope = velocity; velocity-time graph is horizontal line at constant velocity value (slope = 0 indicating no acceleration); acceleration-time graph is horizontal line at zero. The slope of the $x$-$t$ graph directly gives velocity; area under the $v$-$t$ graph gives displacement. Uniform motion is the simplest case of motion and serves as important reference for understanding more complex accelerated motion. It's a good approximation for: cruise control on highway, train between stations, airplane at cruising altitude, object on ice. Not applicable when: speeding up, slowing down, turning (curved path), any acceleration present. Understanding uniform motion is essential because it's the foundation for analyzing all motion—accelerated motion is understood as departure from uniform motion. Many everyday situations approximate uniform motion well enough to use its simple equations for practical calculations."
