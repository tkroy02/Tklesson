    "principle": "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. It measures how quickly velocity increases, decreases, or changes direction. Mathematically: $a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{v_f - v_i}{\\Delta t}$",
    "explanation": "Just as velocity describes how position changes with time, acceleration describes how velocity changes with time. Acceleration is a vector quantity—it has both magnitude and direction. In one-dimensional motion, positive acceleration can mean speeding up (if moving in positive direction) or slowing down (if moving in negative direction). Negative acceleration similarly can mean slowing down or speeding up, depending on the direction of motion. Understanding acceleration is crucial because forces cause acceleration (Newton's Second Law), making acceleration the link between kinematics (describing motion) and dynamics (explaining motion).",

  "summary": "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity: $a = \\Delta v / \\Delta t = (v_f - v_i)/(t_f - t_i)$. It is a vector quantity that can be positive (acceleration in positive direction), negative (acceleration in negative direction), or zero (constant velocity). Units are m/s² (meters per second squared), meaning velocity change per second. Average acceleration uses change in velocity over a time interval; instantaneous acceleration is acceleration at a specific moment. For constant (uniform) acceleration, average and instantaneous accelerations are equal. Key principle: Whether acceleration causes speeding up or slowing down depends on the relative directions of velocity and acceleration. Same signs (both + or both -): speeding up. Opposite signs: slowing down. Four cases in 1D motion: (1) $v > 0, a > 0$: speed up forward, (2) $v > 0, a < 0$: slow down, (3) $v < 0, a < 0$: speed up backward, (4) $v > 0, a < 0$: slow down. For constant acceleration, final velocity can be calculated from $v_f = v_i + a\\Delta t$. This equation can be rearranged to find any unknown variable: $a = (v_f - v_i)/\\Delta t$, $\\Delta t = (v_f - v_i)/a$, $v_i = v_f - a\\Delta t$. Common accelerations: gravity ($g = 9.8$ m/s² downward), car acceleration ($2-5$ m/s²), braking ($-3$ to $-8$ m/s²). Understanding acceleration is fundamental to kinematics and essential for later study of forces (Newton's Second Law: $F = ma$). Zero acceleration means constant velocity (uniform motion)—an important special case."
