Students will learn to identify circular motion in everyday life and understand that even when speed is constant, direction is continuously changing—which means the object is accelerating.",

  "summary": "Circular motion is the movement of an object along a circular path, where the distance from the center (radius) remains constant. It appears everywhere in daily life—from cars on curved roads to planets orbiting the Sun. The key insight is that in circular motion, even if speed stays constant, direction is continuously changing. Since velocity includes both speed and direction, a changing direction means the velocity is changing, which means the object is accelerating. This is true even in uniform circular motion (constant speed). Non-uniform circular motion involves both changing speed and changing direction. Understanding these basics prepares us to study what causes circular motion—the center-seeking force called centripetal force in the next section."
