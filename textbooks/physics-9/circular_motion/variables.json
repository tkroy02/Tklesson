  "summary": "Circular motion is described by three key variables: radius (r)—the distance from the center; speed (v)—how fast the object moves along the circular path; and period (T)—the time to complete one full circle. These variables are connected by the circumference formula C = 2πr and the speed equation v = 2πr/T. This relationship allows us to calculate any variable if we know the other two. Understanding these relationships reveals important patterns: with constant period, speed increases with radius; with constant radius, speed increases as period decreases; with constant speed, larger radii require longer periods. By mastering these concepts and practicing unit conversions, students can solve a wide range of circular motion problems, preparing them for more advanced topics like centripetal force calculations."
