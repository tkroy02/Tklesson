    "explanation": "Newton's first law tells us objects naturally move in straight lines. To make an object go in a circle, something must constantly pull or push it toward the center. This center-directed force is called centripetal force—'centripetal' means 'center-seeking' in Latin.",

It's not a new type of force but a role that existing forces (tension, friction, gravity, normal force) can play. Centripetal force is necessary because of Newton's first law—objects naturally move in straight lines, so something must constantly pull them inward to create circular motion. The feeling of being 'thrown outward' in circular motion is not an outward force but your body's inertia resisting the inward pull. Understanding centripetal force helps explain everything from cars turning corners to planets orbiting the Sun, and prepares us for studying how radius, speed, and period affect circular motion in the next section."
