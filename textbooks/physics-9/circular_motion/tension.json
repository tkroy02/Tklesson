  "summary": "Tension in strings, ropes, and cables provides centripetal force for objects moving in circular paths. The tension required is given by T = mv²/r for horizontal circles, where it depends directly on mass and the square of speed, and inversely on radius. This means faster speeds, heavier objects, and tighter circles all require more tension. Every string has a maximum tension it can withstand—exceed it and the string breaks, sending the object off tangent to the circle. In horizontal circles (swinging parallel to ground), tension alone provides centripetal force. Vertical circles are more complex because gravity affects both speed and tension throughout the rotation. Understanding tension helps explain everything from playground swings and tetherball to hammer throw and amusement park rides. The outward pull you feel when swinging an object is the reaction force (Newton's third law), not a force acting on the object itself. This foundation prepares us for exploring vertical circular motion in detail in the next section."
