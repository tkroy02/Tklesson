    "explanation": "When a car turns, it's not magic that makes it curve—it's friction. The tires push sideways against the road, and the road pushes back (friction) toward the center of the turn. This inward friction force is the centripetal force that bends the car's path into a curve.",

  "summary": "Friction is the primary source of centripetal force for vehicles turning on flat roads. Static friction between tires and road pulls vehicles inward, allowing them to follow curved paths. The maximum safe speed for a curve depends on the radius and the coefficient of friction according to v_max = √(μgr)—notice that mass cancels out, meaning cars and trucks have the same theoretical speed limit on a given curve. When required centripetal force exceeds available friction, vehicles lose control through understeer (front slides wide), oversteer (rear swings out), or hydroplaning (tires ride on water). Engineers use banked curves to reduce reliance on friction by having the normal force provide some centripetal force. Understanding these concepts helps drivers make safer decisions and explains why speed limits change with road conditions. This foundation prepares us for exploring how tension provides centripetal force in situations like balls on strings and amusement park rides."
