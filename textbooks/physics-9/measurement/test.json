    "principle": "The chapter test synthesizes all measurement skills and concepts from Unit 2, requiring both recall of fundamental principles and application to solve problems independently.",
    "explanation": "This assessment moves beyond guided practice to independent demonstration of measurement competency. Success requires solid understanding of the metric system's structure, facility with unit conversions (remembering to square for area, cube for volume), ability to use dimensional analysis for error checking, and practical problem-solving with formulas for area, volume, density, and temperature. The test emphasizes not just getting correct numerical answers, but showing proper work with units, applying concepts correctly, and checking reasonableness of results.",

(B) Unit conversions—demonstrating facility with length (km ↔ m ↔ cm ↔ mm), area (remembering to square conversion factors), volume (remembering to cube factors, 1 L = 1000 cm³, 1 m³ = 1000 L), derived units (speed: m/s ↔ km/h), and temperature (K ↔ °C ↔ °F). (C) Formula-based calculations—applying area formulas (rectangle A = lw, circle A = πr²), volume formulas (cylinder V = πr²h), and density relationships (ρ = m/V, rearranged as m = ρV or V = m/ρ). (D) Multi-step applications—integrating concepts to solve realistic problems involving pools, buoyancy, speeds, and material identification. (E) Dimensional analysis—checking equation validity and deriving units from formulas. Success requires not just computational accuracy but conceptual understanding (why methods work), proper unit management (tracking units through calculations, converting appropriately), and verification (checking reasonableness, dimensional consistency). The test mirrors real physics work where measurement skills form the foundation for more advanced topics."
