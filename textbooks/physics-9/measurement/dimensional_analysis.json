    "principle": "Dimensional analysis uses the fact that valid physical equations must be dimensionally consistent—both sides must have the same dimensions. This principle allows us to check equations, find errors, and even derive formulas.",
    "explanation": "Every physical quantity has dimensions built from fundamental dimensions like length [L], mass [M], and time [T]. In any correct equation, the dimensions on both sides must match exactly. This provides a powerful error-checking tool and problem-solving method. Dimensional analysis can't give you numerical coefficients (like the ½ in KE = ½mv²), but it can reveal the structure of physical relationships.",

  "summary": "Dimensional analysis is a powerful technique that uses the dimensions of physical quantities to check equations, derive relationships, and solve problems. Every mechanical quantity has dimensions built from three fundamental dimensions: length [L], mass [M], and time [T]. For example, velocity has dimensions [LT⁻¹], force has [MLT⁻²], and energy has [ML²T⁻²]. The principle of dimensional consistency requires that valid equations have matching dimensions on both sides—this provides an essential error-checking tool. Quantities can only be added or subtracted if they have the same dimensions, but can be multiplied or divided freely. Dimensional analysis can reveal the functional form of relationships (like T ∝ √(L/g) for a pendulum) but cannot determine dimensionless numerical coefficients (like the 2π). Its limitations include inability to find numerical constants, inability to prove equations correct (only that they might be correct), and restriction to power-law relationships. Despite these limitations, dimensional analysis is invaluable for checking calculations, understanding formulas, converting units, and estimating how quantities scale with changing parameters. Always check dimensions in your work—if dimensions don't match, you've definitely made an error somewhere."
