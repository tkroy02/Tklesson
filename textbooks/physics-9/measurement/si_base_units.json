  "summary": "The SI system is built on seven base units that measure fundamental physical quantities: meter (m) for length, kilogram (kg) for mass, second (s) for time, ampere (A) for electric current, kelvin (K) for temperature, mole (mol) for amount of substance, and candela (cd) for luminous intensity. These units are defined independently using fundamental constants of nature, making them reproducible anywhere with precision. In Grade 9/10 physics, you'll work primarily with meter, kilogram, second, ampere, and kelvin. Base units are the building blocks—all other measurements (derived units) are combinations of these seven through multiplication, division, or powers. For example, speed (m/s) combines meter and second; force (kg·m/s²) combines kilogram, meter, and second. Understanding base units is essential for dimensional analysis, error checking, unit conversion, and comprehending physical relationships. Every physics formula ultimately expresses relationships between these fundamental quantities, making base units the foundation of all scientific measurement."
