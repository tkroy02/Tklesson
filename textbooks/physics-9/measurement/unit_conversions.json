Conversion factors are ratios equal to 1 (like 1000 m/1 km = 1) that allow us to change units while preserving the actual measurement. Understanding conversion is crucial because physics problems often provide data in mixed units that must be standardized before calculations.",

  "summary": "Unit conversion is the process of expressing a measurement in different units while preserving the physical quantity. Conversion factors are ratios equal to 1 (like 1000 m/1 km) that change units without changing the actual measurement. Within the metric system, conversions involve powers of 10 based on prefix relationships: kilo- (1000), centi- (0.01), milli- (0.001), etc. Converting from larger to smaller units increases the numerical value (multiply); converting from smaller to larger decreases it (divide). For derived units like speed (m/s), area (m²), or density (kg/m³), convert each component separately, remembering to square or cube conversion factors when dealing with exponents. The conversion process: identify starting and target units, find the relationship, set up the conversion factor so unwanted units cancel, calculate, and check reasonableness. Common mistakes include forgetting to square/cube factors for area/volume, inverting conversion factors, and not converting all components of derived units. Always check that units cancel properly and the final answer makes physical sense. Mastering unit conversion is essential because physics problems often provide mixed units that must be standardized before calculations can proceed."
