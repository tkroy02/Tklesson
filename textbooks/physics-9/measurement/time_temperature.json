    "explanation": "Time is one of the seven SI base quantities, with the second as its base unit. It's unique because it flows in only one direction and cannot be directly controlled like other quantities. Temperature is also a base quantity, measured in Kelvin (K) in SI, though Celsius (°C) is commonly used. Unlike length or mass which measure 'how much,' temperature measures 'how hot' or 'how energetically particles are moving.' Understanding both is essential for describing motion, energy transfer, thermodynamics, and countless physical processes.",

  "summary": "Time is the measure of duration and the ordering of events, with dimension [T] and SI base unit second (s), defined by atomic oscillations. Common time units include millisecond (10⁻³ s), second, minute (60 s), hour (3600 s), and year (≈3.156 × 10⁷ s). Unlike spatial measurements, time flows in one direction and cannot be controlled. Period is time per cycle; frequency is cycles per time (f = 1/T). Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles and determines heat flow direction, with SI base unit Kelvin (K). Three temperature scales are common: Kelvin (starts at absolute zero: 0 K = -273.15°C), Celsius (water freezes at 0°C, boils at 100°C), and Fahrenheit (water freezes at 32°F, boils at 212°F). Key conversions: K = °C + 273.15, °F = (9/5)°C + 32, °C = (5/9)(°F - 32). Temperature changes are equal in Celsius and Kelvin (ΔT in °C = ΔT in K) because they have the same degree size. Temperature is intensive (doesn't depend on amount), while thermal energy is extensive (does depend on amount). Heat flows spontaneously from higher to lower temperature until thermal equilibrium is reached. Understanding the distinction between temperature (intensity measure) and heat (energy transfer) is crucial. Both time and temperature are fundamental to physics, appearing in equations for motion, thermodynamics, oscillations, and countless physical processes."
