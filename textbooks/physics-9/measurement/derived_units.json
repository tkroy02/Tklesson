    "explanation": "While base units measure fundamental quantities like length, mass, and time, most quantities in physics are defined by relationships between these fundamentals. Derived units express these relationships mathematically. For example, speed is defined as distance divided by time, so its unit (m/s) is derived by dividing the meter by the second. Understanding how derived units are built helps you understand the physics behind the measurements.",

  "summary": "Derived units are formed by combining SI base units through multiplication, division, or exponentiation according to the physical relationships that define quantities. Common derived units without special names include area (m²), volume (m³), speed (m/s), acceleration (m/s²), and density (kg/m³). Many frequently-used derived units have special names: Newton (N = kg·m/s²) for force, Joule (J = kg·m²/s²) for energy, Watt (W = kg·m²/s³) for power, Pascal (Pa = kg/(m·s²)) for pressure, and Hertz (Hz = s⁻¹) for frequency. Derived units reflect the mathematical definitions of physical quantities—if you know the defining equation, you can determine the units. This makes derived units powerful tools for checking work through dimensional analysis: valid equations must have matching units on both sides. Understanding how derived units are constructed from base units helps you remember formulas, check calculations, and understand the relationships between physical quantities. All measurements in physics ultimately reduce to combinations of the seven SI base units, creating a coherent, universal system for scientific communication."
