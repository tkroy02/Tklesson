  "summary": "The metric system (SI) is a decimal-based, internationally standardized measurement system built on powers of ten. Developed in France in the 1790s, it's now used by scientists worldwide and is the official system in nearly every country. Its key advantages include: easy conversions (all by factors of 10, 100, 1000), consistent prefixes that work with any unit (kilo- always means ×1000, milli- always means ×0.001), no arbitrary conversion factors to memorize, and coherent derived units that work seamlessly in calculations. Common prefixes include kilo- (10³), centi- (10⁻²), milli- (10⁻³), micro- (10⁻⁶), and nano- (10⁻⁹). In physics, we use meters for length, kilograms for mass, liters for volume, seconds for time, and Celsius or Kelvin for temperature. The metric system's simplicity, universality, and scientific basis make it essential for physics and all scientific work."
