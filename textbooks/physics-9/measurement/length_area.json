  "summary": "Length is the fundamental one-dimensional measurement of spatial extent, with the meter (m) as the SI base unit and dimension [L]. Common length units include nanometer (10⁻⁹ m), micrometer (10⁻⁶ m), millimeter (10⁻³ m), centimeter (10⁻² m), meter, and kilometer (10³ m). Measuring instruments range from rulers (±1 mm precision) to micrometers (±0.01 mm) to laser interferometers (nanometer precision). Area measures two-dimensional surface extent, with dimension [L²] and SI unit of square meter (m²). Common area units include mm², cm², m², and km². Area formulas depend on shape: rectangle (A = l × w), square (A = s²), triangle (A = ½bh), circle (A = πr²). The critical concept in area conversion is that conversion factors must be squared: 1 m = 100 cm, therefore 1 m² = (100)² cm² = 10,000 cm², NOT 100 cm². This is because area is two-dimensional—a 1 m × 1 m square contains 100 × 100 = 10,000 cm² squares. Choose appropriate units for the scale being measured, read instruments to their precision limit, and always estimate before measuring to catch major errors. Length and area appear throughout physics in distance, wavelength, pressure (force/area), and countless other applications."
