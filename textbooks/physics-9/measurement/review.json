    "explanation": "This section brings together all the measurement topics: the metric system's decimal structure, SI base and derived units, conversion techniques, dimensional analysis for error checking, and practical measurements of physical quantities. Success requires understanding both the underlying concepts (why we use SI units, what dimensions mean) and the procedural skills (how to convert units, calculate density, use formulas). The questions progress from basic recall to application and analysis, mirroring how measurement skills are used in real physics problems.",

  "summary": "Chapter 2 review questions integrate all measurement topics: the metric system's advantages (decimal basis, universal use, consistent prefixes), SI base units (meter, kilogram, second, Kelvin) versus derived units (m², m³, m/s, kg/m³, N, J), unit conversion techniques (conversion factors, squaring for area, cubing for volume), dimensional analysis for error checking (dimensions must match on both sides of equations), and practical measurements (area = length × width for rectangles, A = πr² for circles; volume = l × w × h for boxes, V = πr²h for cylinders, V = 4πr³/3 for spheres; density ρ = m/V for material properties). Temperature conversions use K = °C + 273.15, °F = (9/5)°C + 32, with temperature changes equal in Celsius and Kelvin (ΔT in °C = ΔT in K). Problem-solving requires understanding concepts (why metric system works, difference between temperature and heat, density as characteristic property), procedural skills (converting units, calculating area/volume/density), and integration (multi-step problems combining several concepts). Success depends on both conceptual understanding and computational facility, always checking units and reasonableness of answers."
