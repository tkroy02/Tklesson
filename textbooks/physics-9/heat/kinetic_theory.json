  "summary": "The kinetic theory of matter explains the behavior of solids, liquids, and gases in terms of the motion of their constituent particles. The theory rests on four postulates: (1) all matter is made of tiny particles, (2) these particles are in constant random motion, (3) particles collide elastically with each other and container walls, and (4) the average kinetic energy of particles is proportional to absolute temperature. Solids have strong intermolecular forces holding particles in fixed positions, allowing only vibration. Liquids have weaker forces, allowing particles to slide past each other while remaining close. Gases have very weak forces, with particles moving rapidly and independently. Brownian motion—the random jittering of microscopic particles—provides direct evidence for kinetic theory. Temperature measures average particle kinetic energy, explaining why lighter gases move faster than heavier ones at the same temperature. Gas pressure results from countless molecular collisions with container walls. Kinetic theory explains all gas laws: Boyle's law (pressure ∝ 1/volume at constant temperature), Charles's law (volume ∝ temperature at constant pressure), and Gay-Lussac's law (pressure ∝ temperature at constant volume). Diffusion (mixing of substances) and effusion (escape through small holes) are also explained by random molecular motion, with lighter gases diffusing faster (Graham's law). Understanding kinetic theory connects microscopic particle behavior to macroscopic observations and prepares us for exploring heat engines in the next section, where these principles are applied to convert thermal energy into useful work."
