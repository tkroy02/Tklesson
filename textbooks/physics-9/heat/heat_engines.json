Students will learn how heat engines operate, the principles of the Carnot cycle, how to calculate efficiency, and explore real-world examples including steam engines, internal combustion engines, and power plants. The section also addresses why no heat engine can be 100% efficient.",

    "principle": "A heat engine absorbs thermal energy from a hot reservoir, converts some of it to useful work, and rejects the remaining energy to a cold reservoir, with efficiency limited by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.",
    "explanation": "Every heat engine—from a steam locomotive to a car engine to a power plant—operates on the same basic principle: take heat from a high-temperature source, use some of it to do work, and dump the rest into a low-temperature sink. The Second Law ensures that some energy must always be wasted; 100% efficiency is impossible.",

  "summary": "A heat engine is a device that converts thermal energy into mechanical work by operating in a cycle between a high-temperature reservoir and a low-temperature reservoir. Every heat engine absorbs heat ($Q_H$) from a hot source, converts some to work ($W$), and rejects the remaining heat ($Q_C$) to a cold sink. Thermal efficiency is $e = W/Q_H = 1 - Q_C/Q_H$, always less than 100% because the Second Law requires waste heat. The maximum possible efficiency for any engine operating between temperatures $T_H$ and $T_C$ is the Carnot efficiency: $e_{Carnot} = 1 - T_C/T_H$ (temperatures in Kelvin). Higher $T_H$ and lower $T_C$ increase this limit. Real engines have lower efficiencies due to friction, heat loss, incomplete combustion, and other irreversibilities. Heat engines fall into two main categories: external combustion (fuel burned outside the engine, like steam engines) and internal combustion (fuel burned inside cylinders, like gasoline and diesel engines). The four-stroke gasoline engine operates through intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes. Power plants use heat engines (usually steam turbines) to generate electricity, with efficiencies ranging from 30-40% for traditional plants to 60% for modern combined-cycle plants. Waste heat can sometimes be captured for heating (cogeneration). Understanding heat engines connects thermodynamics to real-world technology and prepares us for the review questions and chapter test, where these concepts will be applied and assessed."
