  "summary": "Temperature and thermal energy are related but distinct concepts in physics. Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance—how fast they're moving on average. Thermal energy (or internal energy) measures the total kinetic energy of all particles combined—the sum of all their motion energy. This means that a small object at high temperature can have less thermal energy than a large object at lower temperature. Temperature is measured using scales: Celsius (water freezes at 0°, boils at 100°), Fahrenheit (freezes at 32°, boils at 212°), and Kelvin (scientific scale starting at absolute zero, 0 K = -273°C). Thermometers work by exploiting properties that change with temperature: liquid expansion, electrical resistance, infrared radiation, or differential expansion of metals. Absolute zero (0 K) is the theoretical minimum temperature where particle motion would stop—it's unattainable in practice but scientists can get extremely close. Understanding the difference between temperature and thermal energy explains everyday phenomena: why metal feels colder than wood at the same temperature, why hot water bottles stay warm all night, and why a candle flame can be briefly touched but a hot pan cannot. This foundation prepares us for exploring heat transfer, specific heat capacity, and the laws of thermodynamics in subsequent sections."
