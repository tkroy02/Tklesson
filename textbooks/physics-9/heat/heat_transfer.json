Students will learn about specific heat capacity—a material property that determines how much energy is needed to change a substance's temperature—and practice calculations using the heat transfer equation $Q = mc\\Delta T$.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from a hotter object to a colder object, and specific heat capacity measures how much energy is required to change the temperature of a given mass of a substance.",
    "explanation": "When you touch a hot stove, thermal energy transfers to your hand—that transfer is heat. Different materials require different amounts of energy to change temperature: water needs lots of energy to warm up (high specific heat), while metal needs very little (low specific heat). This explains why water heats slowly but cools slowly, and why metal heats quickly but burns you immediately.",

  "summary": "Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between objects due to temperature difference, measured in joules (J). It flows spontaneously from hotter to colder objects until thermal equilibrium is reached. Specific heat capacity (c) is a material property that determines how much energy is required to change the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1°C. Water has a very high specific heat (4,180 J/kg°C), while metals have low specific heat (385-900 J/kg°C). The heat transfer equation $Q = mc\\Delta T$ allows calculation of energy transferred during temperature changes, with positive Q for energy added and negative Q for energy removed. When objects at different temperatures are placed together, heat lost by warmer objects equals heat gained by cooler objects (conservation of energy), enabling calculation of final equilibrium temperatures. Understanding specific heat explains everyday phenomena: why oceans moderate climate, why sand gets hotter than water at the beach, why metal heats and cools quickly, and why water is used in car radiators and hot water bottles. This foundation prepares us for exploring the three methods of heat transfer—conduction, convection, and radiation—in the next section."
