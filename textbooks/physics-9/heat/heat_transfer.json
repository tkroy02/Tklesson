When you feel the sun's warmth on your face, that's radiation—traveling through the vacuum of space. Each method transfers thermal energy differently and is important in different situations.",

  "summary": "Heat transfers through three distinct mechanisms. Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy through direct particle collisions, occurring best in solids where particles are closely packed. Materials with high thermal conductivity (like metals) transfer heat quickly; insulators (like wood and plastic) transfer heat slowly. Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of fluids (liquids and gases), driven by density differences—warm fluid rises, cool fluid sinks, creating convection currents. Natural convection occurs without external forces; forced convection uses fans or pumps. Radiation is the transfer of heat by electromagnetic waves (primarily infrared), requiring no medium—it can travel through vacuum. All objects emit radiation based on their temperature. Dark, matte surfaces are good absorbers and emitters; light, shiny surfaces are good reflectors. Most real-world situations involve multiple methods simultaneously. Understanding heat transfer explains everyday phenomena: why metal feels cold (conducts heat from your hand), why hot air rises (convection), why the Sun warms Earth (radiation), and how vacuum flasks keep drinks hot or cold by minimizing all three methods. This knowledge is essential for applications from building insulation to spacecraft design, and prepares us for exploring phase changes in the next section."
