Students will learn why materials expand when heated, how different materials expand at different rates, and the practical importance of accounting for thermal expansion in bridges, railways, thermometers, and household situations.",

    "principle": "Most materials expand when heated and contract when cooled because increased particle kinetic energy causes them to move apart against intermolecular forces.",
    "explanation": "When you heat a material, its particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate more vigorously. This increased motion pushes neighboring particles farther apart, causing the material to expand. Cooling reduces particle motion, allowing them to move closer together, causing contraction.",

  "summary": "Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change size with temperature. When heated, particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate more, pushing each other farther apart. When cooled, they vibrate less and move closer together. The amount of expansion depends on the material (its coefficient of thermal expansion), the original size, and the temperature change. Linear expansion follows $\\Delta L = \\alpha L_0 \\Delta T$, where $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion. For area and volume, coefficients are approximately $2\\alpha$ and $3\\alpha$ respectively for solids. Different materials expand at different rates: aluminum expands significantly, glass expands little, and invar (a special alloy) expands almost not at all. Water has an unusual property: it is most dense at 4°C and expands as it cools further to 0°C, and ice is less dense than liquid water—which is why ice floats and lakes freeze from the top down, protecting aquatic life. Thermal expansion must be accounted for in engineering: bridges have expansion joints, railroad tracks have gaps, pipelines have expansion loops, and buildings incorporate movement allowances. Thermal expansion is also used in devices: liquid thermometers use expansion of alcohol or mercury, bimetallic strips use differential expansion to control thermostats and flashers, and the jar lid trick uses differential expansion to loosen tight lids. Understanding thermal expansion is essential for designing structures that survive temperature changes and for creating temperature-sensing devices. This foundation prepares us for exploring the kinetic theory of matter in the next section, which explains the particle-level reasons for these behaviors."
