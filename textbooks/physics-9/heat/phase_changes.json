Students will learn about melting, freezing, vaporization, condensation, sublimation, and deposition, and discover why temperature remains constant during phase changes despite continuous energy transfer. The concept of latent heat is introduced to explain this phenomenon.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "During a phase change, energy is absorbed or released without changing temperature, as this energy breaks or forms intermolecular bonds rather than increasing particle kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "When ice melts, it absorbs energy but stays at 0°C until completely melted. This energy doesn't make the molecules move faster—it breaks the bonds holding them in solid formation. Similarly, when water boils, energy goes into separating molecules into gas, not raising temperature. This hidden energy is called latent heat.",

  "summary": "Phase changes are transitions between solid, liquid, and gas states. The six phase changes are melting (solid→liquid), freezing (liquid→solid), vaporization (liquid→gas), condensation (gas→liquid), sublimation (solid→gas), and deposition (gas→solid). During a phase change, temperature remains constant because added or removed energy goes into breaking or forming intermolecular bonds rather than changing particle kinetic energy. This energy is called latent heat: latent heat of fusion ($L_f$) for melting/freezing, and latent heat of vaporization ($L_v$) for vaporization/condensation. For water, $L_f = 3.34 \\times 10^5$ J/kg and $L_v = 2.26 \\times 10^6$ J/kg—the energy to vaporize water is nearly seven times greater than to melt it. The formula $Q = mL$ calculates energy transferred during phase changes. Latent heat has important practical consequences: steam burns are severe because steam releases its latent heat upon condensation; ice keeps drinks cold by absorbing energy while melting; sweating cools the body through evaporation; and refrigeration cycles use latent heat to transfer thermal energy. Phase diagrams show how pressure affects phase transitions—lower pressure lowers boiling point (explaining why cooking takes longer at high altitudes), while higher pressure raises boiling point (as in pressure cookers). Understanding phase changes connects particle theory to everyday phenomena and prepares us for exploring the laws of thermodynamics in the next section."
