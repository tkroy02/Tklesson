  "expanded_description": "Newton's First Law of Motion, also called the Law of Inertia, describes what happens when no net force acts on an object. It fundamentally changes our understanding of motion by establishing that forces cause changes in motion, not motion itself.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Newton's First Law states: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity (same speed and direction), unless acted upon by a net external force. This law defines inertia—the tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion.",
    "explanation": "Before Newton, people believed that force was required to maintain motion—that objects naturally slow down and stop without continuous pushing. Aristotle's view seemed correct from everyday experience: push a book across a table and it stops when you stop pushing. Newton's insight was revolutionary: objects don't naturally stop—friction stops them. Without friction (imagine ice or space), objects continue moving at constant velocity forever without any force. This is inertia. The First Law has two parts: (1) Objects at rest remain at rest unless a net force acts. A book on a table stays put until pushed. (2) Objects in motion continue at constant velocity (same speed and direction) unless a net force acts. A hockey puck sliding on ice continues at nearly constant velocity because friction is very small. The key phrase is 'net force'—if all forces balance (net force = zero), the object maintains its current state: rest stays rest, constant velocity motion continues unchanged. Only unbalanced forces (net force ≠ zero) cause acceleration. Understanding the First Law is crucial because it establishes the concept of inertial reference frames, explains why we need seat belts (our bodies want to continue at constant velocity when car suddenly stops), and forms the foundation for Newton's other laws.",

  "summary": "Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia) states: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues moving with constant velocity (constant speed in straight line), unless acted upon by a net external force. Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in motion—the property that makes objects maintain their current state (rest or constant velocity). Mass measures inertia: greater mass = greater inertia = greater resistance to acceleration. The First Law applies when net force is zero, which occurs when: (1) no forces act, or (2) forces present but balanced (vector sum = 0). Key insight: forces cause changes in motion (acceleration), not motion itself. Constant velocity (including v = 0 as special case) is natural state requiring no net force. Objects slow down in everyday life because friction opposes motion, not because motion naturally ceases. Everyday inertia examples: difficulty starting heavy objects moving, difficulty stopping moving objects, lurching forward when car brakes (body's inertia maintains velocity while car decelerates), feeling pushed backward when car accelerates (body's inertia resists acceleration), seat belts needed because passengers continue at crash velocity when car stops. Inertial reference frames are frames where First Law holds—no spontaneous acceleration, only real forces present (examples: ground, constant-velocity train). Non-inertial frames are accelerating frames where First Law appears violated and fictitious forces arise (examples: accelerating car, rotating platform). Historical development: Aristotle incorrectly believed force required for motion. Galileo's inclined plane experiments and thought experiments revealed objects continue moving without force if no friction. Newton formalized this as First Law in 1687, revolutionizing physics and enabling quantitative predictions. The First Law is foundational: defines inertial frames, explains everyday motion phenomena, introduces inertia concept, prepares for Second Law (quantifying force-acceleration relationship) and Third Law (force interactions)."
