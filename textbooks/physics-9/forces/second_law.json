  "expanded_description": "Newton's Second Law is the cornerstone of dynamics, quantifying the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. It provides the mathematical framework for predicting motion from forces and understanding how objects respond to applied forces.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Newton's Second Law states: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically: $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$ or $\\vec{a} = \\frac{\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}$. This law quantifies how forces cause acceleration and how mass affects an object's response to forces.",
    "explanation": "The Second Law is the most practically useful of Newton's three laws because it allows quantitative predictions. It tells us: (1) Net force and acceleration are directly proportional—double the net force, double the acceleration (if mass constant). (2) Mass and acceleration are inversely proportional—double the mass, half the acceleration (if net force constant). (3) Acceleration direction always matches net force direction. The equation $F_{\\text{net}} = ma$ connects three fundamental quantities: force (measured in newtons), mass (measured in kilograms), and acceleration (measured in m/s²). This relationship defines the newton: 1 N is the force that accelerates 1 kg at 1 m/s². The Second Law encompasses the First Law as a special case: when $F_{\\text{net}} = 0$, then $a = 0$ (constant velocity). It explains everyday phenomena: why pushing harder makes objects accelerate faster, why heavier objects are harder to accelerate, why the same force produces different effects on different masses. Understanding the Second Law is essential for solving dynamics problems: given forces and mass, calculate acceleration; given mass and acceleration, calculate required force; given force and acceleration, calculate mass. This law forms the foundation for analyzing all motion caused by forces.",

  "summary": "Newton's Second Law states: $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$ or equivalently $\\vec{a} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{net}}/m$. The law quantifies the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration: (1) Acceleration is directly proportional to net force—double force produces double acceleration (if mass constant). (2) Acceleration is inversely proportional to mass—double mass produces half acceleration (if net force constant). (3) Acceleration direction always matches net force direction. The equation connects three fundamental quantities: net force $F_{\\text{net}}$ (newtons, N), mass $m$ (kilograms, kg), and acceleration $a$ (m/s²). This relationship defines the newton: 1 N is force that accelerates 1 kg at 1 m/s², or 1 N = 1 kg⋅m/s². Problem-solving strategy: (1) identify all forces and draw diagram, (2) choose coordinate system and sign convention, (3) calculate net force (sum all forces with signs), (4) apply $F_{\\text{net}} = ma$ rearranged as needed, (5) check units and reasonableness. The First Law is special case of Second Law where $F_{\\text{net}} = 0$ gives $a = 0$ (constant velocity). The Second Law is more general, handling both balanced forces (no acceleration) and unbalanced forces (acceleration). Mass vs weight distinction: Mass is intrinsic measure of inertia (kg), same everywhere. Weight is gravitational force $W = mg$ (N), varies with gravitational field strength $g$. On Earth $g = 9.8$ m/s²; on Moon $g = 1.6$ m/s²; in space $g \\approx 0$. Same mass has different weights in different gravitational fields. Free fall: when weight is only force, $F_{\\text{net}} = mg$ so $a = mg/m = g$, explaining why all objects fall at same rate regardless of mass. Applications: vehicle acceleration (engine force and mass determine performance), braking (heavier vehicles need more force for same deceleration), safety systems (airbags extend stopping time to reduce force), sports (force application and mass determine athletic performance), space exploration (thrust and spacecraft mass govern trajectory changes). The Second Law is cornerstone of dynamics, enabling quantitative prediction of motion from forces and forming foundation for analyzing all accelerated motion."
