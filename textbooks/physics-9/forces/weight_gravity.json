  "expanded_description": "Weight is the gravitational force exerted on an object by a massive body like Earth. Understanding weight, how it differs from mass, and how it relates to gravitational acceleration is essential for analyzing motion and forces in physics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object, calculated as $W = mg$ where $m$ is mass (kg) and $g$ is gravitational field strength or acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s² on Earth's surface). Weight is a force measured in newtons (N), while mass is the amount of matter measured in kilograms (kg). Weight varies with location (different $g$ values), but mass remains constant everywhere.",
    "explanation": "Weight and mass are fundamentally different but related concepts. Mass is an intrinsic property of matter—the quantity of material in an object and its resistance to acceleration (inertia). Mass is the same whether you're on Earth, the Moon, or in deep space. Weight is the gravitational force acting on that mass. On Earth, weight = $mg$ where $g = 9.8$ m/s². On the Moon, $g = 1.6$ m/s², so the same mass weighs much less. In space far from any massive body, $g \\approx 0$, so weight ≈ 0 (weightlessness), but mass unchanged. Key points: (1) Weight is a force (vector), measured in newtons. Mass is a scalar, measured in kilograms. (2) Weight depends on location ($g$ varies). Mass is constant everywhere. (3) Weight always points toward the center of the massive body (downward on Earth). (4) At Earth's surface, $g = 9.8$ m/s² ≈ 10 m/s² (often approximated for easier calculations). (5) The value of $g$ is both the gravitational field strength (N/kg) and the free-fall acceleration (m/s²)—numerically the same. (6) Normal force often equals weight for objects at rest on horizontal surfaces, but they are different forces (normal from surface, weight from Earth). Weight causes numerous effects: objects fall when dropped, require support forces to remain stationary, create compression in structures, determine how hard objects are to lift. Understanding weight is crucial for analyzing forces in statics (objects at rest) and dynamics (falling objects, objects on scales, apparent weight in accelerating reference frames).",

  "summary": "Weight is the gravitational force acting on an object: $W = mg$ where $m$ is mass (kg) and $g$ is gravitational field strength (N/kg or m/s²). On Earth's surface, $g = 9.8$ m/s² (often approximated as 10 m/s²). Weight is a force measured in newtons (N), always pointing toward Earth's center (downward at surface). Mass vs weight distinctions: Mass is amount of matter (kg), constant everywhere, scalar, measures inertia. Weight is gravitational force (N), varies with location ($g$ changes), vector pointing toward massive body, measures gravitational pull. Same mass has different weights on Earth (strong $g$), Moon (weak $g$), space (nearly zero $g$). Gravitational field strength $g$ has dual interpretation: (1) Force per unit mass (N/kg)—each kilogram experiences 9.8 N force on Earth. (2) Free-fall acceleration (m/s²)—all objects accelerate at 9.8 m/s² when falling. Numerically identical: 9.8 N/kg = 9.8 m/s². All objects fall at same rate regardless of mass because in free fall: $F = mg$ and $F = ma$ give $mg = ma$, so $a = g$ (mass cancels). Heavier objects have more weight but also more inertia—effects exactly cancel. Weight and normal force relationship: Weight is gravitational force from Earth (always downward, magnitude $mg$). Normal force is contact force from surface (perpendicular to surface, magnitude adjusts). For object at rest on horizontal surface: $F_N = W$ (equal magnitudes), but they're different forces from different sources, both acting on same object—NOT action-reaction pair. On inclines or with acceleration: $F_N \\neq W$. Apparent weight is what we feel—actually normal force, not gravitational force. In accelerating elevator upward: $F_N = W + ma$ (feel heavier). Accelerating downward: $F_N = W - ma$ (feel lighter). Free fall: $F_N = 0$ (weightless), even though gravity still acts. Astronauts in orbit feel weightless not because gravity absent (gravity keeps them in orbit), but because they're in continuous free fall—no normal force. Understanding weight essential for analyzing forces in statics (objects at rest), dynamics (falling objects, scales, elevators), and distinguishing actual weight (gravitational force, constant) from apparent weight (normal force, varies with acceleration)."
