  "expanded_description": "Net force is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object. It determines whether and how the object accelerates. Understanding how to calculate and interpret net force is essential for applying Newton's laws and predicting motion.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The net force (also called resultant force or total force) is the single force that has the same effect as all the individual forces acting on an object combined. Mathematically, net force is the vector sum of all forces: $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\sum \\vec{F} = \\vec{F}_1 + \\vec{F}_2 + \\vec{F}_3 + ...$. The net force determines acceleration according to Newton's Second Law.",
    "explanation": "Objects rarely experience just one force—usually multiple forces act simultaneously. A book on a table experiences gravity (downward) and normal force (upward). A sliding block experiences applied force (forward), friction (backward), gravity (down), and normal force (up). To predict motion, we must combine all forces into a single net force. Since forces are vectors, we add them using vector addition: forces in the same direction add, forces in opposite directions subtract. The net force is what actually matters for motion—if you push a box with 50 N but friction opposes with 20 N, the box responds to the net 30 N forward force, not to the individual forces separately. Three scenarios arise: (1) Net force = 0 (balanced forces): no acceleration, constant velocity (Newton's First Law). (2) Net force ≠ 0 in one direction (unbalanced forces): acceleration in that direction (Newton's Second Law). (3) Net force ≠ 0 changing direction: acceleration changes direction. Understanding net force connects force analysis to motion prediction, bridging Newton's laws with kinematics.",

  "summary": "Net force (also called resultant force) is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object: $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\sum \\vec{F} = \\vec{F}_1 + \\vec{F}_2 + ...$. The net force determines acceleration according to Newton's laws. In one dimension, calculate net force by choosing a positive direction, adding forces in positive direction, subtracting forces in negative direction: $F_{\\text{net}} = F_{\\text{positive}} - F_{\\text{negative}}$. Sign of result indicates direction: positive = positive direction, negative = negative direction, zero = no net force. Balanced forces occur when net force = 0 (forces cancel out). Results: no acceleration, constant velocity (including rest as special case), First Law applies. Examples: object at rest on table (normal = weight), object sliding at constant velocity (applied = friction). Unbalanced forces occur when net force ≠ 0 (forces don't cancel). Results: acceleration in direction of net force, Second Law applies. Examples: car speeding up (engine > friction), free fall (only gravity). Important: cannot determine force balance from motion alone—must check acceleration. Constant velocity (including v=0) → balanced. Changing velocity → unbalanced. In two dimensions, use component method: (1) resolve each force into x and y components using $F_x = F \\cos \\theta$ and $F_y = F \\sin \\theta$, (2) sum all x-components: $F_{\\text{net},x} = \\sum F_x$, (3) sum all y-components: $F_{\\text{net},y} = \\sum F_y$, (4) combine using Pythagorean theorem: $F_{\\text{net}} = \\sqrt{F_{\\text{net},x}^2 + F_{\\text{net},y}^2}$, (5) find direction: $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(F_{\\text{net},y}/F_{\\text{net},x})$. Common scenarios: object at rest on surface (normal = weight, net = 0), object at constant velocity (all forces balanced, net = 0), accelerating object (applied > friction horizontally, net ≠ 0), free fall (only gravity, net = mg downward), hanging object at rest (tension = weight, net = 0). Understanding net force bridges force identification to motion prediction, connecting Newton's First Law (net force = 0 → constant velocity) and Second Law (net force ≠ 0 → acceleration)."
