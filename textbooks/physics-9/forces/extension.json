Students will learn Hooke's law, the spring constant, and how to interpret load-extension graphs using everyday examples like springs, rubber bands, and bungee cords.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "When a force is applied to an elastic object, it changes length. Extension occurs when the object gets longer, and compression occurs when it gets shorter.",
    "explanation": "Imagine pulling a spring—it stretches (extension). Push on it—it squashes (compression). The amount it changes length depends on how hard you push or pull, and what the object is made of. This relationship helps us understand everything from car suspension to how mattresses support your weight.",

  "summary": "Extension and compression describe how objects change length when forces are applied. Extension is stretching (getting longer), compression is squashing (getting shorter)—both calculated as $extension/compression = l_2 - l_1$. Hooke's law ($F = k e$) states that force is proportional to extension for elastic materials, up to the limit of proportionality. The spring constant $k$ measures stiffness—high $k$ means stiff, hard to stretch; low $k$ means stretchy, easy to pull. Load-extension graphs show this relationship: straight line through origin means Hooke's law applies, with slope = spring constant. Beyond the limit of proportionality, the graph curves and materials may reach elastic limit (permanent deformation) and eventually breaking point. These principles appear everywhere—car suspension absorbs bumps using spring compression, trampoline springs store energy as they extend, mattress springs compress to support weight, and suspension bridges stretch slightly under traffic. Understanding extension and compression helps engineers design safer buildings, better sports equipment, and more comfortable vehicles. Whether stretching a rubber band or designing earthquake-resistant structures, the same physics applies!"
