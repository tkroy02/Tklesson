Students will learn how these properties combine to create the rich variety of sounds we hear every day.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Every sound we hear can be described by three properties: pitch (how high or low it is), loudness (how strong or weak it is), and quality (what makes it sound like a violin versus a flute versus a voice). These correspond to the physical wave properties of frequency, amplitude, and waveform shape.",
    "explanation": "Imagine hearing a piano and a guitar play the same note at the same volume. You can instantly tell which is which—that's quality. The note itself has a specific pitch (frequency) and loudness (amplitude), but the instrument's unique mixture of overtones creates its characteristic sound. Together, these three properties make every sound distinct.",

  "summary": "Every sound is characterized by three properties: pitch, loudness, and quality. Pitch is determined by frequency—higher frequency = higher pitch. Humans hear roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Loudness is determined by amplitude—larger amplitude = louder sound, measured in decibels (dB) on a logarithmic scale. Every 10 dB increase represents 10× more intensity. Quality (timbre) is what makes sounds with the same pitch and loudness sound different—it's determined by the mixture of overtones (harmonics) present. Most sounds are complex tones containing a fundamental frequency (which determines pitch) plus higher-frequency overtones whose relative strengths create characteristic waveforms. These three properties can vary independently, allowing infinite variety in sound. Understanding them explains how we recognize voices and instruments, how audio engineers shape sound, and how doctors diagnose through listening. This foundation prepares us for exploring the human ear in the next section—how we perceive these properties."
