  "summary": "The wave speed equation $v = f\\lambda$ is a universal relationship that connects speed, frequency, and wavelength for all waves. Speed ($v$) is measured in m/s, frequency ($f$) in Hz, and wavelength ($\\lambda$) in meters. Wave speed is determined by the medium—not by frequency or amplitude. When a wave enters a new medium, frequency stays constant (set by the source), while speed and wavelength change proportionally. Sound travels fastest in solids, slower in liquids, slowest in gases; light travels fastest in vacuum, slower in transparent materials. This equation has countless real-world applications: sonar uses sound speed to measure ocean depth; radar uses light speed to measure distances; earthquake locations are found using P-wave and S-wave speed differences; GPS relies on precise timing of radio waves at light speed. Understanding $v = f\\lambda$ allows us to calculate any wave property when two are known, making it one of the most practical tools in physics. This foundation prepares us for exploring the Doppler effect in the next section—where relative motion changes observed frequency."
