Students will learn why ambulance sirens sound higher pitched as they approach and lower as they recede, and how this principle applies to sound, light, and even measuring the expansion of the universe.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of a wave as perceived by an observer when the wave source and the observer are in relative motion. Approaching sources have higher observed frequency; receding sources have lower observed frequency.",
    "explanation": "Think of an ambulance siren: as it rushes toward you, the sound waves get compressed, reaching your ear more frequently—so you hear a higher pitch. As it passes and moves away, the waves stretch out, arriving less frequently—so the pitch drops. This change in pitch is the Doppler effect in action.",

  "summary": "The Doppler effect is the change in observed frequency of a wave due to relative motion between source and observer. When a source approaches, waves compress—observed frequency increases (higher pitch for sound, blueshift for light). When a source recedes, waves stretch—observed frequency decreases (lower pitch, redshift). The effect applies to all waves: sound, light, water, and seismic. Real-world applications are everywhere: police radar uses Doppler shift of radio waves to measure vehicle speed; weather radar tracks storm motion; medical ultrasound measures blood flow; astronomers measure galaxy motions and discovered the universe is expanding through redshift of distant galaxies. The Doppler effect explains everyday experiences like the pitch drop of a passing siren or train horn, and it's also key to profound discoveries about the cosmos. Understanding that the source's emitted frequency doesn't change—only what we observe—is crucial. The greater the relative speed, the larger the Doppler shift. This phenomenon connects our daily experiences to the largest scales of the universe."
