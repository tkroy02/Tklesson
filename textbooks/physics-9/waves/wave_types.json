  "expanded_description": "This section explores the two main categories of waves: transverse and longitudinal. Students will learn to distinguish between them based on the direction of particle vibration relative to wave travel, examine examples of each type, and understand why this classification matters for describing wave behavior in different mediums.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Waves are classified by how the particles of the medium vibrate relative to the direction the wave travels. In transverse waves, particles vibrate perpendicular to wave direction; in longitudinal waves, particles vibrate parallel to wave direction.",
    "explanation": "Imagine two different ways to send a wave along a rope. If you shake the rope up and down, the wave moves horizontally while the rope moves vertically—that's transverse. If you push and pull the rope back and forth along its length, the wave still moves horizontally, but now the rope also moves horizontally—that's longitudinal. The direction of vibration relative to wave travel makes all the difference.",

  "summary": "Waves are classified into two main types based on how particles vibrate relative to wave direction. Transverse waves have particles vibrating perpendicular to wave travel, creating crests and troughs. Examples include waves on strings, light (electromagnetic), and earthquake S-waves. Transverse mechanical waves can only travel through solids, but electromagnetic transverse waves need no medium. Longitudinal waves have particles vibrating parallel to wave travel, creating compressions and rarefactions. Examples include sound waves, ultrasound, and earthquake P-waves. Longitudinal waves can travel through solids, liquids, and gases. The difference matters greatly: it explains why earthquake S-waves don't reach the other side of Earth (proving a liquid core), why light can travel through space while sound cannot, and why different medical imaging techniques use different wave types. Understanding wave types prepares us for calculating wave speed using $v = fλ$, which applies to both transverse and longitudinal waves—the formula doesn't care how particles vibrate, only that waves exist!"
