A floating leaf bobs up and down as waves pass, showing that energy moves while the water mostly stays in place. This is the essence of wave behavior: energy travels, particles oscillate.",

        "definition": "A wave is a disturbance that carries energy from one place to another through a medium (or sometimes through empty space) without permanently displacing the medium itself.",
        "context": "Think of a stadium wave at a sports event: people stand up and sit down, passing the wave around the stadium. The people (the medium) don't travel around—they just move up and down in place. The energy of the wave travels around the stadium."

          "principle": "Energy Transfer, Not Matter Transfer",

          "application": "When sound travels through air, air molecules vibrate back and forth but don't travel from the source to your ear. They pass the energy along like a chain of dominoes.",
          "example": "A loudspeaker vibrates, causing nearby air molecules to vibrate. These bump into neighbors, passing the vibration along until it reaches your ear—but the air molecules themselves hardly move from their original positions.",

  "summary": "Waves are disturbances that transfer energy without transferring matter. They require a source of vibration and travel through a medium (for mechanical waves) or can travel through vacuum (for electromagnetic waves). Key wave behaviors include reflection (bouncing off surfaces), refraction (bending when changing speed between mediums), and diffraction (spreading around obstacles or through gaps). Waves can be single pulses (like a dropped stone) or continuous waves (like a steady musical note). Mechanical waves like sound need matter to travel through—they cannot travel in space. Electromagnetic waves like light can travel through vacuum—that's how sunlight reaches Earth. Understanding the nature of waves is fundamental to explaining everything from music and communication to medical imaging and earthquake detection. This foundation prepares us for exploring specific wave properties in the next section: amplitude, wavelength, and frequency."
