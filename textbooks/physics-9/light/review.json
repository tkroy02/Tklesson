  "summary": "This review section provides comprehensive practice questions covering all topics from Chapter 9: The Nature of Light (wave-particle duality, speed of light), Electromagnetic Spectrum (regions, properties, applications), Reflection (law of reflection, angle measurement), Types of Reflection (specular vs diffuse, real-world examples), Plane Mirrors (image characteristics, lateral inversion, minimum mirror height), Concave Mirrors (terminology, image cases, ray diagrams), Convex Mirrors (always virtual/upright/reduced, wide field of view, 'objects closer' warning), and the Mirror Equation (1/f = 1/do + 1/di, sign conventions, magnification m = -di/do). Questions range from basic definitions and conceptual explanations to mathematical calculations and real-world applications. Mixed review questions connect concepts across sections, helping students synthesize their understanding of how light behaves and how mirrors form images. Working through these questions reinforces learning, identifies areas needing further study, and prepares students for the chapter test. Success with these questions demonstrates mastery of light and reflection at the Grade 9-10 level."
