  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the mirror equation, a mathematical tool that relates object distance, image distance, and focal length for spherical mirrors. Students will learn how to use this equation to calculate image positions and magnifications for both concave and convex mirrors, and understand the sign conventions that make the equation universally applicable.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The mirror equation, $1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i$, mathematically relates the focal length ($f$), object distance ($d_o$), and image distance ($d_i$) for all spherical mirrors. Combined with the magnification equation, $m = -d_i/d_o$, it allows precise prediction of image characteristics.",
    "explanation": "Imagine having a formula that tells you exactly where an image will form and how large it will be, without drawing ray diagrams. That's what the mirror equation does. By plugging in just two known values—like the mirror's focal length and where you place an object—you can calculate exactly where the image appears and whether it's real or virtual, enlarged or reduced, upright or inverted. It's like having a mathematical shortcut to understanding any mirror situation.",

  "summary": "The mirror equation, $1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i$, is a powerful mathematical tool that relates the focal length ($f$), object distance ($d_o$), and image distance ($d_i$) for all spherical mirrors. Combined with the magnification equation, $m = -d_i/d_o$, it provides complete information about image location, size, and orientation. Correct use requires consistent sign conventions: $d_o$ is always positive; $f$ is positive for concave mirrors and negative for convex mirrors; $d_i$ is positive for real images (in front of mirror) and negative for virtual images (behind mirror). Magnification $m$ is positive for upright images, negative for inverted images; $|m| > 1$ indicates enlargement, $|m| < 1$ indicates reduction. The mirror equation works for all cases, including special limits: object at infinity gives $d_i = f$; object at center of curvature ($d_o = 2f$) gives $d_i = 2f$ and $m = -1$; object at focal point gives $d_i = ∞$ (parallel rays). The equation is essential in designing optical instruments—telescopes use it to position detectors, flashlights use it to place bulbs at the focal point, and security mirrors are designed using magnification calculations. Understanding the mirror equation completes our mathematical description of mirrors and prepares us for applying these concepts in review and assessment."
