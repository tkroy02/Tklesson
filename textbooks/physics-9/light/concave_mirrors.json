Students will learn how concave mirrors reflect light to a focal point, how they can form both real and virtual images depending on object position, and why they are essential in telescopes, flashlights, makeup mirrors, and solar concentrators.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Concave mirrors curve inward, causing parallel light rays to converge at a focal point. They can form either real images (projectable onto a screen) or virtual images (appearing behind the mirror), depending on where the object is placed relative to the focal point and center of curvature.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a spoon's inner surface—it curves inward like a cave. That's a concave mirror. When parallel rays (like from a distant star) hit this curved surface, they all reflect toward a single point called the focal point. This concentrating ability makes concave mirrors powerful: they can focus sunlight to start a fire, collect starlight in telescopes, or magnify your face when you get close enough.",

  "summary": "Concave mirrors curve inward and converge parallel light to a focal point. Their behavior is governed by the relationship f = R/2, where R is the radius of curvature. The type of image formed depends critically on object position. When the object is outside the focal point (beyond F), images are real and inverted—they can be projected onto a screen. When the object is inside the focal point (closer than F), images are virtual, upright, and enlarged—like in makeup mirrors. At the center of curvature C, the image is real, inverted, and the same size. At the focal point F, no image forms (rays become parallel). These properties are visualized using ray diagrams with three principal rays: the parallel ray (reflects through F), the focal ray (reflects parallel), and the center ray (reflects back through C). Concave mirrors have countless applications: telescopes use large concave mirrors to gather starlight; flashlights and headlights place bulbs at the focal point to create parallel beams; solar concentrators focus sunlight for energy; and makeup mirrors provide magnification for grooming. Understanding concave mirrors prepares us for exploring convex mirrors, which have the opposite effect—they diverge light and always produce virtual images."
