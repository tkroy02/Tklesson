  "expanded_description": "This section explores the reflection of light—how light bounces off surfaces, enabling us to see the world around us. Students will learn the law of reflection, understand how smooth and rough surfaces affect reflected light, and discover why reflection is essential for vision and technology.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Reflection occurs when light bounces off a surface. The angle at which light strikes a surface equals the angle at which it bounces away, following the law of reflection. This simple principle explains everything from why you can see yourself in a mirror to why most objects are visible at all.",
    "explanation": "Imagine throwing a ball at a wall: if you throw it straight on, it bounces straight back. If you throw it at an angle, it bounces off at the same angle on the other side. Light behaves the same way when it hits a reflective surface. This predictable behavior allows us to control light with mirrors and understand how we see objects that aren't light sources themselves.",

      "introduction": "Look around you right now. Almost everything you see—this text, your hands, the walls—is visible because of reflected light. Only objects that produce their own light (like the Sun, light bulbs, or screens) are seen directly. Everything else reflects light from some source into your eyes.",
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "Reflection is the bouncing back of light when it strikes a surface. The incoming light ray is called the incident ray, and the outgoing ray is called the reflected ray.",

          "application": "This is why a room gets dark when you turn off the lights—there's no light to reflect off objects into your eyes.",
          "example": "You can read a book because light from a lamp reflects off the pages and into your eyes. The book itself doesn't produce light.",
          "analogy": "Think of a soccer ball being passed: the light source is like the player who kicks the ball, the object is like the player who receives and passes it, and your eye is like the goal—you see the ball only after it's passed to you."

          "example": "If a light ray hits a mirror at 30° from the normal, it reflects at 30° on the other side of the normal.",

          "example": "If a ray hits a mirror at 40° to the mirror surface, its angle of incidence is 50° (because 90° - 40° = 50°). The reflected ray will also be 50° from the normal."

  "summary": "Reflection is the bouncing of light off surfaces, governed by the simple law that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection (θᵢ = θᵣ), both measured from the normal line perpendicular to the surface. This fundamental principle explains all reflective phenomena. Reflection can be specular (mirror-like) on smooth surfaces, producing clear images as parallel rays remain parallel, or diffuse (scattered) on rough surfaces, where microscopic irregularities send light in all directions. Diffuse reflection is why we can see most objects from any angle and why paper, walls, and clothing are visible. Color comes from selective reflection—objects reflect their own color wavelengths and absorb others. Reflection has countless applications: mirrors in vehicles and telescopes, periscopes that change light direction, reflective safety materials that bounce light back to its source, and even the simple experience of seeing yourself in a calm pond. Understanding reflection prepares us for exploring how curved mirrors (concave and convex) can magnify, reduce, and focus light in even more powerful ways."
