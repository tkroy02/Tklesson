Students will learn how convex mirrors reflect light to create virtual images that are always upright and reduced, why they provide a wider field of view, and their essential role in security, vehicle safety, and various optical instruments.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Convex mirrors curve outward and cause parallel light rays to diverge as if coming from a virtual focal point behind the mirror. They always produce virtual, upright, and reduced images regardless of the object's position, making them ideal for situations requiring a wide field of view.",
    "explanation": "Imagine the outside of a shiny spoon—it curves outward like a dome. That's a convex mirror. When parallel rays hit this curved surface, they reflect outward, spreading apart. Your eye traces these diverging rays back behind the mirror, where they appear to originate from a single point—the virtual focal point. Unlike concave mirrors, convex mirrors never produce real images or magnification. Instead, they show a wider area than a flat mirror, which is why they're perfect for rearview mirrors and store security cameras.",

  "summary": "Convex mirrors curve outward and cause parallel light rays to diverge, appearing to come from a virtual focal point behind the mirror. Unlike concave mirrors, convex mirrors ALWAYS produce virtual, upright, and reduced images regardless of the object's position. The image is always located between the mirror and the virtual focal point, and magnification is always less than 1. Ray diagrams for convex mirrors require extending reflected rays backward behind the mirror with dashed lines to locate the virtual image where these extensions intersect. The primary advantage of convex mirrors is their wide field of view—because they curve outward, they capture light from a larger angular range than flat mirrors of the same size. This makes them invaluable for safety and security applications: passenger-side mirrors in vehicles (with the warning that objects are closer than they appear), store security domes, blind corner traffic mirrors, and ATM security mirrors. The reduced image size creates a size-distance perception illusion—objects look smaller, so our brains interpret them as farther away, which is why the warning is necessary. Convex mirrors follow the same mirror equation as concave mirrors (1/f = 1/do + 1/di), with the sign convention that f is negative for convex mirrors. Understanding convex mirrors completes our study of spherical mirrors and prepares us for the mirror equation in the next section, which mathematically relates object distance, image distance, and focal length for both mirror types."
