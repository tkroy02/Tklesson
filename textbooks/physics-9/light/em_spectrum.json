Students will learn how the electromagnetic spectrum is organized by frequency and wavelength, discover the properties and uses of each type of electromagnetic radiation, and understand that visible light is just a tiny portion of this vast spectrum.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The electromagnetic spectrum is the complete range of all electromagnetic waves, organized by frequency and wavelength. It spans from radio waves (longest wavelength, lowest frequency) to gamma rays (shortest wavelength, highest frequency), with visible light occupying a tiny sliver in the middle.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a piano keyboard that extends far beyond what you can hear—way below the lowest bass note and far above the highest treble. The electromagnetic spectrum is like that, but for light. Our eyes can only detect a tiny octave of this immense 'cosmic keyboard'—the rainbow of visible light. Everything else—radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays—is invisible to us, but just as real and incredibly useful.",

        "context": "All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in vacuum (c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s) and share the same wave nature—they're all transverse waves consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. What distinguishes them is their frequency and wavelength."

  "summary": "The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all forms of light, from long-wavelength radio waves to short-wavelength gamma rays. All EM waves travel at the same speed in vacuum (c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s) and differ only in frequency and wavelength. The spectrum is divided into regions: radio waves (communication), microwaves (cooking, radar), infrared (heat, remote controls), visible light (what we see), ultraviolet (sunburn, sterilization), X-rays (medical imaging), and gamma rays (cancer treatment, nuclear phenomena). Higher frequency means higher photon energy—UV, X-rays, and gamma rays are ionizing radiation that can damage living tissue, while lower frequencies are generally safe. Earth's atmosphere blocks many wavelengths, creating 'windows' only for visible light and radio waves at ground level. Temperature determines what wavelengths an object emits—hotter objects emit shorter wavelengths, which is why stars have different colors and why thermal imaging works. Understanding the EM spectrum is essential for medicine, communication, astronomy, and countless technologies we use every day."
