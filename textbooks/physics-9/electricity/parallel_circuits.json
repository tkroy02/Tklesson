    "explanation": "Imagine a multi-lane highway with several toll booths operating in parallel. Each lane has its own booth, and cars can choose any lane. The voltage (pressure to move) is the same for all lanes. Lanes with fewer tolls (lower resistance) allow more cars to pass (higher current). The total number of cars (total current) is the sum of cars in all lanes. If one lane is closed (open circuit), traffic continues in the other lanes. This is how parallel circuits work: voltage is common, current divides, and branches operate independently.",

The key characteristics are: (1) Voltage is the same across all branches: $V_{source} = V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = ...$ (2) Total current equals the sum of branch currents (Kirchhoff's Current Law): $I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + ...$ (3) Equivalent resistance is found using reciprocals: $\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{1}{R_3} + ...$ For two resistors, $R_{eq} = \\frac{R_1 \\times R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$. (4) Current divides inversely with resistance: lower resistance branches carry more current. The current divider formula for two resistors is $I_1 = I_{total} \\times \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$. (5) Power dissipated by each resistor is $P = V^2/R$, so power is inversely proportional to resistance in parallel—the smallest resistor dissipates the most power. Total power can be found from $P_{total} = V \\times I_{total}$ or $P_{total} = V^2/R_{eq}$. Advantages of parallel circuits include independent operation of components, constant voltage for all branches, and continued operation if one branch fails. Disadvantages include increasing total current with added branches and the need for thicker wiring. Real-world applications are everywhere: household wiring (lights and outlets), automotive electrical systems, battery banks for increased capacity, and internal power distribution in electronics. Understanding parallel circuits completes the foundation for circuit analysis, enabling students to analyze complex combinations of series and parallel configurations."
