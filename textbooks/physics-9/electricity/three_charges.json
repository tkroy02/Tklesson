Students will learn how to apply the superposition principle to calculate net forces in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional configurations, using vector addition to combine multiple force vectors.

    "principle": "For systems with multiple charges, the net force on any charge is the vector sum of the individual forces exerted by all other charges. This superposition principle allows us to analyze complex electrostatic configurations by treating each pair interaction independently and then combining the results using vector addition.",
    "explanation": "Imagine three charges arranged in a line. The middle charge feels a push or pull from both of its neighbors. To find the total force, you calculate the force from the left charge and the force from the right charge separately, then add them as vectors—taking direction into account. If the forces are in the same direction, they add; if opposite, they subtract. For charges arranged in two dimensions (like a triangle), you must break forces into components and use trigonometry to find the resultant. This systematic approach works for any number of charges.",

  "summary": "For systems with three or more charges, the net force on any charge is found using the superposition principle: calculate the force from each other charge individually using Coulomb's Law, then add these force vectors. In one-dimensional problems, forces can be treated as signed numbers along a line, with careful attention to direction based on attraction/repulsion and relative positions. In two-dimensional problems, forces must be resolved into $x$ and $y$ components, summed, and then combined to find the resultant magnitude and direction using $F_{net} = \\sqrt{(\\Sigma F_x)^2 + (\\Sigma F_y)^2}$ and $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\Sigma F_y/\\Sigma F_x)$. A systematic problem-solving approach includes: drawing a clear diagram, identifying the charge of interest, drawing force vectors, calculating each magnitude, resolving into components (for 2D), summing components, finding the resultant, and checking reasonableness. Symmetry can simplify problems significantly—for example, a charge at the center of a regular polygon of equal charges experiences zero net force. Real-world applications of multiple charge interactions include ionic crystal structures (like salt), molecular shapes (like water), plasma physics in fusion reactors, and electrostatic shielding (Faraday cages). Mastering three-charge problems builds essential skills for understanding complex electrostatic systems and prepares students for more advanced topics in electricity and magnetism."
