Students will learn the relationship between power, voltage, and current ($P = VI$), as well as alternative forms using resistance ($P = I^2R$ and $P = V^2/R$). Practical applications including energy consumption, cost calculations, and power ratings of household devices are explored.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy (heat, light, motion, etc.). It is calculated as $P = VI$, where $P$ is power in watts, $V$ is voltage in volts, and $I$ is current in amperes. Using Ohm's Law, power can also be expressed as $P = I^2R$ and $P = V^2/R$.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a light bulb connected to a battery. The brightness of the bulb depends on how much electrical energy is being converted to light and heat each second—that's power. A brighter bulb converts more energy per second. The power depends on both how much 'push' (voltage) is available and how much charge is flowing (current). Doubling either voltage or current doubles the power. This relationship explains why high-power appliances like heaters and air conditioners need both higher voltage and thicker wires to carry more current.",

  "summary": "Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is converted to other forms, measured in watts ($1\\ \\text{W} = 1\\ \\text{J/s}$). The fundamental power equation is $P = VI$—power equals voltage times current. Using Ohm's Law, two equivalent forms are derived: $P = I^2R$ (useful when current is known) and $P = V^2/R$ (useful when voltage is known). Power dissipation ($I^2R$) explains why wires heat up and why high-current devices need thick conductors. Electrical energy ($E = P \\times t$) is what you actually pay for, typically measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). One kilowatt-hour is the energy used by a $1000\\ \\text{W}$ device in one hour. Energy cost = energy (kWh) × price per kWh. Household appliances have power ratings ranging from a few watts (LED bulbs, phone chargers) to several kilowatts (heaters, dryers, ovens). Understanding power is essential for home energy management (choosing efficient appliances, identifying phantom loads), electrical safety (proper wire sizing, circuit breaker selection), and emerging technologies like electric vehicles and solar power systems. Power calculations also help compare device efficiencies—for example, LED bulbs produce the same light as incandescents using only 10-20% of the power. Mastering electric power concepts prepares students for analyzing series and parallel circuits, where power distribution depends on circuit configuration."
