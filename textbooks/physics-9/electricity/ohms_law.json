  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Ohm's Law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor. This relationship is expressed mathematically as $V = IR$, where $V$ is voltage in volts, $I$ is current in amperes, and $R$ is resistance in ohms.",
    "explanation": "Imagine water flowing through a pipe. The pressure difference pushing the water (voltage), the amount of water flowing (current), and the narrowness of the pipe resisting flow (resistance) are all related. Increase the pressure, and more water flows. Make the pipe narrower, and less water flows for the same pressure. Ohm's Law quantifies this exact relationship for electricity: voltage pushes current through resistance, and the three are inseparably linked.",

  "summary": "Ohm's Law, $V = IR$, is the fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electric circuits. Voltage ($V$ in volts) is the electric potential difference that pushes charges; current ($I$ in amperes) is the flow rate of charge; resistance ($R$ in ohms) is the opposition to current flow. For a fixed resistance, current is directly proportional to voltage. For a fixed voltage, current is inversely proportional to resistance. Materials that obey Ohm's Law (constant $R$) are called ohmic; metals and carbon resistors are examples. Non-ohmic materials, like light bulb filaments and diodes, have $I-V$ curves that are not straight lines. Resistance depends on physical properties: $R = \\rho L/A$, where $\\rho$ is resistivity, $L$ is length, and $A$ is cross-sectional area. Longer wires have more resistance; thicker wires have less resistance; different materials have different resistivities. Temperature also affects resistance—for most conductors, resistance increases with temperature. Ohm's Law has countless applications: designing LED circuits (choosing current-limiting resistors), troubleshooting electrical faults, selecting proper wire gauges for safe wiring, and understanding battery behavior. Mastering Ohm's Law is essential for analyzing more complex circuits, including series and parallel configurations covered in subsequent sections."
