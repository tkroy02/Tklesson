  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Coulomb's Law, the fundamental equation describing the electric force between charged objects. Students will learn how the force depends on the magnitude of charges and the distance between them, understand the inverse square relationship, and practice calculating electrostatic forces in one-dimensional systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Coulomb's Law states that the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force acts along the line connecting the charges, with like charges repelling and unlike charges attracting.",
    "explanation": "Imagine two charged objects—the force between them depends on three things: how much charge each has (more charge means stronger force), how far apart they are (closer means much stronger force), and what type of charges they are (opposites attract, likes repel). The distance matters enormously because the force drops off with the square of the distance—double the distance, and the force becomes only one-fourth as strong. This inverse square relationship appears throughout physics, from gravity to light intensity.",

  "summary": "Coulomb's Law, $F = k|q_1 q_2|/r^2$, quantifies the electric force between two point charges. The force is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The constant $k = 8.99 \\times 10^9$ N·m²/C². Like charges repel; unlike charges attract, with forces acting along the line connecting the charges. The inverse square relationship means doubling distance reduces force to one-fourth; tripling distance reduces it to one-ninth. Force is a vector—direction matters, especially with multiple charges. The superposition principle states that the net force on a charge is the vector sum of forces from all other charges individually. Coulomb's Law closely resembles Newton's law of gravity (both inverse square), but electric forces can attract or repel and are vastly stronger—about $10^{42}$ times stronger between electrons. This law underlies atomic structure (holding electrons in atoms), chemical bonding, material properties, and technologies from particle accelerators to ion thrusters. Understanding Coulomb's Law is essential for analyzing more complex electrostatic systems, including the three-charge problems covered in the next section."
