    "principle": "In a series circuit, components are connected in a single path so that the same current flows through each component. The total resistance is the sum of individual resistances, and the supply voltage divides among the components proportional to their resistances.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a single-lane road with several toll booths. Every car must pass through each booth in sequence—the same number of cars per hour passes through every booth (current is constant). The total time delay (voltage drop) is the sum of delays at each booth. If one booth creates more delay (higher resistance), it uses up more of the total time budget. Series circuits work the same way: current is the same everywhere, voltage drops add up to the supply voltage, and the largest resistance gets the largest voltage share.",

  "summary": "A series circuit connects components end-to-end, providing a single path for current flow. The key characteristics are: (1) Current is the same through all components: $I_{total} = I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = ...$ (2) Total resistance is the sum of individual resistances: $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$ (3) Voltage drops add to the source voltage (Kirchhoff's Voltage Law): $V_{source} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + ...$ (4) Voltage divides proportionally to resistance: $V_n = I \\times R_n$, with the largest resistor getting the largest voltage drop. The voltage divider formula for two resistors is $V_1 = V_{total} \\times \\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}$. (5) Power dissipated by each resistor is $P = I^2R$, so power is proportional to resistance in series. Total power can be found from $P_{total} = V_{source} \\times I$ or $P_{total} = I^2 R_{eq}$. Advantages of series circuits include simplicity, same current for all components, and easy voltage division. Disadvantages include complete failure if any component opens, and inability to operate components independently. Real-world applications include voltage dividers for sensors, current limiting resistors for LEDs, series battery connections to increase voltage, and protective devices like fuses and switches. Understanding series circuits is essential before studying parallel circuits, where current divides and voltage is constant."
