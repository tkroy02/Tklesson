  "summary": "Section 1.11 covered the Squeeze Theorem (also called the Sandwich or Pinching Theorem), a powerful tool for evaluating limits of functions that are difficult to compute directly. The theorem states that if $g(x) \\leq f(x) \\leq h(x)$ near $c$ and $\\lim_{x \\to c} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to c} h(x) = L$, then $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$. We learned the five-step process: (1) identify the target function, (2) find bounding functions, (3) verify the inequality, (4) evaluate bounding limits, and (5) apply the theorem. Classic applications include proving the fundamental trigonometric limits $\\lim_{\\theta \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\theta} = 1$ and $\\lim_{\\theta \\to 0} \\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{\\theta} = 0$. We practiced handling oscillating functions like $x^2 \\sin(1/x)$ where the oscillation is 'damped' by a factor that approaches zero. The theorem applies to both finite limits and limits at infinity. We identified common bounding strategies: trigonometric bounds ($-1 \\leq \\sin x, \\cos x \\leq 1$), absolute value bounds ($-|f(x)| \\leq f(x) \\leq |f(x)|$), algebraic bounds, and exponential bounds. Common pitfalls include incorrect inequality direction, bounds that don't converge to the same value, inequalities not valid on an interval around $c$, assuming limit existence without proof, and using overly loose bounds. The Squeeze Theorem is particularly valuable for oscillating functions where other limit techniques fail, making it an essential tool in the calculus toolkit."
