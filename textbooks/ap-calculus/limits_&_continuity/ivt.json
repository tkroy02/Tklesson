  "summary": "Section 1.9 covered the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) and its applications. The IVT states that if $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $k$ is any value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists at least one $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f(c) = k$. We learned the five conditions for applying IVT: (1) verify continuity, (2) identify the closed interval, (3) evaluate endpoints, (4) verify $k$ is in range, and (5) apply the conclusion. A special case for root finding uses sign changes: if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, a root exists in $(a, b)$. We practiced the bisection method to narrow root locations through repeated IVT application. We identified when IVT does not apply: discontinuities in the interval, $k$ outside the range, open intervals, and no sign change. Applications include temperature problems, position and motion, economic equilibrium, and fixed point theorems. Common pitfalls include assuming continuity without verification, confusing existence with uniqueness, using open intervals, ignoring the $k$ range requirement, and expecting IVT to locate exact roots. The IVT is a powerful existence theorem that guarantees solutions without requiring explicit computation, forming the foundation for numerical root-finding methods."
