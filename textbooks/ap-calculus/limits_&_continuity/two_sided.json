We learned that left-hand limits $\\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x)$ approach from values less than $c$, while right-hand limits $\\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x)$ approach from values greater than $c$. The fundamental theorem states that a two-sided limit $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. We practiced evaluating one-sided limits graphically by tracing from the appropriate direction, and algebraically by selecting the correct function piece for piecewise functions and analyzing absolute value cases. We identified four cases: (1) both one-sided limits equal (two-sided exists), (2) one-sided limits differ (two-sided DNE), (3) one side undefined (two-sided DNE), and (4) both sides infinite (infinite limit). Applications include piecewise-defined real functions, physics problems with direction-dependent behavior, and domain endpoints. Common pitfalls include confusing left/right notation, assuming two-sided limits always exist, using the wrong piece in piecewise functions, ignoring domain restrictions, and confusing limit values with function values. Mastery of one-sided limits is essential for analyzing continuity, especially at boundary points and discontinuities."
