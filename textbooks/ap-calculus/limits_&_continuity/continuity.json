We identified four types of discontinuities: removable (hole), jump (one-sided limits differ), infinite (vertical asymptote), and oscillating (no limit due to oscillation). We learned that functions can be continuous on intervals, with polynomials continuous everywhere, rational functions continuous where denominators are non-zero, and radical/trigonometric functions continuous on their domains. Properties of continuous functions allow us to build new continuous functions through sums, products, quotients, and compositions. Piecewise functions require special attention at boundary points where continuity must be verified by matching one-sided limits. We previewed the Intermediate Value Theorem, which guarantees that continuous functions achieve all intermediate values between endpoints—particularly useful for proving roots exist when a function changes sign. Common pitfalls include assuming continuity without verification, confusing limit existence with continuity, ignoring domain restrictions, missing boundary points in piecewise functions, and misclassifying discontinuity types."
