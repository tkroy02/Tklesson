  "summary": "Section 1.8 covered limits and continuity of piecewise functions. We learned that piecewise functions use different formulas on different intervals, and discontinuities can only occur at boundary points where the definition changes. To evaluate limits, we select the appropriate sub-function based on the direction of approach: left-hand limits use the $x < c$ piece, right-hand limits use the $x > c$ piece. For continuity at a boundary, all three conditions must be satisfied: (1) $f(c)$ is defined, (2) $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ exists (one-sided limits agree), and (3) $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = f(c)$. We practiced finding unknown parameters that make piecewise functions continuous by setting one-sided limits equal and solving the resulting equations. Special piecewise functions include absolute value functions (continuous everywhere), step functions (jump discontinuities at integers), sign functions (jump at zero), and ramp functions (continuous with corner). Real-world applications include tax brackets, shipping costs, utility rates, and parking fees. Common pitfalls include using the wrong piece for a limit direction, ignoring the function value at boundaries, assuming continuity without verification, misreading inequality symbols, missing multiple boundaries, and making algebraic errors in parameter problems. Mastery of piecewise function analysis is essential for advanced calculus topics and modeling real-world scenarios with tiered structures."
