We explored graphical tracing, numerical tables, and standard notation $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$. We identified three main cases where limits fail to exist: jump discontinuities, unbounded behavior, and oscillation. Crucially, we saw that limits can exist even if the function is undefined at the target value (removable discontinuity)."
