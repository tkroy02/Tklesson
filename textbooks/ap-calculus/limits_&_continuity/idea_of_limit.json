  "expanded_description": "Section 1.1 introduces the fundamental concept of limits - the cornerstone of calculus. Students will explore the intuitive idea of approaching a value without necessarily reaching it. The section covers the concept of left-hand and right-hand limits, understanding when a limit exists (when both sides approach the same value), and interpreting limits graphically. Real-world analogies like approaching a destination or zooming in on a graph help build intuition. This foundational understanding prepares students for more rigorous limit evaluation techniques in subsequent sections.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**The Idea of a Limit**: As $x$ approaches a value $c$, the function $f(x)$ approaches a value $L$, written as $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$. The limit describes behavior near a point, not necessarily at the point itself.\n\n**Key Understanding**:\n• **Two-sided limit exists** when left-hand limit equals right-hand limit: $\\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) = L$\n• **Limit may exist even if function undefined** at that point\n• **Graphical interpretation**: As we trace the graph toward $x = c$, what $y$-value do we approach?\n\n**Notation**: $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ means \"the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ equals $L$\"",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a limit as approaching a destination. As you drive toward a city, you get closer and closer - the limit is the city's location, whether or not you actually enter it. Similarly, as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $c$ (from either side), $f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to $L$. The function might be undefined at $x = c$ (like a hole in the road), but we can still describe where it was heading.",

      "introduction": "Limits are the foundation upon which all of calculus is built. Before we can talk about derivatives (rates of change) or integrals (accumulation), we must understand what happens to a function as its input approaches a particular value. This section develops the intuitive understanding of limits - what they are, how to think about them, and how to recognize them graphically. Whether you're analyzing motion, optimizing a process, or modeling growth, limits provide the mathematical language for describing behavior near a point.",

      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "A **limit** describes the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value. Formally, we write $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ and say \"the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is $L$.\"\n\n**When does a limit exist?**\n• The left-hand limit $\\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x)$ must exist\n• The right-hand limit $\\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x)$ must exist\n• Both must equal the same value $L$\n\n**Important Distinction**:\n• $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ is about what happens NEAR $x = c$\n• $f(c)$ is about what happens AT $x = c$\n• They can be different! The function may have a hole, jump, or be undefined at $c$",
        
        "context": "Limits emerge naturally in many contexts: instantaneous velocity (average velocity over shorter and shorter intervals), tangent lines (slope of secant lines as points get closer), and continuous growth (behavior as time intervals shrink). Understanding limits is essential for grasping the formal definition of derivatives and integrals.",

  "summary": "Section 1.1 introduces the fundamental concept of limits - the value a function approaches as the input approaches a point. Limits exist when left-hand and right-hand limits are equal, regardless of the actual function value at that point. Through graphical interpretation, numerical tables, and conceptual understanding, students learn that limits describe behavior near a point, not necessarily at the point. Key distinctions include understanding when limits fail to exist (jumps, asymptotes, oscillations) and recognizing that infinite limits represent unbounded behavior. This intuitive foundation is essential for all subsequent calculus concepts, from continuity to derivatives and integrals.",
