  "expanded_description": "Section 1.1 introduces the fundamental concept of limits - the conceptual foundation of all calculus. Unlike later sections that focus on computational techniques, this section establishes what limits mean, why they matter, and how to think about approaching behavior. Students explore limits as a process rather than a value, distinguishing between what a function approaches versus what it equals. Through numerical tables and graphical interpretation, students build intuition before any algebraic methods appear. This philosophical groundwork answers the essential question: why do we need limits at all?",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A limit describes what a function approaches, not what it is. As x gets closer to a, f(x) gets closer to L. The limit exists based on behavior near the point, regardless of what happens at the point itself.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of walking toward a destination. Your limit is where you're heading, even if you never actually arrive. Similarly, as x approaches a, we ask: where is the function heading? The function might be undefined at a (like a hole in the path), but we can still describe where it was going. This distinction between approaching and reaching is the fundamental insight of calculus.",

This section is not about techniques - it is about building a mental framework. Limits answer a deceptively simple question: as x gets closer and closer to some value, what value does f(x) get closer and closer to? This question of approaching, rather than reaching, is what makes calculus possible. Without this distinction, we could never handle instantaneous rates of change, tangent lines, or infinite processes.",

  "summary": "Section 1.1 establishes the conceptual foundation for all of calculus. Unlike later sections that teach computational techniques, this section focuses entirely on meaning: limits describe what a function approaches, not what it equals. Through graphical tracing, numerical tables, and careful language, students build intuition about approaching behavior. The distinction between limit and function value, the importance of two-sided agreement, and the necessity of limits for handling undefined expressions (like 0/0 in the tangent problem) are all explored without formal methods. This philosophical groundwork answers the essential question: why do we need limits? Because they let us describe instantaneous behavior that direct evaluation cannot capture. This understanding makes all subsequent limit techniques meaningful rather than rote.",
