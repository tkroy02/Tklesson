  "summary": "Section 2.3 covered higher-order derivatives and their applications. We learned that higher-order derivatives are obtained by repeatedly differentiating a function: $f'(x)$ is the first derivative, $f''(x)$ is the second derivative (derivative of $f'(x)$), $f'''(x)$ is the third derivative, and $f^{(n)}(x)$ is the $n$-th derivative. Multiple notation systems exist: prime notation ($f''$, $f'''$), Leibniz notation ($\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$), Newton's dot notation ($\\ddot{y}$), and operator notation ($D^2f$). For polynomials of degree $n$, all derivatives of order greater than $n$ equal zero. In physics, higher derivatives of position have specific meanings: first derivative = velocity, second derivative = acceleration, third derivative = jerk, fourth derivative = jounce/snap. The second derivative determines concavity: $f''(x) > 0$ means concave up, $f''(x) < 0$ means concave down. Points of inflection occur where concavity changes (verified by sign change in $f''(x)$). The second derivative test classifies critical points: $f''(c) > 0$ indicates local minimum, $f''(c) < 0$ indicates local maximum, $f''(c) = 0$ is inconclusive. Common pitfalls include notation confusion ($f''$ vs $f^2$), compounding algebraic errors, assuming $f''(c) = 0$ means inflection point without verifying concavity change, misapplying the second derivative test at non-critical points, ignoring domain restrictions, and confusing velocity with speed in physical interpretations. Mastery of higher-order derivatives is essential for curve sketching, optimization, motion analysis, and advanced calculus topics."
