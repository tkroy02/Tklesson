Students will learn to compute derivatives using the limit definition, understand the geometric interpretation as slopes of tangent lines, and connect the formal definition to intuitive understanding of instantaneous rates of change.",

    "principle": "The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as the interval approaches zero. This formal definition captures the precise mathematical meaning of instantaneous rate of change and slope of the tangent line.",

  "summary": "The derivative of a function at a point is defined using limits as $f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$. This first principles approach provides the rigorous foundation for differentiation, representing the instantaneous rate of change and the slope of the tangent line. Key steps in computation include: setting up the difference quotient, algebraic simplification, canceling the h factor, and evaluating the limit. The derivative has multiple interpretations: geometrically as slope, physically as instantaneous velocity, and economically as marginal cost. Mastering the first principles approach is essential for understanding where derivative rules come from and provides the conceptual foundation for all subsequent calculus topics."
