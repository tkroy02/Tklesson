  "summary": "Section 2.2 covered the three fundamental differentiation rules that provide efficient shortcuts for finding derivatives. The Power Rule states that $\\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}$ for any real number $n$, working for positive, negative, and fractional exponents. The Constant Multiple Rule states that $\\frac{d}{dx}[c \\cdot f(x)] = c \\cdot f'(x)$, allowing constants to be pulled outside the derivative operator. The Sum and Difference Rules state that $\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \\pm g(x)] = f'(x) \\pm g'(x)$, enabling term-by-term differentiation of polynomials and other multi-term functions. We learned a systematic five-step process: (1) rewrite in power form, (2) apply sum/difference rule, (3) apply constant multiple rule, (4) apply power rule, (5) simplify. These rules were applied to polynomials, rational functions (by rewriting as negative exponents), and radical functions (by rewriting as fractional exponents). We used the basic rules to find tangent line equations and identify points with horizontal tangents (where $f'(x) = 0$). Common pitfalls include forgetting to reduce the exponent, differentiating constants incorrectly (they become 0, not 1), losing negative signs, not rewriting before differentiating, making fraction arithmetic errors, and ignoring domain restrictions. The basic rules reduce polynomial degree by 1 with each differentiation and form the foundation for all advanced differentiation techniques covered in subsequent sections."
