  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the fundamental differentiation rules that make computing derivatives efficient and systematic. Students will learn the power rule, constant multiple rule, and sum/difference rules, which together allow us to differentiate any polynomial function quickly without using the limit definition each time.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Basic differentiation rules provide efficient shortcuts for finding derivatives of common function types. These rules are derived from the limit definition but save substantial computational effort.",
    "explanation": "While the first principles approach gives the theoretical foundation, these basic rules provide the practical tools for efficient differentiation. They work because differentiation is a linear operation that respects addition and scalar multiplication."

The power rule ($\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$) works for any real exponent. The constant multiple rule allows factoring out constants, while the sum and difference rules enable term-by-term differentiation of polynomials. The derivative of any constant is zero. These rules work together to make differentiation of polynomial and power functions straightforward: rewrite in power form, apply rules term by term, and simplify. Mastering these fundamental rules is essential for all subsequent calculus work involving derivatives."
