In physics, derivatives of position give velocity and acceleration. In geometry, derivatives provide slopes for tangent lines and help solve optimization problems.

The key to success with applied derivative problems is: (1) clearly identifying what each variable represents, (2) establishing the correct mathematical relationship, (3) carefully applying differentiation, and (4) interpreting results in context with proper units. Understanding both the mathematical operations and their real-world meanings is essential for effective problem-solving."
