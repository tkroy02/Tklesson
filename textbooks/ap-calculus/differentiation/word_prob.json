  "summary": "Section 2.4 covered applications of derivatives in real-world contexts. We learned that derivatives represent instantaneous rates of change, with units of (output units) per (input units). In motion analysis, position $s(t)$, velocity $v(t) = s'(t)$, and acceleration $a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)$ are related through differentiation. An object speeds up when velocity and acceleration have the same sign, slows down when they have opposite signs, and changes direction when velocity changes sign. Displacement is net change in position; distance is total path length. Related rates problems connect rates of change of related quantities through implicit differentiation with respect to time, following a five-step process: (1) identify variables and rates, (2) draw a diagram, (3) write a relationship equation, (4) differentiate with respect to time, (5) substitute and solve. Economic applications use marginal quantities: marginal cost $MC(x) = C'(x)$, marginal revenue $MR(x) = R'(x)$, and marginal profit $MP(x) = P'(x)$. Profit is maximized when $MR = MC$ or equivalently when $P'(x) = 0$. Biological applications include exponential growth $P(t) = P_0e^{kt}$, logistic growth with carrying capacity, and exponential decay for drug elimination with half-life calculations. Common pitfalls include confusing velocity with speed, forgetting units in related rates, not identifying all variables, misinterpreting marginal quantities as exact rather than approximate, sign errors in motion problems, and forgetting to check endpoints for absolute extrema. Mastery of applied derivatives enables analysis of motion, optimization of business decisions, and modeling of natural phenomena."
