  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the quotient rule, which allows us to differentiate functions that are quotients (divisions) of two other functions. Students will learn to recognize when the quotient rule applies, apply it correctly, and combine it with other differentiation rules.",

    "principle": "The quotient rule provides a method for differentiating quotients of functions. Like the product rule, the derivative of a quotient is NOT the quotient of the derivatives.",
    "explanation": "The quotient rule states that the derivative of a quotient of two functions is: (denominator times derivative of numerator minus numerator times derivative of denominator) all divided by the square of the denominator."

  "summary": "The quotient rule is used to differentiate functions that are quotients of two other functions. For f(x) = u(x)/v(x), the quotient rule states that f'(x) = [v(x)u'(x) - u(x)v'(x)] / [v(x)]². Key steps for application include: (1) identify u(x) (numerator) and v(x) (denominator), (2) compute u'(x) and v'(x) (using chain rule if needed), (3) apply the quotient rule formula, and (4) simplify the result. The mnemonic 'low d-high minus high d-low over low-low' helps remember the formula. The quotient rule frequently combines with the chain rule when either u(x) or v(x) is a composite function. Common applications include rational functions, trigonometric ratios, and average value problems. Avoid common errors like reversing the order in the numerator or forgetting the square in the denominator."
