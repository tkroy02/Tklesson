  "summary": "Section 2.5 covered the Chain Rule, one of the most essential differentiation techniques. The Chain Rule states that for a composite function $y = f(g(x))$, the derivative is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$, or in Leibniz notation, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx}$ where $u = g(x)$. We learned to identify inner and outer functions, with the inner function evaluated first and the outer function applied to the result. The systematic process involves: (1) identify inner and outer functions, (2) differentiate the outer function, (3) differentiate the inner function, (4) multiply the derivatives, (5) substitute back and simplify. We practiced the Chain Rule with power functions, trigonometric functions ($\\sin$, $\\cos$, $\\tan$), exponential functions ($e^x$, $a^x$), and logarithmic functions ($\\ln x$). Multiple-layer compositions require repeated Chain Rule applications, working from outside to inside. We combined the Chain Rule with the Product Rule and Quotient Rule for complex functions. Common pitfalls include forgetting to multiply by the inner derivative, evaluating the outer derivative at $x$ instead of $g(x)$, misidentifying inner and outer functions, not rewriting radicals and fractions as powers before differentiating, applying Chain Rule unnecessarily to non-composite functions, and making algebraic simplification errors. The Chain Rule is fundamental to calculus and appears in nearly all advanced differentiation problems, making mastery essential for success in subsequent topics."
