  "topic": "2.9 Implicit Differentiation",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces implicit differentiation, a fundamental technique for finding derivatives of functions that are defined implicitly by equations relating x and y, rather than explicitly as y = f(x). Students will master the process of differentiating both sides with respect to x, applying the chain rule to y terms, and algebraically solving for dy/dx. This method is essential for working with curves and relationships that cannot be easily solved for y.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "When y is defined implicitly by an equation in x and y, differentiate both sides with respect to x while treating y as a function of x. Apply the chain rule to all y terms, then solve the resulting equation for dy/dx.",
    "explanation": "The crucial insight is recognizing that y is a function of x, even when we cannot explicitly solve for it. Therefore, whenever we differentiate any term containing y, we must apply the chain rule: d/dx[f(y)] = f'(y) · dy/dx. This introduces dy/dx into the equation, which we then isolate through algebraic manipulation."

  "summary": "Implicit differentiation is a powerful technique for finding derivatives of functions defined by equations relating x and y. The key steps are: differentiate both sides with respect to x, apply the chain rule to all y terms by multiplying by dy/dx, collect dy/dx terms, factor out dy/dx, and solve. This method is essential for curves that cannot be easily written as y=f(x) and for solving related rates problems. Common errors include forgetting the chain rule with y terms and making algebraic mistakes when solving for dy/dx."
