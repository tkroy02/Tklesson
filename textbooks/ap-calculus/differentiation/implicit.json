  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "When y is defined implicitly by an equation in x and y, differentiate both sides with respect to x, treating y as a function of x and applying the chain rule. Then solve for dy/dx.",
    "explanation": "Since y is a function of x, whenever we differentiate a term containing y, we must multiply by dy/dx due to the chain rule: d/dx[f(y)] = f'(y) · dy/dx."
