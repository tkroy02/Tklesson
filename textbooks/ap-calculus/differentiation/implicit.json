  "topic": "2.9 Implicit Differentiation",
  "expanded_description": "In some equations, y is not written explicitly as a function of x. For example, x² + y² = 25 defines a circle, but solving for y gives two branches. In such cases, we use implicit differentiation — a method that lets us find dy/dx even when y cannot be isolated easily. This section explains the logic, process, and uses of implicit differentiation, and includes practical examples like circles, exponentials, and trigonometric equations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "When y is defined implicitly by an equation involving both x and y, differentiate both sides with respect to x. Treat y as a function of x, so every time you differentiate a term with y, multiply by dy/dx (chain rule). Then solve the resulting equation for dy/dx.",
    "explanation": "The key idea is that y depends on x, even if the relationship is hidden. Therefore, differentiating y² means applying the chain rule: d/dx[y²] = 2y(dy/dx). This step often trips up learners, but remembering 'differentiate normally, then multiply by dy/dx for any y-term' makes it straightforward."

  "summary": "Implicit differentiation is used when y is intertwined with x in an equation. The strategy is to differentiate both sides with respect to x, applying the chain rule to y terms by multiplying by dy/dx, then solving for dy/dx. This method works for circles, exponentials, trigonometric, and logarithmic equations. It also underlies real-world related rates problems — where multiple variables change together over time. Always remember: differentiate normally, multiply by dy/dx for every y, and rearrange to isolate dy/dx."
