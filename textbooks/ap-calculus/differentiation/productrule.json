  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the product rule, which allows us to differentiate functions that are products of two or more other functions. Students will learn to identify when the product rule applies, apply it correctly, and combine it with other differentiation rules like the chain rule.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The product rule provides a method for differentiating products of functions. Unlike sums and differences, the derivative of a product is NOT the product of the derivatives.",
    "explanation": "The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the first function times the derivative of the second, plus the second function times the derivative of the first. This accounts for how both functions are changing simultaneously."

  "summary": "The product rule is used to differentiate functions that are products of two or more other functions. For f(x) = u(x)v(x), the product rule states that f'(x) = u(x)v'(x) + v(x)u'(x). Key steps for application include: (1) identify u(x) and v(x), (2) compute u'(x) and v'(x) (using chain rule if needed), (3) apply the product rule formula, and (4) simplify the result. The product rule frequently combines with the chain rule when either u(x) or v(x) is a composite function. For products of three or more functions, the extended product rule applies: f'(x) = u'vw + uv'w + uvw'. Common applications include area/volume problems, economic models, and physical systems where multiple quantities vary simultaneously. Avoid the common mistake of simply multiplying derivatives - the correct formula involves a sum of two products."
