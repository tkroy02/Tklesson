  "summary": "Section 2.6 covered the Product Rule for differentiating products of functions. The Product Rule states that for $y = f(x) \\cdot g(x)$, the derivative is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$, often remembered as 'derivative of first times second, plus first times derivative of second.' We learned that the derivative of a product is NOT the product of derivatives—a common mistake. The systematic process involves: (1) identify the two functions, (2) differentiate each function separately, (3) apply the Product Rule formula, (4) simplify the result. We practiced with polynomial products (where expansion can verify results), and transcendental products involving trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions (where the Product Rule is essential). For three or more functions, the rule extends with one term per function: $\\frac{d}{dx}[fgh] = f'gh + fg'h + fgh'$. We combined the Product Rule with the Chain Rule when factors were composite functions. Applications included finding tangent lines and identifying horizontal tangents by setting the derivative to zero. Common pitfalls include multiplying derivatives instead of using the Product Rule, forgetting one of the two terms, not simplifying after application, confusing Product Rule with Chain Rule, sign errors with trigonometric derivatives, and not applying Chain Rule within Product Rule for composite factors. Mastery of the Product Rule is essential for differentiating most real-world functions that involve products."
