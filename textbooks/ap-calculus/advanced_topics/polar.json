  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the polar coordinate system as an alternative to Cartesian coordinates for describing points in the plane. Students will learn to convert between polar and Cartesian coordinates, graph polar equations, and understand the unique features of polar graphs including symmetry and special curves.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In polar coordinates, each point is determined by a distance $r$ from the origin and an angle $\\theta$ from the positive $x$-axis. This system is particularly useful for describing curves with circular symmetry and for modeling rotational motion.",
    "explanation": "While Cartesian coordinates use perpendicular distances $(x,y)$ from axes, polar coordinates use radial distance and angular position: $(r,\\theta)$. The same point can have multiple polar representations, and negative $r$ values are interpreted as pointing in the opposite direction of the given angle."

  "summary": "Polar coordinates provide an alternative coordinate system where points are located by their distance from the origin ($r$) and angle from the positive $x$-axis ($\\theta$). This system excels at describing curves with circular or rotational symmetry. Key polar curves include circles ($r = \\text{constant}$ or $r = a \\cos\\theta$), rose curves ($r = a \\cos(n\\theta)$ with $n$ petals), limacons ($r = a + b \\cos\\theta$), and cardioids (special case where $a = b$). Graphing polar equations involves analyzing symmetry, finding key points, and understanding the geometric meaning of the equation. Conversion between polar and Cartesian coordinates uses the relationships $x = r \\cos\\theta$, $y = r \\sin\\theta$, and $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$. Polar coordinates have important applications in navigation, physics, engineering, and anywhere rotational symmetry or periodic patterns occur. Mastering polar coordinates expands mathematical toolkit for curve description and problem-solving in radially symmetric situations."
