  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on exponential growth and decay models, which describe quantities that change at rates proportional to their current values. Students will learn to set up, solve, and interpret these models in various real-world contexts including population growth, radioactive decay, compound interest, and Newton's Law of Cooling.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Exponential growth and decay follow the differential equation $\\frac{dy}{dt} = ky$, where $k$ is the constant of proportionality. The solution is $y(t) = y_0 e^{kt}$, with $k > 0$ for growth and $k < 0$ for decay.",
    "explanation": "These models apply to situations where the rate of change of a quantity is proportional to the current amount. The key feature is that the relative growth rate $\\frac{dy/dt}{y}$ is constant, leading to exponential behavior. The doubling time (for growth) or half-life (for decay) is constant and characterizes the speed of the process."

Exponential growth ($\\frac{dP}{dt} = kP$, $k>0$) models unbounded increase with constant doubling time, while exponential decay ($\\frac{dA}{dt} = -kA$, $k>0$) models decrease with constant half-life. The logistic model ($\\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\\left(1-\\frac{P}{M}\\right)$) describes limited growth approaching a carrying capacity $M$. Newton's Law of Cooling ($\\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T-T_{\\text{env}})$) models temperature change toward ambient temperature. These models apply to diverse phenomena including population dynamics, radioactive decay, compound interest, drug elimination, and temperature change. Successful application requires identifying the appropriate model, determining parameters from given information, solving the differential equation, and interpreting results in context. Verification through unit analysis, limiting behavior checks, and reasonableness assessment ensures meaningful results. Mastery of these fundamental models provides powerful tools for analyzing and predicting behavior in scientific, financial, and engineering applications."
