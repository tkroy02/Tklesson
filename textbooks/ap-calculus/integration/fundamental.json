FTC Part 1 states that if $F(x) = \\int_a^x f(t) \\, dt$, then $F'(x) = f(x)$, meaning the derivative of an accumulation function equals the original function. FTC Part 2 provides the practical method for evaluating definite integrals: $\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a)$, where $F$ is any antiderivative of $f$. When integration limits are functions of $x$, we combine FTC with the chain rule. The FTC has profound applications in physics (connecting velocity to position), economics (relating marginal quantities to totals), and many other fields. Mastering the FTC is essential for understanding the unity of calculus and for practical computation of definite integrals. Verification through Riemann sums, simple test cases, and conceptual analysis ensures deep understanding of this cornerstone theorem of calculus."
