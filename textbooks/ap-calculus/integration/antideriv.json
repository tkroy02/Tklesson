Basic rules include the power rule ($\\int x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$ for $n \\neq -1$), constant multiple rule, and sum rule. Initial value problems use given conditions to determine the specific constant $C$. Antiderivatives have important applications in recovering position from velocity, cost from marginal cost, and other real-world scenarios where we work backward from rates of change. Mastering antiderivatives provides the essential foundation for the study of integration and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus."
