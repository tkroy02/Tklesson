  "expanded_description": "The Factor Theorem is a natural extension of the Remainder Theorem that establishes a direct connection between factors of a polynomial and its zeros. It tells us that if a number $c$ is a zero of a polynomial, then $(x - c)$ is a factor, and conversely, if $(x - c)$ is a factor, then $c$ is a zero. This theorem is the foundation for factoring polynomials, finding roots, and solving polynomial equations. Combined with synthetic division, it provides a systematic way to factor polynomials and find all their zeros.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Factor Theorem: For a polynomial $f(x)$, $f(c) = 0$ if and only if $(x - c)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. In other words, $c$ is a zero of $f(x)$ exactly when $(x - c)$ divides $f(x)$ evenly (with remainder 0).",
    "explanation": "Think of the Factor Theorem as a two-way street between zeros and factors. If you plug $c$ into the polynomial and get zero, then $x - c$ must be one of the building blocks of the polynomial. Conversely, if $x - c$ is a factor, then $c$ must make the polynomial zero. This connection allows us to use zeros to find factors and factors to find zeros.",

  "summary": "The Factor Theorem states that for a polynomial $f(x)$, $f(c) = 0$ if and only if $(x - c)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. This creates a powerful connection between zeros (numbers that make the polynomial zero) and factors (algebraic expressions that divide the polynomial evenly). Synthetic division is the ideal tool for applying the Factor Theorem—it quickly tests whether a candidate $c$ is a zero (remainder 0) and simultaneously provides the quotient polynomial. By repeatedly finding zeros and using synthetic division to factor them out, we can completely factor polynomials and find all their zeros. This process works for both real and complex zeros, with complex zeros always appearing in conjugate pairs that combine into irreducible quadratic factors with real coefficients. The Factor Theorem also connects to graphing: real zeros correspond to x-intercepts. Common mistakes include sign errors when writing factors from zeros, forgetting to account for leading coefficients in factors, mishandling complex zeros, and stopping the factoring process too early. The Factor Theorem is fundamental in engineering applications like control systems, signal processing, and vibration analysis.",
