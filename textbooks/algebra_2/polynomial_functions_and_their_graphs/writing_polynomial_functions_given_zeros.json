  "expanded_description": "Writing polynomial functions from given zeros is a fundamental skill that reverses the process of finding zeros from factors. Given a list of zeros (roots), we can construct the polynomial by writing each zero as a linear factor, multiplying these factors together, and simplifying. This process requires understanding that complex zeros come in conjugate pairs and that the leading coefficient can be adjusted to meet additional conditions. This skill is essential for modeling real-world situations where we know key points (like x-intercepts) and need to find the underlying polynomial function.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "If $r_1, r_2, ..., r_n$ are zeros of a polynomial function (counting multiplicities), then the polynomial can be written as $f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)$, where $a$ is a non-zero constant called the leading coefficient. Additional conditions (like a specific point on the graph) determine the value of $a$.",
    "explanation": "Think of building a polynomial from its zeros like constructing a product from its factors. Each zero $r$ contributes a factor $(x - r)$. If a zero occurs multiple times (multiplicity > 1), the factor is raised to that power. The leading coefficient $a$ acts like a volume control—it stretches or compresses the graph vertically without changing the zeros. You can determine $a$ if you know one additional point on the graph, such as the y-intercept or any other $(x, y)$ pair.",

  "summary": "To write a polynomial function from given zeros, each zero $r$ contributes a factor $(x - r)$. If a zero has multiplicity $m$, the factor is raised to the $m$th power. For polynomials with real coefficients, complex zeros must appear in conjugate pairs; their combined factor is an irreducible quadratic with real coefficients. The general form is $f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)$, where $a$ is a non-zero constant. The value of $a$ is determined by additional conditions such as the y-intercept, a specific point on the graph, or a given leading coefficient. The polynomial of minimum degree with the given zeros uses exactly these factors—adding extra factors (like irreducible quadratics) increases the degree without adding new real zeros. Common mistakes include forgetting to include complex conjugates, sign errors in factors, mishandling multiplicities, and assuming uniqueness without the constant factor $a$. This skill is essential in curve fitting, engineering design, and signal processing, where functions must pass through specific points or have zeros at predetermined locations.",
