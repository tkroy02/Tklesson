  "expanded_description": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is one of the most important theorems in mathematics. It guarantees that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root, and when counting multiplicities, a polynomial of degree n has exactly n roots in the complex number system. This theorem provides the foundation for understanding that polynomials are completely factorable over the complex numbers, even if some factors are irreducible over the reals. It assures us that when we set out to find all roots of a polynomial, we will always find n of them—no more, no less—in the complex plane.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: Every non-constant polynomial function with complex coefficients has at least one complex zero. As a consequence, a polynomial of degree n has exactly n zeros in the complex number system, counting multiplicities.",
    "explanation": "Think of this theorem as a \"completeness guarantee\" for polynomials. No matter how complicated the polynomial, if you look in the complex numbers, you'll find all the roots you're supposed to have. A quadratic always has 2 roots (they might be real or complex, distinct or repeated), a cubic always has 3, and so on. This theorem tells us that the complex numbers are the right place to look—they're \"big enough\" to contain all polynomial roots.",

This theorem guarantees that polynomials are completely factorable over the complex numbers into linear factors: $f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)$. For polynomials with real coefficients, non-real complex roots occur in conjugate pairs, which means that over the real numbers, factorization includes linear factors for real roots and irreducible quadratic factors for each pair of complex conjugates. The degree of a polynomial tells you exactly how many roots to expect counting multiplicities—a double root counts as two roots, a triple root as three, and so on. Common mistakes include forgetting to count multiplicities, assuming all roots must be real, misapplying the theorem to constant polynomials, and thinking that irreducible quadratics over the reals cannot be factored over the complex numbers. The Fundamental Theorem has profound implications in engineering, physics, and signal processing, where polynomial roots determine system behavior.",
