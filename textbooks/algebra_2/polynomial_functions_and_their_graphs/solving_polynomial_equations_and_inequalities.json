  "expanded_description": "Solving polynomial equations and inequalities brings together all the concepts from this unit: factoring, finding zeros, understanding multiplicity, and analyzing end behavior. Polynomial equations are solved by finding all roots (real and complex) that satisfy the equation, typically by setting the polynomial equal to zero and factoring completely. Polynomial inequalities extend this to find intervals where the polynomial is positive or negative, using the zeros as boundary points. These skills are essential for real-world applications where we need to know not just where a quantity equals zero, but where it exceeds or falls below certain thresholds.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a polynomial equation $f(x) = 0$, find all zeros of $f(x)$ by factoring completely (using techniques from previous sections). To solve a polynomial inequality $f(x) > 0$, $< 0$, $\\geq 0$, or $\\leq 0$, find the real zeros of $f(x)$, use them to divide the number line into intervals, test a point in each interval, and determine where the inequality holds.",
    "explanation": "Think of polynomial equations as asking \"where does the graph cross the x-axis?\" and polynomial inequalities as asking \"where is the graph above or below the x-axis?\" The zeros are the boundary points—they separate regions where the polynomial is positive from regions where it is negative. By testing one point in each interval, we can determine the sign of the polynomial throughout that entire interval. The multiplicity of zeros affects whether the graph crosses or bounces, which influences sign changes between intervals.",

  "summary": "Solving polynomial equations means finding all values of $x$ that make the polynomial equal to zero. This is done by factoring the polynomial completely (over the complex numbers if needed) and setting each factor to zero. Solutions include both real and complex roots. Solving polynomial inequalities ($>0$, $<0$, $\\geq0$, $\\leq0$) involves finding all real zeros, using them to divide the number line into intervals, testing a point in each interval to determine the sign of the polynomial there, and selecting the intervals where the inequality holds. Sign charts are a useful visual tool for organizing this information. Multiplicity affects whether the sign changes at a zero: odd multiplicity causes a sign change; even multiplicity does not. This property allows us to determine signs in all intervals by testing just one interval and applying the rule. For inequalities comparing polynomials to non-zero expressions, first move all terms to one side to get a standard form. Common mistakes include forgetting complex solutions in equations, incorrect interval testing, misapplying multiplicity rules, and mishandling endpoint inclusion in interval notation. These skills are essential in engineering, economics, and physics for finding ranges where quantities satisfy certain conditions.",
