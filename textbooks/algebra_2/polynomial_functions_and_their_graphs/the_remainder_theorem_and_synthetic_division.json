  "expanded_description": "The Remainder Theorem and synthetic division provide efficient tools for evaluating polynomials and dividing by linear factors. Instead of substituting a value into a polynomial and performing numerous calculations, synthetic division offers a streamlined method that gives both the quotient and remainder. The Remainder Theorem then reveals that this remainder is exactly the value of the polynomial at that point. These techniques are foundational for finding zeros, factoring polynomials, and understanding polynomial behavior.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Remainder Theorem states that when a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$, the remainder is $f(c)$. Synthetic division is a shortcut method for dividing a polynomial by a linear factor of the form $(x - c)$, producing both the quotient and the remainder efficiently.",
    "explanation": "Think of synthetic division as organized arithmetic that mimics long division but with less writing. It works only for divisors of the form $(x - c)$, where $c$ is a constant. The process uses only the coefficients of the polynomial, and the final number in the bottom row is the remainder. According to the Remainder Theorem, this remainder equals $f(c)$—so synthetic division gives you a function evaluation for free!",

Synthetic division is a efficient shortcut for dividing by linear factors of the form $(x - c)$. To perform synthetic division: write the coefficients (including zeros for missing terms), bring down the first coefficient, then repeatedly multiply by $c$ and add to the next coefficient. The last number is the remainder; the preceding numbers are the coefficients of the quotient, which has degree one less than the original polynomial. Synthetic division is also an efficient way to evaluate polynomials—the remainder gives $f(c)$. Common mistakes include using the wrong sign for $c$ when the divisor is $(x + a)$, forgetting zero coefficients for missing terms, misinterpreting the quotient's degree, and confusing the remainder with quotient coefficients. These techniques are foundational for polynomial manipulation and have practical applications in computer graphics, numerical analysis, and signal processing.",
