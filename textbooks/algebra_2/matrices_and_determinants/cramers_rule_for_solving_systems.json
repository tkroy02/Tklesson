  "expanded_description": "Cramer's Rule is a theorem in linear algebra that gives an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations with as many equations as unknowns, using determinants. Named after Gabriel Cramer, this rule expresses each variable as the ratio of two determinants. While not the most efficient method for large systems (due to the computational cost of many determinants), it is elegant and useful for small systems, for theoretical purposes, and when only one specific variable is needed. Cramer's Rule also provides a direct connection between determinants and solutions, reinforcing the geometric interpretation of determinants as scaling factors.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a square system of $n$ linear equations in $n$ unknowns, written as $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ with $\\det(A) \\neq 0$, the unique solution is given by $x_i = \\frac{\\det(A_i)}{\\det(A)}$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$, where $A_i$ is the matrix formed by replacing the $i$-th column of $A$ with the column vector $\\mathbf{b}$.",
    "explanation": "Think of Cramer's Rule as a way to isolate one variable at a time. The denominator is the determinant of the coefficient matrix, which measures the overall 'volume scaling' of the transformation. The numerator is the determinant of a modified matrix where the column corresponding to the variable of interest is replaced by the constant vector $\\mathbf{b}$. This replacement changes the volume in a way that directly yields the value of that variable. The rule works only when the system has a unique solution, i.e., when $\\det(A) \\neq 0$."

  "summary": "Cramer's Rule provides an explicit formula for solving a square linear system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ when $\\det(A) \\neq 0$. For each variable $x_i$, replace the $i$-th column of $A$ with the constant vector $\\mathbf{b}$ to form $A_i$, then $x_i = \\frac{\\det(A_i)}{\\det(A)}$. For $2 \\times 2$ systems, this yields simple closed forms; for $3 \\times 3$ systems, it requires computing four determinants using expansion by minors. Cramer's Rule is mainly used for small systems, for symbolic problems, or when only one variable is needed. It fails when $\\det(A) = 0$ (the singular case), indicating either no solution or infinitely many. Common mistakes include applying the rule without checking the determinant, replacing the wrong column, and sign errors in determinant calculations. Understanding Cramer's Rule deepens the connection between determinants and solutions, preparing you for more advanced topics in linear algebra."
