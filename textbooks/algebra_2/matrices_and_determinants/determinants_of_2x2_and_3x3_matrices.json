  "expanded_description": "The determinant is a special scalar value associated with a square matrix. It acts like a mathematical fingerprint, revealing crucial properties of the matrix at a glance. A single number can tell you whether a matrix is invertible, whether a system of equations has a unique solution, or how a transformation scales area or volume. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, the determinant measures the area scaling factor of the linear transformation. For a $3 \\times 3$ matrix, it measures volume scaling. This section develops the methods for calculating determinants of $2 \\times 2$ and $3 \\times 3$ matrices, laying the foundation for Cramer's Rule, finding inverses, and understanding eigenvalues in later courses.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The determinant of a square matrix $A$, denoted $\\det(A)$ or $|A|$, is a single number computed from its entries. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$, the determinant is $ad - bc$. For a $3 \\times 3$ matrix, the determinant is computed by expansion, often using a systematic pattern of products with alternating signs. A zero determinant indicates the matrix is singular (non‑invertible); a non‑zero determinant indicates invertibility.",
    "explanation": "Think of the determinant as a collapse detector. If the rows or columns of a matrix are linearly dependent (one is a multiple or combination of others), the determinant is zero, signaling that the transformation squashes space into a lower dimension. If the determinant is non‑zero, the transformation preserves dimension, and the matrix is invertible. The absolute value of the determinant tells you how much the transformation scales areas ($2 \\times 2$) or volumes ($3 \\times 3$). The sign indicates whether the transformation preserves or reverses orientation (flips)."

  "summary": "The determinant is a scalar value that captures essential information about a square matrix. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$, $\\det = ad - bc$. For a $3 \\times 3$ matrix, the determinant is computed by expansion along a row or column: multiply each entry by its cofactor ($(-1)^{i+j}$ times the $2 \\times 2$ determinant of the matrix left after deleting that entry's row and column) and sum the results. A zero determinant indicates the matrix is singular (non‑invertible) and its rows/columns are linearly dependent; a non‑zero determinant means the matrix is invertible. Key properties include $\\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B)$, $\\det(A^T) = \\det(A)$, and predictable effects of row operations. Geometrically, $|\\det|$ gives the scaling factor for area (2D) or volume (3D). Common mistakes include sign errors in expansion, misidentifying minors, and assuming $\\det(A+B) = \\det(A) + \\det(B)$. Determinants are fundamental for finding inverses, applying Cramer's Rule, and understanding linear transformations."
