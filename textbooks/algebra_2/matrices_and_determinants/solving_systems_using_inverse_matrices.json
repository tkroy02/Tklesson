  "expanded_description": "A system of linear equations is a set of equations that must be solved simultaneously. Writing such a system in matrix form transforms it into a compact equation, $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $A$ contains the coefficients, $\\mathbf{x}$ is the column vector of variables, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the column vector of constants. If the coefficient matrix $A$ is invertible, the solution is simply $\\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$. This elegant method ties together matrix multiplication, the identity matrix, and inverses into a powerful problem‑solving tool. It also lays the groundwork for understanding how computers solve large systems efficiently.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Any system of linear equations can be written as a single matrix equation $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$. If $A$ is an invertible square matrix, then the unique solution is $\\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$. This follows from multiplying both sides of the equation on the left by $A^{-1}$ and using $A^{-1}A = I$.",
    "explanation": "Think of $A$ as a transformation that acts on the unknown vector $\\mathbf{x}$ to produce the known vector $\\mathbf{b}$. The inverse $A^{-1}$ reverses that transformation, allowing us to recover $\\mathbf{x}$ from $\\mathbf{b}$. This perspective unifies the entire solving process: instead of manipulating individual equations, we work directly with the matrix representation. The condition that $A$ must be square and invertible reflects the requirement that the system has the same number of equations as unknowns and that the equations are independent (no redundancies or contradictions)."

If $A$ is a square invertible matrix ($\\det(A) \\neq 0$), the unique solution is $\\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$. This is derived by multiplying both sides on the left by $A^{-1}$ and using $A^{-1}A = I$. The method is especially efficient when solving multiple systems with the same $A$ but different $\\mathbf{b}$ vectors. Always check the determinant first; if $\\det(A)=0$, $A^{-1}$ does not exist and the inverse method cannot be used. Common mistakes include multiplying on the wrong side, applying the method to singular matrices, arithmetic errors, and forgetting the scalar factor in the inverse. Mastering this technique connects matrix operations to practical problem‑solving and prepares you for larger systems and advanced applications."
