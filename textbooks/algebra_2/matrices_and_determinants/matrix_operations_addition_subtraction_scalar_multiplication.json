  "expanded_description": "Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that organize and process information in ways that ordinary algebra cannot. They are the backbone of computer graphics, data science, economics, physics, and engineering. Before matrices can do anything powerful — solving systems of equations, encoding messages, rotating shapes — you need to be comfortable with the basic operations: adding, subtracting, and scaling them. This section builds that foundation from the ground up.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrix operations — addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication — work element by element, operating on corresponding entries. Two matrices can only be added or subtracted if they have exactly the same dimensions.",
    "explanation": "Think of a matrix as a spreadsheet: rows going across, columns going down, and each cell holding a number. When you add two spreadsheets together, you add the number in each cell of the first spreadsheet to the number in the same cell of the second spreadsheet. That's exactly how matrix addition works — position by position, entry by entry. This is called element-wise or entry-wise operation, and it is the defining logic of all three operations in this section. Scalar multiplication is even simpler: multiply every single entry in the matrix by the same number (the scalar). These operations are the vocabulary you need before matrix multiplication, inverses, and all the powerful applications ahead."

A matrix is described by its dimensions: $m \\times n$ (read '$m$ by $n$'), where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. A matrix named $A$ with entry in row $i$ and column $j$ is written $a_{ij}$ (lowercase letter with subscript).",
        "context": "Rows run horizontally (left to right). Columns run vertically (up to down). When stating dimensions, ALWAYS say rows first, then columns — $m \\times n$ means $m$ rows and $n$ columns. This order is universal in mathematics and must be memorized. A matrix is usually named with a capital letter ($A$, $B$, $C$) and individual entries with the corresponding lowercase letter and subscripts ($a_{11}$, $a_{12}$, etc.). The subscript $a_{ij}$ is read 'a sub i j' — $i$ is the row number, $j$ is the column number."

  "summary": "A matrix is an $m \\times n$ rectangular array of numbers (rows first, columns second — the RC rule). Each entry is denoted $a_{ij}$ (row $i$, column $j$). Matrix addition and subtraction are only defined when both matrices have identical dimensions — then you operate entry by entry: $(A \\pm B)_{ij} = a_{ij} \\pm b_{ij}$. Addition is commutative ($A + B = B + A$) and associative; subtraction is not commutative ($A - B \\neq B - A$). Scalar multiplication multiplies every entry of a matrix by the scalar $k$: $(kA)_{ij} = k \\cdot a_{ij}$; no dimension check is required. For combined expressions like $2A - 3B + C$, compute all scalar products first, then add and subtract the resulting matrices. Matrix equations are solved like regular algebraic equations — add, subtract, or scale both sides — performing each operation entry by entry. These operations have direct real-world meaning: addition combines datasets, subtraction shows change, and scalar multiplication scales uniformly. The zero matrix $O$ is the additive identity ($A + O = A$), and $-A$ is the additive inverse ($A + (-A) = O$). These foundations lead directly to matrix multiplication in Section 14.2, where dimension rules become more complex."
