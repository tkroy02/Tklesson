  "expanded_description": "Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that provide a powerful way to organize and manipulate data. Matrix operations—addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication—are the foundational building blocks for more advanced topics like matrix multiplication, inverses, and applications in geometry, economics, and cryptography. These operations are performed element‑wise, meaning corresponding entries are combined. Understanding these basics is essential for working with systems of equations, transformations, and data analysis.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Two matrices of the same dimensions can be added or subtracted by adding or subtracting their corresponding entries. Scalar multiplication multiplies every entry of a matrix by a constant (the scalar).",
    "explanation": "Think of matrices as spreadsheets: if you have two tables of the same size with numbers, adding them means adding the numbers in the same cell. Multiplying by a scalar means scaling every number in the table by that factor. These operations obey properties similar to real numbers: commutativity of addition, associativity, and distributivity of scalar multiplication over addition.",
