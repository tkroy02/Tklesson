  "expanded_description": "Matrix multiplication is the defining operation that elevates matrices from simple data tables to powerful mathematical objects. Unlike the straightforward, element-wise operations of addition and subtraction, matrix multiplication follows a specific row-by-column procedure. This operation is the foundation for representing complex systems of equations, performing geometric transformations in computer graphics, and encoding information in cryptography. This section demystifies the procedure, explains the critical dimension rule, and builds the fluency needed for the advanced topics that follow.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The product of two matrices $A$ and $B$ (denoted $AB$) is defined only when the number of columns in $A$ equals the number of rows in $B$. The resulting matrix $C = AB$ has dimensions equal to the number of rows in $A$ by the number of columns in $B$. Each entry $c_{ij}$ is found by taking the dot product of row $i$ from $A$ and column $j$ from $B$: multiply corresponding entries and sum the results.",
    "explanation": "Think of it as a systematic process: you take a whole row from the first matrix and a whole column from the second. You multiply the first entry of the row by the first entry of the column, the second entry of the row by the second entry of the column, and so on. Then, you add up all those products. That single number is placed in the new matrix at the intersection of that specific row (from the first matrix) and that specific column (from the second matrix). This is not a random process; it is designed to combine information in a way that models compositions of linear transformations and systems of equations. The dimension rule is absolute: the 'inner' dimensions must match, and the 'outer' dimensions determine the size of the result."

The resulting matrix $C = AB$ has dimensions equal to the number of rows in $A$ by the number of columns in $B$ (the 'outer' dimensions). Each entry $c_{ij}$ is calculated as the dot product of row $i$ from $A$ and column $j$ from $B$: $c_{ij} = a_{i1}b_{1j} + a_{i2}b_{2j} + \\dots + a_{in}b_{nj}$. Matrix multiplication is associative ($(AB)C = A(BC)$) and distributive ($A(B+C)=AB+AC$), but it is **not commutative** ($AB \\neq BA$ in general). The identity matrix $I$ (1s on the diagonal, 0s elsewhere) acts as the multiplicative identity: $AI = A$ and $IA = A$ when dimensions are compatible. Common errors include ignoring dimension rules, multiplying element-wise, misaligning rows and columns, forgetting to sum products, and incorrectly assuming commutativity. Mastering this operation is essential for solving systems, performing geometric transformations, and understanding the advanced topics that follow."
