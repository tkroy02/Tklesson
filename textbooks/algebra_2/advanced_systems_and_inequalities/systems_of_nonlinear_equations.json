  "expanded_description": "Not all systems of equations are linear. When at least one equation is nonlinear—involving squares, square roots, absolute values, or other nonlinear expressions—the system is called a nonlinear system. These systems can have multiple solutions, and the graphs of the equations intersect at points corresponding to the solutions. Solving nonlinear systems often requires substitution, elimination (when possible), and careful handling of extraneous solutions. Applications include finding intersection points of geometric figures, optimizing functions, and modeling real-world scenarios where relationships are not proportional.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A system of nonlinear equations can be solved by substitution or elimination, similar to linear systems, but special care must be taken because solutions may be extraneous or multiple. Graphically, the solutions are the intersection points of the curves represented by the equations.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a circle and a line intersecting. The circle equation $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ is nonlinear, while the line $y = mx + b$ is linear. Substituting the linear expression into the circle yields a quadratic in one variable, which may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions. Each solution gives a point of intersection. This idea extends to other curves: parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, etc. The key is to reduce the system to a single equation in one variable using substitution, solve that equation, and then back-substitute to find the corresponding values of the other variable.",
