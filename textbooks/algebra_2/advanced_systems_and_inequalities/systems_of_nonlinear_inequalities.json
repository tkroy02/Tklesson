  "expanded_description": "Just as with linear inequalities, systems of nonlinear inequalities involve finding the region in the plane that satisfies all inequalities simultaneously. However, the boundaries are now curves such as parabolas, circles, ellipses, or other nonlinear graphs. The solution region is the intersection of the half-planes or regions defined by each inequality. Graphing these systems requires careful sketching of curves, determining which side to shade, and identifying intersection points where boundaries meet. These skills are essential for advanced optimization, modeling real-world constraints with nonlinear relationships, and understanding complex feasible regions.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The solution to a system of nonlinear inequalities is the set of points that satisfy every inequality in the system. Graphically, it is the overlapping region of the individual solution sets. Boundaries are drawn as solid (≤ or ≥) or dashed (< or >) curves, and intersection points of boundaries are found by solving the corresponding equations.",
    "explanation": "Each nonlinear inequality divides the plane into regions where the inequality holds and where it does not. The boundary curve is the set of points where equality holds. By graphing each curve, choosing test points to determine shading, and then finding the overlap, you can visualize the feasible region. Intersection points of different boundaries are important because they often represent vertices or boundaries of the feasible region. The region may be bounded or unbounded, and its shape can be quite complex.",

Applications include modeling constraints with nonlinear relationships. Careful graphing, test point selection, and algebraic solving are essential for success."
