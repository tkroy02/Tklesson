  "expanded_description": "Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize (maximize or minimize) a linear objective function subject to a set of linear constraints. When only two variables are involved, the problem can be solved graphically. The feasible region, defined by the system of inequalities, is graphed, and the optimal solution is found at one of the corner points of this region. This method has wide applications in business, economics, engineering, and resource allocation, helping decision-makers achieve the best outcome under limited resources.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In linear programming with two variables, the optimal solution to a linear objective function $z = ax + by$ subject to linear constraints occurs at a corner point (vertex) of the feasible region. To find it, graph the feasible region, identify all corner points, evaluate the objective function at each, and select the point that gives the maximum or minimum value.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a company that makes two products, each requiring certain amounts of labor and materials. The constraints (labor, materials) define a polygon of possible production combinations. The profit is a linear function of the quantities produced. Since the profit increases linearly, the maximum profit must occur at an extreme point of the polygon – a corner where two constraints meet. By checking each corner, you can find the optimal production plan. This is the essence of the graphical method.",

To find it, graph the constraints, identify all corner points (including intersections of boundaries and axes), evaluate the objective at each, and select the best value. Special cases include infeasible (no region), unbounded (no finite optimum), and multiple optimal solutions (objective parallel to a constraint edge). This method is widely used in resource allocation, production planning, and business optimization."
