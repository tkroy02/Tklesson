  "expanded_description": "Solving systems of linear equations in three variables extends the methods you already know from two variables. While a system of two equations represents lines whose intersection point is the solution, a system of three equations in three variables represents planes in three-dimensional space. The solution, if it exists, is typically a single point where all three planes intersect. The methods of elimination and substitution still apply, but require careful organization to avoid errors. Mastering this topic prepares you for linear algebra and applications in science, engineering, and economics where multiple constraints must be satisfied simultaneously.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A system of three linear equations in three variables can be solved by eliminating one variable at a time, reducing the system to two equations in two variables, then solving that subsystem, and finally back-substituting to find the third variable.",
    "explanation": "Think of it as a systematic process: first, pair up equations and eliminate the same variable from two different pairs, obtaining two new equations in the remaining two variables. Then solve that 2×2 system using substitution or elimination. Once you have those two values, plug them back into one of the original equations to find the third variable. This method works provided the system has a unique solution; if the system is inconsistent or dependent, you may find a contradiction or an identity instead.",
