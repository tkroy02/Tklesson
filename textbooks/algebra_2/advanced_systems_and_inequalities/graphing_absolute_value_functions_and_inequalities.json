  "expanded_description": "Absolute value functions have a distinctive V-shaped graph that is symmetric about a vertical line through the vertex. Understanding how to graph these functions, including transformations such as shifts, stretches, and reflections, is essential for solving absolute value equations and inequalities graphically. The parent function $f(x) = |x|$ has its vertex at the origin and opens upward. By applying transformations, you can graph any function of the form $f(x) = a|x - h| + k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex, $a$ determines the steepness and direction. Graphing absolute value inequalities extends this to shading regions above or below the graph, depending on the inequality sign.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The graph of an absolute value function $f(x) = a|x - h| + k$ is a V-shaped curve with vertex at $(h, k)$. The value of $a$ controls the steepness (if $|a| > 1$ the V is narrower, if $0 < |a| < 1$ it is wider) and the direction (if $a > 0$ it opens upward, if $a < 0$ it opens downward). The axis of symmetry is the vertical line $x = h$. To graph an absolute value inequality, first graph the boundary function (with =) as a solid or dashed V, then shade the region above or below depending on the inequality.",
    "explanation": "Think of the parent function $y = |x|$ as a V that meets the y‑axis at the origin. When you replace $x$ with $x-h$, the graph shifts horizontally so that the vertex moves to $(h,0)$. Adding $k$ outside moves it vertically. Multiplying by $a$ stretches or compresses the V vertically, and if $a$ is negative, it flips the V upside down. For inequalities, the graph of $y > a|x-h|+k$ is the region above the V, while $y < a|x-h|+k$ is the region below. The boundary is dashed for strict inequalities, solid for ≤ or ≥.",

  "summary": "Absolute value functions of the form $f(x) = a|x-h|+k$ produce V‑shaped graphs with vertex at $(h,k)$. The parameter $a$ controls steepness and direction (positive opens upward, negative downward). Transformations include horizontal shifts ($h$), vertical shifts ($k$), and vertical stretches/compressions ($|a|$). To graph an absolute value inequality, first graph the boundary V (solid for ≤, ≥; dashed for <, >), then shade above for ≥ or >, and below for ≤ or <. Graphically, absolute value equations are solved by finding intersections of the V with a horizontal line, and inequalities by determining where the V lies above or below that line. Understanding these graphs is essential for solving problems involving absolute value and for interpreting solutions in context."
