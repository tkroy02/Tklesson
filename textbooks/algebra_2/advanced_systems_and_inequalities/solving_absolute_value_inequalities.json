  "expanded_description": "Absolute value inequalities involve expressions like $|ax + b| < c$, $|ax + b| > c$, or more complex forms. Solving them requires understanding that absolute value represents distance from zero on the number line, so inequalities translate into compound statements. For $|X| < c$, the solution is the interval $-c < X < c$; for $|X| > c$, the solution is $X < -c$ or $X > c$. When the right side involves a variable, or when there are multiple absolute values, we use case analysis or the interval method. These inequalities appear in many contexts, such as error tolerances, range restrictions, and mathematical modeling.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For any real number $c > 0$, the inequality $|X| < c$ is equivalent to $-c < X < c$; $|X| > c$ is equivalent to $X < -c$ or $X > c$. If $c = 0$, $|X| < 0$ has no solution, $|X| \\le 0$ gives $X = 0$, and $|X| \\ge 0$ is all real numbers. For $c < 0$, $|X| < c$ has no solution, $|X| > c$ is all real numbers (since absolute value is always non-negative). When the absolute value is compared to an expression involving the variable, we must consider cases or use the interval method.",
    "explanation": "Imagine you are told that a number's distance from zero is less than 5. That number must be between -5 and 5. This is why $|x| < 5$ becomes $-5 < x < 5$. If the distance is greater than 5, the number is either less than -5 or greater than 5. These simple translations are the foundation for solving absolute value inequalities. When the expression inside the absolute value is more complex, you first isolate the absolute value, then apply the appropriate compound inequality, and finally solve the resulting linear inequalities.",

  "summary": "Absolute value inequalities are solved by translating them into compound statements. For $|ax+b| < c$ ($c>0$), the solution is $-c < ax+b < c$. For $|ax+b| > c$ ($c>0$), the solution is $ax+b < -c$ or $ax+b > c$. Special cases apply when $c \\le 0$. When the other side involves a variable, solve by considering cases or using the compound inequality approach, but always check that the solutions satisfy the original inequality. For inequalities with absolute values on both sides, squaring (or interval method) is effective. Common mistakes include forgetting the compound nature, sign errors when dividing by negatives, and not verifying solutions when the right side is variable. Mastering these techniques is crucial for modeling real-world constraints and for advanced mathematics."
