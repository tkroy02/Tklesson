  "expanded_description": "Systems of equations and inequalities are powerful tools for modeling and solving real-world problems. Whether you are determining the break-even point for a business, mixing chemicals in correct proportions, allocating investments, designing geometric shapes, or optimizing production under constraints, these mathematical techniques provide clarity and precision. This section brings together all the methods from previous sections—solving linear and nonlinear systems, graphing inequalities, and interpreting feasible regions—and applies them to practical situations. You will learn how to translate word problems into mathematical models, choose the appropriate solution method, and interpret the results in context.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Real-world problems involving multiple conditions can often be represented by systems of equations (when exact relationships are given) or systems of inequalities (when constraints or limits are involved). Solving these systems yields quantities that satisfy all conditions, and interpreting the solutions in the original context is essential for making informed decisions.",
    "explanation": "Consider a business that sells two products. The profit from each product depends on the number sold, and there are limits on resources. To find how many of each to sell to achieve a target profit while staying within resource limits, you set up a system of inequalities (resource constraints) and possibly an equation for the target profit. The feasible region gives possible combinations, and you might then optimize. In other cases, like mixing solutions of different concentrations, you have exact relationships that lead to a system of linear equations. The process always involves defining variables, translating words into equations/inequalities, solving, and checking reasonableness.",

The key steps are: define variables, translate conditions into equations/inequalities, solve using appropriate algebraic or graphical methods, and interpret results in context. Special attention must be paid to constraint directions, non-negativity, and whether solutions must be integers. Understanding these applications solidifies the connection between abstract mathematics and practical decision-making."
