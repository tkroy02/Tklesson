  "expanded_description": "Section 1.6 covers factoring polynomials - the process of rewriting a polynomial as a product of simpler expressions. Factoring is essentially the reverse of multiplication. Students will learn multiple factoring techniques including Greatest Common Factor (GCF), factoring trinomials, difference of squares, perfect square trinomials, and factoring by grouping. These skills are essential for solving quadratic equations, simplifying rational expressions, and finding zeros of functions.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Factoring** is writing a polynomial as a product of its factors. Common techniques include:\n\n• **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**: Factor out the largest common factor from all terms\n• **Trinomial Factoring**: For $ax^2 + bx + c$, find factors that multiply to $ac$ and add to $b$\n• **Difference of Squares**: $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$\n• **Perfect Square Trinomials**: $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$ and $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$\n• **Factoring by Grouping**: Group terms with common factors, then factor each group\n• **Sum/Difference of Cubes**: $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$, $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$",
    
    "explanation": "Think of factoring as reverse multiplication - like taking a building apart into its original bricks. If multiplication is \"what do you get when you multiply these expressions?\", factoring asks \"what expressions were multiplied to get this polynomial?\" Just as 12 can be factored as $3 \\times 4$ or $2 \\times 6$, polynomials can be factored into simpler polynomial factors. The GCF is like taking out common supplies from multiple construction projects - what does every term share?",

        "definition": "**Factoring** is the process of writing a polynomial as a product of two or more polynomials of lower degree.\n\n**General Factoring Strategy:**\n1. **Always check for a GCF first** - factor out the greatest common factor from all terms\n2. **Count the number of terms** - this determines which method to try next\n3. **For 2 terms**: Check for difference of squares ($a^2 - b^2$), sum/difference of cubes\n4. **For 3 terms**: Check for perfect square trinomial, then general trinomial factoring\n5. **For 4 terms**: Try factoring by grouping\n6. **Check your factors** - multiply to verify you get the original polynomial\n\n**Special Factoring Formulas:**\n• Difference of squares: $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$\n• Perfect square trinomials: $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$, $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$\n• Sum of cubes: $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$\n• Difference of cubes: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$",

  "summary": "Section 1.6 covers factoring polynomials - the reverse of polynomial multiplication. The general factoring strategy is: always check for a GCF first, then determine the number of terms. For 2 terms, check for difference of squares ($a^2 - b^2$) or sum/difference of cubes. For 3 terms, check for perfect square trinomials ($a^2 \\pm 2ab + b^2$) or factor using methods for $ax^2 + bx + c$ (trial and error or AC method/grouping). For 4 terms, try factoring by grouping. Always factor completely by checking if any factors can be factored further. Mastering these techniques is essential for solving quadratic equations, simplifying rational expressions, and understanding function behavior in more advanced mathematics.",
