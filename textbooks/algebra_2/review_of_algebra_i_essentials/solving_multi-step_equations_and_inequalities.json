  "expanded_description": "Section 1.1 reviews the fundamental techniques for solving multi-step equations and inequalities. These skills form the foundation for all algebraic problem-solving. Students will learn to apply inverse operations, combine like terms, and use the distributive property while maintaining equality or inequality relationships. Special attention is given to the critical rule that multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Solving Multi-Step Equations**:\n• Simplify both sides (distribute, combine like terms)\n• Move variable terms to one side using inverse operations\n• Isolate the variable using addition/subtraction, then multiplication/division\n• Check your solution in the original equation\n\n**Solving Multi-Step Inequalities**:\n• Follow the same steps as equations\n• **CRITICAL**: When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, reverse the inequality sign\n• Graph solutions on a number line with open circles for < or > and closed circles for ≤ or ≥",
    
    "explanation": "Think of solving equations as unwrapping a present - you undo operations in reverse order. If \"x\" was multiplied by 3 and then had 5 added, you subtract 5 first, then divide by 3. For inequalities, imagine a seesaw that tips over when you multiply or divide by negatives - the direction of the inequality flips!",

Key steps include simplifying using distribution and combining like terms, moving variables to one side, and isolating the variable using inverse operations. For inequalities, the critical rule is that multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. Equations may have one solution, no solution (contradiction), or all real numbers (identity). These foundational skills are essential for success in all subsequent algebra topics.",
