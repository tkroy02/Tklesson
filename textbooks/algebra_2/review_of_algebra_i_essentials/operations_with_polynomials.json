  "expanded_description": "Section 1.5 covers operations with polynomials - adding, subtracting, and multiplying these algebraic expressions. Polynomials are expressions with variables raised to whole number exponents, such as $3x^2 - 2x + 5$. Students will learn to combine like terms when adding or subtracting, and use the distributive property (including FOIL for binomials) when multiplying. These skills form the foundation for factoring, solving equations, and working with rational expressions in subsequent sections.",

    "principle": "**Polynomials**: Algebraic expressions of the form $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0$ where $a_n \\neq 0$ and $n$ is a whole number.\n\n**Operations**:\n• **Addition/Subtraction**: Combine like terms (same variable and exponent)\n• **Multiplication**: Use distributive property - multiply each term in first polynomial by each term in second\n• **FOIL**: Special case for binomials: First, Outer, Inner, Last\n• **Special Products**: $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$",
    
    "explanation": "Think of polynomials as collections of building blocks - terms with the same variable and exponent are like identical blocks that can be combined. Multiplying polynomials is like using an area model - each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second, just like finding the total area of a rectangle split into smaller rectangles. FOIL is just a handy reminder for binomial multiplication, not a special rule!",

Only like terms can be combined through addition or subtraction.\n\n**Addition/Subtraction**: Combine coefficients of like terms, keeping the variable and exponent the same.\n\n**Multiplication**: Each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. Use distributive property: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ extended to polynomials.\n\n**Special Products to Memorize**:\n• $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$\n• $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$\n• $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$",

  "summary": "Section 1.5 covers operations with polynomials. When adding or subtracting polynomials, combine only like terms - those with the same variable and exponent. When subtracting, distribute the negative sign to all terms in the second polynomial. When multiplying polynomials, use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second, then combine like terms. For binomial multiplication, FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) provides a helpful mnemonic. Special product patterns - perfect squares $(a \\pm b)^2 = a^2 \\pm 2ab + b^2$ and difference of squares $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$ - allow for efficient multiplication when recognized. These skills are essential for factoring, solving equations, and working with rational expressions in subsequent sections.",
