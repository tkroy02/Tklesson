  "expanded_description": "Section 1.3 covers graphing linear equations and inequalities on the coordinate plane. Students will learn to graph lines using slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and standard form, as well as how to graph linear inequalities by drawing boundary lines and shading appropriate regions. These skills bridge algebraic equations with visual representations, making abstract relationships concrete and interpretable.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Linear Equations**: Equations whose graphs are straight lines. Key forms include:\n• Slope-intercept: $y = mx + b$ (slope $m$, y-intercept $b$)\n• Point-slope: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ (slope $m$ through point $(x_1, y_1)$)\n• Standard: $Ax + By = C$ (intercepts easily found)\n\n**Linear Inequalities**: Similar to equations but with $<, >, \\le, \\ge$ symbols. Graph by:\n1. Graph the boundary line (dashed for $<$ or $>$, solid for $\\le$ or $\\ge$)\n2. Test a point not on the line\n3. Shade the region where the inequality is true",
    
    "explanation": "Think of graphing as giving directions to a treasure. A linear equation is like a path - follow the slope (rise over run) from a starting point. For inequalities, imagine coloring one side of a fence - the boundary line is the fence, and you shade where the treasure (solutions) can be found. Test a point to know which side to color!",

  "summary": "Section 1.3 covers graphing linear equations and inequalities. Linear equations can be graphed using slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), point-slope form ($y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$), or standard form ($Ax + By = C$) by finding intercepts or converting to slope-intercept form. Slope measures steepness as rise over run, with positive slope rising left to right, negative slope falling left to right, zero slope for horizontal lines, and undefined slope for vertical lines. For inequalities, graph the boundary line first (solid for $\\le$ or $\\ge$, dashed for $<$ or $>$), then test a point to determine which side to shade. Real-world applications often include additional constraints like non-negativity. These graphing skills provide visual understanding of linear relationships and are essential for solving systems and optimization problems.",
