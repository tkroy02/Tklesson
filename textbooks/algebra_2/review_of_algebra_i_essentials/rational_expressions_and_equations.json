  "expanded_description": "Section 1.9 covers rational expressions and equations - fractions that contain variables in the numerator, denominator, or both. Students will learn to simplify rational expressions by factoring and canceling common factors, perform operations (multiply, divide, add, subtract) with rational expressions, and solve rational equations by clearing denominators. A critical skill is identifying excluded values - values that make denominators zero, which are not part of the domain. These concepts are essential for understanding rates, proportions, and complex algebraic relationships in advanced mathematics and real-world applications.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Rational Expressions**: Fractions of the form $\\frac{P}{Q}$ where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials and $Q \\neq 0$.\n\n**Domain Restrictions**: Values that make denominator zero are excluded.\n\n**Simplifying**: Factor numerator and denominator, cancel common factors.\n\n**Operations**:\n• **Multiplication**: $\\frac{P}{Q} \\cdot \\frac{R}{S} = \\frac{P \\cdot R}{Q \\cdot S}$ (factor first, then cancel)\n• **Division**: $\\frac{P}{Q} \\div \\frac{R}{S} = \\frac{P}{Q} \\cdot \\frac{S}{R}$ (multiply by reciprocal)\n• **Addition/Subtraction**: Find common denominator, combine numerators\n\n**Rational Equations**: Multiply both sides by the LCD to clear denominators, solve resulting equation, then check for extraneous solutions (values that make original denominators zero).",
    
    "explanation": "Think of rational expressions as regular fractions with variables. Just like $\\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$ (divide numerator and denominator by 2), you can simplify $\\frac{x^2-4}{x-2} = x+2$ (after factoring and canceling). The big rule: NEVER let a denominator be zero - those x-values are forbidden! Solving rational equations is like clearing fractions in algebra - multiply through by the common denominator to eliminate fractions, but always check your answers because sometimes they're \"extras\" that make denominators zero!",

Find excluded values by setting each denominator factor equal to zero.\n\n**Simplifying Rational Expressions**:\n1. Factor numerator and denominator completely\n2. Identify common factors\n3. Cancel common factors\n4. Note restrictions from ORIGINAL denominator\n\n**Operations with Rational Expressions**:\n• **Multiplication**: Factor first, then multiply numerators and denominators, cancel common factors\n• **Division**: Multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor, then multiply as above\n• **Addition/Subtraction**: Find LCD, rewrite each fraction with LCD, combine numerators, simplify\n\n**Solving Rational Equations**:\n1. Find the LCD of all denominators\n2. Multiply both sides of equation by LCD\n3. Solve the resulting polynomial equation\n4.

  "summary": "Section 1.9 covers rational expressions and equations. Rational expressions are fractions with polynomials. Always identify excluded values (where denominators = 0) first. Simplify by factoring and canceling common factors. For multiplication and division, factor first, then multiply numerators/denominators and cancel. For addition and subtraction, find the LCD, rewrite each fraction, combine numerators, and simplify. To solve rational equations, multiply both sides by the LCD to clear denominators, solve the resulting polynomial equation, and check for extraneous solutions (values that make any original denominator zero). Applications include work problems (rates adding) and distance-rate-time problems. Mastering rational expressions is essential for advanced algebra, calculus, and real-world problem-solving.",
