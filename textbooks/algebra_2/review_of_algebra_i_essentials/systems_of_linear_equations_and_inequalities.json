  "expanded_description": "Section 1.4 covers systems of linear equations and inequalities - solving problems with multiple conditions simultaneously. Students will learn to solve 2x2 systems using three methods: graphing (finding intersection points), substitution (replacing one variable with an equivalent expression), and elimination (adding equations to cancel variables). The section also covers systems of inequalities, where the solution is the overlapping shaded region. These techniques are essential for real-world problems with multiple constraints, such as break-even analysis, mixture problems, and optimization.",

    "principle": "**Systems of Linear Equations**: Two or more linear equations with the same variables. The solution is the point(s) that satisfy all equations simultaneously.\n\n**Solution Methods**:\n• **Graphing**: Graph both lines; intersection point is solution\n• **Substitution**: Solve one equation for a variable, substitute into the other\n• **Elimination**: Add or subtract equations to eliminate a variable\n\n**Types of Solutions**:\n• **One solution**: Lines intersect at one point (consistent, independent)\n• **No solution**: Parallel lines (inconsistent)\n• **Infinite solutions**: Same line (consistent, dependent)\n\n**Systems of Inequalities**: Solution is the overlapping region where all inequalities are true",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a system of equations as solving a mystery where two different clues must both be true. Where the clues intersect is your answer! For example, \"the sum of two numbers is 10\" and \"their difference is 4\" - only one pair works (7 and 3). For inequalities, imagine overlapping colored regions on a map - the solution is where all colors overlap, like finding a location that satisfies multiple conditions at once (within budget, within time, etc.).",

  "summary": "Section 1.4 covers systems of linear equations and inequalities. For 2x2 systems, three methods are available: graphing (visual, good for estimation), substitution (isolate and replace), and elimination (add/subtract to cancel variables). Systems can have one solution (intersecting lines), no solution (parallel lines), or infinite solutions (same line). For systems of inequalities, graph each inequality separately, then identify the overlapping region where all conditions are satisfied. Real-world applications include break-even analysis, mixture problems, and optimization under multiple constraints. These skills are essential for understanding relationships between multiple conditions and for preparing for linear programming and more advanced applications in later mathematics courses.",
