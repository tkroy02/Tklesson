  "expanded_description": "Section 1.2 provides a comprehensive review of functions, domain, and range - fundamental concepts that describe how mathematical relationships work. Students will learn to identify functions using the vertical line test, determine appropriate domains based on mathematical restrictions and real-world context, and find corresponding ranges. These concepts are essential for understanding how quantities relate to each other and form the basis for more advanced topics in algebra, calculus, and data analysis.",

    "explanation": "Think of a function as a vending machine - you press a button (input) and get exactly one snack (output). If pressing B3 sometimes gave chips and sometimes gave candy, that machine wouldn't be reliable! The domain is all the buttons that work (that have snacks), and the range is all the snacks you can possibly get. Some buttons might be broken (not in domain), and some snacks might never come out (not in range).",

  "summary": "Section 1.2 covers the fundamental concepts of functions, domain, and range. A function is a relation where each input corresponds to exactly one output, which can be verified using the vertical line test on graphs. Domain is the set of all possible inputs, with common restrictions from square roots (radicand ≥ 0), denominators (≠ 0), and real-world context. Range is the set of all possible outputs. Function notation $f(x)$ allows us to evaluate functions at specific values or expressions. Understanding these concepts is essential for working with any type of function and forms the foundation for graphing, transformations, and advanced topics in mathematics.",
