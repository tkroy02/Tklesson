  "expanded_description": "Section 1.7 covers quadratic functions and their graphs. Quadratic functions, written as $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a \\neq 0$, create U-shaped curves called parabolas. Students will learn to identify key features including the vertex (maximum or minimum point), axis of symmetry, intercepts, and direction of opening. The section also covers the three forms of quadratic functions (standard, vertex, and factored form) and how to convert between them. Understanding quadratic graphs is essential for solving optimization problems, modeling projectile motion, and analyzing patterns in data.",

    "principle": "**Quadratic Functions**: Functions of the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a \\neq 0$. Their graphs are parabolas.\n\n**Key Features of Parabolas:**\n• **Vertex**: The turning point - minimum if $a > 0$, maximum if $a < 0$\n• **Axis of Symmetry**: Vertical line through the vertex: $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$\n• **Direction**: Opens up if $a > 0$, opens down if $a < 0$\n• **y-intercept**: $(0, c)$\n• **x-intercepts**: Solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ (also called roots or zeros)\n\n**Forms of Quadratic Functions:**\n• **Standard form**: $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ - gives y-intercept directly\n• **Vertex form**: $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ - vertex at $(h, k)$\n• **Factored form**: $f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$ - x-intercepts at $r_1$ and $r_2$",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a parabola like the path of a ball thrown in the air - it rises to a peak (vertex) then falls back down. The \"a\" value determines how steep the curve is and whether it opens up (like a smile) or down (like a frown). The vertex is the highest or lowest point - the ball's maximum height or the minimum point of a valley. The axis of symmetry is like a mirror line - the left and right sides are mirror images. Each form of a quadratic reveals different information, like different views of the same picture!",

  "summary": "Section 1.7 covers quadratic functions and their parabolic graphs. Key features include the vertex (maximum or minimum point), axis of symmetry (vertical line through vertex), direction of opening (up if $a > 0$, down if $a < 0$), y-intercept ($(0, c)$), and x-intercepts (roots, found by solving $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$). Quadratics can be written in three forms: standard ($ax^2 + bx + c$), vertex ($a(x - h)^2 + k$), and factored ($a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$). Converting between forms uses techniques like completing the square. Applications include projectile motion (finding maximum height, time to ground) and optimization problems (maximizing area). Understanding quadratic graphs provides essential tools for modeling and solving real-world problems.",
