  "expanded_description": "The Fundamental Counting Principle (FCP) is a cornerstone of combinatorics. It states that if one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second independent event can occur in $n$ ways, then the number of ways both events can occur in sequence is $m \\times n$. This simple but powerful principle extends to any number of events and forms the basis for solving complex counting problems without having to list all possibilities. Understanding the FCP is essential for mastering permutations, combinations, and probability calculations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Fundamental Counting Principle: If a task consists of $k$ stages, where the first stage can be completed in $n_1$ ways, the second stage in $n_2$ ways, and so on, then the total number of ways to complete the entire task is $n_1 \\times n_2 \\times n_3 \\times \\cdots \\times n_k$.",
    "explanation": "Think of the FCP as a multiplication shortcut. Instead of listing all possibilities, you multiply the number of choices at each step. For example, if you have 3 shirts and 4 pairs of pants, you have $3 \\times 4 = 12$ possible outfits. Each shirt can be paired with each pair of pants. The principle works because choices at each stage are independent—choosing a shirt doesn't affect which pants you can choose.",

When choices are made without replacement, the number of options decreases at each stage. For problems with multiple mutually exclusive conditions, break into cases, count each using FCP, and add the results. Complementary counting (total minus unwanted cases) is often useful. In probability, FCP helps count total and favorable outcomes. Common mistakes include adding instead of multiplying, forgetting to adjust for restrictions, not handling multiple cases correctly, and misapplying FCP when order matters. The FCP is essential in password security, menu planning, license plate design, and genetics.",
