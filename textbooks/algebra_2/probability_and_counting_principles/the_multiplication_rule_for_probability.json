  "expanded_description": "The multiplication rule is a fundamental tool for finding the probability that two or more events occur together. It connects joint probabilities with conditional probabilities and is essential for analyzing sequential events, such as drawing cards without replacement or conducting multi-stage experiments. Understanding the multiplication rule and its application to both independent and dependent events is crucial for solving complex probability problems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For any two events A and B, the probability that both occur is $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A) = P(B) \\cdot P(A|B)$. If A and B are independent, then $P(B|A) = P(B)$, so the rule simplifies to $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)$.",
    "explanation": "Think of the multiplication rule as a way to find the probability of a sequence of events by multiplying probabilities along the way. When events are dependent, the probability of the second event changes based on the outcome of the first, so we use conditional probability. When events are independent, the first outcome doesn't affect the second, so we can simply multiply the individual probabilities. Tree diagrams are often helpful for visualizing the multiplication rule in action.",

  "summary": "The multiplication rule finds the probability that two or more events occur together. For dependent events, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A)$. For independent events, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)$. For three or more events, extend the rule: $P(A \\cap B \\cap C) = P(A) \\times P(B|A) \\times P(C|A \\cap B)$ for dependent events, or simply multiply individual probabilities for independent events. Tree diagrams are excellent tools for visualizing and applying the multiplication rule to multi-stage problems. Common mistakes include treating dependent events as independent, forgetting to update probabilities in without-replacement problems, confusing \"and\" with \"or,\" and misordering conditional probabilities. The multiplication rule has practical applications in quality control, genetics, reliability engineering, and gambling.",
