  "expanded_description": "Probability problems often involve counting the number of favorable outcomes and total outcomes. Permutations and combinations provide the counting tools needed to handle complex probability scenarios where listing all outcomes is impractical. From card games to lottery odds to quality control sampling, these techniques allow us to calculate probabilities in situations with large sample spaces. Understanding how to apply permutations and combinations in probability is essential for advanced work in statistics, gambling analysis, and risk assessment.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "When all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of an event is $P(E) = \\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of outcomes}}$. Permutations and combinations are used to count both the numerator and denominator when dealing with selections and arrangements.",
    "explanation": "Think of permutations and combinations as the tools that let you count without listing. If you're drawing cards from a deck, the total number of possible 5-card hands is a combination because order doesn't matter. If you're arranging people in a line, the total number of arrangements is a permutation because order matters. By using these counting techniques correctly, you can find probabilities for complex events like getting a flush in poker or winning the lottery.",

  "summary": "Probability with permutations and combinations uses counting techniques to find probabilities in complex situations. The basic formula remains $P(E) = \\frac{\\text{favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}$, but permutations and combinations provide the counting tools. Use combinations when order doesn't matter (card hands, committee selection, lottery numbers). Use permutations when order matters (arrangements, ordered selections). For (at least) problems, either sum the probabilities for each case or use the complement rule: $P(\\text{at least }k) = 1 - P(\\text{less than }k)$. Common mistakes include using permutations when combinations are needed, forgetting to account for all cases in (at least) problems, double-counting, and misapplying the complement. These techniques are essential in gambling analysis, quality control, genetics, and lottery design.",
