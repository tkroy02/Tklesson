  "expanded_description": "Expected value is one of the most important concepts in probability and statistics. It represents the long-run average outcome of a random phenomenon, telling us what we can expect to happen on average over many repetitions. From gambling and insurance to investment decisions and quality control, expected value helps quantify risk and guide decision-making. Understanding how to calculate and interpret expected value is essential for anyone who needs to make decisions under uncertainty.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The expected value (or mean) of a discrete random variable X is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing all these products: $E(X) = \\sum x \\cdot P(x)$. This represents the long-run average value of the random variable over many independent trials.",
    "explanation": "Think of expected value as a weighted average, where each possible outcome is weighted by how likely it is to occur. If you play a game many times, your average winnings per game will approach the expected value. A positive expected value means the game is favorable in the long run; a negative expected value means you will lose money over time. Casinos design all their games to have negative expected value for players, ensuring their profits.",

In gambling, it represents average profit or loss per game; a fair game has expected value zero. Insurance companies use expected value to set premiums based on expected payouts. Businesses use expected value to evaluate decisions under uncertainty. For binomial random variables, $E(X) = np$ simplifies calculations. Common mistakes include forgetting to include all outcomes, confusing gross winnings with net gain, misinterpreting expected value as a single-trial prediction, and using incorrect probabilities. Expected value is fundamental in insurance, gambling, investment, and public policy, wherever decisions must be made in the face of uncertainty.",
