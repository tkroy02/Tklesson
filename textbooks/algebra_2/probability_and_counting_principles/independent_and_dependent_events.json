  "expanded_description": "Understanding whether events are independent or dependent is crucial for correctly applying probability rules. Independent events are those where the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. Dependent events are those where the outcome of one event influences the probability of the other. Distinguishing between these types of events determines whether we use the simple multiplication rule $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ or the general multiplication rule $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B|A)$. This distinction has important implications in fields ranging from quality control to medical testing.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Two events A and B are independent if and only if $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)$. Equivalently, they are independent if $P(A|B) = P(A)$ and $P(B|A) = P(B)$. If these conditions do not hold, the events are dependent.",
    "explanation": "Think of independence as meaning \"no influence.\" If knowing that B happened tells you nothing about whether A happened, then A and B are independent. For example, the result of a coin flip doesn't affect the result of the next coin flip. In contrast, drawing cards without replacement creates dependence because knowing the first card changes the probabilities for the second card. The mathematical definition captures this by comparing the joint probability to the product of individual probabilities.",

Dependent events are those where one event influences the probability of the other. The multiplication rule reflects this: for independent events, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$; for dependent events, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B|A)$. Common situations: with replacement leads to independence; without replacement leads to dependence. To test for independence, compare $P(A \\cap B)$ to $P(A)P(B)$ or check whether $P(A|B) = P(A)$. Common mistakes include treating without-replacement events as independent, confusing mutually exclusive with independent, misunderstanding replacement status, and misinterpreting the meaning of independence. Understanding independence is crucial in medical testing, quality control, weather forecasting, and genetics.",
