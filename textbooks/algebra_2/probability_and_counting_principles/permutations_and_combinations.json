  "expanded_description": "Permutations and combinations are fundamental counting techniques used to determine the number of ways to arrange or select items. The key distinction is whether order matters. Permutations count arrangements where order is important, like the order of finishers in a race or the arrangement of books on a shelf. Combinations count selections where order is not important, like choosing a committee or selecting lottery numbers. These counting methods are essential for probability calculations and appear throughout mathematics, statistics, and computer science.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Permutations count the number of ways to arrange $r$ items selected from $n$ distinct items when order matters: $P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$. Combinations count the number of ways to choose $r$ items from $n$ distinct items when order does not matter: $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.",
    "explanation": "Think of permutations as ordered arrangements. If you're lining up books, swapping two books creates a different arrangement, so order matters. Combinations are selections without regard to order. If you're choosing a committee, the set of people is the same regardless of the order they were chosen. The formulas reflect this: permutations divide by $(n-r)!$ to account for the arrangements of the unchosen items, while combinations also divide by $r!$ to account for the fact that the chosen items can be rearranged without creating a new combination.",
