  "expanded_description": "Probability is the mathematical language of uncertainty. It provides a framework for quantifying how likely events are to occur, from simple coin flips to complex weather forecasts. The basic principles of probability form the foundation for all of statistics, risk assessment, and decision-making under uncertainty. Understanding sample spaces, events, and how to calculate probabilities is essential for anyone working with data or making predictions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The probability of an event $E$, denoted $P(E)$, is a number between 0 and 1 that measures the likelihood that $E$ will occur. In a sample space where all outcomes are equally likely, $P(E) = \\frac{\\text{number of outcomes in }E}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}}$.",
    "explanation": "Think of probability as a fraction: the number of ways the event you're interested in can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. A probability of 0 means the event never happens, 1 means it always happens, and values in between represent varying degrees of likelihood. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes—every possibility that could occur in the situation you're analyzing.",

The sample space $S$ is the set of all possible outcomes, and an event $E$ is a subset of $S$. The complement of an event, $E'$, consists of all outcomes not in $E$, and $P(E') = 1 - P(E)$. Common mistakes include confusing outcomes and events, assuming outcomes are equally likely when they aren't, miscounting the sample space, and incorrectly adding probabilities of overlapping events. Probability is essential in weather forecasting, medical testing, gambling, and countless other real-world applications.",
