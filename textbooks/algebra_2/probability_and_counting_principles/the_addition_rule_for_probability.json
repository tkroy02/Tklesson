  "expanded_description": "The addition rule is a fundamental tool for calculating the probability of combined events, specifically the probability that either event A or event B occurs. The rule differs depending on whether the events are mutually exclusive (they cannot occur at the same time) or not. Understanding this rule is essential for working with compound events and for interpreting probabilities in real-world situations where multiple outcomes are possible, such as risk assessment, quality control, and medical testing.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For any two events A and B, the probability of A or B occurring is: $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$. If A and B are mutually exclusive (cannot happen together), then $P(A \\cap B) = 0$, so $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.",
    "explanation": "Think of the addition rule as a way to avoid double-counting. When you add the probabilities of A and B, you've counted the outcomes that are in both A and B twice. Subtracting the probability of their intersection corrects this double-count. If the events can't happen at the same time, there's no overlap, so you can simply add. This rule is sometimes called the inclusion-exclusion principle for two events.",

For non-mutually exclusive events (with overlap), $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$. This subtraction corrects for double-counting outcomes that satisfy both conditions. The rule extends to three events: $P(A \\cup B \\cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \\cap B) - P(A \\cap C) - P(B \\cap C) + P(A \\cap B \\cap C)$. Common mistakes include forgetting to subtract the intersection for overlapping events, confusing union (or) with intersection (and), and miscounting the intersection outcomes. The addition rule has practical applications in quality control (calculating overall defect rates), medical screening (probability of having at least one condition), insurance (risk assessment), and marketing (customer behavior analysis). Understanding this rule is essential for correctly interpreting probabilities in real-world situations where events may or may not overlap.",
