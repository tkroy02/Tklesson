  "expanded_description": "The addition rule is a fundamental tool for calculating the probability of combined events, specifically the probability that either event A or event B occurs. The rule differs depending on whether the events are mutually exclusive (they cannot occur at the same time) or not. Understanding this rule is essential for working with compound events and for interpreting probabilities in real-world situations where multiple outcomes are possible.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For any two events A and B, the probability of A or B occurring is: <br><br> $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$ <br><br> If A and B are mutually exclusive (cannot happen together), then $P(A \\cap B) = 0$, so $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.",
    "explanation": "Think of the addition rule as a way to avoid double-counting. When you add the probabilities of A and B, you've counted the outcomes that are in both A and B twice. Subtracting the probability of their intersection corrects this double-count. If the events can't happen at the same time, there's no overlap, so you can simply add.",

For non-mutually exclusive events (possible overlap), $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$. For three events, $P(A \\cup B \\cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \\cap B) - P(A \\cap C) - P(B \\cap C) + P(A \\cap B \\cap C)$. Common mistakes include forgetting to subtract the intersection for overlapping events, subtracting incorrectly, confusing union with intersection, and mishandling percentages. The addition rule is essential in quality control, medical screening, insurance, and many other fields where we need the probability of at least one event occurring.",
