  "expanded_description": "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. This concept is fundamental in understanding how probabilities change when we have additional information. From medical testing to weather forecasting, conditional probability helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. It also forms the foundation for more advanced topics like Bayes' theorem and statistical inference.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The conditional probability of event A given that event B has occurred is denoted $P(A|B)$ and is calculated as $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, provided $P(B) > 0$.",
    "explanation": "Think of conditional probability as narrowing down the sample space. When we know that B has occurred, we no longer consider all possible outcomes—only those that are in B. The probability of A given B is then the proportion of outcomes in B that are also in A. This is why we divide by $P(B)$: it's the fraction of the original sample space that remains possible.",

This can be rearranged to give the multiplication rule: $P(A \\cap B) = P(B) \\cdot P(A|B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)$. In two-way tables, conditional probabilities are found by dividing the cell count by the row or column total of the conditioning event. Common mistakes include reversing the condition ($P(A|B)$ vs $P(B|A)$), forgetting to restrict the sample space when conditioning, assuming independence in without-replacement problems, and misinterpreting the phrasing of \"given\" problems. Conditional probability is essential in medical testing (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values), weather forecasting, and forensic science, where probabilities must be updated based on new information.",
