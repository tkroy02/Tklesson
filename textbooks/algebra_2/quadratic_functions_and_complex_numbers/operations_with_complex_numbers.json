  "expanded_description": "Operations with complex numbers follow many of the same rules as operations with real numbers, with the added dimension of the imaginary unit $i$. Addition and subtraction combine like terms—real with real, imaginary with imaginary. Multiplication uses the distributive property (or FOIL) and simplifies using the key fact that $i^2 = -1$. These operations are essential for working with complex numbers in equations, graphing, and real-world applications. Mastering them builds a foundation for more advanced topics like complex conjugates, division, and solving quadratic equations with complex solutions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Complex numbers in standard form $a + bi$ are added, subtracted, and multiplied by treating $i$ as a algebraic variable, with the special rule that $i^2 = -1$ whenever it appears.",
    "explanation": "Think of complex number arithmetic as working with two independent dimensions. Addition and subtraction combine the real parts and imaginary parts separately—like combining like terms in algebra. Multiplication distributes across both parts, and whenever you get an $i^2$ term, you replace it with $-1$, which may convert imaginary products into real numbers. This systematic approach keeps complex arithmetic organized and predictable.",

  "summary": "Operations with complex numbers extend familiar algebraic rules with the special property $i^2 = -1$. For addition and subtraction, combine real parts with real parts and imaginary parts with imaginary parts—essentially combining like terms. For multiplication, use FOIL or the distributive property to multiply as binomials, then replace every $i^2$ with $-1$ before combining like terms. The product of a complex number and its conjugate $(a+bi)(a-bi)$ always yields the real number $a^2 + b^2$, a useful pattern for division. Powers of $i$ follow a cycle every 4 exponents: $i^1 = i$, $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$. Common mistakes include forgetting to replace $i^2$ with $-1$, sign errors in subtraction, and misapplying the conjugate product pattern. Mastering these operations prepares you for more advanced topics like complex division and solving quadratic equations with complex solutions.",
