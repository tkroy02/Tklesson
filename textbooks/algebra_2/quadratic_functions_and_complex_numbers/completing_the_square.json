  "expanded_description": "Completing the square is a powerful algebraic technique that transforms any quadratic function from standard form (ax² + bx + c) into vertex form (a(x - h)² + k). This conversion is essential because vertex form reveals the parabola's vertex directly, making it easier to graph quadratic functions and solve optimization problems. Beyond graphing, completing the square is also the foundation for deriving the quadratic formula and solving quadratic equations that don't factor easily.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Completing the square creates a perfect square trinomial from the x² and x terms of a quadratic expression, allowing it to be written as the square of a binomial plus a constant. This reveals the vertex coordinates and makes the function's transformations explicit.",
    "explanation": "Think of completing the square as \"reassembling\" a squared binomial. When you square a binomial like (x + d)², you get x² + 2dx + d²—a perfect square trinomial. Completing the square works backward: given x² + bx, you add and subtract (b/2)² to create a perfect square trinomial while keeping the expression equivalent to the original. The result reveals the horizontal and vertical shifts from the parent function y = x².",

  "summary": "Completing the square is a versatile algebraic technique that transforms quadratic expressions from standard form (ax² + bx + c) into vertex form (a(x - h)² + k). The process differs based on the leading coefficient: when a = 1, simply add and subtract (b/2)²; when a ≠ 1, first factor a from the x² and x terms before completing the square inside the parentheses. This technique serves multiple purposes: it reveals the vertex coordinates for graphing and optimization, provides a method for solving quadratic equations (by isolating the squared term and taking square roots), and forms the basis for deriving the quadratic formula. Common mistakes include forgetting to factor out a first, sign errors when reading the vertex from vertex form, incorrectly distributing the subtracted term when a ≠ 1, and forgetting the ± symbol when taking square roots. Mastering completing the square gives you flexibility in working with quadratic functions and equations in both pure mathematics and real-world applications like projectile motion and profit maximization.",
