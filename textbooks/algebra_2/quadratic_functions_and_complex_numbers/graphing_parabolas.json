  "expanded_description": "Quadratic functions, which graph as parabolas, are fundamental in algebra and appear throughout mathematics and science. Mastering the three forms of quadratic equations—standard, vertex, and intercept—is essential because each form reveals different features of the parabola. Standard form shows the y-intercept, vertex form reveals the vertex directly, and intercept form displays the x-intercepts. Understanding how to graph from each form and convert between them provides flexibility in problem-solving.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Every quadratic function can be written in three equivalent forms: standard form (y = ax² + bx + c), vertex form (y = a(x - h)² + k), and intercept form (y = a(x - p)(x - q)). Each form highlights specific graph features: the y-intercept, the vertex, or the x-intercepts, respectively.",
    "explanation": "Think of these three forms like different lenses for viewing a parabola. Standard form is like a wide-angle lens showing where it crosses the y-axis. Vertex form zooms in on the turning point. Intercept form highlights where it crosses the x-axis. The value of 'a' is the same in all forms and controls whether the parabola opens upward or downward and how wide it is.",

Each form highlights different features of the parabola: standard form reveals the y-intercept (c) and allows vertex calculation using x = -b/(2a); vertex form directly shows the vertex (h, k); intercept form immediately gives the x-intercepts (p, 0) and (q, 0). The value of a in all forms determines whether the parabola opens upward (a > 0) or downward (a < 0) and affects its width. Converting between forms is essential—use completing the square to go from standard to vertex, factoring or the quadratic formula to get intercept form, and expansion to return to standard form. When graphing, choose the most efficient approach based on the given form. Understanding these three forms provides flexibility in solving real-world problems involving maximum/minimum values (vertex form) or finding when a function equals zero (intercept form).",
