  "expanded_description": "Complex numbers expand the real number system to include solutions to equations like $x^2 + 1 = 0$, which have no real solutions. By introducing the imaginary unit $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, we create a complete number system where every quadratic equation has solutions. Complex numbers are essential not only in algebra but also in engineering, physics, signal processing, and many other fields. They follow consistent rules for arithmetic and have a standard form that makes them easy to work with.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A complex number is any number that can be written in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit defined by $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ (so $i^2 = -1$). The real number $a$ is called the real part, and $b$ is called the imaginary part.",
    "explanation": "Think of complex numbers as expanding the number line into a number plane. Real numbers live on the horizontal axis; pure imaginary numbers (like $2i$, $-5i$) live on the vertical axis; and complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts fill the entire plane. This geometric interpretation helps visualize complex number operations.",

Every complex number can be written in standard form $a + bi$, where $a$ (the real part) and $b$ (the imaginary part) are real numbers. Powers of $i$ follow a repeating cycle every 4 exponents: $i^1 = i$, $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$. Square roots of negative numbers become imaginary numbers: $\\sqrt{-n} = i\\sqrt{n}$. Complex numbers can be visualized as points in the complex plane, with the horizontal axis representing real parts and the vertical axis representing imaginary parts. Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal—this gives two real equations from one complex equation. Understanding complex numbers is essential for advanced mathematics and has practical applications in electrical engineering, quantum mechanics, signal processing, and many other fields.",
