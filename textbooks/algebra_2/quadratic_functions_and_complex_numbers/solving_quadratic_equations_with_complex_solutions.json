  "expanded_description": "Solving quadratic equations often leads to solutions that are not real numbers. When the discriminant is negative, the quadratic formula produces square roots of negative numbers, resulting in complex solutions. These solutions always come in conjugate pairs and have the form $a + bi$ and $a - bi$. Understanding how to find and interpret complex solutions completes our study of quadratic equations and connects to the broader complex number system. This knowledge is essential for advanced mathematics and has practical applications in engineering and physics.",

    "principle": "When a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has a negative discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac < 0$), it has two complex conjugate solutions: $x = \\frac{-b}{2a} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{4ac - b^2}}{2a}i$.",
    "explanation": "Think of complex solutions as the quadratic's way of telling us that its graph never crosses the $x$-axis. The parabola lives entirely above or below the axis, so its roots exist in the complex plane instead. The real part $\\frac{-b}{2a}$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, and the imaginary part involves the distance from the vertex to the $x$-axis. The $\\pm$ gives us the conjugate pair, reflecting symmetry across the real axis in the complex plane.",

  "summary": "Quadratic equations with real coefficients have complex solutions when the discriminant is negative ($\\Delta < 0$). These solutions are found using the quadratic formula, replacing $\\sqrt{\\text{negative}}$ with $i\\sqrt{\\text{positive}}$. The solutions always come in conjugate pairs: $a + bi$ and $a - bi$, where $a = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ (the $x$-coordinate of the vertex) and $b = \\frac{\\sqrt{|\\Delta|}}{2a}$. Graphically, the parabola does not cross the $x$-axis—the vertex lies above the axis if $a > 0$ or below if $a < 0$. The complex roots are symmetric about the real axis in the complex plane, with the same real part as the vertex's $x$-coordinate. Common mistakes include forgetting the $\\pm$ for the conjugate pair, incorrectly simplifying $\\sqrt{-n}$, not dividing both real and imaginary parts by the denominator, and thinking complex means \"no solution.\" Complex solutions are essential in engineering applications like RLC circuits, mechanical vibrations, and control systems, where they indicate oscillatory behavior. Understanding complex solutions completes our study of quadratic equations and connects algebra to the broader complex number system.",
