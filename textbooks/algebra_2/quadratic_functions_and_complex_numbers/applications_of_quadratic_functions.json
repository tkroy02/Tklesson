  "expanded_description": "Quadratic functions are powerful tools for modeling real-world phenomena, from the path of a projectile to the profit of a business. The vertex of a parabola reveals the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic, making it essential for optimization problems. Applications involving projectile motion use quadratics to model height over time, while business applications use them to model profit, revenue, or cost. Understanding how to extract meaningful information from quadratic models allows us to answer practical questions like \"What is the maximum height?\" \"When does the object hit the ground?\" or \"How many units should be produced to maximize profit?\"",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The vertex form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ directly reveals the maximum or minimum value $k$ at $x = h$. For projectile motion, height is modeled by $h(t) = -16t^2 + v_0t + h_0$ (in feet) or $h(t) = -4.9t^2 + v_0t + h_0$ (in meters). For optimization, the vertex gives the input that maximizes or minimizes the output.",
    "explanation": "Think of the vertex as the \"sweet spot\" of a quadratic model. In projectile motion, it's the highest point of the trajectory. In business, it's the production level that yields maximum profit. The symmetry of the parabola means that values on either side of the vertex are lower (for a maximum) or higher (for a minimum). Converting to vertex form or using $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ finds this optimal point efficiently.",

  "summary": "Quadratic functions model countless real-world situations. In projectile motion, height is modeled by $h(t) = -16t^2 + v_0t + h_0$ (feet) or $h(t) = -4.9t^2 + v_0t + h_0$ (meters). The vertex gives the time of maximum height and the maximum height itself; solving $h(t) = 0$ gives the landing time (positive root only). In optimization problems like maximizing area with fixed perimeter, the vertex of the area quadratic gives the dimensions that maximize area. For business applications, profit is often quadratic: $P(x) = R(x) - C(x)$. The vertex gives the production level that maximizes profit, and solving $P(x) = 0$ gives break-even points. When minimizing cost, look for quadratics with $a > 0$ and find the vertex. Common mistakes include using the wrong gravity constant, including negative time solutions, confusing vertex coordinates, and miswriting constraint equations in area problems. Mastering these applications connects algebra to practical problems in sports, engineering, business, and science.",
