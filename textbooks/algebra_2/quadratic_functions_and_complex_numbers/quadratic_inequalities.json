  "expanded_description": "Quadratic inequalities extend the concepts of quadratic equations by asking not just where a quadratic equals zero, but where it is greater than or less than zero. These inequalities describe ranges of values rather than single points, and their solutions are intervals on the number line. Graphically, solving a quadratic inequality means finding the x-values for which the parabola lies above or below the x-axis. Algebraically, we use the roots to divide the number line into test intervals and determine where the inequality holds. Understanding quadratic inequalities is essential for solving real-world problems involving constraints, such as profit above a certain threshold or projectile height above a target level.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a quadratic inequality $ax^2 + bx + c > 0$, $< 0$, $\\geq 0$, or $\\leq 0$, find the roots of the corresponding equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then determine on which intervals the quadratic is positive or negative based on the parabola's shape and the inequality direction.",
    "explanation": "Think of the x-axis as a boundary line. The parabola crosses the x-axis at its roots. Between the roots, the parabola is either entirely above the axis (if it opens upward) or entirely below (if it opens downward). Outside the roots, it's the opposite. The inequality tells us which parts of the parabola we want—the parts above the axis (for $>0$ or $\\geq 0$) or below the axis (for $<0$ or $\\leq 0$). The roots themselves are included if the inequality has $\\geq$ or $\\leq$.",

  "summary": "Quadratic inequalities compare a quadratic expression to zero (or another value) using $>$, $<$, $\\geq$, or $\\leq$. The solution is a set of x-values, typically expressed as intervals. Graphically, the solution corresponds to where the parabola lies above or below the x-axis. Algebraically, the test point method is reliable: rewrite with zero on one side, find the roots of the corresponding equation, use the roots to divide the number line into intervals, test a point in each interval, and include or exclude the roots based on the inequality symbol. Special cases include double roots (where the quadratic is always non-negative or non-positive) and no real roots (where the quadratic is either always positive or always negative). Common mistakes include forgetting to check root inclusion, misidentifying intervals when $a < 0$, mishandling cases with no real roots, and failing to rewrite inequalities before solving. Quadratic inequalities model real-world situations with thresholds and ranges, such as projectile height requirements, profit targets, and safe operating conditions.",
