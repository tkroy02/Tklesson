  "expanded_description": "Trigonometric equations are not just abstract exercises—they are powerful tools for solving real-world problems involving periodic phenomena, geometric relationships, and physical motion. From determining the time of day when the tide reaches a certain height to calculating the angle of a ramp for safe wheelchair access, trigonometric equations model countless practical situations. This section brings together all the equation-solving techniques from previous sections and applies them to concrete problems. You will learn how to translate a verbal description or a real-world scenario into a trigonometric equation, solve it, and interpret the solutions in context, often considering domain restrictions and physical feasibility.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Real-world problems that involve angles, cycles, or periodic behavior can often be modeled by trigonometric equations. The solution process involves: (1) identifying the appropriate trigonometric model (e.g., $y = A\\sin(Bt + C) + D$), (2) substituting known values to create an equation, (3) solving for the unknown variable using algebraic and trigonometric techniques, and (4) interpreting the solutions in the context of the problem, discarding any that are extraneous or outside the physical domain.",
    "explanation": "Imagine you're tracking the depth of water at a dock over time. The tide follows a sinusoidal pattern. You might ask: 'At what times will the water be deep enough for a boat to enter?' This translates to solving $d(t) = \\text{required depth}$ for $t$. The solutions give specific times, but only those within a 24‑hour cycle that also make physical sense (e.g., positive times, within range). This process is typical of applications: setting up an equation, solving, and filtering results.",

  "summary": "Applications of trigonometric equations span many fields: modeling periodic behavior (tides, Ferris wheels), solving geometric problems (ramps, angles of elevation), physics (projectile motion, harmonic motion), and navigation (bearings, distances). The key steps are: (1) translate the real-world situation into a trigonometric equation using an appropriate model, (2) solve the equation using algebraic manipulation and inverse trig functions, (3) consider all solutions within the relevant domain (accounting for periodicity and quadrant issues), and (4) interpret the results in context, discarding any that are physically impossible. Practice with varied problems builds the skill to recognize which technique applies and how to handle the nuances of real-world constraints."
