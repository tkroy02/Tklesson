  "expanded_description": "Some trigonometric equations are quadratic in form, meaning they involve a trigonometric function squared, such as $\\sin^2 \\theta$, $\\cos^2 \\theta$, or $\\tan^2 \\theta$, possibly along with a linear term. These equations can be solved by treating the trigonometric function as a variable, substituting $u = \\sin \\theta$ (or $\\cos \\theta$, $\\tan \\theta$), solving the resulting quadratic equation for $u$, and then solving the basic trigonometric equations for the angle. This technique combines your algebra skills with your trigonometry knowledge and is essential for solving more complex equations that appear in calculus, physics, and engineering.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Equations of the form $a\\sin^2\\theta + b\\sin\\theta + c = 0$ (and similarly for cosine and tangent) are quadratic in $\\sin\\theta$. Let $u = \\sin\\theta$, solve $au^2 + bu + c = 0$ for $u$, then solve $\\sin\\theta = u$ for each solution $u$ that lies within the range $[-1, 1]$.",
    "explanation": "Think of these equations as disguised quadratics. For example, $2\\sin^2\\theta - \\sin\\theta - 1 = 0$ looks like $2x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ with $x = \\sin\\theta$. Factor or use the quadratic formula to find $x = 1$ or $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Then solve $\\sin\\theta = 1$ and $\\sin\\theta = -\\frac{1}{2}$ using methods from previous sections. The key is remembering that $\\sin\\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta$ are limited to $[-1,1]$, so any solutions for $u$ outside this range are discarded.",

  "summary": "Quadratic trigonometric equations have the form $a[f(\\theta)]^2 + b[f(\\theta)] + c = 0$, where $f$ is sine, cosine, or tangent. To solve, let $u = f(\\theta)$, solve the quadratic $au^2 + bu + c = 0$ for $u$ (by factoring or the quadratic formula), then solve $f(\\theta) = u$ for each valid $u$. For sine and cosine, $u$ must be in $[-1,1]$; values outside this range yield no solutions. For tangent, all real $u$ are valid. Sometimes identities are needed to rewrite the equation in quadratic form. Common mistakes include forgetting range restrictions, algebraic errors, missing solutions from basic trig equations, and failing to use identities when necessary. Mastering these equations combines algebraic skill with trigonometric knowledge and is essential for advanced mathematics."
