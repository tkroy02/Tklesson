  "expanded_description": "Verifying trigonometric identities is a fundamental skill that strengthens your understanding of trigonometric relationships and prepares you for solving equations and working with advanced applications. Unlike solving an equation, where you find specific values that make it true, verifying an identity means proving that the equation holds for all values in the domains of the functions involved. This process requires strategic manipulation using the fundamental identities, algebraic techniques, and careful reasoning. Think of it as a puzzle where you transform one side of the equation into the other, step by step, using only valid operations and known identities.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To verify a trigonometric identity, you must show that the two sides are equal for all values in the domain. This is done by transforming one side (usually the more complicated side) step by step until it matches the other side, using algebraic manipulations and previously established identities.",
    "explanation": "Imagine you have a complicated expression on the left and a simpler expression on the right. Your job is to show they're the same. You can rewrite fractions, factor, combine terms, and substitute equivalent expressions using the fundamental identities from Section 12.1. The key is to work methodically, never crossing the equal sign to bring terms from one side to the other—instead, you transform one side independently until it becomes identical to the other side.",

  "summary": "Verifying trigonometric identities is the process of proving that two expressions are equal for all values in their domains. Unlike solving equations, you work on one side only, transforming it step by step using algebraic manipulations and known identities until it matches the other side. Key strategies include converting everything to sines and cosines, factoring, combining fractions, and using Pythagorean identities. Common mistakes include working across the equal sign, algebraic errors, and misapplying identities. With practice, you'll develop pattern recognition and confidence in manipulating trigonometric expressions, which is essential for solving equations and advancing in mathematics."
