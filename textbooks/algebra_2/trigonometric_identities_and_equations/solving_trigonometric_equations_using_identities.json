  "expanded_description": "Not all trigonometric equations come in a form that can be solved immediately by isolating a single function or factoring a quadratic. Often, the equation involves different functions or compound angles that obscure the path to a solution. Trigonometric identities are the key to unlocking these equations: by applying fundamental identities, you can rewrite the equation in a simpler, solvable form. This section teaches you how to strategically use identities—Pythagorean, double-angle, sum-to-product, and others—to transform challenging equations into ones you already know how to solve. Mastering this skill will enable you to tackle a wide variety of trigonometric equations and deepen your understanding of the relationships between functions.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Trigonometric identities can be used to rewrite an equation into an equivalent form that is easier to solve. The goal is to transform the equation into one that involves a single trigonometric function, or a product of factors that can be set to zero, or a quadratic in a single function.",
    "explanation": "Think of identities as mathematical tools that allow you to change the appearance of an equation without changing its solutions. For example, if an equation contains both $\\sin^2\\theta$ and $\\cos^2\\theta$, you might use $\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1$ to eliminate one of them. If you have $\\sin 2\\theta$, you might replace it with $2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$ to introduce a product that can be factored. The choice of which identity to use depends on the structure of the equation and your target form.",

The key is to strategically apply fundamental identities—Pythagorean, double-angle, sum-to-product, etc.—to rewrite the equation in a solvable form, such as a basic equation, a factored product, or a quadratic in a single function. Always work step by step, avoid dividing by factors that could be zero, and check for extraneous solutions when necessary. With practice, you'll develop the skill to recognize which identity to apply and how to combine them to simplify even complex equations."
