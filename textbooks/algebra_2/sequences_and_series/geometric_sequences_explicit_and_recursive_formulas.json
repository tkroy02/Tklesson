  "expanded_description": "Geometric sequences are fundamental patterns where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value, called the common ratio. Unlike arithmetic sequences which add a constant, geometric sequences multiply by a constant, leading to much faster growth or decay. These sequences appear in many real-world contexts, including compound interest, population growth (under ideal conditions), radioactive decay, and the spread of diseases. Understanding both explicit and recursive formulas for geometric sequences provides powerful tools for finding any term and for analyzing the pattern's behavior.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A geometric sequence is a sequence in which the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. This constant ratio is called the common ratio, denoted by $r$. The nth term can be found using either a recursive formula ($a_n = r \\cdot a_{n-1}$) or an explicit formula ($a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$).",
    "explanation": "Think of a geometric sequence as repeated multiplication by the same factor. Starting from the first term $a_1$, you multiply by $r$ each time to get to the next term. The explicit formula $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$ tells you that to get to the nth term, you've multiplied by $r$ a total of $(n-1)$ times. The recursive formula tells you how to build the sequence step by step: each term is the previous term multiplied by $r$.",

Given two non-consecutive terms, $r^{m-k} = \\frac{a_m}{a_k}$, so $r = \\left(\\frac{a_m}{a_k}\\right)^{1/(m-k)}$. To insert $k$ geometric means between $a$ and $b$, use $r = \\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{1/(k+1)}$. Common mistakes include off-by-one errors in the explicit formula (using $r^n$ instead of $r^{n-1}$), confusing arithmetic and geometric sequences, ignoring possible negative ratios, and misapplying the geometric means formula (using subtraction instead of division). Geometric sequences model many real-world situations with exponential growth or decay, such as compound interest, population growth, and radioactive decay.",
