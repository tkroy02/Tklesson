  "expanded_description": "Arithmetic sequences are one of the most fundamental types of sequences in mathematics. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is found by adding a constant value, called the common difference, to the previous term. These sequences appear in many real-world situations, such as simple interest calculations, uniform motion, and patterns in nature. Understanding both explicit and recursive formulas for arithmetic sequences provides powerful tools for finding any term in the sequence and for analyzing the pattern's behavior.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference, denoted by $d$. The nth term can be found using either a recursive formula ($a_n = a_{n-1} + d$) or an explicit formula ($a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$).",
    "explanation": "Think of an arithmetic sequence as a straight line of numbers. Starting from the first term $a_1$, you add the same amount $d$ each time to get to the next term. The explicit formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ tells you directly how many times you've added $d$ to get to the nth term—you add it $(n-1)$ times. The recursive formula tells you how to build the sequence step by step: each term is the previous term plus $d$.",

Given two non-consecutive terms, $d = \\frac{a_m - a_k}{m-k}$. To insert $k$ arithmetic means between $a$ and $b$, use $d = \\frac{b-a}{k+1}$. Common mistakes include off-by-one errors in the explicit formula (using $nd$ instead of $(n-1)d$), confusion about indexing, incorrectly calculating $d$ from non-consecutive terms, and forgetting that $d$ can be negative. Arithmetic sequences model many real-world situations with constant rates of change, such as simple interest, seating arrangements, and taxi fares.",
