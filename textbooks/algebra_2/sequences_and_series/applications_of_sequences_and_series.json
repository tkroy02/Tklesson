  "expanded_description": "Sequences and series have numerous practical applications in finance, population modeling, and other real-world contexts. Arithmetic sequences model situations with constant change, while geometric sequences model exponential growth or decay. Understanding how to apply these mathematical tools allows us to solve problems involving savings plans, loan payments, population projections, and resource consumption. These applications demonstrate the power of sequences and series in describing and predicting real-world phenomena.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Real-world applications of sequences and series fall into several categories: <br><br> • Financial: compound interest, annuities, amortization <br> • Population: growth models, resource consumption <br> • Physical: falling objects, bouncing balls, radioactive decay <br><br> Each application uses either arithmetic or geometric sequences/series, depending on whether the change is additive or multiplicative.",
    "explanation": "Think of these applications as translating real-world situations into mathematical language. If something changes by a constant amount each period (like saving the same amount each month), it's arithmetic. If it changes by a constant percentage (like interest compounding), it's geometric. The formulas for sums then give us totals over time, like total savings or total population after many years.",

  "summary": "Sequences and series have numerous real-world applications. In finance, annuities use geometric series: future value $FV = P \\cdot \\frac{(1+i)^n - 1}{i}$ and loan payments $P = L \\cdot \\frac{i}{1 - (1+i)^{-n}}$. Population growth at constant rate $r$ is modeled by $P_n = P_0(1+r)^n$. Resource consumption that increases by a constant percentage also forms geometric series. The bouncing ball problem gives total distance $d = h \\cdot \\frac{1+r}{1-r}$ for rebound fraction $r$. Common mistakes include mismatching interest rate periods with payment periods, forgetting the initial drop in bouncing ball problems, confusing annuity due with ordinary annuity, and using arithmetic instead of geometric for percentage growth. These applications are essential for personal finance, business planning, and environmental science.",
