  "expanded_description": "Mathematical induction is a powerful proof technique used to prove statements that are asserted for all positive integers. It is especially useful for proving formulas involving sequences, series, and divisibility. The principle of mathematical induction is based on the idea of an infinite chain of dominoes: if you can knock down the first domino, and if each domino knocks down the next, then all dominoes will fall. This section provides an introduction to the method, focusing on understanding the structure of induction proofs and applying it to simple statements.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Mathematical induction is used to prove that a statement $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$. The proof has two steps: <br><br> 1. **Base Case**: Show that $P(1)$ (or sometimes $P(0)$) is true. <br> 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that $P(k)$ is true for some arbitrary positive integer $k$ (this is called the inductive hypothesis). Then prove that $P(k+1)$ is true. <br><br> If both steps are completed, then by the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$.",
    "explanation": "Think of induction as climbing a ladder. First, you must be able to get on the ladder (the base case). Then, you must be able to go from any rung to the next rung (the inductive step). If you can do both, you can climb as high as you want. The inductive hypothesis is the assumption that you've reached some rung $k$; then you show you can reach $k+1$. This chain reaction proves the statement for all positive integers.",

It consists of two parts: the base case (proving $P(1)$) and the inductive step (assuming $P(k)$ and proving $P(k+1)$). Induction is commonly used to prove summation formulas (like $\\sum i = n(n+1)/2$), divisibility statements (like $3 \\mid n^3 - n$), and inequalities (like $2^n > n$). In the inductive step, the key is to express the $k+1$ case in terms of the $k$ case using the inductive hypothesis. Common mistakes include forgetting the base case, circular reasoning (assuming $P(k+1)$), algebraic errors, and proving the wrong statement. Induction is fundamental in computer science for proving algorithm correctness and in mathematics for proving theorems.",
