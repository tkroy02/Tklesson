  "expanded_description": "A geometric series is the sum of the terms of a geometric sequence. These series appear frequently in mathematics and real-world applications, from calculating compound interest to modeling fractal patterns. The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series provides an efficient way to calculate totals without adding all terms individually. Understanding geometric series is essential for working with annuities, mortgages, and many other financial calculations, as well as for understanding infinite series that converge.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence (a finite geometric series) is given by: <br> $S_n = a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$, for $r \\neq 1$. <br> If $r = 1$, then $S_n = n \\cdot a_1$ (all terms are equal).",
    "explanation": "Think of this formula as a shortcut. Adding the terms directly would be tedious, especially for large $n$. The formula comes from a clever trick: multiply the sum by $r$, subtract from the original sum, and watch most terms cancel. The result is a simple expression that gives the total instantly. The formula works for any $r$, but if $r=1$, the denominator becomes zero, so we use the special case.",

If $r = 1$, then $S_n = n \\cdot a_1$. To find the number of terms given the sum, isolate $r^n$ and use logarithms if necessary. To find the first term or common ratio given the sum, substitute into the formula and solve—linear for $a_1$, polynomial for $r$ (may require trial for small $n$). Summation notation $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_1 r^{k-1}$ provides a compact representation. Common mistakes include using the arithmetic series formula, sign errors in the denominator, forgetting the correct exponent ($r^n$, not $r^{n+1}$), and misapplying the formula when $r=1$. Geometric series are essential in finance (annuities, mortgages), fractal geometry, and many other applications.",
