  "expanded_description": "An arithmetic series is the sum of the terms of an arithmetic sequence. Just as arithmetic sequences appear in many real-world contexts involving constant rates of change, arithmetic series appear when we need to find the total accumulated value over time. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series provides an efficient way to calculate these totals without adding all terms individually. Understanding arithmetic series is essential for applications in finance, engineering, and science where cumulative totals are needed.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence (an arithmetic series) can be found using the formula: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ or equivalently $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]$, where $a_1$ is the first term, $a_n$ is the nth term, and $d$ is the common difference.",
    "explanation": "Think of an arithmetic series as pairing terms from the beginning and end. The sum of the first and last terms equals the sum of the second and second-to-last terms, and so on. If you have $n$ terms, you can form $n/2$ such pairs, each with the same sum $(a_1 + a_n)$. This is why the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ works. The second formula simply substitutes $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.",

The sum of the first $n$ terms can be found using $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ or $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]$. The first formula is useful when the last term is known; the second is useful when the common difference is known. To find the number of terms given the sum, substitute into the formula and solve the resulting quadratic equation, keeping only the positive integer solution. To find the first term or common difference given the sum, substitute and solve the linear equation. Summation notation $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} [a_1 + (k-1)d]$ provides a compact way to represent arithmetic series. Common mistakes include using the wrong formula, forgetting the factor of $1/2$, off-by-one errors in the nth term formula, and algebraic errors when solving for $n$. Arithmetic series model real-world situations involving cumulative totals, such as stacking objects, savings plans, and theater seating.",
