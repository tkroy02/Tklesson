  "expanded_description": "Half-life and carbon dating are classic applications of exponential decay models. Half-life is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value, a constant characteristic of radioactive substances. Carbon dating uses the decay of carbon-14 to estimate the age of organic materials. These applications demonstrate how exponential models can be used to solve practical problems in archaeology, geology, and other sciences. Understanding how to work with half-life and carbon dating requires setting up exponential decay equations and solving for time using logarithms.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For exponential decay, the half-life $t_{1/2}$ is related to the decay constant $k$ by $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{k}$ (for continuous decay) or $(1-r)^{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{2}$ (for discrete decay). The amount remaining after time $t$ is $A = A_0 e^{-kt}$ (continuous) or $A = A_0 (1-r)^t$ (discrete). Carbon-14 has a known half-life of approximately 5730 years, allowing us to determine the age of ancient organic materials by measuring the remaining carbon-14.",
    "explanation": "Think of half-life as a natural clock. Radioactive atoms decay randomly, but in a large sample, the time for half to decay is constant. If you know how much of the original carbon-14 remains, you can calculate how many half-lives have passed, and thus how old the sample is. The formula $A = A_0 e^{-kt}$ is just a mathematical way of describing this process, with $k$ related to the half-life.",

For continuous decay, the relationship between half-life $t_{1/2}$ and decay constant $k$ is $k = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}$ and $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{k}$. The amount remaining after time $t$ is $A = A_0 e^{-kt}$. Alternatively, after $n$ half-lives, $A = A_0 (1/2)^n$. Carbon dating uses the known half-life of carbon-14 (5730 years) to determine the age of organic materials. The age $t$ is found from $t = -\\frac{\\ln f}{k}$, where $f$ is the fraction of carbon-14 remaining. Common mistakes include inverting the half-life formula, using common logs instead of natural logs in continuous decay, misunderstanding that half-life is constant, and forgetting that raw carbon dates need calibration. Half-life concepts are essential in archaeology (dating artifacts), geology (dating rocks), and medicine (radioactive tracers).",
