  "expanded_description": "Solving logarithmic equations involves finding the values of the variable that make a logarithmic equation true. Unlike exponential equations, logarithmic equations have domain restrictions: the arguments of all logarithms must be positive. This often leads to extraneous solutions—values that satisfy the algebraic manipulation but not the original equation because they make a logarithm undefined. The key steps are to use logarithm properties to condense the equation into a single logarithm, then convert to exponential form, solve, and check all solutions in the original equation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a logarithmic equation: <br> 1) Use logarithm properties to combine multiple logarithms into a single logarithm. <br> 2) If the equation has the form $\\log_b(\\text{expression}) = \\text{constant}$, rewrite in exponential form: $\\text{expression} = b^{\\text{constant}}$. <br> 3) Solve the resulting equation. <br> 4) Check all solutions in the original equation—any that make any logarithm argument ≤ 0 are extraneous and must be discarded.",
    "explanation": "Think of solving logarithmic equations as undoing the logarithm, similar to how we undo addition, multiplication, or exponentiation. The difference is that logarithms have domain restrictions: you can only take the logarithm of positive numbers. When you convert to exponential form, you might get solutions that make the original arguments non-positive. These solutions must be rejected. Checking is not optional—it's an essential part of the process.",

For equations of the form $\\log_b f(x) = c$, the solution is $f(x) = b^c$. For equations with logarithms on both sides, use the one-to-one property to equate arguments. Always check solutions in the original equation because extraneous solutions are common—any value that makes any logarithm argument non-positive must be discarded. Common mistakes include forgetting to check for extraneous solutions, incorrectly combining logarithms (e.g., $\\log M + \\log N = \\log(M+N)$), converting to exponential form incorrectly (e.g., $\\log_b x = c \\rightarrow x = c^b$), and ignoring domain restrictions introduced by simplification.
