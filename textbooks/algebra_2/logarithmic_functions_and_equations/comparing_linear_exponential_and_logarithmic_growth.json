  "expanded_description": "Understanding the differences between linear, exponential, and logarithmic growth is essential for choosing appropriate models and interpreting real-world phenomena. Linear growth adds a constant amount each period, exponential growth multiplies by a constant factor each period, and logarithmic growth increases rapidly at first then slows down. Each type appears in different contexts: linear in simple interest, exponential in compound interest and population growth, and logarithmic in learning curves and perceptual responses. Recognizing these patterns helps in data analysis, prediction, and decision-making.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The three types of growth can be characterized by their equations and behavior: <br><br> • Linear: $y = mx + b$ — constant rate of change, adds same amount each unit <br> • Exponential: $y = ab^x$ or $y = ae^{kx}$ — constant percentage rate, multiplies by same factor each unit <br> • Logarithmic: $y = a + b\\ln x$ — growth slows over time, increases quickly then levels off",
    "explanation": "Think of linear growth as climbing stairs—each step takes you up the same height. Exponential growth is like a chain reaction—each step multiplies the effect. Logarithmic growth is like learning a new skill—you improve quickly at first, but each additional hour of practice yields smaller gains. These patterns are fundamental in mathematics and appear throughout science and economics.",

  "summary": "Linear, exponential, and logarithmic growth represent fundamentally different patterns. Linear growth ($y = mx + b$) adds a constant amount each period, with constant differences in a table. Exponential growth ($y = ab^x$ or $y = ae^{kx}$) multiplies by a constant factor each period, with constant ratios in a table. Logarithmic growth ($y = a + b\\ln x$) increases quickly at first then slows, with decreasing differences in a table. Recognizing these patterns is essential for choosing appropriate models. Common mistakes include confusing exponential and logarithmic growth (one accelerates, the other decelerates), misidentifying growth from limited data, ignoring domain restrictions of logarithmic models, and assuming only linear or exponential possibilities. Real-world examples include simple interest (linear), compound interest and population (exponential), and perceptual scales and learning curves (logarithmic).",
