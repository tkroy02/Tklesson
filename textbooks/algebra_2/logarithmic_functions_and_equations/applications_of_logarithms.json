  "expanded_description": "Logarithmic scales are used in science and engineering to measure quantities that span many orders of magnitude. The pH scale measures acidity, the Richter scale measures earthquake intensity, and the decibel scale measures sound intensity. These scales are logarithmic because human perception of these phenomena is roughly logarithmic, and because they compress wide ranges into manageable numbers. Understanding how to work with these scales involves applying logarithm properties to solve for unknown values and to compare measurements.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Logarithmic scales are defined by equations of the form $\\text{measurement} = k \\log\\left(\\frac{X}{X_0}\\right)$, where $X$ is the quantity being measured, $X_0$ is a reference value, and $k$ is a constant. Common examples: <br> • pH: $\\text{pH} = -\\log[H^+]$ (with $k=1$, $X_0=1$ M) <br> • Richter scale: $M = \\log\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right)$ (with $k=1$) <br> • Decibel scale: $\\text{dB} = 10 \\log\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right)$ (with $k=10$)",
    "explanation": "Think of logarithmic scales as a way to \"compress\" numbers. A change of 1 on a logarithmic scale corresponds to a multiplication by the base (usually 10) in the actual quantity. For example, a pH change from 3 to 4 means the hydrogen ion concentration is divided by 10. A Richter scale increase from 5 to 6 means the seismic wave amplitude is multiplied by 10. This multiplicative relationship is the key to understanding logarithmic scales.",

  "summary": "Logarithmic scales compress wide-ranging quantities into manageable numbers. The pH scale measures acidity: $\\text{pH} = -\\log[H^+]$, so $[H^+] = 10^{-\\text{pH}}$. Each unit change in pH represents a tenfold change in $[H^+]$. The Richter scale measures earthquake magnitude: $M = \\log(I/I_0)$, so $I/I_0 = 10^M$. A difference of 1 in magnitude means a factor of 10 in amplitude. The decibel scale measures sound intensity: $\\text{dB} = 10\\log(I/I_0)$, so $I/I_0 = 10^{\\text{dB}/10}$. A difference of 10 dB means a factor of 10 in intensity. When comparing quantities on logarithmic scales, the difference in measurements gives the logarithm of the ratio: $\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = 10^{\\Delta L/k}$. Common mistakes include treating logarithmic scales as linear, forgetting the factor of 10 in decibels, sign errors in pH calculations, and mixing up reference values. These scales are essential in chemistry (acidity), geology (earthquakes), and health (hearing safety).",
