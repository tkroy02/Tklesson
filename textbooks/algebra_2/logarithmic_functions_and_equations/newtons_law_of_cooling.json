  "expanded_description": "Newton's Law of Cooling describes how the temperature of an object changes as it approaches the temperature of its surroundings. It states that the rate of cooling (or warming) is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its environment. This leads to an exponential model where the temperature difference decays exponentially over time. This law has practical applications in forensics (estimating time of death), cooking (determining cooling times), and engineering (heat transfer analysis).",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Newton's Law of Cooling states that the temperature $T(t)$ of an object at time $t$ is given by: <br> $T(t) = T_s + (T_0 - T_s)e^{-kt}$ <br> where: <br> • $T_s$ is the surrounding temperature (constant) <br> • $T_0$ is the initial temperature of the object <br> • $k$ is a positive constant that depends on the properties of the object and its surroundings <br> • $t$ is time",
    "explanation": "Think of this as the object's temperature \"chasing\" the surrounding temperature. The difference between the object's temperature and the surroundings decreases exponentially. When the object is much hotter than the surroundings, it cools quickly; as it gets closer to the surroundings, it cools more slowly. The constant $k$ determines how fast this happens—larger $k$ means faster cooling. The same formula works for warming (when the object is cooler than its surroundings).",

We have $T(t) = 80$ at $t=2$ hours after death. So we can find the time when it was 98.6°F by solving for $t$ from that point? Wait, careful: At $t=0$ (time of death), $T = 98.6$. At $t=2$ (time of discovery), $T = 80$. So we already used that to find $k$. To find time of death, we need to know when it reached 98.6°F? That's $t=0$. The question is actually: how long before discovery did death occur? That's exactly the $t$ we've been using. So death occurred 2 hours before discovery? No, we set $t=0$ at death, so discovery at $t=2$ means death was 2 hours before discovery. So the answer is 2 hours? That's too simple. Let's re-read: The problem gives temperature after 2 hours as 80°F. We want to estimate time of death. That means we need to find how long before discovery the body was at 98.6°F. But we already have that—it's 2 hours. So maybe the problem is that we don't know when it was discovered? Actually, the problem states: \"A body at 98.6°F is found in a 65°F room. After 2 hours, its temperature is 80°F.\" This is ambiguous. It might mean: at the time of discovery, it was 98.6°F? No, that would mean it just died. More likely: The body was found, and its temperature was taken immediately? Let's rephrase: At the time of discovery, the body's temperature was 80°F. Two hours later, it was 70°F or something? The problem as stated is confusing. Let's assume the intended meaning: At the time of discovery, the body's temperature is 80°F. Two hours later, it is measured again and is 75°F. Then we can find time of death. But here it says \"after 2 hours, its temperature is 80°F\"—that implies at discovery it was 98.6°F? No."

The temperature difference decays exponentially. To find $k$, use a known temperature at a specific time: $k = -\\frac{1}{t} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T - T_s}{T_0 - T_s}\\right)$. To find the time to reach a certain temperature, use $t = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T - T_s}{T_0 - T_s}\\right)$. The same formula works for warming (when $T_0 < T_s$). Common mistakes include sign errors in the exponent, swapping $T_0$ and $T_s$, inconsistent time units, and using common logs instead of natural logs. Newton's Law has important applications in forensics (estimating time of death), cooking (food cooling times), and engineering (heat transfer analysis).",
