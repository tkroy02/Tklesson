  "expanded_description": "The unit circle is the heart of trigonometry—a simple circle of radius 1 that connects angles to coordinates. Every angle in standard position corresponds to a point (x, y) on the unit circle, and these coordinates are defined as the cosine and sine of that angle. This elegant definition unifies geometry and algebra, making it possible to evaluate trigonometric functions for any angle, not just acute ones. Understanding the unit circle will give you a visual intuition for why sine and cosine behave the way they do, and it forms the basis for graphing, identities, and real‑world applications.",

    "principle": "On the unit circle (radius = 1), the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of an angle θ intersects the circle are (cos θ, sin θ). The tangent is the slope of the terminal side: tan θ = sin θ / cos θ (provided cos θ ≠ 0).",
    "explanation": "Imagine a circle centered at the origin with radius exactly 1. For any angle θ in standard position, draw the ray from the origin. It will hit the circle at a unique point. The x‑coordinate of that point is defined as cos θ, and the y‑coordinate is sin θ. Because the circle has radius 1, the distance from the origin to the point is 1, so by the Pythagorean theorem we immediately get the fundamental identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.",
