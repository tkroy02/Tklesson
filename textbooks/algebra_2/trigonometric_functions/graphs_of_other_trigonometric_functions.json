  "expanded_description": "While sine and cosine are the most familiar trigonometric functions, the other four—tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant—have their own unique graphs with important features. These functions are defined as ratios of sine and cosine, so their graphs have vertical asymptotes wherever the denominator is zero. Understanding these graphs is essential for solving trigonometric equations, analyzing periodic behavior, and preparing for calculus. The graphs reveal patterns of periodicity, symmetry, and asymptotic behavior that are quite different from the smooth waves of sine and cosine.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The graphs of tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant are derived from the sine and cosine functions. They have vertical asymptotes where their denominators are zero, and they exhibit periodic behavior with distinct periods: $\\pi$ for tangent and cotangent, $2\\pi$ for secant and cosecant.",
    "explanation": "Each of these functions is a reciprocal or quotient of sine and cosine: $\\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}$, $\\cot x = \\frac{\\\\cos x}{\\sin x}$, $\\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}$, $\\csc x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$. Wherever the denominator equals zero, the function is undefined, creating vertical asymptotes. Between asymptotes, the graphs take characteristic shapes—increasing curves for tangent, decreasing for cotangent, and U-shaped branches for secant and cosecant.",

Tangent and cotangent have period $\\pi$; secant and cosecant have period $2\\pi$. All have vertical asymptotes where their denominators are zero: tangent and secant at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$; cotangent and cosecant at $x = n\\pi$. Between asymptotes, tangent increases, cotangent decreases, and secant/cosecant form U-shaped branches that never go between $-1$ and $1$. Transformations follow the same patterns as sine and cosine, but for tangent and cotangent, the concept of amplitude is replaced by vertical stretch affecting steepness. Mastering these graphs requires understanding their relationship to sine and cosine and paying careful attention to asymptotes and domain restrictions."
