  "expanded_description": "Once you understand the basic graphs of sine and cosine, you can transform them to model a huge variety of real‑world phenomena. By adjusting the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift, we can stretch, compress, shift, or flip the basic waves. These transformations follow the same patterns you learned for other functions, but with new vocabulary specific to sinusoidal functions. Mastering these transformations will allow you to write equations for any sinusoidal graph and to predict the behavior of waves in physics, engineering, and signal processing.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The general form of a transformed sine function is $y = a\\sin(b(x - c)) + d$, where $|a|$ is the amplitude, $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$ is the period, $c$ is the phase shift (horizontal shift), and $d$ is the vertical shift. The same applies to cosine.",
    "explanation": "Each parameter changes the graph in a specific way: $a$ stretches or compresses vertically and flips if negative; $b$ affects the period (horizontal stretch/compression); $c$ shifts left or right; $d$ shifts up or down. Understanding these one at a time helps you sketch any sinusoidal function by starting with the basic graph and applying the transformations in order.",

To graph a transformed sinusoid, start with the key points of the basic function, apply horizontal changes (period, then phase shift) to x‑coordinates, then apply vertical changes (amplitude, then vertical shift) to y‑coordinates. Conversely, given a graph, find the midline, amplitude, period, and a key point to determine $c$ and the sign of $a$, then write the equation. Mastering these transformations enables you to model any sinusoidal phenomenon."
