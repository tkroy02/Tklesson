  "expanded_description": "Arc length and sector area are two fundamental geometric quantities derived from circles and angles. Using radian measure simplifies the formulas dramatically: the arc length is simply the radius times the angle (in radians), and the sector area is one-half radius squared times the angle. These relationships are not just mathematical curiosities—they appear in physics (circular motion), engineering (gear design), and everyday life (slicing a pizza). This section connects angle measure directly to linear and area measurements, reinforcing why radians are the natural unit for angles.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a circle of radius $r$, an angle $\\theta$ (in radians) subtends an arc of length $s = r\\theta$ and a sector of area $A = \\frac{1}{2}r^2\\theta$. These formulas are linear in $\\theta$ because radian measure is defined as the ratio of arc length to radius.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a slice of pizza. The crust is the arc length, the tip is the center of the circle, and the angle at the tip determines how big the slice is. If you double the angle, you double the crust length and double the area—direct proportionality that holds only when the angle is measured in radians. In degrees, the formulas gain extra factors of $\\frac{\\pi}{180}$, hiding the beautiful simplicity.",

  "summary": "Arc length and sector area are directly proportional to the central angle when measured in radians: $s = r\\theta$ and $A = \\frac{1}{2}r^2\\theta$. If the angle is in degrees, use $s = \\frac{\\pi r \\theta}{180}$ and $A = \\frac{\\pi r^2 \\theta}{360}$. These formulas are essential for problems involving circular motion, distances along curved paths, and areas of circular regions. Always verify the units of the angle before applying the radian‑based formulas, and remember that radius, not diameter, appears in the equations. Mastering these relationships reinforces the power of radian measure and prepares you for more advanced trigonometric applications."
