  "expanded_description": "The graphs of sine and cosine functions reveal their periodic nature. Understanding these basic graphs—their shape, key points, and properties—is essential for modeling repetitive phenomena. In this section, we'll explore the parent functions $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\cos x$, learning how to sketch them, identify their characteristics, and see how they are related. These graphs form the foundation for all later work with sinusoidal functions, including transformations and real-world applications.",

    "principle": "The graphs of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\cos x$ are periodic waves that oscillate between $-1$ and $1$. They have the same basic shape but are shifted horizontally by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians ($90^\\circ$).",
    "explanation": "Imagine a point moving around the unit circle; its $y$-coordinate (sine) and $x$-coordinate (cosine) trace out waves as the angle increases. The sine graph starts at $(0,0)$, rises to a maximum at $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, returns to zero at $\\pi$, goes to a minimum at $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, and completes one cycle at $2\\pi$. Cosine starts at $(0,1)$, decreases to zero at $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, reaches a minimum at $\\pi$, increases back to zero at $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, and returns to $1$ at $2\\pi$. Both have period $2\\pi$ and amplitude $1$.",
