  "expanded_description": "Now that we have defined sine, cosine, and tangent on the unit circle, we can extend these definitions to any angle—not just acute ones. Any angle, no matter how large or negative, can be related to an acute angle called the reference angle. By combining the reference angle with the sign of the function in the appropriate quadrant, we can evaluate trigonometric functions for any angle without a calculator. This skill is essential for solving equations, graphing, and understanding periodic behavior.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For any angle θ (in standard position), there exists an acute reference angle θ' (0 ≤ θ' ≤ 90°) between the terminal side and the x‑axis. The value of any trigonometric function at θ is the same as its value at θ', up to a sign determined by the quadrant of θ.",
    "explanation": "Imagine an angle of 150°. Its terminal side is in Quadrant II, making a 30° angle with the x‑axis. The reference angle is 30°. The sine of 150° is positive (like sine of 30°) and the cosine is negative (unlike cosine of 30°). So sin 150° = sin 30° = 1/2, but cos 150° = –cos 30° = –√3/2. The reference angle gives the magnitude; the quadrant gives the sign.",

  "summary": "To evaluate trigonometric functions of any angle: (1) If the angle is greater than 360° or negative, find a coterminal angle between 0° and 360°. (2) Determine the quadrant of that angle. (3) Compute the reference angle using the appropriate formula for that quadrant. (4) Find the value of the function at the reference angle (from memory or unit circle). (5) Apply the correct sign based on the quadrant (ASTC). For quadrantal angles, use the coordinates directly. This method lets you evaluate any angle exactly without a calculator."
