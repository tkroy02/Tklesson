  "expanded_description": "Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is one of the most important applications of trigonometric functions. It describes any periodic motion where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium—think of a spring bouncing, a pendulum swinging, or a vibrating guitar string. These motions can be modeled using sine and cosine functions, where the amplitude represents the maximum displacement, the period represents the time for one complete cycle, and the phase shift represents the starting position. Understanding SHM connects trigonometry to physics, engineering, and real-world phenomena, showing how abstract functions can describe the world around us.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Simple harmonic motion can be modeled by the equations $y = A\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$ or $y = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency (in radians per unit time), $t$ is time, and $\\phi$ is the phase constant. The period is $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$ and the frequency is $f = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a weight bouncing on a spring. If you pull it down and release it, it oscillates up and down. The maximum distance from the rest position is the amplitude. The time to go down and back up is the period. How many bounces per second is the frequency. The sine or cosine function perfectly describes this motion because at any time $t$, the displacement follows a sinusoidal pattern. The phase constant $\\phi$ tells you where in the cycle the motion starts—at the top, bottom, or somewhere in between.",

  "summary": "Simple harmonic motion is modeled by sinusoidal functions: $y = A\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$ or $y = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$. The amplitude $A$ is the maximum displacement. The period $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$ is the time for one cycle, and frequency $f = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$. The phase constant $\\phi$ is determined by initial conditions. Velocity and acceleration are derivatives: $v = A\\omega\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$ and $a = -A\\omega^2\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) = -\\omega^2 y$, with maximum values $v_{\\text{max}} = A\\omega$ and $a_{\\text{max}} = A\\omega^2$. SHM applies to many physical systems including springs ($\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$) and pendulums ($\\omega = \\sqrt{g/L}$). Understanding SHM connects trigonometric functions to the physical world and prepares students for more advanced studies in physics and engineering."
