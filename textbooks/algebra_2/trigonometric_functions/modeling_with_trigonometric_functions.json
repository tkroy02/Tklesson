  "expanded_description": "Trigonometric functions are ideal for modeling phenomena that repeat in cycles—daily temperatures, tidal heights, seasonal sales, sound waves, and biological rhythms. In this final section, we bring together everything you've learned about sine and cosine functions and apply it to real-world data. You'll learn how to analyze a periodic data set, determine the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift, and write a trigonometric function that models the behavior. Whether you're working with a table of values, a graph, or a verbal description, the goal is the same: find a function of the form $y = A\\sin(B(x - C)) + D$ or $y = A\\cos(B(x - C)) + D$ that closely matches the observations. This skill is essential in science, engineering, and economics, where understanding and predicting cyclic patterns is key.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Any periodic data set can be modeled by a sinusoidal function $y = A\\sin(B(x - C)) + D$ or $y = A\\cos(B(x - C)) + D$, where the parameters $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are determined by key features of the data: amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift.",
    "explanation": "Imagine you have temperature data recorded at noon each day for a year. The pattern repeats every 365 days (period). The average temperature is the midline (vertical shift $D$). The variation above and below that average is the amplitude $A$. The time when the temperature first hits the average or reaches a maximum tells you the phase shift $C$. By identifying these four quantities from the data, you can write an equation that models the entire year's temperatures. This equation can then be used to predict temperatures on future dates or to analyze trends.",

The key steps are: (1) find the midline $D$ from the average of maximum and minimum values; (2) find the amplitude $A$ as the distance from midline to max; (3) determine the period $P$ and compute $B = 2\\pi/P$; (4) find the phase shift $C$ using a reference point such as a maximum (for cosine) or midline crossing (for sine). Technology can perform sinusoidal regression for messy data. These models are used extensively in science and business to describe and predict cyclic behavior. With practice, you can move from raw data to a functional model that captures the essence of any repeating pattern."
