  "expanded_description": "Angles are everywhere in trigonometry, from measuring rotations to describing periodic phenomena. In this section, we establish the foundation: what angles are, how to draw them in standard position, and the two primary units of measure—degrees (the familiar system) and radians (the natural system for mathematics). Mastering radian measure is essential because it links angles directly to arc length and simplifies calculus. You'll learn to convert fluently between degrees and radians, find coterminal angles, and understand the relationships between angles. These skills will underpin everything else in this unit.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An angle can be measured in degrees or radians, and the two units are related by the fundamental equivalence $180^\\circ = \\pi$ radians. Radian measure is dimensionless and defined as the ratio of arc length to radius, making it the natural choice for trigonometric functions.",
    "explanation": "Think of a circle. If you take a radius and wrap it along the circumference, the angle that subtends an arc of length equal to the radius is exactly one radian. Because the circumference is $2\\pi r$, a full revolution corresponds to $2\\pi$ radians. Meanwhile, a full revolution is 360°, so $360^\\circ = 2\\pi$ radians, or $180^\\circ = \\pi$ radians. This simple relationship lets you switch between systems effortlessly. Understanding radians now will pay off when you graph sine and cosine—they are functions of radian measure, not degrees."
