  "expanded_description": "In Section 10.8 we learned to measure and describe linear relationships using the correlation coefficient $r$. But $r$ only tells us HOW STRONG a relationship is — it doesn't let us make predictions. Linear regression takes the next step: fitting a specific line through the scatterplot that we can use to predict the response variable from any value of the explanatory variable. Residuals then measure how wrong those predictions are — revealing which data points the model captures well and which it misses, and helping us evaluate whether a linear model is appropriate at all.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A regression line is the 'best fit' line through a scatterplot — the line that minimizes the total prediction error. Residuals are the signed differences between observed data values and the values predicted by the line, and they are the key tool for evaluating how well the line fits.",
    "explanation": "You already know from algebra that a line is defined by $y = mx + b$. In statistics, we write it slightly differently: $\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$, where $\\hat{y}$ (read 'y-hat') is the predicted value of the response variable for a given $x$. The regression line is the unique line that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances from each data point to the line — a criterion called least squares. The result is a line that is as close as possible to all the data points simultaneously, in a very specific mathematical sense. Residuals measure how far each actual point falls from the predicted line, and analyzing them is essential: a good model has residuals that are small, random, and don't form any pattern."

      "introduction": "There are infinitely many lines you could draw through a scatterplot. How do we find the single best one? The answer is the least-squares criterion: the line that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances (residuals) from each data point to the line. This section explains what that means, how the line is written, and why squared distances are used instead of regular distances.",

      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "The least-squares regression line (LSRL) is the line $\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$ that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals $\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$. It is the unique line that passes closest to all data points simultaneously, using squared vertical distances as the measure of 'closeness.' Also called the line of best fit.",
        "context": "Why squared distances? Two reasons: (1) Squaring makes all distances positive — otherwise positive and negative residuals would cancel out and a terrible fit could still sum to zero. (2) Squaring penalizes large errors more heavily — a residual of 6 contributes $6^2 = 36$, while a residual of 2 contributes only $2^2 = 4$. This means the least-squares line is pulled toward outliers, and no single large error is tolerated when a smaller one is achievable. You'll see this same squaring logic in variance and standard deviation from Section 10.1."

This phenomenon is why 'Sports Illustrated Jinx' seems real: athletes who perform exceptionally (appear on the cover) tend to perform more moderately afterward — because exceptional performance partly reflects a lucky streak."

The intercept $b_0 = \\bar{y} - b_1 \\bar{x}$ gives the predicted $y$ when $x = 0$ — only interpret it when $x = 0$ makes contextual sense. The line always passes through $(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$. A residual is $y - \\hat{y}$ (actual minus predicted): positive means above the line (underestimated); negative means below (overestimated); the sum of all residuals equals zero. The residual plot (plotting residuals vs. $x$) is the key diagnostic: random scatter indicates an appropriate linear model; a curved pattern indicates nonlinearity; a fan shape indicates non-constant variance. The coefficient of determination $r^2 = (r)^2$ represents the proportion of variability in $y$ explained by the linear relationship with $x$ — always interpret as '$r^2 \\times 100\\%$ of the variability in [response variable] is explained by the linear relationship with [explanatory variable].' Interpolation (predicting within the data range) is generally reliable; extrapolation (predicting outside the data range) is not — always flag it. Regression toward the mean is the tendency for extreme $x$ values to produce predicted $y$ values that are less extreme (closer to $\\bar{y}$), reflecting the fact that $|r| < 1$ in almost all real datasets. This section connects directly to Section 10.10 (interpreting and critiquing statistical studies), where regression results are one of the most common types of statistical evidence to evaluate."
