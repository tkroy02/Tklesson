Measures of central tendency — mean, median, and mode — answer the first question. Measures of dispersion — range, variance, standard deviation, and IQR — answer the second. You need BOTH to truly understand a dataset. A mean of 75 means something very different if scores ranged from 74–76 versus 20–100."

Measures of dispersion describe spread: the range (max $-$ min) is quick but sensitive to outliers; variance (average squared deviation from the mean) is the bridge to standard deviation; standard deviation ($\\sqrt{\\text{variance}}$) tells you how far a typical value sits from the mean in original units; and IQR ($Q_3 - Q_1$) measures the spread of the middle 50% and pairs with the median when outliers are present. The fundamental rule: symmetric data with no outliers $\\rightarrow$ use mean and standard deviation; skewed data or outliers present $\\rightarrow$ use median and IQR. Always look at your data before choosing — a single extreme value can change which measures are appropriate."
