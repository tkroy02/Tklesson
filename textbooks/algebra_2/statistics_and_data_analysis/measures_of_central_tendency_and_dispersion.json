  "expanded_description": "Measures of central tendency and dispersion are fundamental tools for describing and understanding datasets. Central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) tell us where the center of the data lies, while dispersion measures (range, standard deviation) tell us how spread out the data is. Together, they provide a complete picture of a dataset's distribution and are essential for comparing different datasets, identifying outliers, and making informed decisions based on data. These concepts form the foundation for statistical analysis in Algebra II and beyond.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The mean is the arithmetic average, the median is the middle value when data is ordered, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value. The range is the difference between maximum and minimum, and the standard deviation measures the typical distance of data points from the mean.",
    "explanation": "Think of central tendency as answering the question 'What is typical?' while dispersion answers 'How much variety is there?' The mean is like a balance point, the median is the midpoint, and the mode is the most common value. The standard deviation tells you, on average, how far data points are from the mean. A small standard deviation means data clusters tightly around the mean; a large one means data is spread out.",

The mean is the arithmetic average, sensitive to outliers; the median is the middle value, resistant to outliers; the mode is the most frequent value. The range is the difference between maximum and minimum. Standard deviation measures the typical distance of data points from the mean, with a smaller value indicating more consistent data. Values more than two standard deviations from the mean are considered unusual. Common mistakes include using the mean with outliers, forgetting to sort data for the median, confusing sample and population standard deviation formulas, and misinterpreting what standard deviation represents. These measures are essential in business, education, healthcare, and manufacturing for understanding and describing data.",
