  "expanded_description": "Measures of central tendency and dispersion are fundamental tools for describing and understanding datasets. Central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) tell us where the center of the data lies, while dispersion measures (range, variance, standard deviation) tell us how spread out the data is. Together, they provide a complete picture of a dataset's distribution and are essential for comparing different datasets, identifying outliers, and making informed decisions based on data.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The mean is the arithmetic average, the median is the middle value when data is ordered, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value. The range is the difference between maximum and minimum, the variance measures average squared deviation from the mean, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, providing a measure of spread in the original units.",
    "explanation": "Think of central tendency as answering the question 'What is typical?' while dispersion answers 'How much variety is there?' The mean is like a balance point, the median is the midpoint, and the mode is the most common value. The standard deviation tells you, on average, how far data points are from the mean. A small standard deviation means data clusters tightly around the mean; a large one means data is spread out.",

The mean is the arithmetic average, sensitive to outliers; the median is the middle value, resistant to outliers; the mode is the most frequent value. The range is the difference between maximum and minimum. Variance is the average squared deviation from the mean, and standard deviation is its square root, providing spread in original units. Choose mean with standard deviation for symmetric data without outliers; choose median with interquartile range for skewed data or data with outliers. Common mistakes include using mean with skewed data, forgetting to sort data for median, confusing population and sample variance, and misinterpreting standard deviation. These measures are essential in business, education, healthcare, and manufacturing for understanding and describing data.",
