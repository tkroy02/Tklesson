  "expanded_description": "One of the most important — and most violated — principles in all of statistics: correlation does not imply causation. You will encounter this concept constantly for the rest of your life, in news headlines, medical studies, social media arguments, and policy debates. Two things can be strongly related without one causing the other. Knowing how to tell the difference, and how to measure the strength of a relationship in the first place, is the focus of this section.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Causation means one variable directly produces a change in another. A strong correlation between two variables is NOT evidence that one causes the other.",
    "explanation": "Here is the trap that catches everyone from middle schoolers to newspaper editors: you observe that two things tend to go up or down together, and you assume one is causing the other. Ice cream sales and drowning rates are strongly positively correlated — both rise in summer. Does eating ice cream cause drowning? Obviously not. The real explanation is a third variable — hot weather — that drives both. This is called a lurking variable, and it's the most common reason correlations are mistaken for causation. In this section, you'll learn to measure correlation precisely using the correlation coefficient $r$, interpret its meaning, and apply critical thinking to distinguish genuine causal relationships from coincidental or confounded ones."

  "summary": "Bivariate relationships between two quantitative variables are visualized with scatterplots and described by direction (positive or negative), form (linear or nonlinear), strength, and outliers. The correlation coefficient $r$ ($-1 \\leq r \\leq 1$) precisely measures the strength and direction of a LINEAR association: positive $r$ means both variables increase together; negative $r$ means they move in opposite directions; $|r|$ close to 1 means a strong linear pattern; $|r|$ close to 0 means a weak linear pattern. Critically, $r = 0$ means no linear relationship — not no relationship at all — and $r$ is invalid for nonlinear data. The most important concept in the section: correlation does not imply causation. Four alternative explanations for any observed correlation are: genuine causation (requires experimental evidence), a lurking variable driving both $x$ and $y$, spurious coincidence (especially in small samples or time-series data), and reversed causation ($y$ causes $x$ rather than $x$ causing $y$). The gold standard for establishing causation is a randomized controlled experiment with random assignment. Observational studies can suggest causation but cannot prove it, no matter how high $r$ is. Complete analysis language: use 'associated with' for correlations, 'causes' only when experimental evidence justifies it, and always identify the study type and plausible lurking variables before drawing any causal conclusion. These concepts connect directly to linear regression (Section 10.9) and interpreting statistical studies (Section 10.10)."
