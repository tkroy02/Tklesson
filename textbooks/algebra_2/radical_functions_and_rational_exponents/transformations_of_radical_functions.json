  "expanded_description": "Transformations of radical functions allow us to shift, stretch, compress, and reflect the parent square root and cube root functions. Understanding these transformations is essential for graphing complex radical functions without plotting numerous points. Just as with other function families, the parameters $a$, $h$, and $k$ in $f(x) = a\\sqrt[n]{x - h} + k$ control vertical stretches/compressions/reflections, horizontal shifts, and vertical shifts respectively. Mastering these transformations enables us to quickly sketch graphs and understand how changes in equations affect their graphs.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For radical functions in the form $f(x) = a\\sqrt[n]{x - h} + k$ (with $n$ even or odd): <br> • $h$ represents the horizontal shift (opposite sign: $x - h$ shifts right $h$ units) <br> • $k$ represents the vertical shift (up $k$ units) <br> • $a$ represents the vertical stretch/compression and reflection: if $|a| > 1$, vertical stretch; if $0 < |a| < 1$, vertical compression; if $a < 0$, reflection across the $x$-axis.",
    "explanation": "Think of transformations as ways to move and reshape the parent graph. The $h$ and $k$ values simply move the graph to a new location—the starting point for square roots, or the inflection point for cube roots, shifts to $(h, k)$. The $a$ value changes how steeply the graph rises or falls, and if negative, flips it upside down. These transformations work exactly the same way they do for other function families you've studied, like quadratics or absolute value functions.",

For $f(x) = a\\sqrt[n]{x - h} + k$, $h$ controls horizontal shift (opposite sign), $k$ controls vertical shift, and $a$ controls vertical stretch/compression ($|a| > 1$ stretches, $0 < |a| < 1$ compresses) and reflection across the x-axis if $a < 0$. For square roots, the starting point moves to $(h, k)$, domain is $[h, \\infty)$, and range depends on $a$ and $k$. For cube roots, the inflection point moves to $(h, k)$, domain and range are all real numbers. When graphing, first plot the key point, then use the stretch factor to find additional points based on the parent function's pattern. Common mistakes include sign errors in horizontal shifts, forgetting to adjust domain for shifted square roots, incorrect order of transformations (stretch before shift), and not adjusting range for reflected square roots. These transformations are essential in modeling real-world phenomena like pendulum periods, stress-strain curves, and utility functions.",
