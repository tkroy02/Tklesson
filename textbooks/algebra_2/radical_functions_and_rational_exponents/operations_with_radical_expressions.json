  "expanded_description": "Operations with radical expressions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of radicals. These operations build on the properties of radicals and require careful attention to like terms, indices, and simplification. Just as with polynomials, you can only add or subtract radicals that have the same index and the same radicand (like radicals). Multiplication and division follow the product and quotient rules, but may require additional steps when indices differ. Mastering these operations is essential for solving equations and working with radical expressions in calculus and beyond.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Operations with radicals follow these rules: <br><br> • Addition/Subtraction: $a\\sqrt[n]{c} \\pm b\\sqrt[n]{c} = (a \\pm b)\\sqrt[n]{c}$ (like radicals only) <br> • Multiplication: $\\sqrt[n]{a} \\cdot \\sqrt[n]{b} = \\sqrt[n]{ab}$ (same index) <br> • Division: $\\frac{\\sqrt[n]{a}}{\\sqrt[n]{b}} = \\sqrt[n]{\\frac{a}{b}}$ (same index, $b \\neq 0$) <br><br> When indices differ, convert to rational exponents first, then combine.",
    "explanation": "Think of radicals as algebraic terms. Like radicals are like terms—they have the same index and same radicand, just like $x$ and $2x$ have the same variable part. You can add or subtract them by combining coefficients. Multiplication and division are more flexible: you can multiply radicals with the same index by multiplying radicands, and divide by dividing radicands. When indices differ, you need to find a common index, just as you need a common denominator to add fractions. Converting to rational exponents provides a unified approach.",

  "summary": "Operations with radical expressions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and rationalizing denominators. Addition and subtraction require like radicals (same index and radicand). Always simplify radicals first to reveal like terms. Multiplication and division follow the product and quotient rules when indices are the same: $\\sqrt[n]{a} \\cdot \\sqrt[n]{b} = \\sqrt[n]{ab}$ and $\\frac{\\sqrt[n]{a}}{\\sqrt[n]{b}} = \\sqrt[n]{\\frac{a}{b}}$. When indices differ, convert to rational exponents, find a common denominator, and combine using exponent rules. For binomial denominators containing square roots, multiply by the conjugate to rationalize. Common mistakes include adding unlike radicals, forgetting to simplify before combining, incorrect multiplication of coefficients and radicands, and leaving radicals in denominators. These operations are essential in physics (vector magnitudes), engineering (RMS calculations), and geometry (distance formula).",
