  "expanded_description": "Inverse functions are a fundamental concept in mathematics that describe when two functions \"undo\" each other. If a function $f$ takes an input $x$ and produces an output $y$, then its inverse $f^{-1}$ takes $y$ as input and produces the original $x$. Not every function has an inverse; for an inverse to exist, the function must be one-to-one (pass the horizontal line test). The graphs of a function and its inverse are symmetric about the line $y = x$. Understanding inverse functions is essential for solving equations, understanding logarithms and exponentials, and for many applications in science and engineering.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Two functions $f$ and $g$ are inverses of each other if $f(g(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$, and $g(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$. The graph of $f^{-1}$ is the reflection of the graph of $f$ across the line $y = x$. To find the inverse of a function algebraically, replace $f(x)$ with $y$, swap $x$ and $y$, then solve for $y$.",
    "explanation": "Think of a function as a machine that transforms inputs into outputs. Its inverse is the same machine running backward—it takes the outputs and returns the original inputs. The condition $f(g(x)) = x$ means that if you apply $g$ then $f$, you get back where you started. Graphically, this \"undoing\" appears as symmetry across the diagonal line $y=x$: if you fold the graph along this line, the function and its inverse match up perfectly.",

        "context": "If a function is not one-to-one, its \"inverse\" would assign multiple inputs to the same output, violating the definition of a function. For example, $f(x) = x^2$ is not one-to-one over all reals because $f(2) = f(-2) = 4$, so it has no inverse function over its entire domain. However, by restricting the domain, we can create a one-to-one function that does have an inverse."

  "summary": "Inverse functions undo each other: $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$. A function must be one-to-one (pass the horizontal line test) to have an inverse that is also a function. To find an inverse algebraically, replace $f(x)$ with $y$, swap $x$ and $y$, then solve for $y$. The graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are symmetric about the line $y = x$. The domain of $f^{-1}$ is the range of $f$, and the range of $f^{-1}$ is the domain of $f$. For functions that are not one-to-one over their entire domain, we can restrict the domain to make them invertible. Common mistakes include confusing $f^{-1}$ with the reciprocal, forgetting to swap variables, ignoring domain restrictions, and assuming all functions have inverses. Inverse functions are essential in temperature conversion, economics (demand functions), and cryptography.",
