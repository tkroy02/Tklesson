  "expanded_description": "Graphing square root and cube root functions involves understanding their basic shapes, domains, and key features. The parent square root function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ starts at the origin and increases slowly, while the cube root function $f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ passes through the origin and increases for all $x$, with symmetry about the origin. These functions have distinct domains: square root functions are defined only for non-negative radicands, while cube root functions are defined for all real numbers. Understanding these basic graphs is essential before applying transformations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The parent square root function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ has domain $[0, \\infty)$ and range $[0, \\infty)$, with a starting point at $(0,0)$ and increasing gradually. The parent cube root function $f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ has domain $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ and range $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, passing through $(0,0)$ and symmetric about the origin (odd function). Both functions are one-to-one and have inverses that are power functions.",
    "explanation": "Think of the square root function as the inverse of $y = x^2$ for $x \\geq 0$. Its graph is half of a sideways parabola, starting at the origin and curving upward. The cube root function is the inverse of $y = x^3$ for all real $x$, so its graph passes through the origin and increases slowly, with the characteristic shape of a cubic rotated 90 degrees. Both functions are increasing, but the square root is defined only for non-negative inputs.",

For square roots, the domain is found by setting the radicand $\\geq 0$. For cube roots, there are no domain restrictions from the root itself. The starting point of a transformed square root $f(x) = \\sqrt{x - h} + k$ is at $(h, k)$. The inflection point of a transformed cube root $f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x - h} + k$ is at $(h, k)$. Common mistakes include drawing square root graphs for negative $x$, confusing the shapes of square and cube roots, misidentifying the starting point, and forgetting that cube roots can be negative. These functions model real-world phenomena like pendulum periods, fluid flow rates, and economic diminishing returns.",
