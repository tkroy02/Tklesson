  "expanded_description": "Verifying inverse functions algebraically is a crucial skill that confirms whether two functions are truly inverses of each other. While graphing can suggest an inverse relationship, algebraic verification using composition provides definitive proof. Two functions $f$ and $g$ are inverses if and only if $f(g(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$, and $g(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$. This composition test is the formal definition of inverse functions and ensures that they undo each other completely.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Functions $f$ and $g$ are inverses of each other if and only if $f(g(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$, and $g(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$. This must hold for every $x$ in the respective domains.",
    "explanation": "Think of function composition as a two-step process. If $f$ and $g$ are inverses, then applying $g$ then $f$ (or $f$ then $g$) should return you to your original input. It's like putting on a sock then a shoe—the inverse would be taking off the shoe then the sock. The composition test checks that these operations truly reverse each other. Both compositions must work because the functions might have different domains, and we need to ensure the reversal works in both directions.",

For square roots and even powers, careful attention must be paid to absolute values and domain restrictions: $\\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$, not $x$, so the domain must be restricted to $x \\geq 0$ for the inverse relationship to hold. For cube roots and odd powers, no such restrictions are needed. Rational functions require careful algebraic simplification, often involving complex fractions, but the process is systematic. Domain considerations are essential: even if the algebra simplifies to $x$, the composition must be defined for all $x$ in the original function's domain. Common mistakes include checking only one composition, ignoring absolute value issues, algebraic errors in simplification, and overlooking domain restrictions from intermediate steps. Verifying inverses is crucial in cryptography (encryption/decryption), engineering (sensor calibration), and economics (currency conversion).",
