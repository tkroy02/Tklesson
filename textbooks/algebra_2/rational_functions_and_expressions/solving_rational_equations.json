  "expanded_description": "Solving rational equations involves equations that contain rational expressions. Unlike polynomial equations, rational equations can have extraneous solutions—values that satisfy the transformed equation but make the original equation undefined. The key to solving rational equations is to eliminate denominators by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator (LCD), then solving the resulting polynomial equation. However, any solution that makes any denominator zero in the original equation must be rejected. Mastering rational equations is essential for applications involving rates, proportions, and combined work problems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a rational equation: 1) Find the least common denominator (LCD) of all rational expressions in the equation. 2) Multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to clear denominators. 3) Solve the resulting polynomial equation. 4) Check all solutions in the original equation to identify and discard any extraneous solutions.",
    "explanation": "Think of solving rational equations as clearing fractions first. Just as you might multiply both sides of $\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{3} = 5$ by 6 to clear denominators, you do the same with rational equations—but with polynomial denominators. The critical difference is that multiplying by an expression that could be zero (the LCD might be zero for some x-values) can introduce extraneous solutions. That's why checking in the original equation is essential, not optional.",

  "summary": "Solving rational equations involves clearing denominators by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator (LCD) of all rational expressions in the equation. This process transforms the rational equation into a polynomial equation that can be solved using standard methods. However, because multiplying by an expression that could be zero may introduce extraneous solutions, it is essential to check all potential solutions in the original equation. Extraneous solutions often arise when a solution makes any denominator zero in the original equation. To avoid missing valid solutions or including invalid ones: 1) Factor all denominators to find the LCD and identify restricted values. 2) Multiply every term on both sides by the LCD. 3) Solve the resulting equation. 4) Check each solution against the restricted values and by substitution into the original equation. Common mistakes include forgetting to check for extraneous solutions, not multiplying every term by the LCD, using an incorrect LCD, and losing solutions by canceling factors that could be zero. Rational equations are essential in work problems, distance-rate-time problems, and electrical circuit analysis.",
