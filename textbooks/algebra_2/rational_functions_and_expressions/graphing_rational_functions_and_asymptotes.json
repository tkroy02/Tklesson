  "expanded_description": "Graphing rational functions combines concepts from polynomial graphing with new features: asymptotes. Unlike polynomials, rational functions can have vertical asymptotes where the function is undefined, and horizontal or slant asymptotes that describe end behavior. Understanding how to find and interpret these asymptotes, along with x-intercepts and y-intercepts, allows us to sketch accurate graphs of rational functions. These graphs are essential in modeling real-world phenomena like concentration rates, average cost, and inverse relationships.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A rational function $f(x) = \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ (with $P$ and $Q$ polynomials) has vertical asymptotes at real zeros of $Q(x)$ that are not also zeros of $P(x)$. The end behavior is determined by comparing the degrees of $P$ and $Q$: if degree $P$ < degree $Q$, horizontal asymptote $y=0$; if degree $P$ = degree $Q$, horizontal asymptote $y = \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of }P}{\\text{leading coefficient of }Q}$; if degree $P$ = degree $Q + 1$, slant asymptote; if degree $P$ > degree $Q + 1$, no horizontal or slant asymptote (end behavior like a polynomial).",
    "explanation": "Think of a rational function as a fraction of two polynomials. The denominator tells you where the function is undefined—these are the vertical asymptotes (unless the same factor cancels, which creates a hole instead). The degrees of numerator and denominator tell you about the long-term behavior: if the denominator grows faster (higher degree), the fraction approaches zero. If they grow at the same rate, the function approaches the ratio of their leading coefficients. If the numerator's degree is exactly one more than the denominator's, the function has a slant asymptote—it behaves like a line for large $|x|$.",

  "summary": "Graphing rational functions involves a systematic approach: factor numerator and denominator to identify holes and vertical asymptotes (zeros of denominator that don't cancel). Compare degrees to find horizontal asymptotes: if numerator degree < denominator degree, $y=0$; if equal, $y = \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\\text{leading coefficient of denominator}}$; if numerator degree = denominator degree + 1, use polynomial division to find slant asymptote; if numerator degree > denominator degree + 1, no horizontal or slant asymptote. Find intercepts: y-intercept by evaluating $f(0)$, x-intercepts by solving numerator = 0 (excluding holes). Plot additional points between and beyond asymptotes to guide the sketch. Common mistakes include confusing holes with vertical asymptotes, misapplying horizontal asymptote rules, thinking graphs can't cross horizontal asymptotes, and sign errors in behavior near vertical asymptotes. Rational functions model many real-world phenomena, including drug concentration, average cost, and inverse square laws.",
