  "expanded_description": "Multiplying and dividing rational expressions follows the same rules as multiplying and dividing numerical fractions. To multiply, multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together, then simplify. To divide, multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor. These operations require careful factoring to identify common factors that can be canceled before multiplying, which simplifies the process and reduces the chance of errors. Mastering these operations is essential for working with complex rational expressions and solving rational equations.",

    "principle": "For rational expressions $\\frac{P}{Q}$ and $\\frac{R}{S}$ (with $Q \\neq 0$, $S \\neq 0$, and for division $R \\neq 0$): <br> Multiplication: $\\frac{P}{Q} \\cdot \\frac{R}{S} = \\frac{P \\cdot R}{Q \\cdot S}$ <br> Division: $\\frac{P}{Q} \\div \\frac{R}{S} = \\frac{P}{Q} \\cdot \\frac{S}{R} = \\frac{P \\cdot S}{Q \\cdot R}$",
    "explanation": "Think of multiplying and dividing rational expressions just like working with numerical fractions. When you multiply $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}$, you multiply numerators ($2 \\times 4 = 8$) and denominators ($3 \\times 5 = 15$). When you divide $\\frac{2}{3} \\div \\frac{4}{5}$, you multiply by the reciprocal: $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$. The only difference with rational expressions is that you're multiplying polynomials, so factoring and canceling common factors before multiplying makes the process much easier.",

  "summary": "Multiplying and dividing rational expressions follows the same rules as numerical fractions. For multiplication, multiply numerators together and denominators together, but always factor first and cancel common factors before multiplying to simplify the process. For division, rewrite as multiplication by the reciprocal of the divisor, then follow the multiplication steps. When working with multiple operations, rewrite all divisions as multiplications first, then factor everything and cancel common factors across all numerators and denominators. Domain restrictions must include all values that make any original denominator zero, plus any values that make the numerator of any divisor zero (since they become denominators after taking reciprocals). Common mistakes include forgetting to take the reciprocal in division, canceling before factoring, missing domain restrictions in division, and mishandling opposite factors. These operations are essential in physics (lens formula), electrical engineering (parallel circuits), and business (unit pricing).",
