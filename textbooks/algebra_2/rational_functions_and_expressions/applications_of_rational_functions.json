  "expanded_description": "Solving rational inequalities involves finding the values of x that make a rational expression greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to zero (or another value). Unlike polynomial inequalities, rational inequalities have additional considerations because the expression can be undefined at certain points. Sign charts are particularly useful for rational inequalities because they allow us to track both where the expression is zero (numerator zeros) and where it is undefined (denominator zeros). The solution set is typically a union of intervals, with careful attention to whether endpoints are included or excluded.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a rational inequality: 1) Rewrite the inequality so that one side is zero. 2) Find all zeros of the numerator and denominator (critical points). 3) Use these critical points to divide the number line into intervals. 4) Create a sign chart by testing a point in each interval to determine the sign of the rational expression. 5) Select the intervals where the inequality holds, being careful with endpoint inclusion based on the inequality symbol.",
    "explanation": "Think of solving rational inequalities as determining where the graph of a rational function is above or below the x-axis. The numerator zeros tell you where the function is zero (potential crossing points). The denominator zeros tell you where the function is undefined (vertical asymptotes or holes). Between these critical points, the sign of the rational expression is constant. By testing one point in each interval, you can determine the sign throughout that interval. The solution is the union of intervals where the inequality is satisfied.",

  "summary": "Solving rational inequalities involves finding where a rational expression is positive, negative, or zero. The process begins by rewriting the inequality so that one side is zero and the other is a single rational expression. Factor numerator and denominator to find critical points—values where the expression is zero (numerator zeros) or undefined (denominator zeros). Arrange these critical points in increasing order and use them to divide the number line into intervals. Create a sign chart by testing a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression. Select the intervals where the sign matches the inequality ($>0$ or $<0$). For non-strict inequalities ($\\geq 0$ or $\\leq 0$), include numerator zeros (where the expression equals zero) but NEVER include denominator zeros (where it's undefined). Common mistakes include including denominator zeros in the solution, failing to combine terms into a single fraction before starting, sign errors when testing intervals, and misordering critical points. Rational inequalities have important applications in medicine (therapeutic drug levels), economics (profit margins), and physics (safe intensity levels).",
