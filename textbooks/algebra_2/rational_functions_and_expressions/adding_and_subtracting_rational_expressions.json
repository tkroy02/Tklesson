  "expanded_description": "Adding and subtracting rational expressions requires finding a common denominator, just as with numerical fractions. When the denominators are the same, we simply add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator. When they are different, we must find the least common denominator (LCD) by factoring each denominator and taking the highest power of each factor. This process combines factoring skills with polynomial manipulation and is essential for solving rational equations and simplifying complex expressions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To add or subtract rational expressions: 1) Factor all denominators completely. 2) Find the least common denominator (LCD) by taking each distinct factor to its highest power. 3) Rewrite each expression with the LCD. 4) Add or subtract the numerators. 5) Simplify the result and state domain restrictions.",
    "explanation": "Think of adding and subtracting rational expressions like adding fractions such as $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6}$. You find the LCD (12), rewrite each fraction ($\\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{2}{12}$), then add numerators ($\\frac{5}{12}$). With rational expressions, the denominators are polynomials, so you factor them to find the LCD, which is a polynomial containing each factor to its highest power. The process is the same—just with polynomials instead of numbers.",

  "summary": "Adding and subtracting rational expressions follows the same principles as adding and subtracting numerical fractions. For expressions with like denominators, simply combine the numerators and keep the denominator. For unlike denominators, first find the least common denominator (LCD) by factoring all denominators and taking each distinct factor to its highest power. Then rewrite each expression as an equivalent fraction with the LCD by multiplying numerator and denominator by the missing factors. Add or subtract the numerators, keeping the LCD as the denominator. Finally, simplify the result by factoring the numerator and canceling any common factors with the denominator, and state domain restrictions from the original denominators. Common mistakes include adding denominators directly, sign errors in subtraction (especially forgetting to distribute the negative), missing factors when finding the LCD, and forgetting to state domain restrictions. These operations are essential in electrical engineering (parallel circuits), work problems, and averaging rates.",
