  "expanded_description": "Simplifying rational expressions is the process of reducing algebraic fractions to their simplest form, much like simplifying numerical fractions. A rational expression is a fraction where the numerator and denominator are polynomials. The simplification process involves factoring both polynomials completely and canceling common factors. This fundamental skill is essential for all operations with rational expressions—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and solving equations—just as simplifying numerical fractions is essential for arithmetic with fractions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A rational expression is in simplest form when the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1 (or -1). To simplify, factor the numerator and denominator completely, then cancel any factors that appear in both, provided they are not zero.",
    "explanation": "Think of simplifying rational expressions like reducing a numerical fraction such as $\\frac{6}{8}$ to $\\frac{3}{4}$. You factor both numbers (6 = 2 × 3, 8 = 2 × 4) and cancel the common factor 2. With rational expressions, you do the same thing—factor polynomials instead of integers, and cancel common polynomial factors. The key difference is that you must consider domain restrictions: values that make the original denominator zero are excluded from the domain, even after canceling.",

  "summary": "Simplifying rational expressions involves writing a fraction of two polynomials in lowest terms by factoring both numerator and denominator completely and canceling any common factors. The process is analogous to simplifying numerical fractions. Key steps: 1) Factor the numerator completely. 2) Factor the denominator completely. 3) Cancel any factors that appear in both. 4) State the domain restrictions from the original denominator—values that make it zero are excluded even if they cancel. Special attention is needed for opposite factors like $(a-b)$ and $(b-a)$, where factoring out $-1$ enables cancellation and introduces a sign change. Common mistakes include canceling terms instead of factors, forgetting domain restrictions, mishandling opposite factors, and not factoring out GCFs first. Simplifying rational expressions is foundational for all operations with rational expressions and has practical applications in physics (circuit analysis), economics (average cost), and medicine (drug concentration modeling).",
