  "expanded_description": "Rational functions are powerful tools for modeling real-world situations involving rates, proportions, and inverse relationships. Three common types of applications are work problems (combined work rates), distance-rate-time problems (average speed, travel times), and mixture problems. These applications often lead to rational equations that need to be solved, and the solutions must be interpreted in the context of the problem. Understanding how to set up and solve these models is essential for applying algebra to practical situations in physics, engineering, business, and everyday life.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Many real-world situations can be modeled using rational functions. Key formulas include: <br><br> • Work: $\\frac{1}{t} = \\frac{1}{t_1} + \\frac{1}{t_2} + ...$ (combined work rate) <br> • Distance-Rate-Time: $d = rt$, $t = \\frac{d}{r}$, $r = \\frac{d}{t}$ <br> • Average speed for equal distances: $\\bar{r} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2}}$ <br> • Mixtures: $\\frac{\\text{amount of solute}}{\\text{total volume}} = \\text{concentration}$",
    "explanation": "Think of these applications as using the same mathematical structures in different contexts. Work problems add rates (jobs per hour). Distance-rate-time problems relate distance, rate, and time in a reciprocal relationship. Mixture problems use ratios to track concentrations. In each case, the unknown appears in the denominator of a rational expression, leading to rational equations that must be solved, with solutions checked for reasonableness in the real-world context.",

Work problems use the principle that rates add: $\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{t_1} + \\frac{1}{t_2} + ...$, where $T$ is time working together. Distance-rate-time problems use $d = rt$, often leading to equations like $\\frac{d}{r_1} + \\frac{d}{r_2} = T$ for trips with multiple legs. For equal distances, average speed is the harmonic mean: $\\bar{r} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2}}$. Mixture problems track solute amounts: $c_1V_1 + c_2V_2 = c_{total}(V_1 + V_2)$. Combined rate problems (wind/current) use effective speeds $v \\pm w$. Common mistakes include using arithmetic mean for average speed, forgetting to check reasonableness (positive times, speeds less than still speed), adding times instead of rates in work problems, and unit inconsistencies. These applications are essential in project management, logistics, pharmacy, and sports analytics.",
