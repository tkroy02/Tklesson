  "expanded_description": "Holes, also called removable discontinuities, are points where a rational function is undefined but the graph has a gap rather than an asymptote. They occur when a common factor cancels from the numerator and denominator, leaving the function undefined at that x-value but defined everywhere else nearby. Understanding holes is essential for accurate graphing and for interpreting the behavior of rational functions, especially in applications where such discontinuities represent physically meaningful gaps.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A rational function $f(x) = \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ has a hole at $x = a$ if $(x - a)$ is a factor of both $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$. After canceling the common factor, the simplified function $g(x)$ is defined at $x = a$, but the original function is not. The hole is located at $(a, g(a))$.",
    "explanation": "Think of a hole as a point that has been \"removed\" from an otherwise continuous graph. The function wants to be continuous, but a factor that cancels creates a 0/0 situation at that x-value. When you simplify, you get a new function that would be defined there, but the original function isn't—so you put an open circle at that point to show it's missing. Holes are different from vertical asymptotes, where the function blows up to infinity.",

  "summary": "Holes (removable discontinuities) occur in rational functions when a common factor cancels from the numerator and denominator. To identify holes: factor completely, cancel common factors, and note the x-values that were canceled. The y-coordinate of each hole is found by evaluating the simplified function at that x-value. Holes are distinct from vertical asymptotes, which occur when a denominator factor does not cancel. When graphing, first graph the simplified function, then place an open circle at each hole location to indicate the point is not included. Domain restrictions include both holes and vertical asymptotes—all values that make the original denominator zero are excluded. Common mistakes include confusing holes with vertical asymptotes, using the original function to find hole coordinates (which is undefined), forgetting to include holes in domain restrictions, and drawing holes as closed circles. Understanding holes is important for accurate graphing and for interpreting real-world models where quantities may be undefined at specific points.",
