  "expanded_description": "Exponential regression is a statistical method for finding an exponential model that best fits a set of data points. When data exhibits exponential growth or decay patterns (increasing or decreasing at a constant percentage rate), an exponential function of the form $y = ab^x$ or $y = ae^{bx}$ can model the relationship. Modern graphing calculators and software can perform exponential regression to determine the parameters $a$ and $b$ that minimize the differences between the model and the actual data. This technique is widely used in science, finance, and economics to analyze trends and make predictions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Exponential regression finds the best-fitting exponential function $y = ab^x$ (or $y = ae^{bx}$) for a given set of data. The coefficient $a$ represents the initial value (when $x = 0$), and $b$ is the growth factor ($b > 1$ for growth, $0 < b < 1$ for decay). For the form $y = ae^{bx}$, $b$ is the continuous growth rate.",
    "explanation": "Think of exponential regression as drawing the best exponential curve through scattered data points. Unlike linear regression which finds a line, exponential regression finds a curve that captures multiplicative growth patterns. The process uses logarithms to transform the exponential relationship into a linear one, then applies linear regression techniques. Most graphing calculators have built-in functions to perform exponential regression automatically.",

  "summary": "Exponential regression finds the best-fitting exponential model $y = ab^x$ for data that exhibits exponential growth or decay. The method often uses linearization: taking logarithms transforms $y = ab^x$ into $\\ln y = \\ln a + x \\ln b$, a linear equation. Linear regression on $(x, \\ln y)$ gives slope and intercept, which are then exponentiated to recover $a$ and $b$. Most graphing calculators have built-in exponential regression functions. The output includes $a$ (initial value), $b$ (growth/decay factor), and $r^2$ (fit quality). The growth rate is $b-1$ (if $b>1$) or $1-b$ (if $b<1$). Predictions are made by substituting $x$ into the model, but extrapolation beyond the data range is less reliable. Common mistakes include using exponential regression on inappropriate data, confusing $a$ and $b$, ignoring $r^2$, and extrapolating too far. Exponential regression is widely used in epidemiology, business forecasting, and environmental science.",
