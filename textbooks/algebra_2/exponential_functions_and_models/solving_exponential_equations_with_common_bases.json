  "expanded_description": "Solving exponential equations with common bases is one of the simplest and most elegant techniques in algebra. When both sides of an equation can be written as powers of the same base, we can use the property that if $a^u = a^v$, then $u = v$ (provided $a > 0$ and $a \\neq 1$). This property allows us to set the exponents equal and solve a simpler equation. This technique is particularly useful for equations like $2^{x} = 32$, $3^{2x-1} = 27$, or $4^{x+2} = 8^{x-1}$, where rewriting with a common base is possible.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "If $a^u = a^v$ where $a > 0$, $a \\neq 1$, then $u = v$. To solve exponential equations, rewrite both sides with the same base, then equate the exponents and solve the resulting equation.",
    "explanation": "Think of this as the \"one-to-one property\" of exponential functions. Since exponential functions are either always increasing ($a > 1$) or always decreasing ($0 < a < 1$), they never take the same value at two different inputs. Therefore, if the outputs are equal, the inputs must be equal. This property is the foundation for solving many exponential equations without logarithms.",

To use this property, rewrite both sides of the equation as powers of the same base. This may involve expressing numbers as powers (e.g., $32 = 2^5$), using negative exponents for fractions ($\\frac{1}{8} = 2^{-3}$), and applying exponent rules like $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$. When the base contains the variable, additional cases must be considered: the base could be 0, 1, or -1 (with appropriate restrictions). Always check these special values in addition to equating exponents. Common mistakes include incorrectly rewriting numbers as powers, forgetting negative exponents for fractions, equating exponents before bases are the same, and missing solutions from special base cases. This technique is used in applications involving doubling time, half-life, and compound interest when the growth factors are nice numbers.",
