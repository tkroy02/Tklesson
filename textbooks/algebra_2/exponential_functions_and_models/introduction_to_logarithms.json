  "expanded_description": "Logarithms are the inverses of exponential functions. Just as subtraction undoes addition and division undoes multiplication, logarithms undo exponentiation. The logarithm base $b$ of a number $x$ answers the question: \"To what power must we raise $b$ to get $x$?\" Understanding logarithms as inverses of exponentials is the foundation for working with logarithmic functions, solving exponential equations, and modeling many real-world phenomena where quantities grow or decay exponentially.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For $b > 0$, $b \\neq 1$, the logarithmic function $y = \\log_b x$ is the inverse of the exponential function $y = b^x$. This means: <br> • $\\log_b x = y$ if and only if $b^y = x$ <br> • $\\log_b(b^x) = x$ for all $x$ <br> • $b^{\\log_b x} = x$ for all $x > 0$",
    "explanation": "Think of a logarithm as a question: \"What exponent gives me this number?\" For example, $\\log_2 8 = 3$ because $2^3 = 8$. The base $b$ of the logarithm is the same as the base of the exponential. Just as the square root function answers \"what number squared gives me this?\", the logarithm answers \"what power of the base gives me this?\" This inverse relationship is the key to understanding all logarithmic properties.",

  "summary": "Logarithms are the inverses of exponential functions: $\\log_b x = y$ means $b^y = x$. The base $b$ must be positive and not equal to 1, and the argument $x$ must be positive. Converting between exponential and logarithmic forms is essential: $b^y = x \\iff \\log_b x = y$. To evaluate a logarithm, rewrite the argument as a power of the base. Special notations include common logarithm ($\\log x = \\log_{10} x$) and natural logarithm ($\\ln x = \\log_e x$). The inverse properties state that $\\log_b(b^x) = x$ and $b^{\\log_b x} = x$, which hold when the bases match. Common mistakes include confusing the base and argument, forgetting domain restrictions (arguments must be positive), misapplying inverse properties with mismatched bases, and confusing $\\log$ and $\\ln$. Logarithms are used in real-world applications such as pH (acidity), Richter scale (earthquakes), and decibels (sound intensity).",
