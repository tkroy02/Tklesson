  "expanded_description": "Compound interest is one of the most important applications of exponential functions in finance. It models how money grows when interest is added to the principal at regular intervals, and then that interest itself earns interest in subsequent periods. The formula $A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$ captures this effect, where $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the annual interest rate, $n$ is the number of compounding periods per year, and $t$ is time in years. Understanding compound interest is essential for making informed financial decisions about savings, loans, and investments.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The compound interest formula $A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$ gives the future value $A$ of an investment: <br> • $P$ = principal (initial amount) <br> • $r$ = annual interest rate (as a decimal) <br> • $n$ = number of compounding periods per year <br> • $t$ = time in years <br><br> For continuous compounding, $A = Pe^{rt}$.",
    "explanation": "Think of compound interest as earning interest on interest. Each compounding period, the interest earned is added to the principal, so the next period's interest is calculated on a larger amount. The more frequently interest is compounded, the faster the money grows. The formula $(1 + r/n)^{nt}$ represents the growth factor over $t$ years. As $n$ increases, this factor approaches $e^{rt}$, which is continuous compounding.",

More frequent compounding yields higher returns. Continuous compounding, $A = Pe^{rt}$, represents the limit as $n \\to \\infty$ and gives the maximum possible return. To find unknown variables: $P = A/(1 + r/n)^{nt}$, $r = n[(A/P)^{1/(nt)} - 1]$, and $t = \\ln(A/P)/[n\\ln(1 + r/n)]$. APY (Annual Percentage Yield) allows comparison of different compounding frequencies: $APY = (1 + r/n)^n - 1$ or $APY = e^r - 1$ for continuous. Common mistakes include incorrect rate conversion (forgetting to divide by 100), confusing $n$ and $nt$, forgetting to subtract 1 in APY, and rounding intermediate steps too early. Compound interest is essential for retirement planning, loan calculations, and investment comparisons.",
