  "expanded_description": "The natural base $e$ is one of the most important constants in mathematics, approximately equal to 2.71828. It arises naturally in calculus, continuous growth processes, and many scientific applications. While exponential functions with other bases like $2$ or $10$ model discrete growth (like annual compounding), the base $e$ is used for continuous growth models such as continuously compounded interest, population growth under ideal conditions, and radioactive decay. The function $f(x) = e^x$ has the remarkable property that its slope equals its value at every point, making it fundamental in calculus.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The natural base $e$ is defined as the limit $e = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n \\approx 2.71828$. Continuous growth and decay are modeled by $A(t) = A_0 e^{kt}$, where $k$ is the continuous growth rate ($k > 0$ for growth, $k < 0$ for decay).",
    "explanation": "Think of $e$ as the ultimate growth factor. If you have 100% growth over 1 year, compounded annually, you multiply by 2. Compounded monthly, you multiply by $(1 + 1/12)^{12} \\approx 2.613$. Compounded daily, $(1 + 1/365)^{365} \\approx 2.7146$. As you compound more and more frequently, you approach $e \\approx 2.71828$. Continuous compounding is the limiting case of compounding infinitely often, giving $A = A_0 e^{rt}$ where $r$ is the nominal annual rate.",

Continuous growth is modeled by $A(t) = A_0 e^{kt}$ where $k > 0$ is the continuous growth rate. Continuous decay uses $k < 0$, often written as $A(t) = A_0 e^{-kt}$. The relationship between discrete annual rate $r$ and continuous rate $k$ is $e^k = 1 + r$, so $k = \\ln(1 + r)$ and $r = e^k - 1$. To solve for time in continuous models, use $t = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A}{A_0}\\right)$. Common mistakes include confusing $e^x$ with multiplication, sign errors in decay models, rounding $e$ too early, and forgetting the initial amount $A_0$. Continuous models appear in finance (continuous compounding), physics (Newton's law of cooling), and biology (population growth).",
