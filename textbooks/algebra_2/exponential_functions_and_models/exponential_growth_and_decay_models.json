  "expanded_description": "Exponential growth and decay models describe situations where a quantity changes by a constant percentage rate over equal time intervals. These models appear everywhere in the real world: population growth, radioactive decay, drug concentration in the bloodstream, and inflation are just a few examples. The general form $y = a(1 + r)^t$ for growth (or $y = a(1 - r)^t$ for decay) captures this behavior, where $a$ is the initial amount, $r$ is the rate (as a decimal), and $t$ is time. Understanding these models allows us to predict future values, estimate past values, and analyze rates of change.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Exponential growth and decay are modeled by $y = a(1 + r)^t$ (growth) or $y = a(1 - r)^t$ (decay), where $a$ is the initial amount, $r$ is the rate of change (as a decimal), and $t$ is time. For growth, $r > 0$; for decay, $0 < r < 1$. The base $(1 + r)$ or $(1 - r)$ is called the growth factor or decay factor.",
    "explanation": "Think of exponential growth as repeated multiplication by the same factor. If something grows by 5% each year, you multiply by 1.05 each year. After $t$ years, you've multiplied by 1.05 $t$ times. That's why the exponent $t$ appears. Decay works the same way but with a factor less than 1. The initial amount $a$ is what you start with before any growth or decay occurs.",

  "summary": "Exponential growth and decay models describe quantities that change by a constant percentage rate. Growth is modeled by $y = a(1 + r)^t$ with $r > 0$, giving a growth factor $>1$. Decay is modeled by $y = a(1 - r)^t$ with $0 < r < 1$, giving a decay factor between 0 and 1. The initial amount $a$ is the value at $t = 0$. To find the rate from data, use $\\frac{y}{a} = (1 \\pm r)^t$ and take the $t$th root. Half-life is the time for a decaying quantity to reach half its initial value, satisfying $(1 - r)^{t_{1/2}} = 1/2$. Doubling time is the time for a growing quantity to double, satisfying $(1 + r)^{t_2} = 2$. Common mistakes include confusing growth and decay factors, forgetting to convert percentages to decimals, inconsistent time units, and omitting the initial amount. Exponential models are essential in biology (population growth), medicine (drug decay), economics (inflation), and physics (radioactive decay).",
