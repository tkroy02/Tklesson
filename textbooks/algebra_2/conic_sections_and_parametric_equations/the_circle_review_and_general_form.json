  "expanded_description": "The circle is the simplest and most familiar conic section, yet it deserves careful study because it connects geometry, algebra, and real-world applications. A circle is a special case of an ellipse where the two foci coincide and the eccentricity is zero. Understanding circles builds a foundation for all other conics. You will learn to write equations in both standard form (which reveals the center and radius) and general form (which requires completing the square). Converting between these forms is an essential algebraic skill that reappears throughout mathematics, physics, and engineering.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A circle is the set of all points in a plane equidistant from a fixed point called the center. The constant distance is the radius. The standard equation of a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a point $C$ fixed in the plane. Every point $P$ at distance exactly $r$ from $C$ lies on the circle. Using the distance formula, $\\sqrt{(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2} = r$. Squaring both sides eliminates the square root and gives the clean polynomial form. This equation is the definition of a circle in algebraic terms. Any equation that can be rewritten into this form represents a circle, provided $r>0$. When the equation is expanded, we get the general form $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, which requires completing the square to recover the center and radius.",

  "summary": "A circle is the set of points at fixed distance $r$ from center $(h,k)$, with standard equation $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$. The general form $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ may represent a circle, a point, or no graph after completing the square. Converting between forms requires completing the square for both $x$ and $y$. Given endpoints of a diameter, the center is the midpoint and radius is half the distance. Three points determine a circle by solving a linear system. Graphing a circle requires plotting center and four directional points. Applications include modeling ranges, ripples, and orbits. Common mistakes include sign errors in center, forgetting to balance completing the square, and misidentifying degenerate cases. Mastery of circles is essential for all other conics."
