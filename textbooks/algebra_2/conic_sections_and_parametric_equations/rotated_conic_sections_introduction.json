  "expanded_description": "Up to now, all the conic sections we have studied — parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, and circles — have been aligned with the coordinate axes. Their equations contained no $xy$‑term. But a conic can be rotated so that its axes are not parallel to the $x$‑ or $y$‑axis. Such a conic is called a rotated conic, and its equation includes an $xy$‑term ($B \\neq 0$ in the general form $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$). Rotated conics appear in physics (rotating frames), engineering (stress analysis), and computer graphics. Although graphing them requires advanced techniques (rotation of axes), you can still identify their type using a simple discriminant. This section introduces the key ideas and gives you the tools to recognize a rotated conic and determine its basic shape.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For any conic given by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$ determines the type of conic, regardless of whether it is rotated. If $\\Delta < 0$, the conic is an ellipse (including circles when $A = C$ and $B = 0$). If $\\Delta = 0$, it is a parabola. If $\\Delta > 0$, it is a hyperbola.",
    "explanation": "The discriminant is invariant under rotation — it does not change when the coordinate axes are rotated. This means you can identify the conic type directly from the original coefficients without having to eliminate the $xy$‑term. For example, the equation $xy = 1$ has $A = 0$, $B = 1$, $C = 0$, so $\\Delta = 1^2 - 0 = 1 > 0$, telling us it is a hyperbola (which it is — a rectangular hyperbola rotated 45°). The sign of $\\Delta$ tells you whether the quadratic part of the equation is elliptic (same sign for $A$ and $C$ after a suitable rotation), parabolic (one squared term vanishes), or hyperbolic (opposite signs).",
