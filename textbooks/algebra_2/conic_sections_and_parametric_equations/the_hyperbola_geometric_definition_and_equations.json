  "expanded_description": "The hyperbola is the last of the four conic sections, formed by slicing a double cone with a plane steeper than the side of the cone. Unlike ellipses, hyperbolas consist of two disconnected branches and have asymptotes — lines that the curves approach but never touch. Hyperbolas appear in long-range navigation systems (LORAN), cooling tower designs, sonic booms, and the paths of comets that escape the solar system. The geometric definition involves two foci, but instead of a constant sum of distances, a hyperbola is defined by a constant *difference* of distances. This change from sum to difference transforms the equation from addition to subtraction and introduces asymptotes. Mastering hyperbolas completes your understanding of conic sections and opens the door to advanced applications in physics and engineering.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A hyperbola is the set of all points $P$ such that the absolute difference of the distances from $P$ to two fixed points $F_1$ and $F_2$ (the foci) is constant. This constant equals the distance between the vertices. The center is the midpoint of the foci, and the hyperbola has two branches, each approaching two intersecting lines called asymptotes.",
    "explanation": "Imagine two fixed points (foci) and a piece of string whose length is *less* than the distance between the foci — but the string method is less intuitive than for ellipses. A better image: take a double cone and slice it vertically; the cross-section shows two mirror-image curves. The defining equation is $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ or $\\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \\frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1$, where the minus sign distinguishes it from an ellipse. The asymptotes are lines through the center with slope $\\pm \\frac{b}{a}$ for horizontal hyperbolas or $\\pm \\frac{a}{b}$ for vertical hyperbolas. The relationship $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ links the focal distance $c$ to the distances $a$ and $b$.",

A hyperbola is the set of points $P$ such that $|PF_1 - PF_2| = 2a$, where $2a$ is a constant less than $2c$. The center is the midpoint of $F_1F_2$. The transverse axis is the line through the foci; its endpoints are the vertices, located $a$ units from center. The conjugate axis is perpendicular to the transverse axis at the center, extending $b$ units in each direction, where $b^2 = c^2 - a^2$. The asymptotes are lines through the center with slopes $\\pm \\frac{b}{a}$ (if transverse axis horizontal) or $\\pm \\frac{a}{b}$ (if vertical).",
        "context": "The relationship $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ (notice the plus sign!) distinguishes hyperbolas from ellipses. This plus sign means $c > a$, so the foci are outside the vertices, and the branches open away from each other."

  "summary": "A hyperbola is the set of points where the absolute difference of distances to two foci is constant ($2a$). Its standard equations are $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$ (horizontal transverse axis) and $\\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1$ (vertical transverse axis). The relationship $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ links focal distance $c$ to $a$ and $b$. Asymptotes through center with slopes $\\pm b/a$ or $\\pm a/b$ guide the shape. Vertices are $a$ units from center along transverse axis; foci are $c$ units from center. Eccentricity $e = c/a > 1$ measures how widely the hyperbola opens. Applications include LORAN navigation, cooling towers, and comet trajectories. Graphing requires plotting center, vertices, asymptotes, and sketching branches that approach the asymptotes. Common mistakes include using ellipse formulas and confusing orientation."
