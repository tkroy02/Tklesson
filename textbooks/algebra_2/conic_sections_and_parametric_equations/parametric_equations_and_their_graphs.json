  "expanded_description": "Parametric equations introduce a powerful way to describe curves by expressing both $x$ and $y$ coordinates in terms of a third variable, usually called the parameter $t$ (which often represents time). Unlike the rectangular equations you have used so far ($y = f(x)$ or $x = g(y)$), parametric equations can represent curves that are not functions, such as loops, crosses, or even motions that backtrack. They are essential in physics (projectile motion, planetary orbits), computer graphics (drawing curves), and engineering (designing roller coasters). This section introduces parametric equations, shows how to graph them by plotting points, and explores the direction (orientation) of the curve as the parameter increases.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A parametric curve in the plane is defined by a pair of equations $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$, where $t$ is the parameter. As $t$ varies over some interval, the point $(x(t), y(t))$ traces a curve. The graph consists of all such points; the direction in which the curve is traced as $t$ increases is called the orientation.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a particle moving along a path. At each instant $t$, its position is given by $(x(t), y(t))$. By recording these positions for a continuous range of $t$, you obtain the entire curve. This is more flexible than a single equation $y = f(x)$ because the curve can loop, cross itself, or move vertically (where $y$ would not be a function of $x$). The parameter does not have to be time; it can be any variable. But thinking of it as time helps visualize the motion.",

They can represent curves that are not functions in $x$ or $y$ and naturally model motion. To graph a parametric curve, choose $t$ values in order, compute $(x,y)$, plot points, and connect them in $t$‑order, indicating orientation with arrows. Common parametrizations include lines ($x = x_0+at$, $y = y_0+bt$), circles and ellipses ($x = h + a\\cos t$, $y = k + b\\sin t$), and parabolas ($x=t$, $y=t^2$, etc.). Applications such as projectile motion use $t$ as time. Careful plotting and attention to orientation and domain are essential for correct graphs."
