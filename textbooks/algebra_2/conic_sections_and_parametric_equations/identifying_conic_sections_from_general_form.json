  "expanded_description": "Not every equation of the form $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ represents a conic section you can easily recognize. The coefficients tell a story: they determine whether the graph is a circle, parabola, ellipse, hyperbola, or one of the degenerate cases (a point, a line, two lines, or no graph at all). Being able to identify the conic type from the general equation saves time and guides you toward the correct method for graphing or further analysis. This section gives you the tools to decode that information, focusing first on equations without an $xy$‑term (so the conic is aligned with the axes) and then briefly introducing the discriminant for rotated conics.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a second‑degree equation $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ with $B = 0$ (no $xy$‑term), the type of conic is determined by the coefficients $A$ and $C$ of $x^2$ and $y^2$. If $A$ and $C$ have the same sign, the conic is an ellipse (or a circle if $A = C$). If they have opposite signs, it is a hyperbola. If either $A = 0$ or $C = 0$ (but not both zero), the equation represents a parabola (provided it is not degenerate). Completing the square reveals the specific features and confirms whether the graph is a genuine conic or a degenerate case.",
    "explanation": "Think of the general equation as a coded message. The coefficients $A$ and $C$ are the most important clues. When they are both positive (or both negative) the equation can be rearranged into a sum of squares, which is the signature of an ellipse or circle. When they have opposite signs, the left side becomes a difference of squares, leading to a hyperbola. When one of them is zero, the squared term disappears for that variable, leaving a parabolic form. Completing the square for $x$ and $y$ then converts the equation into a standard form that reveals the exact shape, center, and other features — or tells you that the equation represents nothing at all (empty set).",

        "definition": "Frequent mistakes: relying solely on the signs of $A$ and $C$ without completing the square (missing degeneracy), forgetting to check if $A$ or $C$ is zero, and mishandling the discriminant when $B$ is present.",

  "summary": "To identify a conic from its general equation $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, first check the $xy$ term. If $B = 0$, classify by the signs of $A$ and $C$: same sign → ellipse (circle if $A = C$); opposite signs → hyperbola; one zero → parabola. Then complete the square to confirm and to find features; if the right side becomes zero or negative, the graph is degenerate (point, lines, or empty). If $B \\neq 0$, use the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$: $\\Delta < 0$ → ellipse, $\\Delta = 0$ → parabola, $\\Delta > 0$ → hyperbola. This classification works for all conics, rotated or not. Always verify by completing the square to avoid mistaking degenerate cases for genuine conics."
