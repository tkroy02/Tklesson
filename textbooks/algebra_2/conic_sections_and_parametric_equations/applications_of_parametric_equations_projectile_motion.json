  "expanded_description": "Projectile motion is one of the most vivid applications of parametric equations. When an object is launched into the air — a baseball, a cannonball, or a soccer ball — its path is a parabola (ignoring air resistance). By using time as a parameter, we can describe both the horizontal and vertical positions independently, which is far simpler than trying to write $y$ directly as a function of $x$. These parametric equations allow us to compute the maximum height, the time of flight, and the range, and to answer questions like 'When does the projectile reach a certain height?' or 'How far does it travel before hitting the ground?' Understanding projectile motion through parametrics is essential in physics, engineering, and sports science.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a projectile launched from $(x_0, y_0)$ with initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\\theta$ above the horizontal, neglecting air resistance, the parametric equations are $x(t) = x_0 + (v_0 \\cos\\theta) t$ and $y(t) = y_0 + (v_0 \\sin\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.8$ m/s² or $32$ ft/s²). The parameter $t$ represents time.",
    "explanation": "Gravity acts only vertically, so horizontal velocity $v_x = v_0\\cos\\theta$ remains constant. Vertical velocity $v_y = v_0\\sin\\theta$ changes due to gravity: $v_y(t) = v_0\\sin\\theta - g t$. Integrating velocity gives position: $x(t) = x_0 + v_0\\cos\\theta \\cdot t$, $y(t) = y_0 + v_0\\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2$. This parameterization cleanly separates the independent horizontal motion from the accelerated vertical motion. The path is a parabola because eliminating $t$ yields a quadratic relation between $x$ and $y$.",
