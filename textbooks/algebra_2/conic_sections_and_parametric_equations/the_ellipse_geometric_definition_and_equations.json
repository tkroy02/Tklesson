  "expanded_description": "The ellipse is a conic section that appears throughout nature and technology: planets orbit the sun in elliptical paths, whispering galleries use elliptical acoustics to carry sound between foci, and elliptical gears transfer motion in machinery. Defined geometrically by two fixed points called foci, an ellipse is the set of all points where the sum of distances to these foci is constant. This elegant definition leads to a standard equation that reveals the ellipse's center, vertices, major and minor axes, and eccentricity. Mastering ellipses builds the foundation for understanding orbital mechanics, optics, and advanced mathematics.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An ellipse is the set of all points $P$ such that the sum of the distances from $P$ to two fixed points $F_1$ and $F_2$ (the foci) is constant. This constant equals the length of the major axis. The center is the midpoint of the foci, and the ellipse is symmetric about both axes through the center.",
    "explanation": "Imagine two thumbtacks (the foci) pushed into a board a fixed distance apart, and a loop of string with length greater than the distance between them. Place the loop around the tacks, pull it taut with a pencil, and trace a curve — the result is an ellipse. The sum of distances from the pencil to each tack stays constant because it's the string length. This geometric definition leads directly to the algebraic equation. For an ellipse centered at the origin with major axis along the x‑axis, the equation is $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a > b > 0$, $a$ is the semi‑major axis length, and $b$ is the semi‑minor axis length. The foci are at $(\\pm c, 0)$ with $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$.",

  "summary": "An ellipse is the set of points where the sum of distances to two foci is constant ($2a$). Its standard equation centered at $(h,k)$ is $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$ for horizontal major axis ($a > b$), and $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} = 1$ for vertical major axis ($a > b$). The relationship $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$ links the focal distance $c$ to the axes. Vertices are $a$ units from center along the major axis; co-vertices are $b$ units along the minor axis. Eccentricity $e = c/a$ ($0 \\le e < 1$) measures elongation. Applications include planetary orbits, whispering galleries, and medical devices. Graphing requires plotting center, vertices, co-vertices, and foci, then sketching the symmetric curve."
