  "expanded_description": "The parabola is one of the four conic sections, formed by slicing a double cone with a plane parallel to the side of the cone. Parabolas appear everywhere in the real world: satellite dishes reflect signals to the focus, suspension bridge cables hang in parabolic curves, car headlights use parabolic reflectors to focus light, and projectile paths under gravity are parabolic. In mathematics, the parabola is defined by a simple geometric relationship involving a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix). This definition leads to a standard equation that reveals the parabola's vertex, axis of symmetry, and orientation. Mastering parabolas is essential for understanding more advanced conics and their applications.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A parabola is the set of all points in a plane equidistant from a fixed point (the focus) and a fixed line (the directrix). The vertex is the midpoint between the focus and the directrix. The axis of symmetry passes through the focus and is perpendicular to the directrix.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a point F (focus) and a horizontal line d (directrix) below it. For any point P on the parabola, the distance from P to F equals the perpendicular distance from P to line d. As P moves, it traces a curve symmetric about the vertical line through F. This geometric definition gives rise to the algebraic equation. For a parabola opening upward or downward, the standard form is $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex and $p$ is the directed distance from the vertex to the focus. If $p > 0$ it opens upward; if $p < 0$ it opens downward. For left/right opening, the roles of x and y swap: $(y-k)^2 = 4p(x-h)$.",
