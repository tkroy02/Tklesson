  "expanded_description": "Polar coordinates offer an alternative way to describe points in the plane, based on distance from a fixed point (the pole) and angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). While Cartesian coordinates use horizontal and vertical distances, polar coordinates are natural for circular and spiral patterns, making them indispensable in physics (orbits, waves), engineering (antenna patterns), and mathematics (complex numbers). This section introduces the polar coordinate system, conversion between polar and Cartesian coordinates, and basic polar equations and their graphs. Mastering polar coordinates expands your toolkit for describing curves that are awkward or impossible in Cartesian form.",

  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A point in the plane can be represented by polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $r$ is the distance from the origin (pole) and $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the positive $x$-axis (polar axis). By convention, $r \\ge 0$ and $\\theta$ is usually given in radians or degrees. Negative $r$ can also be used, meaning the point is in the opposite direction of $\\theta$.",
    "explanation": "Imagine standing at the origin, facing the positive $x$-axis. To locate a point, you turn through angle $\\theta$ (counter‑clockwise for positive) and then walk a distance $|r|$ along that ray. If $r$ is negative, you walk backward instead. This simple idea produces coordinates that are ideal for circles, spirals, and other rotationally symmetric figures. Converting between polar and Cartesian uses the relationships $x = r\\cos\\theta$, $y = r\\sin\\theta$, and $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$, $\\tan\\theta = y/x$ (with quadrant adjustments).",
