    "principle": "Market equilibrium occurs at the price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, resulting in no inherent tendency for change and efficient allocation of resources without shortages or surpluses.",
    "explanation": "Equilibrium is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect, establishing a market-clearing price $P^*$ and quantity $Q^*$ where $Q_d = Q_s$. At prices above equilibrium, surpluses occur ($Q_s > Q_d$), creating downward pressure on prices. At prices below equilibrium, shortages occur ($Q_d > Q_s$), creating upward pressure on prices. The price mechanism automatically guides markets toward equilibrium through these pressures.",

  "summary": "Market equilibrium represents the balancing point where supply and demand intersect, establishing stable prices and quantities that clear markets without shortages or surpluses. The equilibrium price $P^*$ and quantity $Q^*$ emerge from the interaction of buyers and sellers, with the price mechanism automatically guiding markets toward equilibrium through responses to shortages and surpluses. Changes in supply or demand conditions shift equilibrium points, with predictable effects on prices and quantities. In competitive markets, equilibrium generates efficient outcomes that maximize total social welfare, measured by the sum of consumer and producer surplus. Understanding market equilibrium provides the foundation for analyzing how markets coordinate economic activity, allocate resources efficiently, and respond to changing conditions through price signals."
