  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Normal goods are those for which demand increases as consumer income rises and decreases as income falls, while inferior goods are those for which demand decreases as income rises and increases as income falls, with the classification depending on consumer preferences and the availability of substitutes.",
    "explanation": "The relationship between income and demand is characterized by income elasticity of demand $E_i = \\frac{\\% \\Delta Q_d}{\\% \\Delta I}$. For normal goods, $E_i > 0$; for inferior goods, $E_i < 0$. Normal goods can be further classified as necessities ($0 < E_i < 1$) or luxuries ($E_i > 1$). The classification is context-dependent and can change over time or across different consumer groups.",

          "statement": "Consumer demand progresses through a hierarchy from basic physiological needs to higher-level psychological needs, with goods satisfying lower-level needs typically having lower income elasticity and reaching saturation sooner, while goods satisfying higher-level needs maintain strong income sensitivity.",
          "application": "This principle helps explain why certain goods transition from normal to inferior status while others maintain normal good characteristics, based on which level of needs they satisfy and how consumer priorities evolve with prosperity.",
          "example": "Basic food items (physiological needs) reach consumption limits quickly, while education, self-improvement, and luxury experiences (self-actualization needs) continue growing with income indefinitely.",
          "analogy": "Like building a pyramid - you complete the foundation first (basic needs), then progressively add higher levels (psychological needs), with demand shifting upward as income allows.",

  "summary": "Normal and inferior goods represent fundamentally different relationships between income and demand, with normal goods showing positive income elasticity (demand increases with income) and inferior goods showing negative income elasticity (demand decreases with income). Normal goods include both necessities (0 < E_i < 1) and luxuries (E_i > 1), while inferior goods typically represent budget alternatives or products associated with economic hardship. However, classification is dynamic and context-dependent - the same product can be normal for some consumers and inferior for others, or transition between categories over time due to technological change, market saturation, or evolving consumer preferences. Understanding these classifications and their fluid boundaries is essential for predicting consumer behavior across different economic conditions and income levels."
