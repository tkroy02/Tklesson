    "principle": "The law of demand states that, ceteris paribus, there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded - as price increases, quantity demanded decreases, and as price decreases, quantity demanded increases.",
    "explanation": "This inverse relationship occurs due to two main effects: the substitution effect (consumers switch to cheaper alternatives when a good's price rises) and the income effect (a price change affects consumers' real purchasing power). The demand curve graphically represents this relationship, sloping downward from left to right, showing the various quantities consumers are willing and able to purchase at different price levels during a specific time period.",

  "summary": "The law of demand establishes the fundamental inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, driven by substitution and income effects. This relationship is represented by downward-sloping demand curves that show consumer willingness to purchase at various prices. While price changes cause movements along a fixed demand curve, other factors like income, prices of related goods, consumer preferences, and expectations cause the entire curve to shift. Though most goods follow this standard pattern, exceptions like Veblen goods (status items), Giffen goods (extreme necessities), and emergency situations can create upward-sloping demand or other anomalies. Understanding the law of demand and its limitations provides the foundation for analyzing consumer behavior and market dynamics."
