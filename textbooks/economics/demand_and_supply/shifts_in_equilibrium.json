  "expanded_description": "Markets are dynamic, not static. Changes in the underlying determinants of demand (3.3) or supply (3.7) shift the entire demand or supply curve, disrupting the existing equilibrium and setting in motion a process that establishes a new equilibrium price and quantity. Analyzing these shifts—predicting the direction of change in P and Q—is the essential tool for understanding real-world market events, from technological disruptions to policy changes and shifts in consumer tastes. Mastering this analysis allows us to move from description to prediction in economics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A change in any non-price determinant causes the affected curve (demand or supply) to shift. This shift creates a disequilibrium at the original price (a temporary shortage or surplus). The price mechanism then engages: the disequilibrium causes the price to change, creating movements along the other curve (and the shifted curve) until a new intersection is found. The ultimate effect on equilibrium price (P) and quantity (Q) depends on which curve shifted and in which direction. When only one curve shifts, the effects on P and Q are predictable: Demand Increase (D→): P↑, Q↑. Demand Decrease (D←): P↓, Q↓. Supply Increase (S→): P↓, Q↑. Supply Decrease (S←): P↑, Q↓.",
    "explanation": "The step-by-step logic is critical: 1. Identify the event: Which determinant changed? Does it affect demand, supply, or both? 2. Determine the shift direction: Does the event increase or decrease demand/supply? 3. Shift the curve: Draw the new curve. 4. Find the new intersection: Compare the new equilibrium (P2, Q2) to the old (P1, Q1).<br><br>**Single Shifts** are straightforward. **Double Shifts**—when both curves shift simultaneously—require careful stepwise analysis. In a double shift, the effect on either P or Q is ambiguous and depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts. For example, if both demand and supply increase, quantity will definitely increase, but the effect on price is ambiguous (it could rise, fall, or stay the same depending on which shift is larger).<br><br>This analytical framework applies universally, from analyzing the effect of a frost in Brazil on coffee prices (supply decrease) to understanding how a viral social media trend affects the price of a toy (demand increase).",
