  "expanded_description": "Understanding how changes in supply and demand conditions cause equilibrium points to shift over time, analyzing the dynamics of market adjustments, and examining how time lags, expectations, and economic shocks create evolving market outcomes.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Market equilibrium is dynamic rather than static, constantly shifting in response to changes in supply and demand determinants, with the speed and pattern of adjustment depending on market structure, time horizons, and the nature of the economic shocks.",
    "explanation": "Equilibrium shifts occur when changes in non-price factors cause supply or demand curves to move, establishing new equilibrium prices and quantities. These shifts can be temporary or permanent, immediate or gradual, and create adjustment patterns that vary across markets. The adjustment process involves both price changes and quantity responses, with different time horizons (immediate, short-run, long-run) showing different adjustment patterns and elasticities.",

  "summary": "Equilibrium shifts represent the dynamic nature of markets as they constantly adjust to changing economic conditions. Single curve shifts create predictable equilibrium changes, with demand shifts affecting both price and quantity in the same direction, while supply shifts affect price and quantity in opposite directions. Simultaneous shifts create more complex patterns, with one variable changing predictably while the other changes ambiguously depending on relative shift magnitudes. These adjustments occur across different time horizons, with immediate run responses showing price volatility and fixed quantities, short-run responses showing moderate adjustments, and long-run responses showing substantial quantity changes with stable prices. Understanding equilibrium shifts provides the foundation for predicting how markets evolve over time and respond to economic shocks, policy changes, and technological progress."
