  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The determinants of demand are factors other than a good's own price that influence consumer purchasing decisions, causing the entire demand curve to shift leftward (decrease in demand) or rightward (increase in demand) rather than moving along a fixed curve.",
    "explanation": "While price changes cause movements along a demand curve, changes in determinants of demand alter the fundamental relationship between price and quantity, creating new demand curves. The main determinants include: consumer income, prices of related goods (substitutes and complements), consumer tastes and preferences, expectations about future prices and income, and the number of consumers in the market.",

          "principle": "Rational Expectations Theory",
          "statement": "Consumers form expectations about future market conditions based on available information and adjust current behavior accordingly, with demand responding not just to current prices but to anticipated future prices, income, and availability.",
          "application": "This principle explains why demand can shift rapidly in response to news, forecasts, or policy announcements, as consumers act on expectations rather than waiting for actual changes to occur.",
          "example": "When hurricane warnings are issued, demand for emergency supplies spikes immediately based on expectations of future scarcity, not current weather conditions.",
          "analogy": "Like chess players thinking several moves ahead - consumers make current purchasing decisions based on where they expect the market to be in the future.",

  "summary": "The determinants of demand are non-price factors that cause entire demand curves to shift, fundamentally changing the relationship between price and quantity demanded. Key determinants include: consumer income (creating normal/inferior good distinctions), prices of related goods (substitutes and complements), consumer tastes and preferences (influenced by advertising, information, and social trends), expectations about future prices and income, and changes in market population and demographics. Understanding these determinants is crucial for predicting market behavior, as they often create more significant demand changes than price movements alone. The interplay of these factors explains why demand curves constantly evolve in response to changing economic conditions, consumer psychology, and market information."
