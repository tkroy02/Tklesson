    "principle": "The determinants of supply are factors other than a good's own price that influence producer decisions, causing the entire supply curve to shift leftward (decrease in supply) or rightward (increase in supply) rather than moving along a fixed curve.",
    "explanation": "While price changes cause movements along a supply curve, changes in determinants of supply alter the fundamental relationship between price and quantity, creating new supply curves. The main determinants include: production costs (input prices, technology), producer expectations, number of sellers, government policies (taxes, subsidies, regulations), and natural conditions or external shocks.",

  "summary": "The determinants of supply are non-price factors that cause entire supply curves to shift, fundamentally changing the relationship between price and quantity supplied. Key determinants include: production costs (input prices, wages, energy costs), technological capabilities, producer expectations about future prices and costs, number of sellers in the market, government policies (taxes, subsidies, regulations), and natural conditions or external shocks. Understanding these determinants is crucial for predicting market behavior, as they often create more significant supply changes than price movements alone. The interplay of these factors explains why supply curves constantly evolve in response to changing production conditions, technological progress, competitive dynamics, and policy environments."
