  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Disequilibrium occurs when quantity demanded does not equal quantity supplied at the prevailing market price, creating either shortages (excess demand) when $Q_d > Q_s$ or surpluses (excess supply) when $Q_s > Q_d$, with market forces creating automatic price adjustments to restore equilibrium.",
    "explanation": "Shortages occur when prices are below equilibrium, leading to excess demand that creates upward pressure on prices as consumers compete for limited goods. Surpluses occur when prices are above equilibrium, leading to excess supply that creates downward pressure on prices as producers compete to sell excess inventory. Both conditions represent temporary market imbalances that trigger self-correcting price adjustments in competitive markets.",

  "summary": "Disequilibrium occurs when markets fail to balance supply and demand, creating either shortages (excess demand) or surpluses (excess supply). Shortages emerge when prices are below equilibrium, leading to rationing, black markets, and upward price pressure. Surpluses occur when prices are above equilibrium, leading to inventory accumulation, waste, and downward price pressure. Competitive markets automatically adjust toward equilibrium through price changes, but various frictions and policy interventions can slow or prevent this adjustment. Understanding disequilibrium dynamics is crucial for predicting market behavior, evaluating policy interventions, and recognizing how price signals guide resource allocation in market economies."
