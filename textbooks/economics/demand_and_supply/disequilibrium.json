  "expanded_description": "Disequilibrium is the state of imbalance in a market where quantity demanded does not equal quantity supplied. It occurs whenever the market price is set at any level other than the equilibrium price. There are two types of disequilibrium: surplus (excess supply) and shortage (excess demand). While competitive markets naturally tend toward equilibrium through price adjustments, disequilibrium can become persistent when prices are prevented from adjusting due to government controls, institutional rules, or market power. Understanding disequilibrium is essential for analyzing the consequences of price ceilings, price floors, and other market interventions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Disequilibrium exists at any price where quantity demanded (Qd) ≠ quantity supplied (Qs). A surplus (or excess supply) occurs when Qs > Qd; this happens at prices above the equilibrium price (P*). A shortage (or excess demand) occurs when Qd > Qs; this happens at prices below P*. In a freely functioning competitive market, these conditions create pressure for price changes that move the market toward equilibrium. Persistent disequilibrium occurs when this price adjustment is prevented, leading to inefficient outcomes that require non-price rationing mechanisms.",
    "explanation": "It's crucial to distinguish temporary from persistent disequilibrium. Temporary disequilibrium is a natural part of the market's adjustment process (e.g., a holiday sale creating a temporary shortage until prices rise). Persistent disequilibrium is a sustained imbalance caused by barriers to price adjustment.<br><br>At a price set above P*: The high price is a signal and incentive for producers to bring a large quantity to market. However, it is a disincentive for consumers, who buy less. The result is unsold goods—a surplus. This unsold inventory signals to sellers that the price is too high.<br><br>At a price set below P*: The low price is a strong incentive for consumers to demand a large quantity. However, it is a disincentive for producers, who bring less to market. The result is unmet demand—a shortage. This empty shelf and frustrated buyers signal that the price is too low.<br><br>In both cases, the price fails to perform its rationing and signaling functions efficiently. When price cannot change, other, often less efficient, rationing mechanisms must emerge.",

Combine P terms: (100/6)P + (100/3)P = (100/6 + 200/6)P = (300/6)P = 50P. So: 100,000 - 10,000 = 50P → 90,000 = 50P → P = \\$1,800. This contradicts the given. There's an inconsistency.

In a shortage, the rationing is more severe and visible: **waiting lines, lotteries, seller favoritism, discrimination, and black markets** emerge.

Prices are not just transfer payments; they are vital **signals** that guide production and **incentives** that motivate actors, and they perform the **rationing** function of allocating scarce goods to those who value them most. When prices are not allowed to move to equilibrium, these functions break down, leading to inefficiency, waste, and often unintended consequences that hurt the very groups the policies were designed to protect."
