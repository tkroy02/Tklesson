When these price-quantity pairs are plotted on a graph with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, they form a supply curve.

  "summary": "Supply schedules and curves are complementary representations of producer behavior, with schedules organizing price-quantity data in tabular form and curves providing visual representation of the same relationship. Individual supply schedules sum horizontally to create market supply schedules, which then translate into market supply curves. The crucial distinction between movements along supply curves (price changes) and shifts of supply curves (changes in other factors) is fundamental to accurate economic analysis. Understanding how to construct, interpret, and distinguish between these representations provides the graphical foundation for supply analysis and market prediction in economics, revealing producer cost structures, capacity constraints, and responsiveness to market conditions."
