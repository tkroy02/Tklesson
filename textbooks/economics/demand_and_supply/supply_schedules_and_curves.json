  "expanded_description": "Supply schedules and supply curves are complementary tools that represent the relationship between price and quantity supplied. A supply schedule is a table showing specific price-quantity pairs, while a supply curve is the graphical representation of that same relationship. Understanding how to construct, interpret, and use these tools is essential for analyzing producer behavior and market dynamics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A supply schedule is a table listing quantities supplied at various prices, holding all other factors constant. A supply curve is the graphical representation of a supply schedule, plotting price on the vertical axis and quantity supplied on the horizontal axis. Both show the same information—the relationship between price and quantity supplied—in different formats. The supply curve slopes upward from left to right, reflecting the law of supply. Every point on the supply curve represents a specific price-quantity combination from the supply schedule. The supply curve makes the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied visually clear and enables analysis of producer behavior, market outcomes, and policy effects.",
    "explanation": "Supply schedules and curves are the fundamental tools for analyzing producer behavior. They translate the abstract law of supply into concrete, usable information.<br><br>Consider a simple example—weekly supply of apples by an individual producer: Supply Schedule: At \\$1 per apple → 50 apples supplied per week, At \\$2 per apple → 100 apples supplied per week, At \\$3 per apple → 150 apples supplied per week, At \\$4 per apple → 200 apples supplied per week, At \\$5 per apple → 250 apples supplied per week. This table shows the supply schedule—specific price-quantity pairs showing how many apples this producer is willing to supply at each price.<br><br>The same information can be shown graphically as a supply curve: Vertical axis: Price (\\$1, \\$2, \\$3, \\$4, \\$5), Horizontal axis: Quantity (50, 100, 150, 200, 250 apples/week), Plot points: (50, \\$1), (100, \\$2), (150, \\$3), (200, \\$4), (250, \\$5), Connect points with smooth curve sloping upward.<br><br>The supply curve makes the direct relationship visible—as you move up the price axis (higher prices), you move right along the quantity axis (higher quantities). Both formats are useful: Supply schedules provide precise numerical information, useful for calculations. Supply curves provide visual representation, useful for seeing relationships and comparing scenarios.<br><br>We distinguish between: Individual supply (one producer's supply schedule/curve—shows one firm's production behavior), Market supply (sum of all individual supplies—shows total quantity supplied by all producers at each price). Market supply is simply the horizontal sum of individual supplies—at each price, add up quantities supplied by all producers.<br><br>Understanding supply schedules and curves enables: Predicting producer behavior (how will production change if price changes?), Measuring producer surplus (difference between willingness to accept and actual price), Finding market equilibrium (where supply intersects demand), Analyzing policy effects (how do subsidies affect quantity produced?). These tools transform the abstract law of supply into practical analytical power.",

Format: typically two columns—one for price, one for quantity supplied. The schedule lists multiple price points and corresponding quantities, showing how quantity supplied varies with price. Time period specification is essential (per day, per week, per year) because supply is a flow concept—quantity per unit of time.",
        "context": "Supply schedules can represent individual supply (one producer) or market supply (all producers). They provide the foundation for constructing supply curves and performing economic calculations. The schedule must hold all other factors constant (ceteris paribus) to isolate the pure price effect."

  "summary": "Supply schedules and supply curves are complementary tools representing the relationship between price and quantity supplied. A supply schedule is a table listing quantities supplied at various prices, organized with price in one column and corresponding quantity supplied in another. The schedule shows the direct relationship between price and quantity (law of supply) through numerical data, with higher prices corresponding to higher quantities and vice versa. Each entry represents quantity producers are both willing and able to sell (effective supply, not wishful thinking). The schedule must specify a time period (per day, per week, per year) because supply is a flow variable—quantity per unit of time. The ceteris paribus condition is essential—the schedule holds all non-price factors constant (input costs, technology, expectations, number of sellers) to isolate the pure price effect.<br><br>A supply curve is the graphical representation of the supply schedule, plotting price on the vertical axis and quantity supplied on the horizontal axis by convention (always use this orientation in economics). Points from the supply schedule are plotted as coordinates (quantity, price) and connected with a smooth curve. The supply curve slopes upward from left to right, reflecting the law of supply—as you move up the price axis (higher prices), you move right along the quantity axis (higher quantities supplied). Each point on the curve represents a specific price-quantity combination showing how much producers supply at that price. Despite being called a 'curve,' supply curves can be linear (straight lines with constant slope) or nonlinear (curved lines with changing slope)—both are called supply curves by convention. The curve allows reading quantities supplied at any price and prices at any quantity, including interpolating between plotted points.<br><br>Individual supply represents one producer's production behavior at various prices, showing a single firm's supply schedule or curve. Market supply represents all producers combined, showing total quantity supplied by everyone at each price. Market supply is derived through horizontal summation—at each price, add up the quantities supplied by all individual producers. The process: take a price, sum all individual quantities supplied at that price, repeat for all prices to create market supply schedule. Market supply curve lies to the right of any individual supply curve because it represents more producers selling at each price. Market supply inherits the law of supply from individuals—if individual curves slope upward, market curve must also slope upward. Adding more producers to the market increases market supply at every price, shifting the market supply curve rightward. Market size directly affects total supply—larger numbers of producers create greater market supply.<br><br>Supply schedules provide precise numerical information useful for calculations and detailed analysis. Supply curves provide visual representation useful for seeing relationships, comparing scenarios, and geometric analysis of producer surplus, equilibrium, and policy effects. Both formats show the same fundamental information—the price-quantity relationship—but serve different analytical purposes.<br><br>Understanding how to construct supply schedules from data, plot supply curves from schedules, interpret points on curves, aggregate individual supplies into market supply, and translate between numerical and graphical formats is essential for economic analysis. These tools transform the abstract law of supply into concrete, usable frameworks for analyzing producer behavior, predicting market responses to price changes, measuring welfare (producer surplus), finding equilibrium (where supply meets demand), and evaluating policy effects (subsidies, taxes, regulations). Mastery of supply schedules and curves is foundational to all further microeconomic analysis."
