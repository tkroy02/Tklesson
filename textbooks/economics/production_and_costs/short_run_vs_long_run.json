    "principle": "The fundamental distinction between short run and long run in production economics is not based on calendar time but on input flexibility: short run has at least one fixed input, while long run allows adjustment of all inputs, creating different production possibilities and cost structures.",

The long run represents a strategic horizon where all constraints can be changed, allowing complete reoptimization of the production process. This distinction fundamentally shapes firm behavior, cost minimization strategies, and market responses to economic changes.",

          "final_answer": "In short run, the airline has $10 million fixed costs and $100 variable cost per passenger. It should operate if price exceeds $100 (AVC), even if below total cost, to cover some fixed costs. In long run, all costs are variable - the airline can adjust its entire fleet and network. It should only operate if price covers long-run average cost. This explains why airlines may operate unprofitable routes short run (covering variable costs) while planning network restructuring long run (ensuring all costs are covered).",

  "summary": "The distinction between short run and long run in production economics is fundamental to understanding firm behavior. Short run is characterized by at least one fixed input, leading to constrained optimization, diminishing marginal returns, and cost structures that include both fixed and variable components. Long run allows adjustment of all inputs, enabling unconstrained optimization, returns to scale patterns, and cost structures where all costs are variable. This temporal distinction creates different decision rules: in short run, firms consider only variable costs (fixed costs are sunk), while in long run, all costs matter. The actual duration of these periods varies by industry, with capital-intensive sectors having longer adjustment periods than labor-intensive or service sectors. Understanding these differences is crucial for analyzing firm responses to market changes, capacity planning, and the dynamic adjustment of industries to economic conditions."
