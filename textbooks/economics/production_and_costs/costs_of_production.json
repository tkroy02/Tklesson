  "summary": "Production costs are categorized into fixed costs (independent of output), variable costs (changing with output), and total costs (their sum). In the short run, fixed inputs create U-shaped average total cost curves due to the interplay between declining average fixed costs and eventually increasing average variable costs from diminishing returns. Marginal cost plays a crucial role in production decisions, intersecting average costs at their minimum points and determining profit-maximizing output where P=MC. The shutdown rule states that firms should operate if price exceeds average variable cost. In the long run, all inputs are variable, creating long-run average cost curves that typically show economies of scale (declining LRAC), constant returns, and possibly diseconomies of scale (increasing LRAC). Understanding these cost relationships is essential for business decisions regarding production levels, capacity planning, technology choice, and market strategy across different time horizons."
