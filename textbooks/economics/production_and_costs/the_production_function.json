  "summary": "The production function represents the technological relationship between inputs and maximum possible output, serving as the fundamental constraint on firm production capabilities. In the short run with fixed inputs, production exhibits three stages characterized by initially increasing then diminishing marginal returns, with rational firms operating in Stage II. In the long run with all inputs variable, returns to scale determine how output responds to proportional input changes: increasing returns (output more than doubles), constant returns (output doubles), or decreasing returns (output less than doubles). Different mathematical functional forms like Cobb-Douglas and Leontief capture various technological relationships regarding input substitutability and scale properties. Understanding production functions enables analysis of firm efficiency, optimal input combinations, scale decisions, and the technological foundations of economic growth and industry structure."
