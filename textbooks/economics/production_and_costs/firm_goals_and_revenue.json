    "principle": "While firms may pursue multiple objectives, profit maximization serves as the fundamental economic goal that explains most business behavior, with revenue generation representing the income side of the profit equation that must be balanced against costs.",

However, real-world firms may also pursue revenue growth, market share, social objectives, or managerial goals, creating complex decision-making environments. Understanding the relationship between revenue, costs, and different firm objectives provides the foundation for analyzing business behavior across market structures.",

  "summary": "Firm goals center on profit maximization as the primary economic objective, achieved by producing where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Revenue concepts - total, average, and marginal - interact with costs to determine optimal production levels and profitability. While the standard model assumes profit maximization, real-world firms often pursue alternative objectives including revenue growth, market share, sales volume, satisficing behavior, or social goals. These alternative objectives explain why firms sometimes appear to deviate from strict profit maximization. However, the survival constraint principle indicates that profitability remains essential for long-term viability, with other goals becoming feasible only when basic profit requirements are met. Understanding the interplay between different firm objectives and revenue generation provides crucial insights into business behavior across various market structures and economic conditions."
