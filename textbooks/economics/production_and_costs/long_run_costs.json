  "summary": "Long-run costs represent the minimum achievable costs when all inputs are variable and firms can choose optimal scale and technology. The long-run average cost (LRAC) curve serves as an envelope of short-run average cost curves, touching each at the output where that plant size is optimal. The shape of the LRAC curve reflects returns to scale: declining LRAC indicates economies of scale, flat LRAC indicates constant returns, and rising LRAC indicates diseconomies of scale. The minimum efficient scale (MES) - where LRAC is minimized - fundamentally influences industry structure and competitive dynamics. Understanding long-run costs enables strategic decisions about optimal firm size, capacity expansion, technology adoption, and competitive positioning. Businesses use this analysis to navigate scale requirements, develop cost advantages, and plan growth strategies that align with their cost structure and market opportunities."
