  "summary": "Cost calculation methods range from basic arithmetic for simple cost structures to sophisticated mathematical and strategic approaches for complex business scenarios. Fundamental calculations involve summing fixed and variable costs, dividing by quantity for averages, and differencing for marginal costs. Calculus provides precise methods through derivatives for marginal costs and integrals for recovering total costs from marginal costs. Advanced applications address multi-product cost allocation, joint production costs, activity-based costing, and strategic decision-making incorporating opportunity costs and relevant cost analysis. Mastering these methods enables businesses to accurately determine costs, optimize production levels, make informed pricing decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and develop competitive strategies based on thorough understanding of their cost structure and behavior."
