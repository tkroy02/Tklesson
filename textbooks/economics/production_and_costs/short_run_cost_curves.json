  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Short-run cost curves exhibit systematic graphical patterns that reflect the law of diminishing marginal returns: total cost curves increase at varying rates, average cost curves are U-shaped, and marginal cost curves intersect average curves at their minimum points, creating a coherent visual framework for cost analysis.",
    "explanation": "The graphical representation of short-run costs provides intuitive understanding of cost behavior. The TC curve increases slowly initially (increasing returns) then more rapidly (diminishing returns). The ATC and AVC curves are U-shaped due to the interplay between spreading fixed costs and diminishing returns. The MC curve is J-shaped and determines the behavior of average curves. These graphical relationships enable visual analysis of production efficiency, optimal output levels, and profitability conditions.",

  "summary": "Short-run cost curves provide a powerful graphical framework for understanding and analyzing production costs. Total cost curves (TFC, TVC, TC) show how costs accumulate, with TVC and TC exhibiting S-shapes that reflect increasing then diminishing returns. Average cost curves (AFC, AVC, ATC) reveal per-unit costs, with AFC always declining, AVC and ATC U-shaped due to the trade-off between fixed cost spreading and diminishing returns. The marginal cost curve is J-shaped and crucially intersects both AVC and ATC at their minimum points. These systematic graphical relationships enable comprehensive business decision-making: comparing price with AVC determines shutdown decisions, finding where P=MC identifies profit-maximizing output, and comparing price with ATC assesses profitability. Cost curve analysis supports both operational decisions and strategic planning, providing visual intuition about cost behavior, efficiency, and competitive positioning across different production levels."
