The net redistribution of $6,185 primarily benefits borrowers at the expense of savers and fixed-income groups. These arbitrary transfers create economic inefficiency and social inequity, disproportionately harming vulnerable groups like retirees while encouraging speculative borrowing. Policies such as inflation indexing and credible inflation control can mitigate these harmful redistribution effects.",

When businesses cannot predict future costs and prices, they become reluctant to make long-term investments. When consumers face uncertain future purchasing power, they may make suboptimal spending and saving decisions. This uncertainty cost often exceeds the direct costs of inflation itself.",
          "application": "This principle explains why central banks prioritize price stability, why countries with high inflation typically have lower investment and growth, and why reducing inflation variability is as important as reducing inflation levels.",
          "example": "During the high-inflation 1970s, business investment declined in many advanced economies as uncertainty about future costs made long-term planning difficult, contributing to slower productivity growth.",
          "analogy": "Like trying to drive in heavy fog—you can still move forward, but you must go much slower and risk wrong turns because you can't see clearly ahead. Low inflation is like clear weather that allows confident, efficient travel.",

  "summary": "Inflation represents a sustained increase in the general price level, measured through indices like CPI and the GDP deflator. It is categorized into demand-pull inflation (from excess aggregate demand), cost-push inflation (from rising production costs), and built-in inflation (from expectations). Inflation erodes purchasing power, creates economic inefficiencies through menu costs and shoe leather costs, and causes arbitrary redistribution of wealth from creditors to debtors and from fixed-income groups to others. While moderate inflation is normal in growing economies, high or unpredictable inflation creates significant costs including reduced investment, distorted economic decisions, and social inequity. Understanding inflation's causes, measurement, and effects is crucial for economic policy, business planning, and protecting living standards against the erosion of money's value."
