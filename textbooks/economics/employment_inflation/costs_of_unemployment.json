The long-term costs are substantial: current unemployed workers will lose approximately $1.28 trillion in lifetime earnings, while their children may lose $2.4 trillion through intergenerational effects. Combined with the approximately $1.6 trillion annual output loss, the total economic burden exceeds $5 trillion in present value terms.

  "summary": "Unemployment imposes substantial costs across multiple dimensions including economic output losses, fiscal impacts on government budgets, psychological distress, social exclusion, health deterioration, and long-term scarring effects. Economically, unemployment creates permanent output losses through Okun's Law relationships and reduces both current earnings and lifetime earning potential. Psychologically, it causes depression, anxiety, and loss of identity. Socially, it strains families, increases substance abuse, and reduces community participation. These costs are distributed unevenly, with young workers, minorities, less-educated individuals, and residents of depressed regions bearing disproportionate burdens. The effects persist long after reemployment through earnings scarring, skill atrophy, and intergenerational impacts that perpetuate disadvantage. The comprehensive costs of unemployment demonstrate why it represents one of the most significant economic and social problems and why policies addressing both immediate unemployment and its long-term consequences are essential for individual wellbeing and societal health."
