  "expanded_description": "Few economic policies generate as much debate as the minimum wage. To its supporters, it's a essential tool for lifting workers out of poverty and ensuring that full-time work provides a decent standard of living. To its critics, it's a misguided intervention that prices low-skilled workers out of jobs and creates more harm than good. The minimum wage debate sits at the intersection of economic theory, empirical evidence, and values. It's a debate about how labor markets work, who bears the burden of low wages, and what role government should play in setting wages. Understanding both sides of this debate is essential for any student of economics.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The minimum wage is a government-mandated price floor in the labor market, setting the lowest legal wage employers can pay. Its economic effects depend critically on labor market structure. In competitive markets, a minimum wage above equilibrium reduces employment and creates unemployment. In monopsony markets, it can increase employment. The net effects on poverty, inequality, and worker welfare depend on these employment effects, who earns minimum wage, and how firms adjust through prices, profits, and productivity.",
    "explanation": "Think of the minimum wage as a price floor, like a minimum price for wheat. In a competitive market, if you set the price above what would naturally occur, you get a surplus - more wheat supplied than demanded. In labor markets, that surplus shows up as unemployment - more people want to work at the higher wage than there are jobs. But if employers have market power (monopsony), they may have been paying below the competitive wage, so a carefully set minimum wage can actually increase employment. The real world is complicated: some workers gain higher wages, some lose jobs, some firms raise prices, some reduce profits, and some invest in productivity. The minimum wage debate is about the size of these effects and whether the gains to workers who keep their jobs outweigh the losses to those who become unemployed.",

      "introduction": "Walk into any fast-food restaurant, and you'll see workers earning somewhere around $\\$10$ to $\\$15$ per hour. Should the government require that they earn more? That's the minimum wage question, and it's one of the most contentious issues in economics. Supporters say it's a matter of basic fairness - if you work full-time, you shouldn't be poor. Critics say it backfires, hurting the very workers it's supposed to help. In this section, we'll explore both sides, examine the evidence, and understand why economists themselves are divided on this issue.",
      
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "The minimum wage is a price floor in the labor market, setting the lowest hourly wage that employers can legally pay. In the United States, the federal minimum wage is currently $\\$7.25$ per hour, though many states and cities have higher minimums. The economic analysis of minimum wage involves understanding its effects on employment, hours, prices, profits, poverty, and inequality. These effects depend on the level of the minimum wage relative to market wages, the elasticity of labor demand and supply, the degree of monopsony power, and the characteristics of affected workers and firms.",
        "context": "The minimum wage has been debated since it was first introduced in the U.S. in 1938 as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Supporters argue that it protects vulnerable workers from exploitation, reduces poverty, and stimulates demand by putting money in the pockets of low-income workers who spend most of what they earn. Critics argue that it destroys jobs, particularly for teenagers and low-skilled workers, encourages automation, and is a blunt instrument that often benefits workers in higher-income households (like teenagers from middle-class families) rather than the working poor. The academic debate intensified in the 1990s when David Card and Alan Krueger published a study finding no job losses from a minimum wage increase in New Jersey fast-food restaurants, challenging the conventional wisdom. Since then, hundreds of studies have been conducted, with results ranging from significant job losses to small gains. The consensus today is that modest minimum wage increases have small and uncertain employment effects, but large increases may cause significant job losses."

If you believe monopsony power is widespread, you expect smaller losses or even gains. The truth likely lies somewhere in between, with effects varying across industries and regions.",
          "example": "A fast-food restaurant in a city with many competitors likely operates in a competitive labor market - a minimum wage increase would probably reduce employment there. A rural nursing home with few competitors might have monopsony power - a modest minimum wage increase might not reduce employment and could even increase it."

Fast food has relatively elastic labor demand (easy to substitute kiosks, elastic product demand), so minimum wage increases there may cause larger employment losses. Healthcare has more inelastic demand, so effects may be smaller.",
          "example": "A 10% minimum wage increase might reduce fast-food employment by 2-3% (elastic demand) but reduce nursing home employment by only 0-1% (inelastic demand). The same policy has different effects in different sectors."

  "summary": "The minimum wage is one of the most debated policies in economics. As a price floor in the labor market, its effects depend critically on market structure. In competitive labor markets, a minimum wage set above the equilibrium wage reduces employment and creates unemployment, as firms move up their labor demand curves. The magnitude of job losses depends on the elasticity of labor demand, which varies across industries based on factors like ease of substitution and product demand elasticity. In monopsony markets, however, a minimum wage set between the monopsony wage and the competitive wage can actually increase employment by offsetting employer market power. Empirical research on minimum wage effects has produced a range of estimates. The famous Card-Krueger study of New Jersey fast-food restaurants found no job losses, challenging the conventional wisdom. Subsequent meta-analyses suggest that modest minimum wage increases (10-20%) reduce employment of low-skilled workers by about 1-2% - a small but statistically significant effect. However, effects vary widely across studies, industries, and worker groups. Teenagers and restaurant workers appear most affected. Large minimum wage increases (like $\\$15$) may cause larger employment losses, especially in areas where the increase is far above prevailing wages. Beyond employment, firms respond through multiple channels: reducing hours, raising prices, cutting profits, and investing in automation. The minimum wage is also a blunt tool for poverty reduction because many minimum wage workers are not in poor households (teenagers, second earners) and some poor households have no workers. Alternative policies like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) more effectively target the working poor. The minimum wage debate ultimately involves both economic analysis and values - how much weight to give to the gains of workers who receive raises versus the losses of those who become unemployed, and what role government should play in setting wages."
