  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Monopsony occurs when a single buyer (employer) faces an upward-sloping labor supply curve, allowing them to set wages below workers' marginal revenue product. Unlike competitive markets where firms are wage takers, monopsonists recognize that hiring additional workers requires raising wages for all workers, creating a gap between wages and marginal revenue product.",
    "explanation": "In monopsonistic labor markets, employers have wage-setting power because workers have limited alternative employment options. This market structure leads to lower wages and employment than in competitive markets, as firms balance the marginal cost of hiring additional workers against their marginal revenue product. The degree of monopsony power depends on factors like employer concentration, worker mobility, and job search frictions.",

This occurs because the monopsonist was previously restricting employment to keep wages low—hiring until MRP_L = MFC > W. The minimum wage eliminates this incentive by making the marginal cost of labor constant at $12 up to the point where the supply curve becomes binding. Both wages and employment increase, demonstrating how minimum wages can have positive effects in monopsonistic labor markets, contrary to the competitive market prediction.",

Minimum wages can increase employment, antitrust enforcement becomes crucial for wage determination, and policies reducing worker mobility (like non-compete enforcement) become harmful rather than protective. This paradox requires rethinking conventional labor market policy based on the actual competitive structure of labor markets.",
          "application": "This principle explains why the same policy (like minimum wage increases) can have different effects in different labor markets, and why policy design should consider local labor market structure rather than applying one-size-fits-all approaches.",
          "example": "A $15 minimum wage might reduce employment in a competitive urban labor market with many small employers, while increasing employment in a rural company town where a single employer dominates hiring and has been suppressing wages below competitive levels.",
          "analogy": "Like medical treatments that have opposite effects on different conditions—a policy that is harmful in one context (competitive markets) may be beneficial in another (monopsonistic markets), requiring diagnosis before prescription.",

  "summary": "Monopsony power occurs when employers have wage-setting power in labor markets, typically due to limited competition for workers. This power arises from employer concentration, geographic isolation, occupational specificity, search frictions, and restrictive employer practices. Monopsonists hire fewer workers at lower wages than competitive employers because they face upward-sloping labor supply curves—hiring additional workers requires raising wages for all workers, making the marginal cost of labor exceed the wage rate. Empirical evidence shows significant monopsony power in many labor markets, with wages suppressed 10-20% below competitive levels in concentrated markets. Recognizing monopsony has profound policy implications: minimum wages may increase employment, antitrust enforcement should address labor market effects, and policies reducing worker mobility can harm competition. The modern understanding of monopsony emphasizes that pervasive frictions and imperfections, rather than single employers, create employer market power in contemporary labor markets."
