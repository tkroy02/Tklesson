  "expanded_description": "Throughout most of this unit, we've assumed competitive labor markets where many employers compete for workers. But what if there's only one employer in town? Or a few dominant employers? In such markets, employers have monopsony power - the ability to set wages below competitive levels. This is the mirror image of monopoly, but in the labor market rather than the product market. Monopsony helps explain why some workers earn less than their value to employers, why minimum wages might not reduce employment in some contexts, and why companies like Walmart or rural hospitals may have significant power over their workers.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Monopsony power exists when a firm faces an upward-sloping labor supply curve, meaning it must raise wages to attract more workers. Unlike a competitive firm that takes wages as given, a monopsonist can set wages below the value of workers' marginal product, earning monopsony profits. This results in both lower wages and lower employment than in competitive labor markets.",
    "explanation": "Imagine a company town - a factory in a remote area where it's the only major employer. If the factory wants to hire more workers, it can't just post a job at the going wage; it has to raise wages to attract workers from farther away or to induce current residents to give up other activities. This means the cost of hiring an additional worker includes not just that worker's wage, but also the higher wages you must pay to all existing workers. This makes the marginal cost of labor higher than the wage. A profit-maximizing monopsonist hires where marginal cost equals the value of marginal product, then sets the wage from the supply curve. The result: wages below the competitive level, and employment below the competitive level too. This is why monopsony is sometimes called the 'mirror image' of monopoly - both restrict output to keep prices (or wages) favorable.",

      "introduction": "Imagine you live in a small town with one major hospital. If you're a nurse, you can work there or commute an hour to the next town. The hospital knows this. They don't have to pay you as much as if there were ten hospitals competing for you. This is monopsony power - the power that comes from being the only buyer of labor in a market. In this section, we'll explore how monopsony works, why it matters, and how it changes our understanding of labor markets, minimum wages, and unions.",
      
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "Monopsony (from Greek: 'mono' = single, 'opsonia' = purchase) is a market structure with a single buyer of labor. More generally, monopsony power refers to any situation where employers face an upward-sloping labor supply curve, giving them some ability to set wages below competitive levels. A monopsonist maximizes profit by hiring labor up to the point where the marginal cost of labor equals the value of marginal product, then pays the wage on the supply curve corresponding to that employment level. This results in both lower wages and lower employment than in a competitive market.",
        "context": "Pure monopsony - a single employer in a labor market - is rare, but monopsony power is common. It exists whenever employers have some market power over workers due to: geographic concentration (rural areas, company towns), job specialization (workers with skills specific to a few firms), lack of mobility (family ties, moving costs), or collusion among employers. Examples include rural hospitals, nursing homes, school districts in small towns, and large retailers in isolated areas. Even Walmart, with its massive size, has been accused of exercising monopsony power in some local labor markets. Understanding monopsony is crucial because it challenges the competitive model's predictions about minimum wages (they might not reduce employment in monopsony) and unions (they can offset employer power). It also provides a framework for analyzing antitrust policy in labor markets."

So the marginal cost of labor ($MCL$) is greater than the wage. For a linear supply curve $W = a + bL$, total labor cost $= W \\times L = aL + bL^2$, so $MCL = a + 2bL$ - twice the slope of supply."

          "statement": "A profit-maximizing monopsonist hires where the marginal cost of labor equals the value of marginal product, then pays the wage on the supply curve at that employment level. This results in both lower wages and lower employment than in a competitive labor market.",
          "application": "This principle provides a benchmark for identifying monopsony power. If we observe wages significantly below what comparable workers earn elsewhere, and employment seems constrained, monopsony may be present. It also explains why some firms can be profitable despite paying low wages - they're capturing some of the value workers create.",
          "example": "A rural nursing home may be the only employer of nurses within 30 miles. It pays $\\$25$ per hour, while nurses in the nearest city earn $\\$35$. The nursing home hires fewer nurses than it would at the competitive wage, and those who are employed are paid less than their value to the home. This is classic monopsony."

        {
          "principle": "Monopsony Creates Inefficiency and Deadweight Loss",
          "statement": "By restricting employment below the competitive level, monopsony prevents mutually beneficial transactions from occurring. Workers who would work for wages between $W_m$ and $W_c$ are not employed, even though their value to the firm exceeds what they would accept. This lost surplus is deadweight loss.",
          "application": "This principle justifies policy interventions in monopsonistic labor markets. Minimum wages, unions, and antitrust enforcement can potentially increase efficiency by moving employment toward the competitive level. However, interventions must be carefully designed to avoid overshooting.",
          "example": "In the nursing home example, suppose there are qualified nurses willing to work for $\\$28$ per hour who are currently unemployed. Their value to the nursing home might be $\\$35$ per hour. These potential jobs don't exist because the home exercises monopsony power. This is deadweight loss - value that could be created but isn't."

          "principle": "Minimum Wages Can Increase Employment Under Monopsony",
          "statement": "In a monopsonistic labor market, a minimum wage set between the monopsony wage and the competitive wage will increase both wages and employment. This counterintuitive result occurs because the minimum wage overcomes the monopsonist's incentive to restrict hiring.",
          "application": "This principle has important implications for policy debates. It suggests that the employment effects of minimum wages depend on market structure. In markets with significant monopsony power, minimum wages may not cause job losses - and might even create jobs. This helps explain why empirical studies of minimum wages often find mixed results.",
          "example": "If the rural nursing home pays $\\$25$ and the competitive wage would be $\\$35$, a minimum wage of $\\$30$ would increase employment. The home would hire more nurses because the marginal cost of hiring is now $\\$30$ (constant) up to the point where the supply curve exceeds that wage, and they hire where $\\$30 = VMP$, which is at a higher employment level than before."

        {
          "principle": "Monopsony Power Is a Matter of Degree, Not Just Pure Monopsony",
          "statement": "Few labor markets are pure monopsonies, but many have some degree of monopsony power. Any factor that makes labor supply less than perfectly elastic to an individual firm gives that firm some wage-setting power. The extent of monopsony power can be measured by how much wages are below $VMP$.",
          "application": "This principle broadens the relevance of monopsony theory beyond textbook cases. Most firms have some monopsony power due to search frictions, mobility costs, and worker preferences. Understanding this helps explain why identical workers might earn different wages at different firms, and why wage dispersion persists even in seemingly competitive markets.",
          "example": "Even in a city with many restaurants, each restaurant has some monopsony power over its current workers because finding a new job takes time and effort. This is why wages can differ across similar restaurants and why workers don't instantly leave a slightly lower-paying job. Dynamic monopsony recognizes that all employers have some power."

So $VMP = 500 - 20L$ (since $L_D = 500 - 20W$, solving for $W$ gives $W = 25 - L/20$, so $VMP = 25 - L/20$? Let's be consistent: $L_D = 500 - 20W$ means $W = 25 - L/20$. So $VMP = 25 - L/20$ in wage units. Set $MCL = VMP$: $L/10 - 5 = 25 - L/20$ → Multiply by 20: $2L - 100 = 500 - L$ → $3L = 600$ → $L = 200$. Then wage from supply: $L_S = 100 + 20W$ → $200 = 100 + 20W$ → $100 = 20W$ → $W = 5$. So monopsony wage = $\\$5$, employment = 200."

  "summary": "Monopsony power exists when a firm faces an upward-sloping labor supply curve, giving it the ability to set wages below competitive levels. Unlike competitive firms that take wages as given, a monopsonist must raise wages to attract more workers, and the marginal cost of hiring an additional worker exceeds the wage because the higher wage must be paid to all existing workers. A profit-maximizing monopsonist hires where the marginal cost of labor equals the value of marginal product ($MCL = VMP$), then pays the wage on the supply curve at that employment level. This results in both lower wages ($W_m < W_c$) and lower employment ($L_m < L_c$) than in a competitive market, creating deadweight loss. Monopsony power arises from various sources: geographic concentration (company towns, rural areas), skill specificity (workers with specialized skills), lack of worker mobility, collusion among employers (no-poach agreements), and search frictions (dynamic monopsony). Pure monopsony is rare, but some degree of monopsony power is common in many labor markets. The monopsony model has important implications for policy. Unlike in competitive markets where minimum wages above equilibrium reduce employment, in monopsony markets a minimum wage set between the monopsony wage and the competitive wage can actually increase employment by forcing the monopsonist to hire more workers up to the point where the wage equals $VMP$. This helps explain why empirical studies of minimum wages sometimes find small or even positive employment effects. Unions can also play a countervailing role in monopsony markets, raising wages toward competitive levels without necessarily reducing employment. Understanding monopsony is essential for analyzing labor market power, evaluating minimum wage policies, and assessing antitrust enforcement in labor markets."
