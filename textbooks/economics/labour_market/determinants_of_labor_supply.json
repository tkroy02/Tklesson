  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Labor demand is determined by multiple factors beyond wages, primarily the demand for products labor produces, the productivity of labor, the prices of other inputs, and institutional factors. Changes in these determinants shift the entire labor demand curve, altering employment at every wage level.",
    "explanation": "While the wage rate determines movement along a given labor demand curve, other factors cause the curve itself to shift. The most important determinants include: (1) product demand, (2) technology and productivity, (3) prices of other inputs, (4) number of employers, and (5) government policies. Understanding these factors explains why employment patterns change over time and differ across industries.",

When labor becomes relatively more expensive (due to wage increases, taxes, or regulations), firms substitute toward other inputs like capital, energy, or materials. The ease of substitution depends on technology and determines how responsive employment is to cost changes.",
          "application": "This principle explains why employment is more sensitive to wage changes in some industries than others, and why policies that increase labor costs can have unintended consequences by encouraging automation and capital substitution.",
          "example": "When minimum wages increase in the fast-food industry, restaurants increasingly install self-service kiosks and automated cooking equipment, substituting capital for the now-more-expensive labor. In contrast, substitution is more difficult in personal care services like haircuts, where employment is less affected.",
          "analogy": "Like choosing between driving, flying, or taking a train—when one option becomes more expensive or difficult, people substitute toward alternatives, with the ease of substitution depending on the specific journey and available options.",

  "summary": "Labor demand is determined by multiple factors beyond wages. Product demand is the primary driver through the derived demand mechanism—firms only hire workers to produce goods and services consumers want. Technology affects labor demand through productivity enhancements (increasing demand) and substitution possibilities (potentially reducing demand), with modern technology often being skill-biased. Prices of other inputs influence labor demand through substitution effects (cheaper alternatives reduce demand) and scale effects (lower costs increase output and derived demand). Government policies like minimum wages, payroll taxes, and regulations affect labor demand by altering employment costs or productivity. Understanding these determinants explains employment patterns across industries, regions, and time periods, and helps predict how labor markets will respond to economic changes, technological progress, and policy interventions. The relative importance of each factor varies by industry, occupation, and time horizon."
