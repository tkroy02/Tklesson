This could increase labor force participation for mothers with young children from 60% to 80%, adding approximately 20,000 workers in a city with 100,000 such mothers.

  "summary": "Labor supply decisions are determined by a complex combination of demographic factors, economic incentives, and institutional contexts. Demographic characteristics create predictable lifecycle patterns with participation peaking in prime working years. Economic factors like wages, taxes, and non-labor income create financial incentives through substitution and income effects. Institutional arrangements and social norms establish the framework within which work decisions occur. Key determinants include: age and lifecycle stage, gender and family responsibilities, education levels, wage rates and expected earnings, wealth and non-labor income, tax and transfer policies, social norms about work, and institutional supports like childcare and flexible work arrangements. Understanding these determinants helps explain workforce participation patterns, predict how labor markets will evolve with demographic and social changes, and design effective policies to encourage work while supporting family and personal needs."
