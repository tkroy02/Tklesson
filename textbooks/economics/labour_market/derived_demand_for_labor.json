  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The demand for labor is a derived demand—it depends on the demand for the goods and services that labor produces. Firms hire workers up to the point where the marginal revenue product of labor equals the wage rate (MRP_L = W), ensuring that the revenue generated by the last worker hired equals their cost.",
    "explanation": "Unlike consumer demand for final goods, labor demand stems from firms' profit-maximizing decisions about production. The marginal revenue product of labor (MRP_L), calculated as marginal product of labor times marginal revenue, determines how much a worker is worth to the firm. As wages change, firms adjust employment along their MRP_L curve, which serves as their labor demand curve.",

The moderately inelastic demand suggests limited substitution possibilities and/or inelastic product demand. If demand were more elastic (-0.8), employment would fall to 800 workers; if more inelastic (-0.1), employment would only fall to 975 workers. This demonstrates why minimum wage effects vary across industries and why policies must consider the derived nature of labor demand.",

          "application": "This principle explains why worker-friendly policies often work best when combined with product market reforms, and why protecting workers in declining industries requires either retraining for growing sectors or ongoing subsidies that acknowledge the lack of underlying product demand.",

  "summary": "The demand for labor is derived from the demand for the products that labor helps produce. Firms hire workers up to the point where the marginal revenue product of labor equals the wage rate (MRP_L = W). The labor demand curve is the MRP_L curve, which slopes downward due to diminishing marginal returns. Labor demand elasticity—how responsive employment is to wage changes—depends on four factors: the elasticity of product demand, the ease of substituting other inputs for labor, labor's share of total costs, and the elasticity of supply of other inputs (Hicks-Marshall laws). Wage changes affect employment through both scale effects (output changes) and substitution effects (input mix changes). Understanding derived demand is crucial for analyzing labor market policies like minimum wages, payroll taxes, and immigration, as these policies' employment effects depend fundamentally on product market conditions and production technologies. Labor markets cannot be understood in isolation from the product markets they ultimately serve."
