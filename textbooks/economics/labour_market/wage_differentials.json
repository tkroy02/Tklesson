The explained portion reflects different career paths, work patterns, and occupational choices, often influenced by social norms and family responsibilities. The unexplained portion may reflect discrimination, promotion barriers, negotiation differences, or unmeasured factors. Addressing the gap requires both expanding opportunities in high-paying fields (reducing occupational segregation) and combating discrimination and bias in pay and advancement decisions. Family-friendly policies and pay transparency can also help narrow the gap.",

          "statement": "In competitive markets, discrimination can persist through multiple equilibrium mechanisms. Employer prejudice may be sustained by customer discrimination or by segregation that makes statistical discrimination self-fulfilling. Occupational crowding creates wage differentials that reflect historical exclusion rather than current productivity differences. These equilibria can be stable even without ongoing intentional discrimination, as past discrimination shapes current opportunities and expectations.",
          "application": "This principle explains why discrimination can persist even in competitive markets and why proactive policies (affirmative action, antidiscrimination enforcement, occupational integration programs) may be needed to shift from discriminatory to non-discriminatory equilibria.",
          "example": "If employers believe women are less committed to careers, they may offer them fewer opportunities, which then makes career investment less rewarding for women, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that sustains the initial statistical discrimination.",
          "analogy": "Like a road system where certain routes become established—once most traffic flows certain ways, it becomes rational for new drivers to follow those routes, perpetuating the pattern even if alternative routes might be better.

  "summary": "Wage differentials—systematic variations in pay across jobs and workers—arise from multiple sources. Human capital differences (education, experience, skills) explain substantial wage variations, with education typically yielding significant returns. Compensating differentials equalize job attractiveness by paying more for undesirable characteristics like risk or unpleasant conditions. Labor market segmentation divides workers into primary sectors (high wages, security) and secondary sectors (low wages, instability), with limited mobility between them. Institutional factors like unions, minimum wages, and internal labor markets create wage structures that depart from pure market determination. Discrimination, both statistical and preference-based, creates persistent wage gaps across demographic groups that cannot be fully explained by productivity differences. Understanding these multiple sources of wage variation helps explain observed earnings distributions, informs policies addressing wage inequality, and illuminates how labor markets allocate workers to jobs and determine their compensation."
