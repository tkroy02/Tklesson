    "principle": "The labor demand curve graphically represents the relationship between the wage rate and the quantity of labor demanded, derived directly from the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP_L) curve. It slopes downward because of diminishing marginal returns to labor, showing that firms hire more workers only at lower wage rates.",

At any given wage, the curve shows how many workers firms want to hire. The downward slope reflects diminishing marginal product of labor—as more workers are hired with fixed capital, each additional worker contributes less to revenue.",

This coordinated response makes total employment more responsive to wage changes than any single firm's employment. Additionally, product price adjustments in the market reinforce this elasticity when wages change industry-wide.",
          "application": "This principle explains why industry-wide wage increases (through unions or minimum wages) often have larger employment effects than wage increases at individual firms, and why labor demand appears more elastic at the market level than at the firm level.",

If all restaurants in a city raise wages simultaneously, the industry faces higher costs that may reduce overall restaurant demand, creating larger employment effects.",

  "summary": "The labor demand curve graphically represents the relationship between wage rates and the quantity of labor demanded, derived directly from the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP_L) curve. It slopes downward due to diminishing marginal returns to labor, showing that firms hire more workers only at lower wage rates. Movements along the curve occur when wages change, while shifts of the curve result from changes in product demand, technology, prices of other inputs, or the number of firms. Market labor demand is obtained by horizontally summing individual firms' demand curves, and this aggregation typically makes market demand more elastic than individual firm demands. Understanding the graphical representation of labor demand is essential for analyzing labor market equilibrium, predicting employment effects of wage changes, and evaluating labor market policies. The downward-sloping nature of labor demand reflects the fundamental economic principle that the value of additional workers declines as employment increases with fixed capital."
