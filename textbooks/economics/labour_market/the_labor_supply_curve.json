This reservation wage depends on the value of leisure, non-labor income, household responsibilities, and alternative uses of time. Changes in factors that affect reservation wages (wealth, family circumstances, social benefits) shift the labor supply curve by changing who is willing to work at any given market wage.",
          "application": "This principle explains why means-tested benefits can create work disincentives, why married women often have higher reservation wages than single women, and why policies that reduce work-related costs (childcare subsidies, transportation assistance) can increase labor supply by effectively lowering reservation wages.",
          "example": "A parent with young children may have a high reservation wage because they value time with children and face childcare costs. A childcare subsidy effectively lowers their reservation wage, making work more attractive and shifting their labor supply rightward.",
          "analogy": "Like a seller's minimum acceptable price—you won't sell your car below a certain price no matter what the market is doing. Similarly, workers won't work below their reservation wage regardless of labor market conditions.",

  "summary": "The labor supply curve represents the relationship between wage rates and the quantity of labor workers are willing to provide. Individual labor supply decisions involve utility maximization between consumption (enabled by work income) and leisure time. The curve typically slopes upward at lower wages where the substitution effect dominates (higher wages make work more attractive), but may bend backward at high wages where the income effect dominates (higher income reduces need to work). Market labor supply aggregates individual supplies and responds through both extensive (whether to work) and intensive (how many hours) margins. Labor supply shifts occur due to demographic changes, wealth accumulation, social norms, government policies, and immigration. Understanding labor supply helps explain employment patterns, wage differentials, and how labor markets respond to economic changes and policy interventions."
