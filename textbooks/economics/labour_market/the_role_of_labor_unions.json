    "principle": "Labor unions are organizations that represent workers in collective bargaining with employers, seeking to improve wages, benefits, and working conditions. Their economic impact includes creating wage premiums for members, potentially reducing employment in unionized sectors, affecting income distribution, and influencing workplace practices and productivity.",
    "explanation": "Unions operate as labor cartels that restrict labor supply and bargain for higher compensation. Their effects extend beyond direct members through threat effects (raising non-union wages), spillover effects (establishing industry standards), and political influence (affecting labor legislation). The net economic impact involves tradeoffs between higher compensation for some workers and potential efficiency losses or employment reductions.",

This suggests that while deindustrialization contributed significantly to union decline, the primary challenge has been maintaining union presence within growing sectors of the economy, particularly private services.

  "summary": "Labor unions represent workers in collective bargaining with employers, seeking to improve wages, benefits, and working conditions. They typically achieve wage premiums of 10-20% for their members while compressing wage distributions within unionized workplaces. Unions affect employment through standard demand responses to higher wages, though these effects may be moderated by productivity increases or employment protection. The economic impact of unions involves a fundamental tradeoff between their monopoly power (potentially causing efficiency losses) and their collective voice function (potentially improving workplace governance and productivity). Union membership has declined substantially in most developed countries due to structural economic changes, globalization, employer opposition, and legal frameworks. In response, unions and new worker organizations are developing alternative strategies for representing workers in changing economic conditions, including political action, community alliances, and new forms of organization for non-traditional workers."
