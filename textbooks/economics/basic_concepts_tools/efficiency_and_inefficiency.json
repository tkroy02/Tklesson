  "summary": "Economic efficiency encompasses three dimensions: productive efficiency (operating on the PPF with no wasted resources), allocative efficiency (producing the optimal mix of goods where MB=MC), and dynamic efficiency (optimal intertemporal allocation balancing current consumption with future growth). Productive efficiency requires technical optimization and full employment, allocative efficiency requires competitive markets without externalities or market power, and dynamic efficiency requires optimal investment in physical capital, human capital, and technology. Market failures create inefficiency—monopoly power restricts output, externalities distort private decisions, public goods are underprovided, and information problems cause misallocation. The welfare theorems establish that competitive markets achieve efficiency under ideal conditions, while real-world imperfections often require government intervention. Understanding these efficiency concepts provides the foundation for evaluating economic performance and designing policies to improve social welfare through better resource allocation."
