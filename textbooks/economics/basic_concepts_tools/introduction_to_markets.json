    "principle": "Markets are institutional arrangements that facilitate the exchange of goods, services, and resources between buyers and sellers, with different market structures characterized by the number of firms, product differentiation, barriers to entry, and degree of price-setting power, each producing distinct outcomes for efficiency, innovation, and consumer welfare",
    "explanation": "A market exists whenever buyers and sellers interact to determine prices and quantities of goods and services. The four primary market structures are: perfect competition (many firms, identical products, $P=MC$), monopoly (single firm, $P>MC$), monopolistic competition (many firms, differentiated products), and oligopoly (few firms, strategic interdependence). Market efficiency occurs when $P=MC$ and total surplus is maximized, while market failures arise when externalities, public goods, or information asymmetries prevent efficient outcomes.",

Perfect competition serves as the efficiency benchmark where $P=MC$ and total surplus is maximized, while monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly create various forms of market power and potential inefficiency. Markets perform essential functions including price discovery, resource allocation, information aggregation, and incentive provision. However, market failures—externalities, public goods, information problems, and market power—can prevent efficient outcomes, providing economic justification for government intervention through regulation, taxation, public provision, or antitrust policy. Understanding market structures and their limitations provides the foundation for analyzing economic organization and designing policies to improve social welfare."
