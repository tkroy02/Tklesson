Growth can be balanced (PPF shifts equally in all directions) or biased (PPF shifts more in one direction), with the pattern determined by which factors are growing fastest and where technological progress is concentrated.",

Growth springs from technological progress, capital accumulation, labor force growth, and institutional development, with different sources creating different growth patterns—balanced or biased, catch-up or frontier-led, sustainable or environmentally damaging. The Solow model highlights technology's crucial role in long-term growth, while new growth theory emphasizes human capital and knowledge accumulation. Successful growth strategies adapt to countries' specific conditions, balancing investment in physical capital, human capital, and institutions while integrating strategically with the global economy. Understanding growth dynamics helps explain why some countries develop rapidly while others stagnate, and how policies can accelerate PPF expansion to raise living standards while maintaining environmental and social sustainability."
