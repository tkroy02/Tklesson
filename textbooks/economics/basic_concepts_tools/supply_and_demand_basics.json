  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Supply and demand are the fundamental market forces that determine the price and quantity of goods and services in a competitive market, with demand representing consumer willingness and ability to purchase at various prices, and supply representing producer willingness and ability to sell at various prices, interacting to reach an equilibrium where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.",
    "explanation": "The law of demand states that, ceteris paribus, as price increases, quantity demanded decreases, resulting in a downward-sloping demand curve. The law of supply states that, ceteris paribus, as price increases, quantity supplied increases, resulting in an upward-sloping supply curve. Market equilibrium occurs at the price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, ensuring no shortage or surplus. Changes in factors other than price cause shifts in the curves, leading to new equilibrium points.",

  "summary": "Supply and demand are the fundamental forces that determine prices and quantities in markets. The law of demand describes the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, while the law of supply describes the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied. Market equilibrium occurs where these curves intersect, ensuring no shortage or surplus. Shifts in demand or supply due to changes in non-price factors lead to new equilibria, and the ceteris paribus assumption allows for isolated analysis of price effects. Understanding these basics is essential for analyzing market behavior and economic outcomes."
