  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The terms of trade (TOT) measure the rate at which a country can exchange its exports for imports, calculated as the ratio of export prices to import prices, with improvements in TOT indicating that a country receives more imports for each unit of exports, thereby enhancing its economic welfare",
    "explanation": "The terms of trade are typically measured as $TOT = \\frac{P_X}{P_M} \\times 100$, where $P_X$ is the price index of exports and $P_M$ is the price index of imports. An increase in TOT (e.g., from 100 to 110) means that export prices have risen relative to import prices, allowing the country to purchase more imports with the same quantity of exports. Conversely, a decrease in TOT reduces purchasing power and can lead to welfare losses. TOT is influenced by factors such as demand shifts, technological changes, and trade policies.",

Improvements in TOT enhance economic welfare by increasing purchasing power, while deteriorations reduce it.

The Prebisch-Singer hypothesis suggests long-term decline in TOT for primary commodity exporters, creating development challenges. TOT changes affect economic growth, income distribution, and trade balances, with policy responses including stabilization funds, exchange rate management, and export diversification. Understanding terms of trade is crucial for assessing trade benefits, managing economic volatility, and formulating effective development strategies."
