    "principle": "International trade allows countries to specialize in producing goods where they have comparative advantage (lower opportunity costs), then exchange these goods to consume beyond their domestic production possibilities, creating mutual gains through more efficient global resource allocation",
    "explanation": "The gains from trade arise from differences in opportunity costs between countries. When Country A has a lower opportunity cost of producing good X than Country B ($OC_X^A < OC_X^B$), Country A has comparative advantage in X and should specialize in X production, while Country B specializes in Y. Trading at an intermediate price ratio $\\frac{P_X}{P_Y}$ between the two opportunity costs allows both countries to consume outside their individual PPFs, increasing global efficiency and welfare.",

The gains from trade arise from more efficient global resource allocation, with benefits measured by the outward shift of the consumption possibilities frontier. While comparative advantage based on opportunity cost differences provides the fundamental rationale for trade, modern trade theories also emphasize economies of scale, product differentiation, and intra-industry trade. Trade policies like tariffs and quotas typically reduce welfare by creating deadweight losses, though they may benefit specific groups. Understanding both the theoretical benefits and real-world complexities of trade provides the foundation for evaluating trade policy and recognizing the mutual gains from international exchange."
