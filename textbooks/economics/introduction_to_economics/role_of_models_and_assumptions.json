    "principle": "Economic models are simplified representations of reality that use strategic assumptions to isolate key mechanisms and relationships, with their value determined not by realism of assumptions but by predictive accuracy, explanatory power, and insight generation",
    "explanation": "Models serve as 'laboratories' for economic thought experiments, allowing analysis of complex systems through controlled simplification. The modeling process involves $\\text{Reality} \\rightarrow \\text{Assumptions} \\rightarrow \\text{Model} \\rightarrow \\text{Predictions} \\rightarrow \\text{Testing}$, where good models balance tractability with relevance. As Milton Friedman argued, models should be judged by their predictions rather than their assumptions, though assumption transparency remains crucial for understanding model limitations and domain applicability.",

  "summary": "Economic models are essential tools for understanding complex economic systems, using strategic assumptions to create simplified representations that isolate key mechanisms and relationships. The modeling process involves deliberate tradeoffs between realism and tractability, with different model types (algebraic, geometric, computational) and structures (static, dynamic, stochastic) optimized for different purposes (explanation, prediction, policy evaluation). Good models are judged not by the realism of their assumptions but by their predictive accuracy, explanatory power, and insight generation, following Friedman's instrumentalist view while maintaining transparency about assumption limitations. The art of economic modeling lies in choosing assumptions that simplify reality without distorting the essential features relevant to the analysis, with sensitivity analysis testing how conclusions depend on specific assumptions. Models serve as laboratories for economic thought experiments, allowing systematic analysis of causal relationships and policy effects that would be impossible to discern in complex real-world economies. While all models are necessarily incomplete representations of reality, carefully constructed models provide invaluable frameworks for economic reasoning, policy analysis, and scientific progress in understanding economic phenomena."
