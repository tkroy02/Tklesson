  "expanded_description": "The fundamental economic problem addresses why economics exists as a field of study. Scarcity—the condition where limited resources cannot satisfy unlimited human wants—creates the need for choice, trade-offs, and resource allocation decisions at every level of society.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Scarcity forces individuals, businesses, and societies to make choices about how to allocate limited resources among unlimited wants and needs. Every choice involves a trade-off—selecting one option means giving up another.",
    "explanation": "Economics exists because we live in a world where resources are finite but human desires are infinite. This fundamental mismatch creates scarcity, which necessitates decision-making about what to produce, how to produce it, and who receives the output. Even wealthy nations face scarcity because no society has unlimited time, labor, natural resources, or capital. Understanding scarcity and choice is the foundation of economic thinking—it explains why we budget, prioritize, and constantly make decisions about resource use in our personal lives, businesses, and governments.",

  "summary": "The fundamental economic problem is scarcity—the condition where limited resources cannot satisfy unlimited human wants and needs. This creates the necessity for choice. Scarcity is universal and permanent, affecting individuals, businesses, and governments regardless of wealth or development level. Resources are scarce because they are finite (limited land, time, labor, capital) while wants are unlimited and continuously expanding. This mismatch forces all societies to make decisions about resource allocation, answering three fundamental questions: What to produce? How to produce it? For whom to produce? Every choice involves trade-offs—selecting one option means giving up another—and carries an opportunity cost. Scarcity cannot be eliminated because resources are physically finite, time cannot be created, and human wants perpetually expand even as some are satisfied. Wealth and technology can alleviate specific shortages but cannot eliminate the fundamental condition of scarcity. Understanding scarcity and choice is the foundation of economics, explaining why prioritization, competition, efficiency, specialization, and trade emerge in all economic systems. The study of economics exists precisely because scarcity makes choice necessary and choice requires a systematic way to analyze trade-offs and optimize resource use."
