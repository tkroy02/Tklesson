  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Scarcity forces choices and creates opportunity costs — the essence of economic reasoning.",
    "explanation": "Scarcity exists because human wants are effectively unlimited while resources (time, land, labor, capital, knowledge, environmental capacity) are limited. Economics studies how those limited resources are allocated across competing uses. Choices made by individuals, firms, and governments reflect trade-offs: selecting one option requires forgoing another, and the forgone option's value is the opportunity cost. Institutions (markets, property rights, policy) and incentives shape those choices, but they cannot eliminate scarcity. Instead, they organize how society prioritizes needs and wants.",

      "introduction": "At its core, economics asks: given limited resources, how should we allocate them to satisfy as many wants as possible? This problem — scarcity — underpins microeconomic decisions (individual consumption, firm production) and macroeconomic policy (budget allocation, public investment). Students should learn to identify scarce resources, measure opportunity costs, compare alternatives using explicit criteria, and recognize the institutional mechanisms that coordinate allocation (markets, planning, mixed approaches).",
