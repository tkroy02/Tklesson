  "section_title": "1.1 The Fundamental Economic Problem: Scarcity and Choice",
  "introduction": "Every society, regardless of wealth, technological advancement, or political structure, faces the same universal condition: resources are limited, but human wants are unlimited. This mismatch between finite resources and infinite desires creates the fundamental economic problem—scarcity. Economics emerges as the study of how individuals, firms, and governments make choices in the presence of scarcity. These choices require evaluating trade-offs, incurring opportunity costs, and determining the most efficient allocation of resources. The entire discipline of economics, from microeconomic decision theory to macroeconomic policy and global trade, rests upon this foundational reality.",
  "key_concept": {
    "definition": "Scarcity is the condition where the available resources are insufficient to satisfy all human wants. Because of scarcity, economic agents must make choices about the use of limited resources, and every choice incurs an opportunity cost—the value of the next best alternative forgone.",
    "context": "Scarcity is not simply a shortage; it is a perpetual and universal condition. Even the richest individuals, the most technologically advanced firms, and the most resource-abundant countries must make trade-offs. Time, labor, land, capital, environmental quality, and even attention are all limited. Therefore, society must develop mechanisms and institutions (markets, government programs, property rights, etc.) to manage scarcity and coordinate decision-making.",

  "summary": "Scarcity is the core economic constraint that forces individuals, firms, and governments to make choices. These choices involve trade-offs because selecting one option requires giving up another. The value of the alternative sacrificed is the opportunity cost. Scarcity manifests in many forms—time, resources, labor, capital, environmental quality—and affects every decision at every level of society. Economic systems exist to help answer the three basic allocation questions: what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce. Understanding scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost is essential for exploring production theory, market behavior, resource allocation, and public policy.",
