  "summary": "The fundamental economic problem of scarcity—the perpetual condition where unlimited human wants exceed the limited resources available to satisfy them—forms the foundation of all economic study. Scarcity makes choice unavoidable at individual, business, and societal levels. Every choice involves an opportunity cost, representing the value of the next best alternative forgone. Different economic systems—traditional, market, command, and mixed—represent various societal approaches to answering the three fundamental economic questions: What to produce? How to produce it? And for whom to produce it? Understanding scarcity and choice provides the essential framework for analyzing all economic behavior and decision-making, from personal finance to global trade policy. The concept of opportunity cost reminds us that the true price of any decision includes both visible costs and invisible sacrifices, encouraging more rational and comprehensive evaluation of alternatives in a world of inevitable trade-offs."
