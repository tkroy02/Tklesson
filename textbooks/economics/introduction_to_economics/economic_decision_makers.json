  "summary": "The three fundamental economic decision-makers—households, firms, and government—interact through markets and institutions to determine economic outcomes. Households maximize utility through consumption, labor supply, and saving decisions subject to budget constraints $P_xX + P_yY = I$. Firms maximize profits through production, pricing, and investment decisions subject to technological constraints $Q = f(K,L)$. Government maximizes social welfare through provision of public goods, correction of market failures, redistribution of income, and stabilization of economic fluctuations. Their interactions create the circular flow of economic activity: households supply factors to firms and receive income, which they spend on goods and services produced by firms, while government collects taxes and provides public services and regulation. Understanding these roles and their optimization problems provides the foundation for analyzing how economies function, how policies affect outcomes, and how resources are allocated across competing uses in a world of scarcity."
