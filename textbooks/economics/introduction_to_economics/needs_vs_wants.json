    "summary": "The distinction between needs and wants forms the fundamental architecture of economic decision-making in a world of scarcity. Needs represent the essential requirements for human survival, health, and basic social functioning—characterized by inelastic demand, universal recognition across cultures, and catastrophic consequences when unmet. Wants encompass the infinite landscape of human desires that enhance quality of life, provide pleasure, confer status, and enable self-expression—exhibiting elastic demand, social malleability, and the capacity for deferral or substitution without dire consequences. The boundary between needs and wants is dynamic and culturally contextual, evolving with economic development, technological change, and social norms. Understanding this distinction enables rational consumption choices, effective financial planning, conscious resistance to manipulative marketing, and insightful analysis of market behavior across economic contexts. Ultimately, mastering the needs-wants distinction provides essential tools for navigating the fundamental economic problem of scarcity, helping individuals and societies allocate limited resources in ways that maximize both survival security and genuine life satisfaction while avoiding the traps of perpetual dissatisfaction and status competition that characterize unlimited want pursuit."
