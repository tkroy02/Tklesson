    "principle": "Economic systems represent society's institutional solutions to the fundamental questions of what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce it, with systems varying along continua of property rights, market freedom, and government intervention",
    "explanation": "The three primary economic system models—market, command, and mixed—represent different institutional arrangements for addressing scarcity. Market economies rely on decentralized price signals and private property, command economies use centralized planning and state ownership, while mixed economies combine elements of both. The efficiency-equity tradeoff $\\text{Social Welfare} = f(\\text{Efficiency}, \\text{Equity})$ varies systematically across systems, with each generating distinct patterns of innovation, growth, and distribution.",

The historical experience demonstrates market superiority in information processing and innovation but also reveals necessary government roles in providing public goods, regulating externalities, maintaining competition, and ensuring social protection. The optimal economic system varies across contexts and evolves over time, with successful mixed economies pragmatically harnessing markets where they work well while using targeted intervention where markets fail seriously, all within robust institutional frameworks that protect property rights, maintain macroeconomic stability, and provide social safety nets. The ongoing challenge for all societies remains designing institutions that harness human creativity and coordination while mitigating the inherent limitations of both market and government mechanisms."
