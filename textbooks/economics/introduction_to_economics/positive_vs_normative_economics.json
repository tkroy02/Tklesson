  "expanded_description": "Economics can be approached from two distinct perspectives: positive economics, which describes and explains what is, and normative economics, which prescribes what ought to be. Understanding this distinction is crucial for separating factual analysis from value judgments and for recognizing when economic debates involve disagreements about facts versus disagreements about values.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Positive economics makes objective, testable statements about economic facts and relationships—describing how the economy works without making value judgments. Normative economics makes subjective statements about what should be—prescribing policies and outcomes based on value judgments about what is desirable or fair. Positive economics can be verified or refuted with evidence; normative economics involves opinions about goals and ethics that cannot be proven true or false.",
    "explanation": "The positive-normative distinction separates 'is' from 'ought,' facts from values, description from prescription. Positive economics answers questions like: What will happen if the minimum wage increases? How does inflation affect purchasing power? What causes unemployment? These are factual questions with empirical answers—we can test them with data and evidence. Normative economics answers questions like: Should the minimum wage be increased? Is current inflation too high? What unemployment rate should we accept? These involve value judgments about what's desirable—they depend on ethical principles, distributional preferences, and societal goals that vary among people. Understanding this distinction is essential because: Economic debates often conflate positive and normative issues, making resolution difficult. People may agree on positive facts but disagree on normative conclusions (both accept minimum wage reduces some employment but disagree whether it should be raised). Conversely, people may share normative goals but disagree on positive facts (both want to reduce poverty but disagree on which policies work). Good economic analysis clearly separates positive analysis (what the evidence shows) from normative recommendations (what we should do given our values). This doesn't mean normative economics is invalid—policy ultimately requires value judgments. But clearly identifying when we're stating facts versus expressing values improves clarity, honesty, and productive debate.",

It describes 'what is' or 'what will be' without claiming 'what should be.' Positive statements are in principle verifiable—we can check them against data.",
        "context": "Positive economics strives for scientific objectivity similar to natural sciences. Just as physics describes how gravity works without judging whether gravity is good, positive economics describes how markets work without judging whether outcomes are desirable. This doesn't mean positive economics is value-free in choosing what to study, but the analysis itself aims to be factual and testable."

          "example": "Positive statement: 'Raising minimum wage from \\$10 to \\$15 will reduce employment of low-skilled workers by 5%.' This is testable—we can study jurisdictions that raised minimum wage and measure employment changes. Evidence might support or refute the claim, but it's factual, not a value judgment."

          "example": "Positive statement: 'If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, inflation will decrease but unemployment will increase.'

          "example": "Economists debate: 'Does increasing government debt slow economic growth?' This is positive—in principle answerable with evidence.

  "summary": "Economics divides into positive economics (describing what is) and normative economics (prescribing what ought to be). Positive economics consists of objective, testable statements about economic reality—describing facts, explaining causes and effects, and predicting consequences. Positive statements can be verified or refuted with empirical evidence. Examples include: predictions about policy effects ('Minimum wage increase will reduce employment by X%'), empirical descriptions ('Unemployment rate is 4%'), comparative analysis ('Countries with higher taxes have larger government sectors'), and theoretical relationships ('Profit-maximizing firms produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost'). Positive economics aims for scientific objectivity, uses neutral language, focuses on mechanisms and trade-offs without judging them, relies on evidence, and makes conditional if-then predictions. It informs policy by providing factual foundation, testing theories, forecasting conditions, evaluating policy effectiveness, and clarifying trade-offs. However, positive economics alone cannot determine what policies should be pursued. Normative economics makes subjective value judgments about what should be, involving ethical principles, distributional preferences, and prescriptions about desirable policies and outcomes. Normative statements cannot be proven true or false—they reflect values that differ legitimately among people. Examples include: policy prescriptions ('Government should raise minimum wage'), distributional judgments ('Income inequality is too high'), outcome evaluations ('Unemployment is unacceptably high'), trade-off prioritizations ('Growth is more important than equality'), and ethical principles ('Everyone deserves healthcare'). Normative economics uses 'should/ought' language, makes value judgments about good/bad and fair/unfair, prescribes actions, and weighs competing values. People reach different normative conclusions due to different ethical frameworks (utilitarian vs. rights-based vs. egalitarian), distributional preferences (whose welfare matters most), time preferences (present vs. future), risk attitudes (precautionary vs. innovation principles), and views on government role. Normative economics is essential for: setting policy goals, weighing trade-offs, evaluating fairness, making recommendations, and expressing societal values. The positive-normative distinction matters because it: clarifies whether disagreements are about facts or values, focuses research on answerable questions, promotes intellectual honesty about value judgments, enables productive debates, and reveals appropriate limits of economic expertise (economists have expertise on positive questions but no special authority on normative ones). Conflating positive and normative creates problems: hidden value judgments presented as facts, false objectivity claims, unproductive debates arguing values as if they're facts, misleading public discourse, and politicization of factual questions. Good policy analysis clearly separates the two: positive analysis establishes facts about costs, benefits, and effects; normative analysis adds value judgments about whether outcomes are desirable and policies worth pursuing. Both are necessary—positive analysis without normative values cannot guide action, while normative recommendations without positive foundations lack effectiveness. Understanding this distinction improves economic reasoning, policy debates, and critical evaluation of economic claims."
