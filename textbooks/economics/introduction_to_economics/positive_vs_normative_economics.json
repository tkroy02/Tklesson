The integrated recommendation is to implement a carbon tax while using revenue to address distributional concerns.

  "summary": "The distinction between positive and normative economics represents a fundamental divide between the scientific study of what is and the philosophical discussion of what ought to be. Positive economics employs empirical methods, testable hypotheses, and logical reasoning to establish factual claims about economic behavior and outcomes ($H_0: \\beta = 0$). Normative economics incorporates value judgments, ethical frameworks, and normative criteria to make prescriptions about desirable policies and distributions ($SW = f(Equity, Efficiency)$). While logically distinct—following Hume's guillotine that values cannot be derived from facts alone—these dimensions are necessarily integrated in real-world policy analysis. Effective economic reasoning requires clear separation of positive predictions from normative evaluations, transparency about value premises, and respect for reasonable value disagreements. Professional economists maintain credibility by providing evidence-based analysis while acknowledging the value judgments involved in policy recommendations, focusing on areas where evidence can narrow policy disagreements and presenting tradeoffs clearly for democratic decision-making. Understanding this distinction is essential for both economic literacy and honest policy debate, allowing societies to make informed choices based on both factual evidence and explicit value frameworks."
