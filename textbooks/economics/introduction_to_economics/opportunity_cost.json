  "expanded_description": "A deep dive into the concept of opportunity cost — the single most important consideration in economic decision-making. This section moves beyond the textbook definition to equip students with the skill to identify, calculate, and apply opportunity cost in personal finance, business strategy, and public policy, transforming how they evaluate trade-offs and measure the true cost of any choice.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The true cost of any choice is the value of the next-best alternative that must be sacrificed.",
    "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the cornerstone of rational decision-making. It forces a comparison between the chosen option and its most valuable competitor, making trade-offs explicit. Unlike accounting costs, which are explicit and historical, opportunity costs are implicit and forward-looking, encompassing both monetary and non-monetary sacrifices (like time, enjoyment, or future opportunities). Properly accounting for opportunity cost prevents the 'sunk cost fallacy' and ensures resources are directed toward their highest-valued use.",
