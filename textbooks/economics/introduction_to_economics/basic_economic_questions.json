This section explores how different societies organize production and distribution, analyzing the mechanisms and consequences of various approaches to solving the eternal economic problem of allocating scarce resources among unlimited wants.",

    "principle": "All societies must determine what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce - these decisions define an economic system.",
    "explanation": "These three questions represent the practical application of scarcity at a societal level. The answers determine the allocation of resources, distribution of output, and ultimately shape the standard of living and economic equity within a society. Different economic systems (market, command, mixed) provide distinct institutional frameworks for answering these questions, with profound implications for efficiency, growth, and fairness.",
