          "final_answer": "During expansion, GDP grows 6.1% driven primarily by strong investment growth (contributing 2.16 percentage points) and solid consumption (2.6 points). During recession, growth slows to 0.63% as investment collapses (-2.7 point contribution), despite countercyclical support from faster government growth (0.68 points) and stronger net exports (2 points). Investment shows extreme volatility (27 percentage point swing), while consumption is relatively stable (3 point swing). Government spending and net exports act as automatic stabilizers, growing faster during downturns. This pattern suggests that smoothing the investment cycle through countercyclical policies could significantly reduce economic volatility.",

Understanding these volatility patterns helps predict business cycle behavior and design effective stabilization policies.",
          "application": "This principle explains why investment is both a key driver of economic expansions and a major contributor to recessions, why consumption provides economic stability, and how automatic stabilizers built into government spending and trade patterns help moderate economic fluctuations.",
          "example": "During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, business investment fell approximately 20% while consumption declined only 2%, demonstrating the extreme volatility of investment compared to the relative stability of consumption expenditure.",
          "analogy": "Like different instruments in an orchestra—investment is the percussion section (loud and dramatic), consumption is the string section (steady foundation), government is the conductor (providing stability and direction), and net exports are the wind instruments (responsive to external conditions).",

  "summary": "The expenditure approach calculates GDP as the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (C + I + G + [X-M]). Consumption, typically the largest component, includes durable goods, nondurable goods, and services, with services dominating in developed economies. Investment is the most volatile component and includes business fixed investment, residential construction, and inventory changes. Government spending covers purchases of goods and services but excludes transfer payments. Net exports represent the difference between exports and imports. The composition of expenditure reveals economic structure, with different patterns across development stages and business cycles. Proper measurement requires careful accounting to avoid double counting, distinguish final from intermediate goods, and apply consistent valuation methods. Expenditure patterns provide crucial insights into economic conditions, with investment volatility driving business cycles while consumption provides stability, and government spending and net exports often acting as automatic stabilizers. Understanding these patterns helps diagnose economic problems, forecast trends, and design effective economic policies."
