    "principle": "National income measures the total value of goods and services produced in an economy over a specific period, providing a comprehensive snapshot of economic performance. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) serves as the primary measure, calculated through expenditure, income, and production approaches that must yield identical results by accounting identity.",
    "explanation": "National income accounting provides the fundamental framework for assessing economic health, comparing economic performance across countries and time periods, and informing policy decisions. The circular flow model demonstrates why different measurement approaches must converge on the same total.",

Therefore, GDP growth does not necessarily indicate improvements in living standards or societal wellbeing.",

  "summary": "National income accounting provides the fundamental framework for measuring economic performance through Gross Domestic Product and related concepts. GDP can be measured through expenditure, income, and value-added approaches that must yield identical results due to the circular flow of economic activity. Beyond GDP, measures like GNP, NDP, NI, PI, and DPI track how total production translates into household income, revealing important aspects of economic structure and income distribution. While essential for economic analysis, policy formulation, and international comparisons, national income measures have significant limitations: they exclude non-market production, ignore income distribution, count defensive expenditures as positive contributions, and fail to capture environmental costs. Understanding both the power and limitations of national income accounting is crucial for appropriate interpretation of economic data and for developing complementary measures that better reflect true economic welfare and sustainable development."
