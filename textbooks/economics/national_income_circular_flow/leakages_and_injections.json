  "summary": "Leakages and injections provide the fundamental framework for understanding economic equilibrium and fluctuations. Leakages (saving, taxes, imports) withdraw spending from the circular flow, while injections (investment, government spending, exports) add spending. Equilibrium occurs when total injections equal total leakages, with imbalances creating economic expansion or contraction. The multiplier process amplifies initial spending changes, but multiple leakages reduce multiplier sizes in modern economies. Automatic stabilizers—progressive taxation, unemployment benefits, and income-sensitive consumption—automatically moderate economic fluctuations by making leakages responsive to income changes. This framework guides effective fiscal policy: during recessions, increasing injections or reducing leakages stimulates the economy; during expansions, the reverse prevents overheating. Long-term economic health requires structural balance between saving and investment, sustainable government budgets, and competitive trade positions. Understanding leakage-injection dynamics enables better economic forecasting, more effective policy design, and improved management of both short-term stabilization and long-term growth challenges."
