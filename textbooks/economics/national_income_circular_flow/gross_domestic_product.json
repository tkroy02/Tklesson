Scenario D: GDP grows 3% but welfare improvements depend on distribution, highlighting GDP's blindness to inequality.

  "summary": "Gross Domestic Product serves as the comprehensive measure of a nation's economic output, calculated through equivalent expenditure, income, and value-added approaches. The crucial distinction between nominal GDP (current prices) and real GDP (inflation-adjusted) separates actual output growth from mere price increases. GDP enables business cycle analysis, growth trend assessment, and international comparisons, particularly when adjusted for population (GDP per capita) and purchasing power differences. However, GDP has significant limitations: it excludes non-market production, ignores income distribution, counts defensive expenditures as positive contributions, and fails to capture environmental costs or product quality improvements. While indispensable for economic analysis and policy, GDP should be interpreted alongside complementary indicators that measure economic welfare, environmental sustainability, and social progress more comprehensively. Understanding both the power and limitations of GDP is essential for meaningful economic assessment and policy formulation."
