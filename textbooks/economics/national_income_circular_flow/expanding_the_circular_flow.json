  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The expanded circular flow model incorporates government and foreign sectors that introduce injections and withdrawals into the basic household-firm cycle. Government collects taxes (withdrawal) and provides spending and transfers (injection), while the foreign sector involves imports (withdrawal) and exports (injection), creating a more comprehensive view of modern mixed economies.",
    "explanation": "This expansion transforms the closed circular flow into an open system where economic activity is influenced by fiscal policy and global trade. The model demonstrates how government intervention and international exchange create additional channels for money flows while maintaining the fundamental identity that total injections must equal total withdrawals in equilibrium.",

The economy shows a cautious private sector saving more than investing, while government runs a modest deficit, and the country maintains a trade surplus. In circular flow terms, the private sector's net saving is channeled to finance both the government deficit and foreign borrowing (represented by the trade surplus). This represents a stable but potentially growth-constrained equilibrium, with the government providing modest stimulus to offset private sector caution.",

  "summary": "The expanded circular flow model incorporates government and foreign sectors, transforming the basic household-firm interaction into a comprehensive framework for analyzing modern mixed economies. Government introduces taxes (withdrawals) and spending/transfers (injections), while the foreign sector involves exports (injections) and imports (withdrawals). The model demonstrates how fiscal policy affects economic activity through different multiplier effects—government spending has larger impacts than tax changes due to direct injection into the circular flow. International trade introduces import leakage that reduces multiplier sizes in open economies. The complete framework reveals fundamental accounting identities, particularly that sectoral balances must sum to zero—private surplus plus government balance plus foreign balance equals zero. This expanded model provides essential insights for economic policy, showing how domestic fiscal measures, international trade patterns, and private sector behavior interact to determine economic outcomes in globally integrated economies."
