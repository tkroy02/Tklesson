This indicates efficient translation of economic resources into human wellbeing, with particularly strong performance in health (life expectancy 75 years) and education (15 years expected schooling).

  "summary": "A wide range of alternative macroeconomic measures complement GDP by addressing its limitations in measuring economic welfare, environmental sustainability, and broader aspects of societal progress. Welfare-based measures like the Genuine Progress Indicator and Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare adjust GDP for income distribution, non-market production, defensive expenditures, and environmental costs. Environmental measures including Green GDP and Ecological Footprint account for natural resource depletion and ecological constraints. Multidimensional indices like the Human Development Index and OECD Better Life Index combine economic, social, and environmental indicators to provide comprehensive assessments of development and wellbeing. These alternative measures reveal that GDP growth does not necessarily translate into improved welfare, particularly when it comes at the expense of environmental quality, income equality, or non-market aspects of wellbeing. While GDP remains valuable for measuring market economic activity, these complementary indicators provide crucial information for policymakers seeking to promote genuine, sustainable improvements in human welfare and quality of life."
