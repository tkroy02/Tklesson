This interdependence explains why economic problems rarely remain isolated and why coordinated policy responses are often necessary.",

  "summary": "The circular flow model provides a fundamental framework for understanding how market economies operate, showing the continuous flow of resources, goods, services, and money between households and firms. The basic two-sector model demonstrates that production generates income which enables consumption, completing the circular relationship. Expanded versions incorporate government, financial markets, and international trade, showing how taxes, saving, and imports represent withdrawals from the circular flow, while government spending, investment, and exports represent injections. The model explains key macroeconomic identities—particularly that total income equals total output equals total expenditure—and provides the foundation for national income accounting. It illustrates how economic shocks propagate through the economy and how policy interventions can influence economic activity through the multiplier process. The circular flow emphasizes the fundamental interdependence of all economic sectors and the importance of maintaining balance between injections and withdrawals for economic stability."
