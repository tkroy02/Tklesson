Scenario D: Changing benefit patterns are fully captured in compensation measures. Total measurement gaps amount to approximately $700 billion (3.2% of a $22 trillion GDP), mainly from underground activity and profit shifting. Statistical agencies use various methods to address these issues, but complete accuracy remains challenging, particularly for informal activity and international income shifting.",

  "summary": "The income approach calculates GDP by summing all factor payments generated in production—compensation to employees, corporate profits, proprietors' income, rental income, and net interest—to arrive at national income, then adding depreciation and net indirect business taxes to reconcile with market-price GDP. This approach reveals the functional distribution of income among labor, capital, land, and entrepreneurship, with labor typically receiving 55-65% of national income in developed economies. The necessary adjustments account for capital consumption (depreciation) and the difference between factor costs and market prices (net indirect taxes). While providing crucial insights into income distribution and production costs, the income approach faces measurement challenges including underground economy activity, international profit shifting, and the need to impute certain income types like owner-occupied housing services. Proper interpretation of income patterns helps diagnose economic trends, assess factor productivity changes, and understand distributional consequences of economic policies and structural transformations."
