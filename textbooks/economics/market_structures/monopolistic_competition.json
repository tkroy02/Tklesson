  "summary": "Monopolistic competition characterizes markets with many firms selling differentiated products, where each firm has some pricing power due to product differentiation but faces competitive pressure from close substitutes. In the short run, firms maximize profits where MR = MC and may earn economic profits. However, free entry ensures that in long-run equilibrium, economic profits are eliminated (P = ATC) through the entry of new firms, which reduces each existing firm's demand. The long-run equilibrium features excess capacity—firms produce at output levels below the minimum of their average cost curves—representing productive inefficiency that is the price paid for product variety. Firms engage extensively in non-price competition through advertising, product development, and branding to differentiate their products and reduce price elasticity. The Dorfman-Steiner condition provides the rule for optimal advertising expenditure. While monopolistic competition doesn't achieve either allocative efficiency (P > MC) or productive efficiency (excess capacity), the benefits of product variety and innovation may offset these efficiency losses, making it a common and often desirable market structure for consumer goods and services."
