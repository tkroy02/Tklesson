  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A monopoly exists when a single firm is the sole producer of a product with no close substitutes, protected by significant barriers to entry that prevent competition, allowing it to set prices above marginal cost and restrict output to maximize profits.",

They maximize profits by producing where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR = MC) and charging the highest price consumers will pay for that quantity, creating a deadweight loss to society through reduced output and higher prices compared to competitive markets.",

  "summary": "Monopoly represents a market structure where a single firm serves the entire market, protected by barriers to entry that prevent competition. Unlike competitive firms, monopolists face downward-sloping demand curves and set prices above marginal cost (P > MC) by restricting output to where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR = MC). This creates deadweight loss—reduced social welfare compared to competitive markets—through allocative inefficiency. Monopolists may engage in price discrimination, charging different prices to different consumers based on willingness to pay, which can increase profits and potentially reduce deadweight loss. Policy responses to monopoly include antitrust enforcement (breaking up monopolies), regulation (controlling prices), public ownership, or accepting temporary monopolies for innovation (patents). Natural monopolies—where single-firm production is most efficient due to scale economies—present particular regulatory challenges, often requiring price regulation to balance efficiency and equity concerns while ensuring service quality and adequate investment."
