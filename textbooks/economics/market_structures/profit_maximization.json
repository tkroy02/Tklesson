  "summary": "The MR = MC rule represents the universal condition for profit maximization across all market structures. While competitive firms equate P = MC and imperfect competitors equate MR = MC < P, both follow the same fundamental logic: expand output when additional revenue exceeds additional cost, and contract when additional cost exceeds additional revenue. This marginal analysis framework extends to input hiring decisions (MRP = MFC), multi-plant optimization (equal MC across plants), and multi-product firms (MR = MC for each product). The rule ensures that firms produce the quantity where the benefit of the last unit equals its cost, though market structure determines whether this achieves social efficiency (P = MC in competition) or creates deadweight loss (P > MC in imperfect competition)."
