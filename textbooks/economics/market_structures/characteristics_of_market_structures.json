    "principle": "Market structures are defined by key characteristics including the number of firms, degree of product differentiation, barriers to entry, and control over pricing, which collectively determine the nature of competition and efficiency outcomes in different markets.",
    "explanation": "The continuum of market structures ranges from perfect competition (many small firms, identical products) to monopoly (single firm, unique product), with monopolistic competition and oligopoly representing intermediate forms. Each structure creates different incentives for firms, leading to distinct patterns of pricing, output, innovation, and efficiency. Understanding these characteristics enables prediction of market behavior and evaluation of economic welfare implications.",

          "final_answer": "The restaurant market exhibits classic monopolistic competition: many small firms (25 restaurants), differentiated products (various cuisines and quality levels), relatively free entry (moderate barriers), and some pricing discretion. In long-run equilibrium, restaurants will earn zero economic profit, operate with some excess capacity, and continuously differentiate through menu innovation, ambiance, and service quality. The market will feature substantial product variety but not achieve productive efficiency due to the excess capacity inherent in monopolistic competition.",

Even monopolies or oligopolies may behave competitively if markets are contestable - when entry and exit are costless and potential competitors can rapidly enter if incumbents earn excess profits. This explains why some concentrated markets still achieve competitive outcomes.",
          "application": "This principle informs antitrust policy and market regulation, suggesting that promoting entry conditions may be more important than breaking up existing firms in some markets.",

  "summary": "Market structures are defined by four key characteristics: number and size of firms, degree of product differentiation, barriers to entry and exit, and control over pricing. Perfect competition represents the theoretical ideal with many small firms, homogeneous products, free entry, and no price control, achieving efficiency but potentially lacking innovation incentives. Monopoly features a single firm, unique products, insurmountable barriers, and significant pricing power, creating inefficiency but possible innovation funding. Monopolistic competition combines many firms with product differentiation, leading to zero economic profit long-run but product variety. Oligopoly involves few interdependent firms with strategic behavior and various competitive outcomes. Real markets typically exist along a continuum between these ideal types, with contestability and dynamic considerations influencing actual market performance beyond static structure characteristics."
