          "final_answer": "China's development strategy systematically targeted sectors with progressively higher income elasticity: from low-YED labor-intensive goods (0.8) to medium-YED electronics (1.5) to high-YED technology exports (2.2). This elasticity upgrading allowed China to capture growing shares of world income growth. Current challenges include: maturing global demand for traditional exports, intensifying technology competition eroding elasticity advantages, and the need to develop domestic demand with different elasticity patterns. The transition requires moving toward even higher elasticity sectors (services, innovation) while managing domestic demand composition to sustain growth.",

  "summary": "Advanced elasticity applications reveal how these concepts underpin complex economic systems and strategic decisions. Multi-sided platform economics uses differential elasticities across user groups to optimize ecosystem value. Macroeconomic policy effectiveness depends on aggregate demand and supply elasticities across business cycles. International trade and development strategies succeed through systematic movement toward higher income elasticity exports. These advanced applications demonstrate that elasticity analysis extends far beyond basic pricing to encompass market design, stabilization policy, development strategy, and digital ecosystem management. Understanding these complex elasticity interactions enables better business strategies, more effective policies, and deeper insights into how economic systems evolve and respond to interventions across different contexts and time horizons."
