  "summary": "Calculating and interpreting Price Elasticity of Demand involves precise mathematical methods and clear economic classification. The midpoint (arc) formula is preferred for discrete changes as it eliminates direction bias, while point elasticity provides precise measurement at specific prices. Interpretation follows clear thresholds: |PED| > 1 indicates elastic demand (revenue moves opposite to price), |PED| < 1 indicates inelastic demand (revenue moves with price), and |PED| = 1 indicates unit elastic demand (revenue unchanged). Theoretical extremes include perfectly inelastic demand (|PED| = 0, vertical curve) and perfectly elastic demand (|PED| = ∞, horizontal curve), which provide important boundaries for understanding real-world elasticity measurements that typically range from 0.3 to 3.0."
