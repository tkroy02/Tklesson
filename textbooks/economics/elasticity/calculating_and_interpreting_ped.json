  "expanded_description": "To move from a qualitative understanding of elasticity to quantitative analysis, we need robust calculation methods. This section introduces the formulas used to compute Price Elasticity of Demand, focusing on the superior midpoint (arc elasticity) method. It also covers how to correctly interpret the resulting coefficient, avoiding common pitfalls. Mastering calculation and interpretation is essential for applying elasticity to real data and making informed business and policy decisions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Price Elasticity of Demand is calculated as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in price. The choice of which price and quantity to use as the base for calculating percentages matters. The **midpoint formula** (or arc elasticity formula) solves this ambiguity by using the average of the initial and final values as the base. The formula is: PED = | [(Q₂ - Q₁) / ((Q₁ + Q₂)/2)] / [(P₂ - P₁) / ((P₁ + P₂)/2)] |. This yields a single, consistent elasticity value for the segment between two points, regardless of whether you consider the change from point 1 to point 2 or vice versa.",
    "explanation": "Why not use the simple percentage change formula (%Δ = (New - Old)/Old)? Because it gives different answers depending on direction. A price rise from \\$10 to \\$20 is a 100% increase using the old price (\\$10) as base, but a price fall from \\$20 to \\$10 is a 50% decrease using the old price (\\$20) as base. The midpoint formula uses the average as the base, providing symmetry: the elasticity from A to B equals the elasticity from B to A.<br><br>**Interpretation**: The calculated PED coefficient (e.g., 0.5, 2.0) tells us the *proportional responsiveness*. A PED of 2.0 means that for every 1% change in price, quantity demanded changes by 2% in the opposite direction. It is a *unit-free* measure of sensitivity.<br><br>**Point Elasticity**, calculated using calculus (PED = |(dQ/dP) × (P/Q)|), gives the elasticity at a specific point on the demand curve. It's crucial for non-linear demand curves.",
