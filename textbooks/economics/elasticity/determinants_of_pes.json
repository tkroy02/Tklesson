    "principle": "The price elasticity of supply is determined by producers' ability to reallocate resources, adjust production processes, and respond to price incentives, with flexibility increasing over longer time horizons and varying across different production technologies and resource constraints.",

          "final_answer": "Generic drugs have elastic supply (PES ≈ 1.5) due to competition, standardized production, and streamlined approvals. Patented pharmaceuticals have highly inelastic supply (PES ≈ 0.1) due to monopoly protection, complex manufacturing, and lengthy regulatory processes. This 15:1 elasticity difference reflects the policy trade-off between incentivizing innovation (through patent protection that creates inelastic supply) and ensuring accessibility (through generic competition that creates elastic supply). The regulatory system manages this transition from inelastic to elastic supply as drugs move from patent protection to generic competition.",

  "summary": "The price elasticity of supply is determined by multiple interconnected factors across different dimensions. Time horizons are fundamental - supply becomes more elastic over longer periods as producers overcome adjustment constraints. Production technology characteristics create inherent flexibility or rigidity, with human-controlled manufacturing generally more elastic than biologically-constrained processes. Resource mobility and availability determine input constraints, with specialized or location-specific resources creating inelastic supply. Economic factors like market structure and competition affect responsiveness, with competitive markets enabling more elastic supply through easy entry. Institutional factors including regulations, property rights, and market institutions either facilitate or hinder supply adjustments. These determinants interact to create the observed supply elasticities across different industries, explaining why some markets respond quickly to price signals while others exhibit rigid supply and price volatility. Understanding these factors helps businesses plan production capacity, governments design effective policies, and economists predict market responses to various shocks and interventions."
