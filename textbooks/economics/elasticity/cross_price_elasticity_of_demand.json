  "summary": "Cross price elasticity of demand measures how quantity demanded of one good responds to price changes in another good, revealing substitute relationships (XED > 0) and complement relationships (XED < 0). The magnitude indicates the strength of these relationships. Substitute goods compete in the same market, with high positive cross elasticity indicating intense competition and limited pricing power. Complement goods are consumed together, with strong negative cross elasticity enabling strategic pricing models like razors-and-blades. Cross elasticity is crucial for market definition in antitrust cases, competitive analysis, pricing strategy, and developing product ecosystems. Understanding these relationships helps businesses identify competitors, plan strategic responses to price changes, and optimize pricing across related product lines to maximize overall profitability."
