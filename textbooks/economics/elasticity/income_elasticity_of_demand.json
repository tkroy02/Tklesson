  "expanded_description": "Measuring how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good is to changes in consumer income, classifying goods as normal, inferior, or luxury based on their income elasticity, and understanding how consumption patterns evolve with economic growth.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Income elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded resulting from a one percent change in consumer income, revealing how consumption patterns shift as economic circumstances change and classifying goods based on their relationship to income.",
    "explanation": "Unlike price elasticity which measures movement along a demand curve, income elasticity measures shifts of the entire demand curve. The sign and magnitude of income elasticity classify goods into fundamental economic categories: normal goods (positive elasticity), inferior goods (negative elasticity), and luxury goods (elasticity greater than 1). This classification helps predict how demand for different products will evolve with economic growth or recession.",

  "summary": "Income elasticity of demand measures how quantity demanded responds to changes in consumer income, classifying goods into normal (YED > 0), inferior (YED < 0), and luxury (YED > 1) categories. Normal goods are further divided into necessities (0 < YED < 1) and luxuries (YED > 1). This classification has profound implications: luxury goods experience amplified business cycle effects, growing rapidly during expansions but declining sharply in recessions, while necessities provide stable demand. Inferior goods decrease in demand as incomes rise, creating predictable transition patterns during economic development. Understanding income elasticity helps businesses plan for economic cycles, forecast demand growth, and develop appropriate strategies for different product categories. It also helps policymakers anticipate structural changes in consumption and address the challenges of economic development."
