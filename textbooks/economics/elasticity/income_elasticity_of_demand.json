  "expanded_description": "Income Elasticity of Demand (YED) measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in consumer income. It indicates whether a good is a necessity or a luxury, and helps classify goods as normal or inferior. Understanding YED is essential for businesses planning for economic expansions or recessions, for policymakers assessing the impact of income changes on different sectors, and for analyzing long-term consumption trends as economies develop.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Income Elasticity of Demand (YED) is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in consumer income that caused it. The formula is: YED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income). Unlike Price Elasticity of Demand, YED can be positive or negative, and the sign provides crucial information about the type of good. <strong>Normal Goods (YED > 0)</strong>: Demand increases as income increases. <strong>Inferior Goods (YED < 0)</strong>: Demand decreases as income increases. Among normal goods, they are further classified as <strong>Necessities (0 < YED < 1)</strong> where demand is income-inelastic, and <strong>Luxuries (YED > 1)</strong> where demand is income-elastic.",
    "explanation": "The sign of YED tells the <strong>direction</strong> of the relationship between income and demand. The magnitude tells us the <strong>strength</strong> of that relationship.<br><br>For a <strong>normal good</strong>, a positive YED means consumption rises with income. Most goods are normal goods. For an <strong>inferior good</strong, a negative YED means consumption falls as income rises because consumers switch to higher-quality alternatives. Examples include generic brands, bus travel, or instant noodles.<br><br>The magnitude classification helps identify business cycle sensitivity: Luxuries (YED > 1) experience volatile demand—booming in expansions and collapsing in recessions. Necessities (0 < YED < 1) have stable demand regardless of the economic climate.<br><br>YED is typically calculated using the midpoint formula, similar to PED, to ensure consistency: YED = [(Q₂ - Q₁) / ((Q₁+Q₂)/2)] / [(I₂ - I₁) / ((I₁+I₂)/2)]."

If YED is positive and greater than 1, the good is a <strong>luxury</strong> (demand is highly responsive to income changes).",

          "example": "<strong>Fresh fruits and vegetables</strong>: YED is positive but likely less than 1 (a necessity).
