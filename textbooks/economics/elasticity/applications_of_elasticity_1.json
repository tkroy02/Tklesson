          "final_answer": "The EV market exhibits elastic demand (PED = -1.8), luxury good characteristics (YED = 2.5), and strong substitution with gasoline vehicles (XED = 1.2). This indicates: (1) price reductions will dramatically increase adoption, (2) economic growth will disproportionately benefit EV sales, and (3) EVs directly compete with traditional cars. The market is in early growth phase where cost reductions and income growth drive rapid expansion. As the market matures, these elasticities will decrease toward normal good levels. Businesses should prioritize cost reduction while policymakers should support infrastructure development during this elastic response period.",

  "summary": "Elasticity concepts have extensive real-world applications across business, policy, and consumer domains. Businesses use price elasticity for revenue optimization through dynamic pricing, market segmentation, and product strategy. Governments apply elasticity to design efficient tax systems, predict behavioral responses, and understand tax incidence. Consumer behavior analysis reveals how income elasticity drives consumption evolution with economic development, while cross elasticity defines market boundaries and competitive relationships. These applications demonstrate how elasticity provides quantitative insights into economic behavior, enabling better decision-making, more effective policies, and deeper understanding of market dynamics across diverse contexts from ride-sharing platforms to electric vehicle adoption to public health taxation."
