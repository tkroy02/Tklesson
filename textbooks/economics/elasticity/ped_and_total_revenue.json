  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue follows a predictable pattern: when demand is elastic, price and revenue move in opposite directions; when demand is inelastic, they move together; and when demand is unit elastic, revenue remains unchanged with price changes.",

The elasticity determines which effect dominates. This principle is fundamental for business pricing decisions, tax policy, and understanding market dynamics.",

  "summary": "The relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue is fundamental to business and economic analysis. When demand is elastic (|PED| > 1), price and revenue move in opposite directions - lower prices increase revenue, higher prices decrease revenue. When demand is inelastic (|PED| < 1), price and revenue move together - higher prices increase revenue, lower prices decrease revenue. Revenue is maximized at the unit elastic point (|PED| = 1). This relationship emerges from the balance between the price effect (revenue change from different price per unit) and quantity effect (revenue change from different quantity sold). These principles drive optimal pricing strategies, tax incidence analysis, cost pass-through decisions, and explain why businesses invest in creating inelastic demand through branding and differentiation."
