  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Price elasticity of demand quantifies the percentage change in quantity demanded resulting from a one percent change in price, revealing how consumers trade off price changes against their desire for a product and fundamentally determining how price changes affect a seller's total revenue.",
    "explanation": "Elasticity measures responsiveness, not just the direction of change. It is a unit-free measure calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. The value determines whether demand is elastic (responsive), inelastic (unresponsive), or unit elastic. This classification is crucial because it predicts whether a price increase will raise or lower total revenue, making it essential for business and policy decisions.",

          "statement": "The total revenue test is a method to estimate the price elasticity of demand by observing the change in total revenue that results from a price change. If total revenue moves in the opposite direction of the price change, demand is elastic. If it moves in the same direction, demand is inelastic. If it remains unchanged, demand is unit elastic.",
          "application": "Businesses can use this simple test without complex calculations. If a price hike leads to higher revenue, they are operating on the inelastic portion of their demand curve. If it leads to lower revenue, they are on the elastic portion.",
          "example": "A farmer selling wheat (a commodity with elastic demand) cannot raise revenue by withholding supply to increase price, as the resulting quantity drop would be larger than the price gain. A pharmaceutical company selling a patented drug (inelastic demand) can raise revenue by increasing its price.",
          "analogy": "Like pulling on a rubber band (demand) attached to a weight (revenue). If the band is stiff (inelastic), pulling (raising price) lifts the weight (revenue). If the band is stretchy (elastic), pulling just stretches the band and the weight doesn't rise.",

  "summary": "Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price, with the midpoint formula providing the most reliable measure for discrete changes. Demand is classified as elastic (|PED| > 1), inelastic (|PED| < 1), or unit elastic (|PED| = 1). The key determinants are the availability of close substitutes, whether the good is a necessity or luxury, the share of the consumer's budget, and the time horizon for adjustment. The most critical application of elasticity is predicting the effect of a price change on total revenue: if demand is elastic, price and revenue move oppositely; if inelastic, they move together. This makes elasticity a cornerstone of effective pricing strategy and economic analysis."
