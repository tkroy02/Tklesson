  "expanded_description": "Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its own price. It quantifies the sensitivity of consumers to price changes. While the Law of Demand tells us that quantity demanded moves in the opposite direction of price, PED tells us by how much—is the response large, small, or somewhere in between? Understanding PED is fundamental for predicting how changes in prices (due to taxes, cost changes, or monopolistic pricing) will affect sales volumes, consumer spending, and market outcomes.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in price that caused it. Since price and quantity demanded move in opposite directions (due to the Law of Demand), this ratio is inherently negative. However, economists typically take the absolute value (ignore the negative sign) for ease of discussion and comparison. The formula is: PED = |(% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Price)|. The resulting value categorizes demand: Elastic (PED > 1): Quantity is highly responsive to price. A 1% price cut leads to a >1% increase in Qd. Inelastic (PED < 1): Quantity is unresponsive to price. A 1% price cut leads to a <1% increase in Qd. Unit Elastic (PED = 1): Quantity responds proportionally. A 1% price cut leads to exactly a 1% increase in Qd.",
    "explanation": "Elasticity is a unit-free measure—it uses percentages, not absolute amounts. This allows comparison across different goods (e.g., cars vs. coffee) measured in different units. The focus is on the proportional (percentage) change.<br><br>Think of it as a measure of the 'flatness' or 'steepness' of the demand curve at a point, though slope and elasticity are related but distinct concepts. A flatter curve generally indicates more elastic demand, but not always, as slope depends on the units used.<br><br>Why does magnitude matter? If demand is elastic, a price increase will cause such a large drop in sales that total revenue (Price × Quantity) will fall. If demand is inelastic, a price increase will cause such a small drop in sales that total revenue will rise. This link between elasticity and revenue is a central application (covered in 4.4).<br><br>Examples: Insulin for a diabetic is a classic inelastic good—price changes have little effect on quantity demanded because it's essential. Restaurant meals are often elastic—if prices rise, people can easily cook at home or choose a different restaurant.",
