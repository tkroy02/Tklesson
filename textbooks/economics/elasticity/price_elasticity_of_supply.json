  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Price elasticity of supply measures the percentage change in quantity supplied resulting from a one percent change in price, revealing how quickly and easily producers can adjust production levels in response to market price signals.",

Unlike demand elasticity which always has a consistent relationship with revenue, supply elasticity interacts with demand elasticity to determine how price changes distribute between quantity and price adjustments in market equilibrium.",

  "summary": "Price elasticity of supply measures how responsive quantity supplied is to price changes, with elastic supply (PES > 1) indicating producers can easily increase output and inelastic supply (PES < 1) indicating production constraints. Key determinants include time horizons (supply becomes more elastic over longer periods), production flexibility, spare capacity, and resource mobility. Supply elasticity has crucial economic implications: it determines how markets adjust to shocks (elastic supply leads to quantity adjustments, inelastic supply leads to price adjustments), affects tax incidence (the more inelastic side bears more burden), influences price stability, and determines the effectiveness of economic policies. Understanding supply elasticity helps predict market behavior, design effective policies, and make informed business decisions about production planning and capacity investment."
