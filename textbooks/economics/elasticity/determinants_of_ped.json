    "principle": "The price elasticity of demand for a good is determined by underlying economic factors that affect consumers' ability and willingness to substitute away from the good when its price increases, with substitutability being the most important determinant.",

The same good can have different elasticities in different markets or time periods based on these determinants. Understanding these factors allows prediction of elasticity even without numerical calculation.",

          "final_answer": "Refrigerators have the most elastic demand (|PED| ~2.5) due to high budget share, durability (purchases can be postponed), and availability of substitutes (different brands, used appliances). Restaurant meals have moderately elastic demand (|PED| ~1.5) due to moderate budget share and good substitutes (home cooking). Table salt has the most inelastic demand (|PED| ~0.1) due to very low budget share and few substitutes for its specific use.",

  "summary": "The price elasticity of demand is determined by multiple interconnected factors. The availability of close substitutes is the most important determinant, with more substitutes creating more elastic demand. Necessities have inelastic demand while luxuries have elastic demand. The time horizon significantly affects elasticity, with demand becoming more elastic over longer periods as consumers can adjust their behavior and make capital investments. Budget share plays a crucial role, with higher-share goods having more elastic demand as consumers pay closer attention to prices. Additional factors include good durability (durable goods have more elastic demand), addictive properties (creating inelastic demand), and whether goods are used in combination with others. These determinants work together to shape consumer responsiveness to price changes across different markets and time periods."
