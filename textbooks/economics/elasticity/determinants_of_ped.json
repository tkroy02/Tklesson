  "expanded_description": "The Price Elasticity of Demand for a good is not a random number; it is systematically influenced by several economic factors. These determinants explain why insulin has inelastic demand while a specific brand of soda has elastic demand. Understanding what makes demand more or less elastic allows us to predict consumer behavior, design effective pricing strategies, and anticipate the market impact of taxes and subsidies.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The key determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand are: (1) Availability of Close Substitutes, (2) Necessity vs. Luxury, (3) Proportion of Income Spent on the Good, (4) Time Horizon, and (5) Definition of the Market (Broad vs. Narrow). Goods with many close substitutes, which are luxuries, constitute a large share of the budget, have longer time for adjustment, or are defined in narrow, specific terms tend to have more elastic demand. Goods with few substitutes, which are necessities, constitute a small share of the budget, allow little time for adjustment, or are defined in broad terms tend to have more inelastic demand.",
    "explanation": "These determinants work by affecting a consumer's ability and willingness to change their purchasing behavior when price changes. If it's easy to switch to an alternative (substitutes) or if the price change significantly impacts one's budget (income share), the response will be larger (elastic). If a good is essential for life or habitually consumed (necessity), or if the price change is too small to notice (tiny income share), the response will be smaller (inelastic).<br><br>The **time horizon** is particularly important: demand is almost always more **elastic in the long run** than in the short run. In the short run, consumers may be locked into current consumption patterns, contracts, or durable goods. Over time, they can find substitutes, change habits, or adjust their capital stock.<br><br>These factors often interact. For example, gasoline has few short-run substitutes for driving (inelastic short-run demand), but over the long run, people can buy more fuel-efficient cars, move closer to work, or use public transportation (more elastic long-run demand)."

This is because necessities are required for basic living, while luxuries are discretionary.<br>3. **Proportion of Income Spent on the Good**: Goods that take up a large share of a consumer's budget tend to have more elastic demand because a price change has a significant income effect.

Demand for 'fruit' is inelastic; demand for 'Washington Fuji apples' is elastic.<br><br>These determinants often **interact**. For example, the demand for gasoline is inelastic in the short run (necessity, few substitutes, fixed car stock) but becomes more elastic in the long run (people can buy efficient cars, move, use transit). Similarly, addictive goods like cigarettes show inelastic demand in the short run but more elastic demand in the long run as habits can change.<br><br>Understanding these determinants allows one to **predict elasticity qualitatively** without complex calculations, which is invaluable for businesses setting prices, governments designing tax policy, and analysts forecasting market reactions. For instance, a firm with a highly differentiated product (few substitutes) has more power to raise prices without losing many sales, while a firm selling a commodity must accept the market price because demand for its output is perfectly elastic."
