          "final_answer": "The proposed $400 billion fiscal tightening faces significant risks: (1) Overshooting danger is substantial since the package exceeds the $300 billion output gap, potentially creating a 3.3% negative output gap and causing an unnecessary recession; (2) While tightening helps debt sustainability nominally, a recession could partially offset this through reduced revenues and increased automatic stabilizer costs; (3) Implementation during an economic slowdown would be procyclical, exacerbating rather than moderating the cycle. After accounting for these risks, net fiscal improvement may be only $250 billion rather than the nominal $400 billion. Recommended improvements include: reducing the package to $250 billion to match the output gap, implementing gradually over 2-3 years, front-loading measures with the smallest negative multipliers, including automatic stabilizer triggers, and coordinating with monetary policy. Additionally, contingency plans should include pause clauses if the economy weakens significantly. This analysis demonstrates that while fiscal tightening can be necessary, its design must carefully balance fiscal objectives with economic stability considerations to avoid self-defeating outcomes.",

  "summary": "Contractionary fiscal policy involves deliberate decreases in government spending, increases in taxes, or both to cool overheating economies, control inflation, and stabilize public finances. This approach works primarily through demand-reduction channels, with effectiveness depending on fiscal multipliers that amplify initial tightening through successive rounds of reduced spending. The choice between spending cuts and tax increases involves trade-offs: spending cuts typically have higher negative multipliers but face implementation challenges, while tax increases deploy faster but may have smaller economic effects per revenue dollar. Contractionary policy is most effective during periods of significant economic overheating with demand-driven inflation, when asset bubbles are forming, or when fiscal imbalances threaten sustainability. However, fiscal contraction carries risks including excessive economic slowdown, increased unemployment, social disruption, political instability, implementation timing problems, and potential self-defeating effects through reduced growth and revenues. Successful tightening requires balancing short-term economic stability against long-term fiscal sustainability through careful design features such as appropriate pacing, growth-friendly measures, social protection elements, and coordination with other policies. While contractionary fiscal policy remains a crucial tool for macroeconomic management, its effectiveness depends critically on accurate economic diagnosis, appropriate policy design, and careful attention to implementation risks that can significantly affect outcomes."
