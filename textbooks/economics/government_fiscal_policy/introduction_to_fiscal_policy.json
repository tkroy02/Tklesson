After accounting for these constraints, the net stimulus effect may be only $\\$50$-$100$ billion rather than the nominal $\\$200$ billion. A modified approach is recommended: reduce the package to $\\$150$ billion, focus on quickly implementable measures like tax cuts and transfers, combine with a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to address debt concerns, and maintain flexibility to withdraw stimulus if the economy recovers rapidly.

  "summary": "Fiscal policy represents governments' use of spending, taxation, and borrowing to achieve macroeconomic objectives including economic stabilization, sustainable growth, and equitable distribution. The effectiveness of fiscal tools depends on multiple factors: the specific instruments used (spending generally has higher multipliers than taxes), economic conditions (multipliers are larger during recessions), policy design features, and how policies are financed. Countercyclical fiscal policy involves running deficits during downturns and surpluses during expansions, using both automatic stabilizers that operate without discretion and discretionary measures that require deliberate action. However, fiscal policy faces significant constraints including implementation lags, debt sustainability concerns, crowding out effects, political economy limitations, and theoretical challenges like Ricardian equivalence. Successful fiscal management requires navigating these constraints through careful policy design, institutional frameworks, medium-term planning, and coordination with monetary policy. While fiscal policy remains a crucial stabilization tool, its effectiveness depends on appropriate timing, instrument selection, and addressing implementation challenges that can significantly reduce real-world impact compared to theoretical potential."
