          "final_answer": "A comprehensive fiscal package addressing structural challenges involves significant trade-offs: The climate component uses carbon taxation (revenue neutral after recycling) and green public investment, achieving emissions targets while potentially stimulating green growth. The aging population component requires gradual pension reforms that spread adjustment costs across generations. The technology disruption component provides targeted support for affected workers. The combined package has a net fiscal cost of approximately $1.5\\%$ of GDP initially, manageable for countries with fiscal space but requiring financing or offsetting measures elsewhere. Distributionally, careful design can make the package progressive overall, though specific measures like carbon taxes are inherently regressive without compensation. Implementation faces substantial political economy challenges, including resistance to carbon pricing, retirement age increases, and new taxes, requiring broad consensus-building and phased introduction. This illustrates how modern fiscal policy must balance multiple objectives—economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, intergenerational equity, and social protection—within fiscal constraints.",

  "summary": "Contemporary fiscal policy debates reflect evolving understanding of fiscal effectiveness, changing economic constraints, and expanding policy objectives. The fiscal multiplier debate now emphasizes state-dependent effects, with much larger multipliers during severe recessions—especially with constrained monetary policy—than during normal times. Debt sustainability analysis has shifted focus from arbitrary debt thresholds to the interest-growth differential, with persistent $r < g$ making higher debt levels sustainable. Modern Monetary Theory challenges conventional debt constraints but remains controversial. Distributional concerns have moved to the forefront, with debates about optimal progressivity, wealth taxation, and universal basic income. Climate change and other structural challenges require integrated fiscal approaches that coordinate environmental, social, and economic objectives. These evolving debates reflect broader recognition that fiscal policy operates in complex, interconnected systems where context matters profoundly, one-size-fits-all prescriptions fail, and successful policy requires careful diagnosis, appropriate instrument selection, and strategic coordination across multiple objectives and time horizons."
