  "summary": "The electron volt (eV) is defined as the kinetic energy gained by an electron accelerated through a potential difference of one volt, equal to 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ joules. This unit provides a natural energy scale for atomic and subatomic processes where joules are impractically large. Key relationships include: E(eV) = qΔV/e for any charge, photon energy E(eV) = 1240/λ(nm), temperature equivalence 1 eV ≈ 11,604 K, and mass-energy E = mc² with electron mass 0.511 MeV and proton mass 938.3 MeV. Common multiples are meV (atomic vibrations), eV (atomic transitions), keV (X-rays), MeV (nuclear processes), GeV (particle masses), and TeV (collider energies). Applications span atomic physics (energy levels 1-100 eV), semiconductor devices (band gaps 0.1-3 eV), nuclear physics (binding energies ~8 MeV/nucleon), and particle physics (rest masses MeV-GeV scale). The electron volt serves as the fundamental energy currency across modern physics, enabling clear communication and calculation across diverse subfields from condensed matter to cosmology."
