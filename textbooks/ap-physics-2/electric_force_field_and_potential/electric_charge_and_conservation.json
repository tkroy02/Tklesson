          "statement": "Materials and charging methods exhibit specific electrical behaviors based on electron mobility: Conductors: Free electrons move throughout material; Charge distributes over surface; Reach electrostatic equilibrium quickly; Examples: metals, graphite, electrolytes. Insulators: Electrons bound to atoms/molecules; Charge remains where placed; No bulk charge movement; Examples: glass, rubber, plastic, dry wood. Semiconductors: Intermediate conductivity; Can be controlled (doping); Essential for electronics; Examples: silicon, germanium. Charging by Friction: Electron transfer between materials; Depends on electron affinity; Triboelectric series ordering; Always produces equal and opposite charges; Conservation maintained. Charging by Conduction: Direct contact between objects; Charge sharing; Objects reach same potential; Final charges proportional to capacitance; Both objects same charge sign. Charging by Induction: No physical contact required; Charge separation through influence; Grounding removes excess charge; Objects acquire opposite charges; Conservation maintained. Electrostatic Series: Materials ranked by tendency to gain/lose electrons; Higher materials lose electrons (become positive); Lower materials gain electrons (become negative); Useful for predicting friction charging. Grounding: Connection to Earth (infinite charge reservoir); Provides path for charge flow; Neutralizes excess charge; Safety feature in electrical systems. Practical Applications: Static electricity control; Electrostatic precipitators; Photocopiers; Lightning protection; Electronic device design; Material selection for specific uses.",

  "summary": "Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that exists in two types (positive and negative) and is quantized in integer multiples of the elementary charge e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C. The law of conservation of charge states that the total electric charge in an isolated system remains constant, applying universally to all physical processes from everyday charging to nuclear reactions. Materials are classified as conductors (free electron movement), insulators (bound electrons), or semiconductors (controlled conductivity) based on their ability to conduct charge. Objects can be charged through friction (electron transfer between materials), conduction (charge sharing through contact), or induction (charge separation through influence without contact), with all methods obeying charge conservation. Understanding these fundamental principles of electric charge provides the foundation for electrostatics, circuit theory, and modern electronic technology, with applications ranging from static electricity control to advanced semiconductor devices."
