  "summary": "Electric potential (voltage) is a scalar field defined as potential energy per unit charge (V = U/q) or as the negative line integral of the electric field (V_P = -∫_∞^P E·dl). For point charges, V = kQ/r with reference at infinity. The superposition principle allows simple scalar addition of potentials from multiple charges. The electric field relates to potential through the gradient: E = -∇V, with components E_x = -∂V/∂x, etc. Equipotential surfaces are surfaces of constant potential, always perpendicular to electric field lines. Conductors are equipotential volumes with constant potential throughout. Potential calculations for continuous distributions involve integration: V = ∫(k dq/r) over the charge distribution. Important results include: infinite line charge (logarithmic potential), ring charge (V = kQ/√(z²+R²) on axis), spherical shell (V = kQ/r outside, constant inside), and solid sphere (parabolic potential inside). Potential concepts provide powerful tools for analyzing electrical systems, often simplifying calculations compared to direct field methods."
