          "statement": "Work and potential concepts find diverse applications: Work-Energy Theorem: W_net = ΔK; For electric forces only: W_field = ΔK; Relates potential and kinetic energy. Energy Conservation: K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f (no non-conservative forces); Powerful for motion analysis; Can solve for speeds, distances. Charged Particle Acceleration: Charges accelerate in field direction; ΔK = qΔV; Electron volt: energy gained by e through 1 V. Capacitor Charging: Work to charge capacitor: W = ½QV = ½CV²; Energy stored in electric field; Not QV because voltage increases during charging. Battery Operation: EMF (ε) = work per charge; Battery does work on charges; Maintains potential difference; Chemical energy → electrical energy. Particle Accelerators: Use potential differences to accelerate particles; Large ΔV gives high energies; Electron volts measure particle energy. Circuit Applications: Power = IV = work/time; Energy transfer in circuits; Resistors dissipate energy as heat; Capacitors store energy. Efficiency Considerations: Useful work vs total energy; Losses to heat, radiation; Maximum efficiency for reversible processes; Practical devices have losses.",

  "summary": "The work done in moving charges through electric fields relates directly to potential differences through W_against = qΔV, where work against the field equals the charge times potential difference. The electric force is conservative, making work independent of path and dependent only on endpoints. Key relationships include: work by field W_field = q∫E·dl = -qΔV, work against field W_against = qΔV, and energy conservation K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f for isolated systems. Special cases include uniform fields (W = qEd cosθ), point charge fields (W = kqQ[1/r_f - 1/r_i]), and capacitor charging (W = ½CV² = ½QV). The electron volt (eV) represents the energy gained by an electron moving through 1 volt potential difference. Practical applications span particle accelerators, capacitor energy storage, battery systems, and various electrical devices where energy transformations between electrical and other forms occur. These principles provide the foundation for analyzing energy transfer and transformation in all electrostatic systems."
