  "summary": "Electric potential energy represents the work required to assemble charge configurations against electric forces, stored in the electric field and recoverable as other energy forms. Key formulas include: two point charges (U = kq₁q₂/r), multiple charges (U = ½∑∑kqᵢqⱼ/rᵢⱼ), continuous distributions (U = ½∫ρV dV), capacitors (U = ½CV² = ½Q²/C = ½QV), and field energy density (u = ½ε₀E²). The electric force is conservative, enabling energy conservation (K + U = constant) for analyzing charge dynamics. Important applications include stability analysis (minimum U for stable equilibrium), binding energy calculations (energy to disassemble systems), escape energy problems, and practical energy storage in capacitors. The reference point for zero potential energy is typically taken at infinite separation. Electric potential energy provides powerful tools for analyzing electrical systems without detailed force calculations, simplifying many practical problems in physics and engineering."
