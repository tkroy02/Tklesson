Force Direction: Like charges: repulsive force; Unlike charges: attractive force; Acts along line joining charges; Central force nature. Vector Form: F₁₂ = k(q₁q₂/r²)r̂₁₂; F₁₂ = force on q₁ due to q₂; r̂₁₂ = unit vector from q₂ to q₁; Includes direction information. Point Charge Assumption: Valid for point charges or spherically symmetric distributions; For non-spherical objects, integration required; Good approximation when r >> object size. Inverse-Square Nature: Force ∝ 1/r²; Same form as gravity; Fundamental property of 3D space; Field lines spread over spherical surface. Comparison with Gravity: Both inverse-square laws; Electrostatic: can be attractive or repulsive; Gravity: always attractive; Electrostatic much stronger for elementary particles. Historical Context: Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785); Torsion balance experiments; Confirmed inverse-square law; Foundation of electrostatics.

  "summary": "Coulomb's Law, F = k|q₁q₂|/r², quantitatively describes the electrostatic force between two point charges, with k = 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C². The force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between charges and directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes, with direction along the line joining the charges (repulsive for like charges, attractive for unlike charges). Electrostatic forces are vectors that obey the superposition principle, meaning the net force on a charge equals the vector sum of individual forces from all other charges. This vector nature requires component analysis for multi-charge systems and enables equilibrium calculations where net force equals zero. Compared to gravity, electrostatic forces are immensely stronger at atomic scales (∼10³⁶ times for protons) but often cancel in macroscopic objects due to electrical neutrality. Applications span from atomic physics (electron-nucleus interactions) to technology (electrostatic precipitators, photocopiers) and biological systems (membrane potentials), making Coulomb's Law fundamental to understanding electromagnetic phenomena across all scales of physics."
