          "statement": "Surface and volume charge distributions yield important electric field results: Infinite Plane Charge: E = σ/(2ε₀); Constant magnitude; Perpendicular to plane; Independent of distance; Same on both sides; Direction: away from positive charge. Spherical Shell: Outside (r > R): E = kQ/r² (like point charge); Inside (r < R): E = 0; Charge on surface only; Conducting sphere same result. Solid Sphere (Uniform): Outside (r > R): E = kQ/r²; Inside (r < R): E = kQr/R³ (linear with r); Total charge Q = (4/3)πR³ρ. Charged Disk (On Axis): E = (σ/(2ε₀))[1 - z/√(z² + R²)]; Approaches infinite plane for z << R; Approaches point charge for z >> R; Maximum at surface. Cylindrical Symmetry: Infinite cylindrical shell; Outside: E = 2kλ/r; Inside: E = 0 for conducting shell; Solid cylinder: different inside field. Method Comparison: Direct integration: always works but may be difficult; Gauss's Law: much easier for symmetric distributions; Choice depends on symmetry. Non-Uniform Distributions: ρ = ρ(r) for spherical symmetry; Must integrate: E = (1/(ε₀r²))∫₀ʳ ρ(r')4πr'² dr'; More complex but solvable. Practical Applications: Capacitor plates (finite but large); Planetary electric fields; Atomic nucleus fields; Plasma physics; Semiconductor devices.",

  "summary": "Electric field calculations from continuous charge distributions involve integrating contributions from infinitesimal charge elements using the relation dE = k dq/r². Charge distributions are characterized by density parameters: linear density λ for 1D distributions, surface density σ for 2D distributions, and volume density ρ for 3D distributions. Key results include: infinite line charge (E = 2kλ/r radially), infinite plane (E = σ/(2ε₀) constant), charged ring on axis (E = kQz/(z² + R²)^{3/2}), spherical shell (E = 0 inside, kQ/r² outside), and solid sphere (E = kQr/R³ inside, kQ/r² outside). Symmetry considerations are crucial for simplifying calculations, often reducing vector problems to scalar integrals. While direct integration always works, Gauss's Law provides easier solutions for highly symmetric distributions. These calculation methods form the foundation for analyzing electric fields in diverse physical systems from atomic scales to astrophysical objects."
