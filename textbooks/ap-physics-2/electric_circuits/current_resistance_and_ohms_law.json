  "summary": "Electric current (I) is defined as the rate of charge flow (I = ΔQ/Δt), measured in amperes, with conventional current direction defined as positive charge flow. Resistance (R) quantifies opposition to current flow, calculated as R = ρL/A where ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area. Ohm's Law states V = IR for ohmic materials, establishing a linear relationship between voltage and current. Key relationships include: current density J = I/A, drift velocity v_d = I/(nAe), power dissipation P = IV = I²R = V²/R, and temperature dependence ρ = ρ₀[1 + α(T - T₀)] for metals. Materials are classified as conductors (low ρ), semiconductors (intermediate ρ), and insulators (high ρ), with superconductors exhibiting zero resistance below critical temperature. Non-ohmic devices like diodes and transistors show nonlinear I-V characteristics. Circuit analysis uses series resistance (R_total = R₁ + R₂ + ...) and parallel resistance (1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ...) rules. These fundamental concepts form the basis for understanding and designing electrical circuits across applications from power distribution to electronic devices."
