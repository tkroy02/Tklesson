  "summary": "Capacitors store energy in their electric fields according to $E = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \\frac{1}{2}QV = \\frac{Q^2}{2C}$, with the energy proportional to the square of the voltage. The energy density in the electric field is $u_E = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2$ for vacuum, showing energy is distributed throughout the field volume. During RC circuit charging, only 50% of the energy supplied by the source is stored in the capacitor, with the other 50% dissipated in the resistor, regardless of the resistance value. In capacitor combinations, parallel configurations store energy equal to the sum of individual energies at the same voltage, while series configurations store energy based on the equivalent capacitance and total voltage. Practical applications range from camera flashes and defibrillators (high power pulses) to supercapacitors for energy backup and renewable energy storage. Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and batteries, offering high power density and long cycle life but lower energy density than batteries. Understanding capacitor energy storage is essential for designing efficient energy systems across electronics, power engineering, and renewable energy applications."
