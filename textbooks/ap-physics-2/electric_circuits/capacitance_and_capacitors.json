  "summary": "Capacitance is defined as $C = \\frac{Q}{V}$, measuring a device's ability to store charge and energy. Parallel plate capacitors follow $C = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 A}{d}$, with dielectric materials increasing capacitance by factor $\\kappa$ ($C = \\kappa C_0$). Energy stored is $E = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \\frac{1}{2}QV = \\frac{Q^2}{2C}$, showing quadratic dependence on voltage. Capacitors combine in series as $\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2} + \\cdots$ and in parallel as $C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + \\cdots$. Different capacitor types (ceramic, electrolytic, film, supercapacitors) serve various applications including energy storage (camera flashes, defibrillators), filtering (power supplies, audio circuits), timing (RC circuits), and coupling (amplifier stages). Capacitors enable high-power pulse delivery, frequency selection, DC blocking while passing AC, and temporary energy storage across countless electronic and electrical systems."
