  "summary": "Resistivity (ρ) is an intrinsic material property measured in Ω·m that quantifies how strongly a material opposes electric current, while resistance (R = ρL/A) depends on both material and geometry. Materials are classified as conductors (ρ < 10⁻⁵ Ω·m), semiconductors (10⁻⁵ < ρ < 10⁵ Ω·m), and insulators (ρ > 10⁵ Ω·m), with superconductors exhibiting zero resistivity below critical temperature. Temperature dependence varies: metals show increasing resistivity (ρ = ρ₀[1 + α(T - T₀)]), while semiconductors show decreasing resistivity. Electrical power represents energy conversion rate, calculated as P = IV = I²R = V²/R, measured in watts. Energy consumption is E = Pt, with practical unit kilowatt-hour (1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J). Key applications include power transmission using high voltage to minimize I²R losses, heating devices using high-resistivity materials, safety systems employing fuses and circuit breakers, and efficiency optimization through proper material selection and system design. These principles enable the design and analysis of efficient, safe electrical systems across residential, commercial, and industrial applications."
