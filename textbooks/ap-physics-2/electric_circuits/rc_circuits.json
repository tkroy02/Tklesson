  "summary": "RC circuits exhibit exponential charging and discharging behavior characterized by the time constant $\\tau = RC$. During charging, capacitor voltage follows $V_C(t) = V_0(1 - e^{-t/\\tau})$ while current follows $I(t) = \\frac{V_0}{R}e^{-t/\\tau}$. During discharging, capacitor voltage follows $V_C(t) = V_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$ with current $I(t) = -\\frac{V_0}{R}e^{-t/\\tau}$. The time constant represents the time to reach 63.2% of final value during charging or 36.8% of initial value during discharging. Practical completion occurs in about $5\\tau$ (99.3% charged). RC circuits find extensive applications including timing circuits (using predictable charging/discharging times), filters (low-pass: output across capacitor, high-pass: output across resistor, with cutoff frequency $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi RC}$), differentiators (small $\\tau$), and integrators (large $\\tau$). These circuits form the foundation for many timing, wave-shaping, and filtering functions in electronic systems."
