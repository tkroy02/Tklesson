  "summary": "Capacitors combine differently than resistors: series combinations use $\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2} + \\cdots$ resulting in reduced equivalent capacitance, with the same charge on all capacitors and voltage dividing inversely with capacitance ($V_i = \\frac{Q}{C_i}$). Parallel combinations use $C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + \\cdots$ resulting in increased equivalent capacitance, with the same voltage across all capacitors and charge dividing proportionally to capacitance ($Q_i = C_iV$). Complex networks containing both series and parallel combinations are analyzed using step-by-step simplification, identifying basic combinations and progressively reducing the circuit to a single equivalent capacitance. Practical considerations include voltage ratings (series combinations must share voltage safely), energy storage ($E = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$), and the use of capacitor banks to achieve specific capacitance values or voltage ratings not available with single capacitors. These principles enable the design and analysis of capacitor networks for energy storage, filtering, timing, and various other applications in electronic and electrical systems."
