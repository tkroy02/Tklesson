  "summary": "Kirchhoff's Loop Rule (Kirchhoff's Voltage Law) states that the algebraic sum of all potential differences around any closed loop in a circuit equals zero: ΣV = 0. This is fundamentally based on energy conservation - the net work done in moving a charge around any closed path is zero in a conservative field. Proper voltage sign conventions are crucial: voltage drops are negative when following the current direction through resistors, and voltage rises are positive when moving from the negative to positive terminal through sources. Mesh analysis provides a systematic method for applying the loop rule by defining mesh currents that automatically satisfy current conservation. For complex circuits, the loop rule combines with the junction rule and Ohm's Law to provide complete solutions. Advanced applications include handling dependent sources, using supermesh techniques for current sources, and verifying solutions through power balance calculations. The loop rule applies universally to all electrical circuits and is essential for analyzing voltage distribution, power transfer, and circuit behavior in both simple and complex networks across all areas of electrical engineering and electronics."
