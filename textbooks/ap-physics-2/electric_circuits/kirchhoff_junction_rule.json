  "summary": "Kirchhoff's Junction Rule (Kirchhoff's Current Law) states that the algebraic sum of all currents meeting at any circuit node equals zero: ΣI = 0. This is equivalent to stating that the sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving: ΣI_in = ΣI_out. The rule is fundamentally based on conservation of electric charge - charge cannot accumulate at any point in a circuit under steady-state conditions. For circuit analysis, proper current direction conventions must be established, and only (n-1) independent junction equations exist for a circuit with n nodes. The junction rule combines with Ohm's Law (V = IR) and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to provide complete solutions for complex circuits. Advanced applications include matrix methods for large systems, analysis of circuits with dependent sources, and verification using power balance calculations. The rule applies universally to all electrical circuits regardless of complexity or the types of elements present, making it one of the most fundamental and widely used principles in electrical engineering and circuit analysis."
