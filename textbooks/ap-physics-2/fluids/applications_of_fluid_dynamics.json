  "summary": "Applications of fluid dynamics span virtually all areas of modern science and engineering, demonstrating the universal relevance of fundamental fluid principles. Engineering applications include aerodynamic design with lift and drag calculations ($L = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 C_L A$, $D = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 C_D A$), hydraulic systems utilizing Pascal's principle for force amplification, and pipeline networks analyzed using Darcy-Weisbach equations. Environmental applications encompass atmospheric dynamics driven by pressure gradients, river hydraulics described by Manning's equation ($v = \\frac{1}{n}R^{2/3}S^{1/2}$), groundwater flow governed by Darcy's law, and pollutant transport modeled with advection-diffusion equations. Biological and medical applications include cardiovascular hemodynamics analyzed through Poiseuille's law ($Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4\\Delta P}{8\\mu L}$), respiratory airflow patterns, microcirculation dynamics, and medical device design for ventilation, dialysis, and drug delivery. Across all domains, successful application requires integrated analysis combining continuity, Bernoulli, and momentum principles with domain-specific considerations including practical constraints, safety factors, efficiency optimization, and biological compatibility. These diverse applications highlight how fundamental fluid dynamics principles provide the foundation for solving critical problems in transportation, energy, environment, medicine, and countless other fields that shape modern technology and quality of life."
