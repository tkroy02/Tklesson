  "summary": "Pascal's principle states that pressure applied to a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid, mathematically expressed as P₁ = P₂ or equivalently F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂. This fundamental principle enables hydraulic systems to provide mechanical advantage through area ratios, with MA = A₂/A₁ = F₂/F₁, allowing small input forces to generate large output forces. However, this force multiplication comes with a distance trade-off governed by work conservation: F₁d₁ = F₂d₂, meaning the input piston must move much farther than the output piston. Real hydraulic systems achieve 80-95% efficiency, with losses arising from fluid friction, mechanical friction, and leakage. Advanced applications include multi-stage systems where total mechanical advantage multiplies across stages, and diverse real-world implementations from automotive brakes to industrial presses, all relying on the elegant pressure transmission described by Pascal's principle to transform and transmit forces efficiently through confined fluid systems."
