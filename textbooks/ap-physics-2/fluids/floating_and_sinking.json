  "summary": "The fundamental conditions for floatation are determined by density comparison: objects float when $\\rho_{object} < \\rho_{fluid}$, sink when $\\rho_{object} > \\rho_{fluid}$, and achieve neutral buoyancy when densities are equal. For floating objects, the fraction submerged equals the density ratio $f = \\rho_{object}/\\rho_{fluid}$, with apparent weight given by $W_{app} = W - F_b$. Stability of floating objects depends on the relative positions of the center of buoyancy (centroid of displaced volume) and center of gravity, with positive metacentric height indicating stability. Complex systems involving hollow structures or composite materials are analyzed using effective density $\\rho_{eff} = m_{total}/V_{total}$, enabling engineering design of floating systems that combine dense materials with air spaces to achieve desired buoyancy characteristics. These principles enable the design of everything from massive ships carrying heavy cargoes to precision scientific instruments, all governed by the elegant density relationships that determine whether objects float or sink in fluids."
