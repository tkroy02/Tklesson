  "summary": "Bernoulli's equation $P + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\rho gh = \\text{constant}$ expresses conservation of energy per unit volume for ideal fluid flow along a streamline. This fundamental principle reveals the inverse relationship between pressure and velocity: as flow accelerates in constrictions, pressure decreases, and as flow decelerates in expansions, pressure increases. The equation combines static pressure $P$ (pressure energy), dynamic pressure $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$ (kinetic energy), and hydrostatic pressure $\\rho gh$ (potential energy). Key applications include the Venturi effect for flow measurement, aerodynamic lift generation through pressure differentials, atomizers utilizing low-pressure regions, and various engineering systems exploiting the pressure-velocity trade-off. While the ideal equation assumes inviscid, incompressible, steady flow along streamlines, real-world applications often require modifications to account for viscosity, turbulence, and energy losses. Through these diverse applications, Bernoulli's principle provides essential insights into energy transformations in fluid flow, enabling the design and analysis of numerous practical systems across engineering, transportation, and environmental domains."
