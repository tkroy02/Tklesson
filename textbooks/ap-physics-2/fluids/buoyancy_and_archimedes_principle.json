Derivation from Pressure: Consider submerged object; Pressure on bottom surface > pressure on top surface; Net upward force = $\\Delta P \\times A$; Integration over all surfaces yields $F_b = \\rho_{fluid}V_{object}g$ for fully submerged. Key Features: Buoyant force always acts upward through buoyancy center; Depends only on fluid density and displaced volume; Independent of object density, shape, or depth. Fully Submerged Objects: $V_{disp} = V_{object}$; $F_b = \\rho_{fluid}V_{object}g$ constant with depth. Partially Submerged Objects: $V_{disp} < V_{object}$; $F_b = \\rho_{fluid}V_{disp}g$ varies with submersion. Vector Nature: Single resultant upward force; Application point = center of buoyancy (centroid of displaced volume).

  "summary": "Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force on an object immersed in fluid equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, mathematically expressed as $F_b = \\rho_{fluid}V_{disp}g$. This fundamental principle determines whether objects float, sink, or achieve neutral buoyancy based on density relationships: objects float when $\\rho_{object} < \\rho_{fluid}$, sink when $\\rho_{object} > \\rho_{fluid}$, and achieve neutral buoyancy when densities are equal. For floating objects, the fraction submerged equals the density ratio $f = \\rho_{object}/\\rho_{fluid}$. Apparent weight in fluids is given by $W_{app} = W - F_b$, becoming zero for neutrally buoyant objects. Advanced applications include ship design (where displacement equals ship weight), submarine buoyancy control (using ballast tanks), density measurement with hydrometers, and various engineering systems that exploit buoyancy principles. The center of buoyancy (centroid of displaced volume) and its relationship to the center of gravity determines stability, with higher metacenter providing greater stability. These principles enable everything from massive aircraft carriers to precise scientific instruments, all governed by Archimedes' timeless insight into fluid displacement."
