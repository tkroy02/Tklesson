  "summary": "Advanced Bernoulli applications extend the fundamental principle to real-world engineering systems through several key developments. The modified Bernoulli equation $P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 + \\rho gh_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho gh_2 + \\rho gh_L$ accounts for energy losses through head loss terms $h_L$, including major losses from pipe friction ($h_{L,major} = f\\frac{L}{D}\\frac{v^2}{2g}$) and minor losses from fittings ($h_{L,minor} = K\\frac{v^2}{2g}$). For compressible flows, the extended Bernoulli equation $\\int \\frac{dP}{\\rho} + \\frac{1}{2}v^2 + gz = \\text{constant}$ incorporates density variations, with isentropic flow relations providing stagnation properties ($T_0, P_0, \\rho_0$) that account for kinetic energy conversion. Engineering applications combine Bernoulli's principle with continuity, momentum, and energy equations to analyze complex systems including pipe networks, pump-pipeline systems, aerodynamic designs, and HVAC systems. Practical design incorporates safety factors, material limitations, maintenance requirements, and optimization considerations. These advanced applications demonstrate how the fundamental energy conservation principle of Bernoulli's equation provides the foundation for solving complex, real-world fluid flow problems across numerous engineering disciplines while acknowledging the limitations and corrections needed for accurate practical implementation."
