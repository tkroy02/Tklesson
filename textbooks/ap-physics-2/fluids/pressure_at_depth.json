  "summary": "Hydrostatic pressure in fluids follows the fundamental relationship P = P₀ + ρgh, where pressure increases linearly with depth due to the weight of the fluid column above. This principle enables pressure measurement through manometers, which utilize fluid height differences to determine pressure variations, and barometers, which measure absolute atmospheric pressure. Pascal's principle states that pressure applied to a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid, forming the basis for hydraulic systems that provide mechanical advantage through the relationship F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂. These systems enable force multiplication while conserving energy through the work relationship F₁d₁ = F₂d₂. Together, these principles of pressure at depth and pressure transmission provide the foundation for understanding fluid behavior in numerous engineering applications, from hydraulic brakes and lifts to underwater structures and pressure measurement devices, all governed by the fundamental interplay between depth, density, and pressure in static fluids."
