Pressure at Same Depth: In connected fluid, pressure equal at same height; Explains communicating vessels. Pascal's Principle: Pressure applied to confined fluid transmitted equally throughout fluid; $P_1 = P_2$; $\\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \\frac{F_2}{A_2}$. Hydraulic Systems: Mechanical advantage: $MA = \\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$; Small force on small area creates large force on large area; Conservation of work: $F_1d_1 = F_2d_2$. Applications: Hydraulic lifts and brakes; Dam design; Blood pressure variation with height; Submarine pressure hulls; Water towers. Problem Solving: Use $P = P_0 + \\rho gh$ for depth problems; Apply Pascal's principle for confined fluids; Use hydraulic equations for mechanical advantage; Consider density variations.",

  "summary": "Density, defined as mass per unit volume ($ρ = m/V$), serves as an intensive material property that characterizes substances regardless of sample size, while pressure, defined as force per unit area ($P = F/A$), quantifies how forces are distributed over surfaces. In fluid statics, hydrostatic pressure increases linearly with depth according to $P = P_0 + ρgh$, where the pressure depends only on depth and fluid density, not on container shape. Pascal's principle states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid, enabling hydraulic systems that provide mechanical advantage through area differences ($F_1/A_1 = F_2/A_2$). The distinction between absolute pressure (total pressure relative to vacuum) and gauge pressure (difference from atmospheric pressure) is crucial for proper measurement and application. These fundamental concepts of density and pressure provide the foundation for understanding fluid behavior in diverse applications ranging from hydraulic machinery to atmospheric science, with density determining buoyancy effects and pressure governing force transmission in fluid systems."
