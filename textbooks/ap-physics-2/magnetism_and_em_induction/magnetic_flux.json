  "summary": "Magnetic flux $\\Phi_B = \\int \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$ measures the total magnetic field passing through a surface, calculated as the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field. For uniform fields and flat surfaces, this simplifies to $\\Phi_B = BA\\cos\\theta$. The weber (Wb) is the SI unit of magnetic flux (1 Wb = 1 T·m²). Gauss's Law for magnetism states that the net flux through any closed surface is zero ($\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = 0$), reflecting the absence of magnetic monopoles. Faraday's Law ($\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}$) establishes that changing magnetic flux induces electromotive force, forming the basis for generators, transformers, and numerous electromagnetic devices. Magnetic circuit analysis uses flux continuity and reluctance concepts analogous to electrical circuits. These flux principles are fundamental to understanding and designing electromagnetic systems across power generation, transportation, medicine, and information technology."
