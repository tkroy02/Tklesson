  "summary": "The magnetic force on a moving charge follows the Lorentz force law $\\vec{F}_B = q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$, producing a force perpendicular to both velocity and magnetic field vectors. The force magnitude is $F_B = |q|vB\\sin\\theta$, maximum when velocity is perpendicular to the field and zero when parallel. Charged particles in uniform magnetic fields exhibit characteristic motions: circular paths when $\\vec{v} \\perp \\vec{B}$ with radius $r = \\frac{mv}{|q|B}$ and cyclotron frequency $f = \\frac{|q|B}{2\\pi m}$, helical paths when velocity has both perpendicular and parallel components, and straight-line motion when $\\vec{v} \\parallel \\vec{B}$. Practical applications include velocity selectors (using crossed E and B fields where $v = E/B$), mass spectrometers (separating particles by mass-to-charge ratio), cyclotrons (particle accelerators using constant magnetic fields), and Hall effect devices (measuring charge carrier properties). The magnetic force does no work, changing only the direction of motion while conserving kinetic energy."
