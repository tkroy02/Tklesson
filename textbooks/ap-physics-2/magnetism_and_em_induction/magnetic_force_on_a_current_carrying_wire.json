  "summary": "Current-carrying wires experience magnetic forces given by $\\vec{F} = I\\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B}$ for straight segments, with magnitude $F = ILB\\sin\\theta$ and direction determined by the right-hand rule. For arbitrary paths, the force is calculated using $d\\vec{F} = I d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{B}$ and integration. Closed current loops in uniform magnetic fields experience zero net force but develop torque $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{\\mu} \\times \\vec{B}$, where the magnetic moment is $\\vec{\\mu} = NI\\vec{A}$. Parallel current-carrying wires exert forces on each other given by $F/L = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\\pi d}$, with like currents attracting and unlike currents repelling. These principles enable numerous applications including electric motors (using torque on current loops), loudspeakers (using force on voice coils), galvanometers (using torque for measurement), and the definition of the ampere based on forces between parallel currents. Magnetic forces do no work, serving only to transfer energy between different forms or redirect motion."
