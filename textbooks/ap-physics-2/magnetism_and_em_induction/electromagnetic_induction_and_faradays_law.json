Electric Generators: Rotating coil in magnetic field; $\\mathcal{E} = NBA\\omega\\sin(\\omega t)$; AC generators: slip rings; DC generators: commutator; Power = $\\mathcal{E}I$. Transformers: Two coils sharing magnetic flux; Ideal transformer: $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{N_1}{N_2}$, $V_1I_1 = V_2I_2$; Step-up: $N_2 > N_1$; Step-down: $N_2 < N_1$; Requires AC. Induction Heating: Time-varying magnetic field induces eddy currents; Joule heating: $P = I^2R$; Used in cooking, metal processing. Eddy Currents: Circulating induced currents in conductors; Cause heating and magnetic damping; Lenz's Law: oppose motion; Applications: brakes, damping. Self-Induction: Changing current in circuit induces EMF in same circuit; $\\mathcal{E} = -L\\frac{dI}{dt}$; L = self-inductance. Mutual Induction: Changing current in one circuit induces EMF in nearby circuit; $\\mathcal{E}_2 = -M\\frac{dI_1}{dt}$; M = mutual inductance.",

  "summary": "Electromagnetic induction, governed by Faraday's Law $\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}$, describes how changing magnetic flux induces electromotive force in circuits. Lenz's Law determines the direction of induced currents, always opposing the flux change that created them, ensuring energy conservation. Magnetic flux $\\Phi_B = \\int \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$ can change through variations in field strength, loop area, or orientation. Motional EMF $\\mathcal{E} = B l v$ occurs when conductors move through magnetic fields. Key applications include electric generators (converting mechanical to electrical energy), transformers (changing AC voltage levels), induction heating (using eddy currents), and electromagnetic braking (opposing motion through induced currents). These principles form the foundation of electrical power generation, distribution, and numerous electromagnetic devices that are essential to modern technology."
