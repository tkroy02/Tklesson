  "summary": "Electric generators convert mechanical energy to electrical energy using electromagnetic induction ($\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}$), with AC generators producing sinusoidal output and DC generators using commutators for rectification. Electric motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy using magnetic forces on current-carrying conductors ($\\vec{F} = I\\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B}$), with back EMF ($\\mathcal{E} = k\\omega$) developing during operation. Transformers transfer electrical energy between circuits through mutual induction while changing voltage levels ($\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{N_1}{N_2}$), enabling efficient AC power transmission. These electromagnetic devices form the foundation of modern electrical power systems, with generators at power plants, transformers for voltage transformation in transmission and distribution, and motors as the primary consumers of electrical energy in industrial, commercial, and residential applications. Efficiency optimization, proper design, and appropriate selection of these devices are crucial for sustainable and reliable electrical energy systems."
