  "summary": "Magnetic fields are produced by magnetic dipoles with inseparable north and south poles. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract, following an inverse square force relationship. Magnetic fields are represented by field lines that emerge from north poles and enter south poles, forming continuous closed loops. Field line density indicates field strength, measured in teslas (T). Earth behaves as a giant magnetic dipole with its south magnetic pole near geographic north, enabling compass navigation. Materials are classified as ferromagnetic (strong attraction, permanent magnets like iron), paramagnetic (weak attraction, temporary like aluminum), or diamagnetic (weak repulsion like copper). Magnetic phenomena find applications in navigation, data storage, medical imaging, and numerous electrical devices. Unlike electric charges, magnetic poles cannot be isolated, and magnetic fields do no work on moving charges, representing fundamental differences between electric and magnetic phenomena."
