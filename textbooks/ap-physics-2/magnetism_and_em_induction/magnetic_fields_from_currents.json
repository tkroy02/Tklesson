  "summary": "Magnetic fields are generated by electric currents according to the Biot-Savart Law $d\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I d\\vec{l} \\times \\hat{r}}{r^2}$, which calculates the field contribution from each current element, and Ampere's Law $\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$, which relates the magnetic field circulation around a closed path to the enclosed current. Key results include: field around a straight wire $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$, field at center of a loop $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R}$, field inside a solenoid $B = \\mu_0 nI$, and field inside a toroid $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 NI}{2\\pi r}$. The right-hand rule determines field direction: thumb in current direction, fingers curl in field direction. These principles enable the design and analysis of electromagnets, MRI systems, particle accelerators, and numerous other electromagnetic devices that form the foundation of modern technology."
