  "summary": "Motional electromotive force (EMF) is generated when conductors move through magnetic fields, described by $\\mathcal{E} = B l v$ for perpendicular motion. The EMF arises from the magnetic force ($\\vec{F}_B = q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$) on charge carriers, causing charge separation until balanced by electric forces. The direction is determined by the right-hand rule, with energy conservation maintained through opposing magnetic forces on induced currents. Key applications include AC/DC generators (converting mechanical to electrical energy), electromagnetic brakes (dissipating kinetic energy as heat), Faraday disks (homopolar generators), and maglev systems (combining levitation and propulsion). Power relationships show $P_{mech} = Fv = \\mathcal{E}I = P_{elec}$ for ideal conversion, with practical systems having efficiencies below 100% due to resistive losses. These principles form the foundation of electrical power generation and numerous electromagnetic devices essential to modern technology."
