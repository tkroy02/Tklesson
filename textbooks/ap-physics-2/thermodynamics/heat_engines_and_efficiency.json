  "summary": "Heat engines are cyclic devices that convert thermal energy from high-temperature sources into useful mechanical work while rejecting waste heat to low-temperature sinks. Thermal efficiency, defined as η = W_net/Q_H = 1 - Q_C/Q_H, quantifies the effectiveness of this energy conversion, with all real engines having η < 1 due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Carnot cycle establishes the theoretical maximum efficiency possible between two temperature reservoirs: η_Carnot = 1 - T_C/T_H, where temperatures must be in absolute units. Real heat engines implement various thermodynamic cycles including the Otto cycle for gasoline engines (25-30% efficiency), Diesel cycle for diesel engines (30-40% efficiency), Rankine cycle for steam power plants (40-48% efficiency), and Brayton cycle for gas turbines (35-45% efficiency). These practical engines achieve efficiencies significantly below Carnot limits due to irreversibilities, mechanical losses, finite temperature differences, and material constraints. Efficiency improvements focus on increasing hot reservoir temperatures, reducing cold reservoir temperatures, minimizing irreversibilities, and implementing waste heat recovery systems. Understanding heat engine principles and efficiency limitations is crucial for energy conversion optimization, transportation system design, power generation planning, and environmental impact assessment across modern technological systems."
