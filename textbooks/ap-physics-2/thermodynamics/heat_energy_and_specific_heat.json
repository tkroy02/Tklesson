  "summary": "Heat energy and specific heat capacity form the foundation of thermal energy transfer and storage analysis. Heat represents energy transfer due to temperature difference, quantified by Q = mcΔT where specific heat capacity c characterizes a material's thermal inertia - water's high value (4186 J/kg·K) explains its effectiveness in temperature moderation and thermal storage. Calorimetry applies energy conservation (Q_gained = Q_lost) to measure heat transfer and material properties, with careful accounting for calorimeter heat capacity in precise measurements. Phase transitions involve latent heat exchange at constant temperature: fusion (melting/freezing) requires L_f = 334 kJ/kg for water, while vaporization (boiling/condensation) requires significantly more energy (L_v = 2260 kJ/kg for water) due to complete separation of molecules. Combined processes follow heating curves with sensible heating slopes and phase change plateaus, enabling calculation of total energy requirements for complex thermal processes. These principles govern numerous practical applications including HVAC design, cooking processes, refrigeration systems, thermal energy storage, and climate modeling, where understanding heat transfer, energy conservation, and phase change behavior is essential for efficient system design and operation."
