  "summary": "Refrigerators and heat pumps operate as reverse heat engines, using work input to move heat from cold to hot spaces against the natural direction of heat flow. Performance is measured by the coefficient of performance (COP), with COP_refrigerator = Q_C/W for cooling systems and COP_heat_pump = Q_H/W for heating systems, both typically exceeding 1. The vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, the most common technology, employs four key processes: adiabatic compression, isobaric condensation, adiabatic expansion, and isobaric evaporation, using refrigerant phase changes for efficient heat transfer. The Carnot cycle establishes theoretical maximum COP values: COP_R,Carnot = T_C/(T_H - T_C) and COP_HP,Carnot = T_H/(T_H - T_C), though real systems achieve significantly lower performance due to irreversibilities. Advanced applications include heat pumps for efficient building heating, geothermal systems utilizing stable ground temperatures, absorption refrigeration using thermal energy inputs, and cascade systems for very low temperatures. These technologies find widespread application in household appliances, commercial refrigeration, industrial processes, and building HVAC systems, with ongoing developments focusing on improved efficiency, environmental compatibility, and renewable energy integration."
