Latent Heat Concept: Energy required for phase change at constant temperature; Does not change molecular kinetic energy (temperature constant); Changes potential energy and molecular arrangement. Quantitative Relationships: Q = mL for pure phase change; L_f = latent heat of fusion; L_v = latent heat of vaporization; L_s = latent heat of sublimation; Typical units: J/kg or kJ/kg. Characteristic Values: Water: L_f = 334 kJ/kg, L_v = 2260 kJ/kg; Alcohol: L_f ≈ 109 kJ/kg, L_v ≈ 855 kJ/kg; Metals: L_f typically 20-400 kJ/kg; L_v typically 1000-6000 kJ/kg. Molecular Interpretation: Fusion: overcoming crystalline lattice energy; Vaporization: overcoming all intermolecular forces + expansion work; L_v > L_f due to complete molecular separation. Temperature and Pressure Dependence: Phase change temperatures depend on pressure; Higher pressure → higher boiling point (generally); Triple point: unique T,P where three phases coexist. Energy Conservation: During phase change: energy input increases potential energy only; Temperature remains constant until phase change complete; Energy released during reverse process equals energy absorbed.",

  "summary": "Phase changes and latent heat represent fundamental thermodynamic processes where substances transition between solid, liquid, and gas states with significant energy exchange at constant temperature. The six phase transitions (melting, freezing, vaporization, condensation, sublimation, deposition) each involve characteristic latent heats: fusion (L_f) for solid-liquid transitions and vaporization (L_v) for liquid-gas transitions, with water exhibiting L_f = 334 kJ/kg and L_v = 2260 kJ/kg - the latter requiring approximately 7 times more energy due to complete molecular separation. Heating and cooling curves graphically represent these processes, showing temperature plateaus during phase transitions where energy causes molecular rearrangement rather than temperature change. Phase diagrams comprehensively map substance behavior across all temperature-pressure conditions, featuring triple points where three phases coexist and critical points where liquid-gas distinctions vanish. Practical applications leverage phase change properties in refrigeration cycles (using evaporation cooling), thermal energy storage systems (utilizing melting solidification), weather phenomena (driven by water phase changes), and numerous industrial processes. These principles enable technologies from air conditioning and power generation to food preservation and materials processing, where controlled phase transitions provide efficient energy transfer, temperature regulation, and material transformation capabilities."
