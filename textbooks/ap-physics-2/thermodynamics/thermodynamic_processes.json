Real-World Examples: Isobaric: piston with constant weight, boiling water, weather systems; Isochoric: pressure cooker heating, bomb calorimeter, sealed reaction vessels. Energy Relationships: Isobaric: heat added partly increases internal energy, partly does work; Isochoric: all heat added increases internal energy; Work efficiency differs between processes. Temperature Dependence: Both processes show temperature changes; Isobaric: temperature change affects both volume and internal energy; Isochoric: temperature change affects pressure only.

  "summary": "The four fundamental thermodynamic processes - isobaric (constant pressure), isochoric (constant volume), isothermal (constant temperature), and adiabatic (no heat transfer) - represent specific constraints that govern system behavior and energy transfers. Isobaric processes involve work W = PΔV with both internal energy changes and work output, commonly occurring in open systems and phase changes. Isochoric processes feature W = 0 with all heat transfer increasing internal energy, typical in sealed containers. Isothermal processes maintain constant temperature through heat exchange, with Q = W and ΔU = 0 for ideal gases, enabling maximum work extraction during expansion. Adiabatic processes involve no heat transfer (Q = 0) with ΔU = -W, causing significant temperature changes during compression/expansion, described by PV^γ = constant. These processes display characteristic curves on P-V diagrams: isobaric (horizontal), isochoric (vertical), isothermal (hyperbolic), and adiabatic (steeper hyperbolic). Practical applications include heat engine cycles combining these processes (Otto, Diesel, Carnot cycles), refrigeration systems, atmospheric phenomena, and biological processes. Understanding these fundamental processes enables analysis of energy conversion efficiency, system design optimization, and prediction of natural thermodynamic behavior across engineering, environmental, and biological systems."
