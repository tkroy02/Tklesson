  "summary": "The First Law of Thermodynamics, expressed as ΔU = Q - W, represents energy conservation for thermal systems, stating that the change in internal energy of a system equals the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. Internal energy (U) is a state function depending only on the system state, while heat (Q) and work (W) are path-dependent process functions. Different thermodynamic processes have characteristic behaviors: isothermal processes maintain constant temperature with ΔU = 0, adiabatic processes involve no heat transfer with ΔU = -W, isobaric processes occur at constant pressure, and isochoric processes have constant volume with W = 0. Work in thermodynamic processes can be calculated as the area under P-V curves, with cyclic processes having ΔU = 0 over complete cycles. Practical applications include heat engines that convert heat to work with efficiency η = W/Q_H, refrigerators that use work to move heat from cold to warm spaces with COP = Q_C/W, and heat pumps for building heating with COP = Q_H/W. The First Law finds applications across internal combustion engines, power plants, refrigeration systems, biological energy conversion, and environmental processes, providing the fundamental framework for analyzing energy transfers and conversions while preventing perpetual motion machines of the first kind through strict energy accounting."
