Discrete Spectra Problem: Atoms emit and absorb only specific frequencies; Classical theory predicts continuous spectra; Mathematical regularity in hydrogen spectra (Balmer series). Bohr's Three Postulates (1913): Postulate 1: Electrons exist in stationary states (specific orbits) without radiating energy. Postulate 2: Only certain orbits allowed where electron angular momentum is quantized: mvr = nħ, where n=1,2,3... and ħ = h/2π. Postulate 3: Radiation occurs only when electron jumps between stationary states; Photon energy = energy difference: hf = E_i - E_f. Correspondence Principle: Quantum theory must agree with classical physics in limit of large quantum numbers; High-n transitions should approach classical radiation frequencies; Provides connection between quantum and classical worlds. Historical Significance: Bohr's paper 'On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules' (1913); Combined Planck's quantization with Rutherford atom; Successfully predicted hydrogen spectrum; Nobel Prize 1922. Resolution of Paradoxes: Stationary states explain atomic stability; Quantum jumps explain discrete spectra; Quantization explains spectral regularities.",

Fundamental Limitations: Cannot explain multi-electron atoms (helium spectrum fails); No prediction of transition probabilities or line intensities; Cannot explain chemical bonding; Fails for Zeeman and Stark effects; Quantization condition appears ad hoc. Successes and Achievements: Perfect hydrogen spectrum prediction; Correct ionization energy; Derived Rydberg constant from first principles; Explained spectral series regularity; Resolved atomic stability paradox. Historical Impact and Transition: 'Old Quantum Theory' (1913-1925); Guided development of matrix mechanics and wave mechanics; Correspondence principle influenced Heisenberg; Conceptual bridge to full quantum mechanics. Modern Perspective: Superseded by Schrödinger equation and quantum mechanics; Remains excellent pedagogical tool; Historically crucial stepping stone; Demonstrates how scientific theories evolve.

  "summary": "The Bohr model represents a pivotal achievement in physics, successfully applying quantum concepts to atomic structure for the first time. Through three revolutionary postulates - stationary states, angular momentum quantization, and quantum jumps - Bohr resolved the atomic stability paradox and perfectly explained hydrogen's discrete spectrum. The model yielded precise quantitative predictions including the Bohr radius (0.529 Å), hydrogen energy levels (E_n = -13.6/n² eV), and the theoretical derivation of the Rydberg constant. While brilliantly successful for hydrogen and hydrogen-like ions, the model faced fundamental limitations with multi-electron atoms, spectral line intensities, and finer details of atomic structure. These limitations ultimately drove the development of complete quantum mechanics, yet Bohr's conceptual framework, particularly the correspondence principle, guided this transition. The Bohr model remains invaluable as a pedagogical tool, historical milestone, and demonstration of how scientific theories evolve through creative synthesis of classical and quantum ideas, standing as one of the most influential models in the history of physics."
