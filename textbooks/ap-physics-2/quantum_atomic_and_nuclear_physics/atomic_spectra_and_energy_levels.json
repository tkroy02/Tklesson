Emission Spectra: Produced when excited atoms return to lower energy states; Electrons transition from higher to lower energy levels; Emit photons with energy ΔE = E_upper - E_lower; Appear as bright lines against dark background. Absorption Spectra: Produced when atoms absorb specific wavelengths from continuous spectrum; Electrons excited from lower to higher energy levels; Absorb photons with energy exactly matching level differences; Appear as dark lines against bright continuous background. Continuous Spectra: Produced by hot, dense objects; Result from thermal radiation processes; All wavelengths present; Examples: incandescent lights, stars. Kirchhoff's Laws: Hot dense object → continuous spectrum; Hot low-density gas → emission line spectrum; Cool gas in front of hot source → absorption line spectrum. Spectral Series Organization: Lines grouped in series with mathematical regularity; Hydrogen series: Lyman (UV), Balmer (visible), Paschen (IR), etc.; Rydberg formula describes wavelength patterns. Experimental Setup: Spectroscope with slit, collimator, prism/grating, telescope; Modern: spectrometer with CCD detectors; High resolution reveals fine structure.

  "summary": "Atomic spectra provide definitive evidence for the quantization of energy in atoms, with discrete spectral lines corresponding to transitions between specific energy levels. The Bohr model successfully explains hydrogen spectra through quantized electron orbits and derived energy levels E_n = -13.6/n² eV, predicting spectral series (Lyman, Balmer, Paschen) with remarkable accuracy. Multi-electron atoms require the full quantum mechanical description with four quantum numbers (n, l, m_l, m_s) that define electron states and obey selection rules (Δl = ±1) governing allowed transitions. Atomic spectra serve as unique fingerprints for elements, enabling composition analysis across scientific disciplines from astronomy to forensic science. The study of atomic spectra not only revealed the quantum nature of matter but also drove the development of quantum mechanics, providing the experimental foundation for our modern understanding of atomic structure and continuing to enable technological advances in spectroscopy, lasers, and quantum technologies."
