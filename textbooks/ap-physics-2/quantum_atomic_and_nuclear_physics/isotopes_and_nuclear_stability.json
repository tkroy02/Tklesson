Iron Peak Elements: Maximum binding around iron group; Nickel-62 actually most bound; Iron-56 most abundant due to stellar physics; Endpoint of stellar fusion.

Pairing Energy Effects: Even-even nuclei: most stable; Odd-even nuclei: intermediate; Odd-odd nuclei: least stable; Explains odd-even abundance variations. Quantitative Stability Criteria: Beta stability: optimal N/Z ratio; Alpha decay: Z²/A < ~48 stable; Spontaneous fission: Z²/A < ~50 stable; Proton drip line: limit of proton binding.

  "summary": "Isotopes and nuclear stability follow systematic patterns governed by the balance between the strong nuclear force and Coulomb repulsion. The valley of stability represents the band of stable nuclei where neutron-proton ratios increase from approximately 1 for light elements to about 1.5 for heavy elements. Binding energy per nucleon peaks around iron-56, explaining why fusion of light elements and fission of heavy elements both release energy. Magic numbers (2,8,20,28,50,82,126) confer special stability, while pairing effects make even-even nuclei most stable. Quantitative stability criteria help predict decay modes, with neutron-rich nuclei undergoing beta-minus decay, proton-rich nuclei undergoing beta-plus decay or electron capture, and very heavy nuclei being susceptible to alpha decay and spontaneous fission. These fundamental principles of nuclear stability not only explain the existence and properties of different isotopes but also enable applications ranging from nuclear energy to medical diagnostics and provide the foundation for understanding elemental formation in stars and the evolution of the universe."
