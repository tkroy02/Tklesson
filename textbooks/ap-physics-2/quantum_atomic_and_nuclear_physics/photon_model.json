  "summary": "The photon model establishes light as quantized packets of electromagnetic energy, revolutionizing our understanding of light-matter interactions. Fundamental relationships E = hf and p = h/λ describe photon energy and momentum, with Planck's constant h = 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s connecting the quantum and classical worlds. Wave-particle duality represents a core quantum principle, with experiments like the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering demonstrating particle-like behavior while interference and diffraction patterns reveal wave-like characteristics. Modern technologies including lasers, photovoltaics, quantum communication, and medical imaging all rely on photon principles, with photons serving as both practical tools and fundamental probes of quantum reality. The photon model successfully explains phenomena from atomic spectra to cosmological observations, providing the foundation for quantum electrodynamics and continuing to drive technological innovation across multiple fields. Understanding photon properties and behavior remains essential for advancing both fundamental physics and practical applications in our increasingly photonic world."
