Historical Context: de Broglie's PhD thesis (1924); Inspired by symmetry: if waves are particles, particles should be waves; Einstein supported the idea; Nobel Prize 1929. Phase Waves and Pilot Waves: de Broglie originally proposed 'pilot waves' guiding particles; Phase wave frequency: f = E/h; Group velocity equals particle velocity. Bohr Model Justification: Explains angular momentum quantization: mvr = nħ; Circumference = nλ: 2πr = nλ; Natural foundation for stationary states. Experimental Predictions: Electron diffraction should occur; Davisson-Germer experiment (1927) confirmation; Thomson independently observed electron diffraction. Wave-Particle Symmetry: Complete duality between light and matter; Photons: E = hf, p = h/λ; Electrons: λ = h/p, f = E/h; Unified quantum description. Relativistic Form: λ = h/p = hc/√(E² - (mc²)²); For high energies, λ ≈ hc/E; Compton wavelength: λ_C = h/(mc). Significance for Quantum Mechanics: Direct inspiration for Schrödinger's wave equation; Foundation of wave mechanics; Born's probability interpretation. Macroscopic Objects: λ = h/(mv) extremely small for everyday objects; Baseball (0.15 kg, 40 m/s): λ ≈ 10⁻³⁴ m; Completely negligible wave effects.",

Measurement Problem: Quantum systems exist in superpositions; Measurement produces definite outcomes; How does superposition collapse? Schrödinger's cat paradox. Copenhagen Interpretation: Standard interpretation; Wavefunction as information; Measurement causes collapse; Observer plays special role; Quantum realm separate from classical. Many-Worlds Interpretation: All possibilities realized; Wavefunction never collapses; Universe constantly branching; All outcomes occur in parallel universes; Solves measurement problem. de Broglie-Bohm Pilot-Wave: Particles have definite trajectories; Guided by quantum potential; Wavefunction as real field; Deterministic but non-local; Restores classical intuition. Quantum Superposition: Systems exist in multiple states simultaneously; Double-slit: particle goes through both slits; Measurement forces choice; Macroscopic superpositions controversial. Quantum-Classical Boundary: Where does quantum behavior end? Decoherence explains emergence of classicality; Environment interactions destroy coherence; No sharp boundary exists. Philosophical Questions: Nature of reality independent of observation? Role of consciousness in measurement? Limits of human knowledge? Completeness of quantum description. Modern Experimental Tests: Delayed-choice experiments; Quantum eraser; Tests of Bell's inequalities; pushing superposition to larger scales.",

  "summary": "Wave-particle duality represents one of the most profound and counterintuitive principles in physics, establishing that all quantum entities exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on experimental context. The de Broglie hypothesis λ = h/p extended this duality from light to all matter, with experimental confirmation through electron diffraction and countless subsequent demonstrations. Bohr's complementarity principle formalizes the mutual exclusivity of wave and particle behaviors in any single experiment, while the measurement problem and various quantum interpretations grapple with the deeper implications for reality and observation. From the philosophical puzzles of Schrödinger's cat to the practical applications in electron microscopy and quantum technologies, wave-particle duality continues to challenge our classical intuitions while enabling revolutionary advances across science and technology. This fundamental quantum principle not only reshaped our understanding of the microscopic world but also continues to drive both theoretical exploration and technological innovation at the frontiers of physics."
