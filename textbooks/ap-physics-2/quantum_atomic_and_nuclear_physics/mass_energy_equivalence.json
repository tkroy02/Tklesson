  "summary": "Einstein's mass-energy equivalence E=mc² represents one of the most profound insights in physics, establishing that mass and energy are different manifestations of the same fundamental quantity. This principle explains the enormous energy release in nuclear reactions through small mass defects, with binding energy calculations revealing why fusion of light elements and fission of heavy elements both release energy as systems move toward the maximum binding around iron-56. The equation provides the theoretical foundation for stellar energy production through hydrogen fusion, powers human nuclear technology in reactors and weapons, underlies medical applications like radiation therapy and PET scans, and reveals deep connections between particle physics and cosmology. While complete matter-energy conversion remains impractical with current technology, the understanding that everyday mass represents tremendous latent energy has transformed our conception of the universe and continues to drive research in fundamental physics, energy technology, and our understanding of cosmic evolution from the Big Bang to the present."
