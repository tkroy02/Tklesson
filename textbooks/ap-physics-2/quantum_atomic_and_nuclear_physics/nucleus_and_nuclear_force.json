  "summary": "Nuclear structure is governed by the strong nuclear force, a short-range, charge-independent attraction that binds protons and neutrons together against electrostatic repulsion. Nuclei exhibit constant density with radii scaling as R ∝ A¹ᐟ³, and their stability is quantified through binding energy derived from mass defect via E = mc². The liquid drop model successfully describes overall binding energy trends through the semi-empirical mass formula, while the shell model explains magic numbers and individual nucleon behavior. Nuclear stability follows the valley of stability where N/Z ratios increase from 1 for light nuclei to ~1.5 for heavy nuclei, with doubly magic nuclei exhibiting exceptional stability. These fundamental principles of nuclear structure and forces not only explain nuclear stability and decay but also enable applications ranging from nuclear energy to medical diagnostics and provide the foundation for understanding stellar nucleosynthesis and the origin of elements in the universe."
