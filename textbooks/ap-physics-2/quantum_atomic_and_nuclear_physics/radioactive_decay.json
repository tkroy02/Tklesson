  "summary": "Radioactive decay encompasses three fundamental processes: alpha decay involving quantum tunneling of helium nuclei through Coulomb barriers, beta decay mediated by the weak force with continuous energy spectra requiring neutrinos, and gamma decay consisting of electromagnetic transitions between nuclear energy states. These processes follow exponential decay laws characterized by half-lives ranging from fractions of seconds to billions of years. Alpha decay exhibits discrete energies and follows the Geiger-Nuttall law relating energy to half-life, beta decay involves transformations between nucleons with three variants (beta-minus, beta-plus, electron capture), and gamma decay follows multipole selection rules with possible competition from internal conversion. The mathematical description of radioactive decay enables applications from radiometric dating to nuclear medicine, while the physical mechanisms provide insights into fundamental forces and quantum phenomena. Understanding these decay processes is essential for both practical applications in medicine and energy and for fundamental research in nuclear and particle physics."
