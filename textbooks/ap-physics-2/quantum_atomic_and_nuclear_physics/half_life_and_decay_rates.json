Secular Equilibrium: Occurs when λ_p << λ_d (T₁/₂_p >> T₁/₂_d); After ~5-10 daughter half-lives; Daughter activity equals parent activity: A_d = A_p; Constant ratio N_d/N_p = λ_p/λ_d = T₁/₂_d/T₁/₂_p. Transient Equilibrium: Occurs when λ_p < λ_d but comparable; Daughter activity exceeds parent activity initially; Ratio A_d/A_p = λ_d/(λ_d - λ_p) at equilibrium. No Equilibrium: When λ_d < λ_p (daughter longer-lived than parent); Daughter accumulates continuously; No constant activity ratio. Natural Decay Series: Four natural series: uranium (4n+2), thorium (4n), actinium (4n+3), neptunium (4n+1); Each starts with long-lived parent; Ends with stable lead or bismuth. Bateman Equations: General solution for arbitrary decay chain; Account for initial conditions; Used in radiation dosimetry and nuclear engineering. Growth of Daughter: Initially increases from zero; Reaches maximum when λ_dN_d = λ_pN_p; Then follows equilibrium or decay pattern. Practical Applications: Radon from uranium decay (health hazard); Medical isotope generators (e.g., ⁹⁹Mo/⁹⁹ᵐTc); Nuclear waste management; Geological dating using series.",

  "summary": "Radioactive decay kinetics follows precise exponential mathematics characterized by half-lives and decay constants that are fundamental properties of each radionuclide. The exponential decay law N(t) = N₀e^(-λt) describes the statistical behavior of large ensembles of radioactive atoms, with applications ranging from radiometric dating to nuclear medicine. Carbon-14 dating utilizes the 5730-year half-life to date organic materials up to ~50,000 years old, while longer-lived isotopes like uranium-238 enable dating of geological formations billions of years old. Complex decay chains exhibit equilibrium conditions where secular equilibrium occurs when parent half-lives greatly exceed daughter half-lives, leading to equal activities throughout the chain. These fundamental principles of radioactive decay kinetics provide powerful tools for determining ages, understanding nuclear processes, and applying radioactive isotopes across science, medicine, and industry, while the statistical nature of quantum decay processes reveals fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and the nature of time itself."
