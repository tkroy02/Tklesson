Frequency Threshold: No electron emission below specific frequency f₀, regardless of intensity (classical: energy accumulation should work for any frequency).

  "summary": "The photoelectric effect provides crucial evidence for the quantum nature of light, demonstrating that light energy is transferred in discrete packets (photons) rather than continuously. Key observations - immediate emission, frequency threshold, intensity-independent maximum energy, and current proportional to intensity - all contradict classical wave theory but are perfectly explained by Einstein's photoelectric equation K_max = hf - φ. The work function φ represents the minimum energy needed to remove electrons from a material, determining the threshold frequency f₀ = φ/h below which no emission occurs regardless of intensity. Modern applications span photomultiplier tubes for single-photon detection, solar cells for energy conversion, digital image sensors, and numerous light-sensing technologies. The photoelectric effect not only revolutionized our understanding of light-matter interactions but also enabled technologies that define modern life, from digital photography to renewable energy, while providing the experimental foundation for quantum mechanics and continuing to drive innovations in quantum optics and photonic devices."
