  "summary": "Single-slit diffraction demonstrates the wave nature of light through the spreading and interference of light passing through narrow openings. The phenomenon is explained by Huygens' principle, where each point in the slit acts as a source of secondary wavelets that interfere to create characteristic patterns of bright and dark regions. The intensity distribution follows a sinc² function ($I = I_0[\\frac{\\sin(\\beta/2)}{\\beta/2}]^2$), with minima occurring at $a\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$ and a dominant central maximum containing most of the light energy. Diffraction sets fundamental resolution limits for optical instruments through the Rayleigh criterion ($\\theta_{min} = 1.22\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$ for circular apertures), determining the maximum performance of telescopes, microscopes, cameras, and other imaging systems. These principles find wide application in optical design, where understanding diffraction effects is crucial for optimizing instrument performance, from astronomical observatories to microscopic imaging systems. The study of single-slit diffraction provides essential insights into wave behavior that cannot be explained by geometric optics alone and establishes fundamental limits on our ability to observe and measure fine details in the physical world."
