  "summary": "The thin lens equation ($\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$) and mirror equation (identical mathematical form) provide the fundamental mathematical framework for analyzing optical systems. Combined with the magnification formula ($M = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}$) and proper sign conventions (Real-is-Positive: real images positive, virtual images negative; converging elements positive f, diverging elements negative f), these equations enable precise calculation of image characteristics without graphical construction. Optical power ($P = \\frac{1}{f}$ in diopters) quantifies lens strength for vision correction applications. Multiple element systems are analyzed sequentially, with overall magnification as the product of individual magnifications. Real-world applications span vision correction (myopia: diverging lenses, hyperopia: converging lenses), camera design (focusing, field of view), projector systems (throw ratios), and scientific instruments (microscopes, telescopes). Advanced applications include solving for unknown parameters, optimizing system performance, and balancing engineering trade-offs in practical optical design. Mastery of these mathematical tools is essential for optical engineering across healthcare, photography, scientific research, and technology development."
