  "summary": "Reflection and refraction govern light behavior at interfaces between different media. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection ($\\theta_i = \\theta_r$), with specular reflection from smooth surfaces creating clear images and diffuse reflection from rough surfaces scattering light. Refraction follows Snell's Law ($n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2$), where light bends toward the normal when entering denser media (higher n) and away from normal when entering less dense media. Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from higher to lower index media at angles exceeding the critical angle ($\\theta_c = \\sin^{-1}(\\frac{n_2}{n_1})$), enabling applications like optical fibers, prism reflectors, and diamond brilliance. Dispersion causes wavelength-dependent refraction, separating white light into colors through prisms. These principles form the foundation for numerous optical technologies including lenses, mirrors, fiber optics, and various imaging systems used in communications, medicine, and scientific instrumentation."
