  "summary": "Young's double-slit experiment stands as one of the most important demonstrations in physics, conclusively establishing light's wave nature through interference patterns. The experiment shows alternating bright ($d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$) and dark ($d\\sin\\theta = (m+\\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$) fringes with constant spacing ($\\Delta y = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d}$), resulting from superposition of coherent waves from two slits. Mathematical analysis reveals sinusoidal intensity distribution ($I = 4I_0\\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi d y}{\\lambda D})$) with perfect contrast under ideal conditions. The experiment's significance extends beyond classical optics to quantum mechanics, where single-particle versions demonstrate wave-particle duality - particles build up interference patterns individually, but measuring which slit they pass through destroys the pattern. Modern applications include optical interferometry for precision measurement, holography for 3D imaging, coherence characterization, and fundamental tests of quantum theory. The double-slit experiment remains a cornerstone of optics education and a powerful tool for both technological applications and probing the fundamental nature of reality."
