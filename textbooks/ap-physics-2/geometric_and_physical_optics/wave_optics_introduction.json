Linear Polarization: Electric field oscillates in single plane; Produced by polaroid filters, reflection, scattering; Malus' Law: $I = I_0\\cos^2\\theta$ for crossed polarizers. Circular/Elliptical Polarization: Electric field rotates; Circular: constant amplitude; Elliptical: varying amplitude; Produced by quarter-wave plates. Brewster's Angle: Reflection completely polarized when $\\tan\\theta_B = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$; Reflected light 100% polarized parallel to surface; No reflection of p-polarization at this angle. Birefringence: Double refraction in anisotropic crystals; Different refractive indices for different polarizations; Ordinary and extraordinary rays; Used in wave plates. Coherence Concepts: Temporal coherence: monochromaticity, coherence time $\\tau_c = \\frac{1}{\\Delta\\nu}$, coherence length $L_c = c\\tau_c$; Spatial coherence: correlation between different points; Laser: high coherence; Thermal sources: low coherence. Polarization Applications: Sunglasses reduce glare; LCD displays use polarized light; 3D movies use polarization separation; Optical communications use polarization modulation.",

  "summary": "Wave optics explains optical phenomena that cannot be understood through geometric optics alone, demonstrating light's wave nature through interference, diffraction, and polarization. Interference occurs when coherent light waves superimpose, creating patterns of constructive ($\\Delta L = m\\lambda$) and destructive ($\\Delta L = (m+\\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$) interference observed in double-slit experiments and thin films. Diffraction causes light to bend around obstacles and spread after passing through openings, with single-slit diffraction producing characteristic patterns and diffraction gratings enabling spectral analysis. Huygens' principle explains wave propagation through secondary wavelets. Polarization demonstrates light's transverse nature, with Malus' Law ($I = I_0\\cos^2\\theta$) describing intensity through polarizers and Brewster's angle ($\\tan\\theta_B = n_2/n_1$) providing complete polarization by reflection. Coherence (temporal and spatial) is essential for observable interference effects. These wave phenomena find applications in anti-reflection coatings, spectroscopy, optical instruments, displays, communications, and numerous technologies where understanding light's wave behavior is crucial for system design and performance."
