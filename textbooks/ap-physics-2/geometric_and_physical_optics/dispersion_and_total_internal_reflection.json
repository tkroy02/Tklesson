  "summary": "Dispersion and total internal reflection are fundamental optical phenomena with widespread applications. Dispersion occurs because the refractive index of materials varies with wavelength (Cauchy's equation: $n(\\lambda) = A + \\frac{B}{\\lambda^2}$), causing different colors to refract at different angles. This produces spectra in prisms but causes chromatic aberration in lenses, corrected using achromatic doublets combining materials with different dispersion (Abbe numbers). Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from higher to lower index media at angles exceeding the critical angle ($\\theta_c = \\sin^{-1}(\\frac{n_2}{n_1})$), creating evanescent waves that decay exponentially in the lower-index medium. TIR enables optical fibers (numerical aperture $NA = \\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}$), gemstone brilliance, and various sensors. Advanced applications include dispersion-compensated fiber optics, TIR-based microscopy, and integrated photonic devices. Understanding these phenomena is crucial for designing optical systems in communications, imaging, spectroscopy, and sensing technologies."
