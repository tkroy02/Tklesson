  "summary": "Ray diagrams for lenses provide both graphical and mathematical methods for analyzing image formation. Converging lenses (positive focal length) can produce both real and virtual images depending on object position: real inverted images when object is outside the focal point, virtual upright magnified images when object is inside the focal point. Diverging lenses (negative focal length) always produce virtual, upright, diminished images regardless of object position. The thin lens equation ($\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$) and magnification formula ($M = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}$) provide quantitative relationships, with proper sign conventions essential for correct results. Ray tracing using principal rays (parallel, focal, center) enables graphical determination of image characteristics. Multiple lens systems are analyzed sequentially, with the image from one lens becoming the object for the next. These principles form the foundation for optical instruments including microscopes, telescopes, cameras, and vision correction systems, where controlled refraction and precise image formation are essential for their operation."
