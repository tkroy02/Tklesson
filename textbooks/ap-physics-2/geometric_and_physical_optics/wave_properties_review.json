  "summary": "Wave properties are characterized by fundamental parameters including amplitude (wave strength), wavelength (spatial period), frequency (temporal rate), and wave speed ($v = f\\lambda$). The superposition principle states that when waves overlap, the resultant displacement equals the sum of individual displacements, leading to interference patterns with constructive interference ($\\Delta L = n\\lambda$) creating intensity maxima and destructive interference ($\\Delta L = (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$) creating minima. At boundaries, waves exhibit reflection (with or without phase inversion), transmission (energy transfer), refraction (direction change per Snell's Law: $n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2$), and diffraction (bending around obstacles). Standing waves form through interference between incident and reflected waves, with resonance occurring at specific frequencies ($f_n = \\frac{nv}{2L}$). These fundamental wave behaviors provide the foundation for understanding both geometric optics (ray approximation) and physical optics (wave nature) in subsequent studies of optical phenomena."
