Ray Tracing Rules: Parallel ray: reflects as if coming from focal point; Focal ray: reflects parallel to principal axis; Center ray: reflects as if coming from center of curvature; Vertex ray: reflects with equal angles. Mirror Equation: $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$ with f < 0; Always gives d_i < 0 (virtual image); Image always located behind mirror. Magnification: $M = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}$; Always gives 0 < M < +1 (upright and diminished); M decreases as object moves farther away. Field of View: Much wider than plane or concave mirrors; Allows viewing of large areas; Useful for security and safety applications. Special Properties: No real image formation possible; Objects appear smaller but more area visible; 'Objects in mirror are closer than they appear' warning. Applications: Vehicle side-view mirrors (passenger side); Security mirrors in stores; Traffic mirrors at intersections; Industrial safety mirrors; Wide-angle optical systems.",

  "summary": "Ray diagrams for mirrors provide both graphical and mathematical methods for analyzing image formation. Plane mirrors always produce virtual, upright images that are the same size as the object ($d_i = -d_o$, $M = +1$) with lateral inversion. Concave mirrors (converging, $f > 0$) can produce both real and virtual images depending on object position: real inverted images when object is outside the focal point, virtual upright magnified images when object is inside the focal point. Convex mirrors (diverging, $f < 0$) always produce virtual, upright, diminished images ($0 < M < +1$) with wide fields of view. The mirror equation ($\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$) and magnification formula ($M = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}$) provide quantitative relationships, with proper sign conventions essential for correct results. Ray tracing using principal rays (parallel, focal, center, vertex) enables graphical determination of image characteristics. These principles find applications in telescopes, vehicle mirrors, security systems, and various optical instruments where controlled reflection and image formation are required."
