Physical Interpretation: Rotational analog of mass; Measures resistance to angular acceleration; For given torque, larger I means smaller α: $\\alpha = \\frac{\\tau}{I}$.

Radius of Gyration: Distance k where all mass concentrated gives same I: $I = Mk^2$; $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{I}{M}}$; Useful for comparing different shapes. Comparison with Linear Motion: Force F causes acceleration a = F/m; Torque τ causes angular acceleration α = τ/I; Mass m resists linear acceleration; Moment of inertia I resists angular acceleration. Factors Affecting I: Total mass M; Mass distribution (shape); Location of rotation axis; Object geometry and density. Dimensional Analysis: I has units kg·m²; Consistent with mr²; Different from energy units (same dimensions but different physical meaning).

  "summary": "Moment of inertia serves as the rotational analog of mass, quantifying an object's resistance to angular acceleration through the relationship τ = Iα. Unlike mass alone, moment of inertia depends crucially on how mass is distributed relative to the rotation axis, with the fundamental definition I = Σmr² for discrete systems and I = ∫r²dm for continuous distributions. Common geometric shapes have characteristic moments of inertia, with the parallel axis theorem enabling calculation about any axis given the moment about a parallel axis through the center of mass. This concept plays a vital role in rotational dynamics, determining rotational kinetic energy (K = ½Iω²), influencing the period of physical pendulums, and affecting acceleration in rolling motion. From the design of sports equipment to the operation of industrial machinery, understanding and applying moment of inertia principles is essential for analyzing and predicting rotational behavior in diverse physical systems."
