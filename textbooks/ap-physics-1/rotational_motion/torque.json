  "summary": "Torque represents the rotational analog of force, causing angular acceleration rather than linear acceleration, with magnitude determined by both force applied and its lever arm - the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis to the force line. Through multiple equivalent calculation methods (lever arm, force components, vector cross product), torque provides a complete description of rotational force effectiveness. The lever arm concept enables mechanical advantage in simple machines, allowing force amplification through strategic application points while conserving work. In rigid body dynamics, net torque relates to angular acceleration through the rotational version of Newton's second law (τ = Iα), with moment of inertia serving as rotational mass. Torque principles underlie diverse applications from simple tools to complex machinery, demonstrating the fundamental unity of rotational dynamics across physical systems."
