  "summary": "Newton's second law for rotation, Στ = Iα, provides the fundamental equation for analyzing rotational dynamics, establishing that net external torque causes angular acceleration proportional to the torque and inversely proportional to the moment of inertia. This rotational analog of F = ma can be rigorously derived from particle dynamics and applies to rigid bodies undergoing fixed-axis rotation. Effective problem-solving requires systematic approaches including extended free-body diagrams, proper coordinate systems, and careful calculation of net torque. The law extends to complex applications including combined translational-rotational motion (where both F = ma and τ = Iα apply simultaneously), time-dependent systems requiring calculus methods, and real-world engineering systems from vehicle dynamics to robotic control. Through these applications, τ = Iα demonstrates its power as the cornerstone of rotational dynamics, enabling prediction and analysis of rotational motion across diverse physical systems."
