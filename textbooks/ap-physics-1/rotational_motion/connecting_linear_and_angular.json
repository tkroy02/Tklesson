  "summary": "The relationships between linear and angular motion provide a unified framework for analyzing rotational systems, with fundamental connections through arc length ($s=r\\theta$), tangential velocity ($v_t=r\\omega$), and acceleration components ($a_t=r\\alpha$, $a_c=r\\omega^2$). These relationships reveal that all points on a rotating rigid body share the same angular motion but have different linear motions depending on their distance from the axis. Rolling motion represents the most important application of these connections, where the no-slip condition ($v_{cm}=r\\omega$, $a_{cm}=r\\alpha$) couples translational and rotational kinematics, producing characteristic velocity distributions with the contact point instantaneously at rest. The vector nature of rotational motion, expressed through cross products ($\\vec{v}=\\vec{\\omega}\\times\\vec{r}$), provides the most general description, valid in three dimensions. These fundamental relationships enable analysis of diverse real-world systems from simple wheels to complex machinery, demonstrating the profound mathematical unity underlying rotational dynamics."
