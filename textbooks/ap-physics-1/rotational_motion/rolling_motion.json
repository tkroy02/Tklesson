  "summary": "Rolling motion represents the fundamental combination of translational and rotational motion, characterized by the no-slip condition $v_{cm} = R\\omega$ that relates linear velocity to angular velocity. This kinematic constraint, coupled with the dynamic equations $\\sum F = ma_{cm}$ and $\\sum \\tau = I\\alpha$, provides a complete description of rolling behavior. Static friction plays a crucial role in enabling rolling without slipping by providing the necessary torque for rotation while doing no work. Energy methods offer powerful alternative approaches, with total kinetic energy given by $K_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{cm}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_{cm}\\omega^2$, simplifying the analysis of complex rolling systems. From objects rolling down inclines to vehicles accelerating on roads, rolling motion demonstrates the intricate interplay between translation and rotation, with applications spanning sports, engineering, and everyday phenomena. The analysis of rolling with slipping transitions and rotational collisions further extends these principles to more complex dynamic scenarios."
