Derivation from Particle Systems: Consider rigid body as collection of particles; Each particle has Kᵢ = ½mᵢvᵢ²; For rotation: vᵢ = rᵢω; Therefore Kᵢ = ½mᵢ(rᵢω)² = ½mᵢrᵢ²ω²; Sum over all particles: K_rot = ΣKᵢ = ½ω²Σmᵢrᵢ² = ½Iω². Continuous Distribution Derivation: For continuous objects: K_rot = ∫½v² dm = ∫½(rω)² dm = ½ω²∫r² dm = ½Iω². Physical Interpretation: Energy stored in rotational motion; Depends on both mass distribution (I) and rotation rate (ω); For same ω, larger I means more energy. Units and Dimensions: K_rot has units joules (J); I in kg·m², ω in rad/s; ½Iω² in kg·m²/s² = N·m = J. Comparison with Translation: K_trans = ½mv² depends on mass and speed; K_rot = ½Iω² depends on moment of inertia and angular speed; Same mathematical form, different physical quantities. Energy Distribution: In rotating object, outer parts have more kinetic energy (v = rω); Energy proportional to r². Special Cases: Pure rotation: K = ½Iω²; Combined motion: K = ½mv_cm² + ½I_cmω²; Rolling without slipping: K = ½mv² + ½Iω² with v = Rω.",

  "summary": "Rotational kinetic energy, given by K_rot = ½Iω², represents the energy due to rotational motion and serves as the direct rotational analog of translational kinetic energy K_trans = ½mv². This energy depends on both the object's moment of inertia (reflecting mass distribution) and its angular velocity, with the quadratic dependence emphasizing the significance of rotation rate. For objects undergoing combined translational and rotational motion, the total kinetic energy is the sum K_total = ½mv_cm² + ½I_cmω², with rolling motion providing the important special case where v_cm = Rω. Energy conservation methods and the work-energy theorem provide powerful tools for solving complex rotational dynamics problems, often offering simpler solutions than force-based approaches. These principles extend to advanced applications including rotational collisions, oscillatory systems, and real-world engineering designs from flywheel energy storage to vehicle dynamics, demonstrating the fundamental role of rotational energy in understanding and predicting the behavior of rotating systems across physics and engineering."
