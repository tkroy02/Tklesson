  "summary": "Centripetal acceleration, when revisited through the lens of rotational kinematics, reveals itself as a fundamental consequence of curved motion, with rigorous derivations from geometric, calculus, and vector perspectives all confirming $a_c = r\\omega^2 = v^2/r$. In rotational systems, centripetal acceleration exhibits clear linear dependence on radius for rigid bodies rotating with constant angular velocity, while tangential acceleration ($a_t = r\\alpha$) handles changes in rotation rate. The concept extends powerfully to advanced applications including rotating reference frames (introducing centrifugal and Coriolis effects), orbital mechanics (where gravity provides the necessary centripetal acceleration), and engineering design (where acceleration limits determine system integrity). This comprehensive understanding of centripetal acceleration provides the foundation for analyzing diverse phenomena from artificial gravity in space stations to the operation of particle accelerators, demonstrating the profound unity of rotational dynamics across scales from everyday objects to celestial bodies."
