  "summary": "Fluid mechanics synthesis involves integrating multiple principles—continuity, Bernoulli, buoyancy, and conservation laws—to solve complex real-world problems. This requires analyzing systems with integrated continuity-Bernoulli relationships in multi-component networks, combining static and dynamic effects in moving boundary problems, and applying these principles to advanced engineering design and optimization across various domains. Successful synthesis demands systematic problem-solving strategies: identifying all relevant principles and constraints, setting up appropriate mathematical formulations, solving often complex equation systems, and verifying solutions through conservation checks and physical reasoning. Real-world applications span water supply systems, aircraft design, chemical processes, energy conversion, and biomedical devices, where practical constraints, economic factors, safety requirements, and performance objectives must all be balanced. Through this synthetic approach, fundamental fluid mechanics principles become powerful tools for designing, analyzing, and optimizing the complex fluid systems that underpin modern technology and infrastructure."
