  "summary": "Advanced buoyancy problems extend Archimedes' principle to complex scenarios involving multiple fluids, constraints, and accelerating systems. In multi-fluid environments, the total buoyant force equals the sum of contributions from each fluid layer: $F_b = \\sum \\rho_i g V_{disp,i}$, with objects floating at interfaces when $\\rho_1 < \\rho_{object} < \\rho_2$. Constrained systems require detailed force analysis, with tension in supporting strings given by $T = W - F_b$ and normal forces at container contact $N = W - F_b$. In accelerating reference frames, buoyancy analysis uses effective gravity $\\vec{g}_{eff} = \\vec{g} - \\vec{a}$, though the submerged fraction remains independent of vertical acceleration since both weight and buoyant force scale with $g_{eff}$. Rotating systems induce centrifugal effects that tilt fluid surfaces, with buoyant forces always acting perpendicular to the effective fluid surface. These advanced principles enable analysis of real-world systems from ships maneuvering in waves to aircraft fuel management and spacecraft fluid dynamics, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of Archimedes' fundamental insight across diverse physical scenarios."
