  "summary": "The continuity equation expresses conservation of mass in fluid flow, stating that for incompressible flow $A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$ and for compressible flow $\\rho_1A_1v_1 = \\rho_2A_2v_2$. This fundamental principle relates flow velocity inversely to cross-sectional area, causing fluid to accelerate in constrictions and decelerate in expansions. Volume flow rate $Q = Av$ and mass flow rate $\\dot{m} = \\rho Av$ remain constant along a streamline for steady flow. The equation extends to complex configurations including branching systems where $\\sum Q_{in} = \\sum Q_{out}$, converging flows, and networks with multiple streams. Advanced applications address compressible gases where density variations affect the flow, unsteady conditions with time dependence, and practical engineering systems requiring optimized flow distribution. Through these diverse applications, the continuity equation provides the essential foundation for analyzing and designing fluid flow systems across engineering, environmental, and biological domains."
