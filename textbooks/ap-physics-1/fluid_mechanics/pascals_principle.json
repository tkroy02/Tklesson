  "summary": "Pascal's principle states that pressure applied to a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid, mathematically expressed as $P_1 = P_2$ or equivalently $F_1/A_1 = F_2/A_2$. This fundamental principle enables hydraulic systems to provide mechanical advantage through area ratios, with $MA = A_2/A_1 = F_2/F_1$, allowing small input forces to generate large output forces. However, this force multiplication comes with a distance trade-off governed by work conservation: $F_1d_1 = F_2d_2$, meaning the input piston must move much farther than the output piston. Real hydraulic systems achieve $80-95\\%$ efficiency, with losses arising from fluid friction, mechanical friction, and leakage. Advanced applications include multi-stage systems where total mechanical advantage multiplies across stages, and diverse real-world implementations from automotive brakes to industrial presses, all relying on the elegant pressure transmission described by Pascal's principle to transform and transmit forces efficiently through confined fluid systems."
