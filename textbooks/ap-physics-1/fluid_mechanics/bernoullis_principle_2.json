  "summary": "Advanced applications of Bernoulli's principle extend across numerous engineering domains, providing essential tools for system design and analysis. In aerodynamics, Bernoulli explains lift generation through pressure differentials on wings and control surfaces, with practical calculations for lift forces and stall speeds. Flow measurement devices including Venturi meters, orifice plates, and Pitot tubes utilize the pressure-velocity relationship to determine flow rates and velocities with various accuracy and application characteristics. Complex engineering systems integrate Bernoulli's principle with other physical laws: hydraulic networks combine continuity and energy conservation for pipe system design, multi-phase systems address complex fluid interactions, and energy conversion devices like pumps and turbines apply modified Bernoulli relationships with efficiency considerations. These advanced applications demonstrate Bernoulli's principle as a fundamental tool in engineering design, enabling the analysis and optimization of diverse fluid systems while accounting for real-world complexities including viscosity, turbulence, multi-phase interactions, and practical design constraints across aerospace, chemical, environmental, and biomedical engineering domains."
