Force Resolution: Weight vector: always vertical downward; Parallel component: mg sinθ (causes acceleration down incline); Perpendicular component: mg cosθ (pressed into surface); These replace simple mg in horizontal problems. Normal Force: Perpendicular to surface; Magnitude depends on perpendicular forces; On frictionless incline: N = mg cosθ; With additional forces: N = mg cosθ ± other perpendicular components; Always less than weight (except at 0°). Trigonometric Relationships: sinθ = opposite/hypotenuse (parallel component); cosθ = adjacent/hypotenuse (perpendicular component); tanθ = sinθ/cosθ = parallel/perpendicular components; Angle θ measured from horizontal. Motion Equations: Newton's Second Law in tilted coordinates: ΣF_x = ma_x, ΣF_y = ma_y; Typically a_y = 0 (no motion perpendicular to surface); a_x determined by net parallel forces; Frictionless case: a = g sinθ down incline. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1) Choose tilted coordinates; 2) Draw FBD with resolved weight; 3) Write Newton's Second Law in both directions; 4) Solve for unknowns; 5) Interpret results physically. Special Cases: Horizontal surface (θ = 0°): normal force = mg, no parallel component; Vertical surface (θ = 90°): normal force = 0, parallel component = mg; Critical angles where motion begins. Real-World Applications: Ramps and loading docks; Mountain roads and highways; Roof pitch calculations; Playground slides; Conveyor systems; Geological slopes.",

Kinetic Friction: Resists motion once sliding occurs; Constant magnitude: f_k = μ_kN = μ_kmg cosθ; Direction: opposite to velocity relative to surface; Typically μ_k < μ_s. Critical Angle Concept: Angle where object just begins to slide under gravity alone; Condition: mg sinθ = μ_smg cosθ; Therefore: tanθ_critical = μ_s; For θ < θ_critical: object remains at rest; For θ > θ_critical: object accelerates down. Motion Down Incline: With kinetic friction: net force = mg sinθ - μ_kmg cosθ; Acceleration: a = g(sinθ - μ_k cosθ); If μ_k > tanθ, object won't slide or will slow if given push. Motion Up Incline: Pushing object up incline; Friction opposes motion (down incline); Net force = F_applied - mg sinθ - μ_kmg cosθ; More force needed than on level surface. Equilibrium Conditions: Object at rest on incline; Static friction balances parallel component: f_s = mg sinθ; This is possible only if mg sinθ ≤ μ_smg cosθ, i.e., tanθ ≤ μ_s; Multiple equilibrium states possible with additional forces.

  "summary": "Inclined planes require analyzing forces in tilted coordinate systems where gravity resolves into parallel and perpendicular components. The parallel component causes acceleration down the incline, while the perpendicular component determines the normal force. Friction plays a crucial role in determining whether objects remain stationary or slide, with the critical angle (tanθ = μ_s) marking the transition. Advanced applications include connected systems, pulley arrangements, and energy-based approaches. These concepts find extensive applications in transportation, construction, and mechanical design where sloped surfaces are encountered."
