  "summary": "Advanced friction problems involve complex multi-surface systems, circular motion scenarios, and energy-based approaches. Multi-surface analysis determines which interfaces slip first and how forces transmit through connected systems. Circular motion applications include banked curves where friction combines with normal force components to provide centripetal force. Energy methods offer powerful alternatives to force analysis, particularly for distance and speed calculations. These advanced concepts find extensive applications in vehicle dynamics, mechanical design, and safety engineering, requiring sophisticated analytical and sometimes numerical approaches for complete solutions."
