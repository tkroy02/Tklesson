Trajectory Equation (Path): Eliminate time from parametric equations: t = x/vₓ₀ (for x₀ = 0); Substitute into y(t): y = (v_y₀/vₓ₀)x - (g/(2vₓ₀²))x²; Express in terms of launch angle: y = x tanθ - (gx²)/(2v₀²cos²θ); This is a parabolic equation: y = Ax - Bx². Key Motion Parameters: Time of flight (T): when projectile returns to initial height; For level ground: T = (2v₀sinθ)/g; Maximum height (H): when v_y = 0; H = (v₀²sin²θ)/(2g); Range (R): horizontal distance at time of flight; R = (v₀²sin2θ)/g. Symmetry Properties: Time up = time down (for symmetrical launch); Speed at same height equal; Launch angle θ and impact angle φ related; Horizontal positions symmetric about maximum height. Velocity Relationships: Speed at any point: v = √(vₓ² + v_y²); Direction: φ = tan⁻¹(v_y/vₓ); Impact velocity equals launch velocity (magnitude) for level ground; Vertical velocity component reverses sign at same height. Energy Considerations: Total mechanical energy conserved (ignoring air resistance); Kinetic energy converted to potential energy and back; Speed minimum at maximum height; Vertical motion follows energy conservation. Special Cases: Horizontal launch: θ = 0°, v_y₀ = 0; Vertical launch: θ = 90°, pure 1D motion; Optimal range: θ = 45° for maximum range on level ground.",

Target Hitting Accuracy: Given target position, find launch conditions; Two angles give same range (complementary angles); Choice depends on obstacles, timing, or other constraints; Accuracy requirements determine acceptable parameter ranges. Energy Efficiency: Minimum launch speed to reach target; Optimal angle for minimum energy expenditure; Trade-off between speed and angle; Energy conservation applications. Sports Applications: Basketball: shooting angles and backboard use; Baseball/softball: batting angles and projectile range; Golf: club selection and swing optimization; Football: passing trajectories and receiver positioning; Tennis: serve angles and shot placement. Engineering Applications: Water jets and fountains: nozzle design and pressure requirements; Particle separators: trajectory-based sorting; Construction: material launching and placement; Safety: falling object protection and barrier design. Military and Aerospace: Artillery: range tables and firing solutions; Missile guidance: interception trajectories; Spacecraft: re-entry angles and landing precision; Satellite deployment: orbital insertion parameters. Entertainment Applications: Fireworks: burst heights and patterns; Theme park rides: projectile motion elements; Movie special effects: realistic projectile trajectories; Video games: physics engine development.

The trajectory forms a perfect parabola under ideal conditions, with key parameters including range, maximum height, and time of flight. Advanced scenarios involve elevated launches, angled impacts, and obstacle clearance, while optimization problems seek the best launch conditions for specific objectives. These principles find extensive applications in sports, engineering, military, and entertainment fields, making projectile motion a fundamental concept in AP Physics 1 with broad practical significance."
