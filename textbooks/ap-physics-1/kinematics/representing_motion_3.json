Constant acceleration produces rectangular areas, changing acceleration produces complex shapes, and the cumulative area calculation with initial conditions enables conversion to velocity-time and position-time graphs. These techniques provide powerful tools for analyzing complex real-world motions and form the foundation for calculus-based kinematics in AP Physics 1."
