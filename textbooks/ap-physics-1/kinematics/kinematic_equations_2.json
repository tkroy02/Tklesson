Connected Systems: Objects connected by ropes, rods, or constraints; Motion constraints relate their kinematics; Constant distance or fixed relationships; Examples: pulley systems, connected vehicles, mechanical linkages. Multi-Stage Multi-Object Problems: Objects with different motion phases; Phase changes affect relationships; Boundary conditions between phases; Time synchronization crucial; Examples: relay races, staged missions. Coordinate System Strategies: Use same coordinate system for all objects; Choose origin to simplify equations; Consider moving reference frames; Use relative coordinates when beneficial.
