  "summary": "Velocity-time graphs provide comprehensive motion information where slopes represent acceleration and areas represent displacement. Straight lines indicate constant acceleration, curved lines indicate changing acceleration, and horizontal lines indicate constant velocity. The area under the curve gives displacement, with signed areas accounting for direction changes. These graphical analysis techniques enable complete motion description and form the foundation for solving complex kinematics problems in AP Physics 1."
