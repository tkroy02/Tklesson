Coordinate Systems: Cartesian (rectangular) coordinates: x and y axes; Polar coordinates: magnitude and direction; Choice depends on problem context; Cartesian most useful for kinematics.

Vector Addition: Components add independently: Rₓ = Aₓ + Bₓ, R_y = A_y + B_y; Resultant magnitude: R = √(Rₓ² + R_y²); Resultant direction: θ_R = tan⁻¹(R_y/Rₓ); More accurate than graphical methods. Vector Subtraction: Change components signs: Rₓ = Aₓ - Bₓ, R_y = A_y - B_y; Equivalent to adding negative vector; Important for relative motion. Magnitude and Direction: Magnitude (length): v = √(vₓ² + v_y²); Always positive; Direction: θ = tan⁻¹(v_y/vₓ); Consider quadrant for correct angle; Use reference angles.

Component Equations: Horizontal: x(t) = x₀ + vₓ₀t; vₓ(t) = vₓ₀ (constant); aₓ = 0; Vertical: y(t) = y₀ + v_y₀t - ½gt²; v_y(t) = v_y₀ - gt; a_y = -g. Key Parameters: Initial speed: v₀; Launch angle: θ; Components: vₓ₀ = v₀ cosθ, v_y₀ = v₀ sinθ; Time of flight: when projectile returns to launch height; Maximum height: when v_y = 0; Range: horizontal distance at time of flight. Symmetrical Motion (Level Ground): Launch and landing at same height; Time up = time down; Trajectory symmetric about peak; Maximum range at 45° launch angle; Range equation: R = (v₀² sin2θ)/g. Elevated Launch/Landing: Different initial and final heights; Asymmetrical trajectory; Different ascent and descent times; Modified range equations; Impact velocity different from launch velocity. Optimization Problems: Maximum range for given speed; Maximum height constraints; Clearing obstacles; Hitting targets; Minimum launch speed problems. Real-World Considerations: Air resistance effects; Wind influences; Spin effects; Non-constant g at large scales; Coriolis effects for long range.

  "summary": "Two-dimensional motion is analyzed by decomposing vectors into perpendicular components and applying 1D kinematics independently to each component. Vector decomposition uses trigonometric functions to break magnitude and direction into x and y components. Component-wise kinematics treats x and y motions as independent, with time as the common parameter. Projectile motion exemplifies 2D kinematics with constant horizontal velocity and constant vertical acceleration due to gravity. These techniques provide the foundation for analyzing all types of motion in multiple dimensions in AP Physics 1."
