  "summary": "Gravitational potential energy, defined as $U_g = -\\frac{GMm}{r}$ with zero reference at infinity, provides the foundation for understanding orbital mechanics and space mission planning. Orbital energy analysis reveals that bound systems have negative total energy ($E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r}$ for circular orbits), while escape requires zero energy ($v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$). Practical applications include Hohmann transfers for efficient orbit changes, rocket equation calculations for propellant requirements ($\\Delta v = v_e \\ln\\frac{m_0}{m_f}$), and gravity assist maneuvers for energy-efficient interplanetary travel. These principles enable the design and execution of complex space missions, from satellite deployments to planetary exploration, while demonstrating the elegant energy conservation that governs all gravitational motion."
