Ellipse Geometry: Semi-major axis (a): half the longest diameter; Semi-minor axis (b): half the shortest diameter; Foci (plural of focus): two fixed points; Focal distance (c): distance from center to focus; Eccentricity: $e = \\frac{c}{a}$ (0 = circle, 0<e<1 = ellipse, e=1 = parabola). Key Orbital Points: Perihelion: closest approach to Sun; Aphelion: farthest distance from Sun; Relationships: $r_{peri} = a(1-e)$, $r_{aph} = a(1+e)$; Average distance: $r_{avg} = a$. Historical Significance: Replaced Ptolemaic circular orbits with epicycles; Based on Tycho Brahe's precise observational data; First major departure from ancient Greek astronomy; Foundation for Newton's work on gravity. Solar System Examples: Mercury: e = 0.206 (most elliptical); Venus: e = 0.007 (nearly circular); Earth: e = 0.017; Pluto: e = 0.244 (highly elliptical); Most planets have small eccentricities. Physical Interpretation: Result of inverse-square gravitational force; Explains observed planetary positions; Predicts seasonal variations in solar heating; Basis for accurate astronomical predictions. Modern Applications: Exoplanet orbit characterization; Comet and asteroid trajectory prediction; Spacecraft orbital design; Binary star system analysis.",

These laws, derived empirically from Tycho Brahe's observations and later explained by Newton's gravitation, enable mass determination of celestial objects, prediction of orbital characteristics, and analysis of diverse systems from planets to binary stars. Modern applications span exoplanet discovery, spacecraft navigation, and galactic dynamics, demonstrating the enduring power of Kepler's insights in contemporary astronomy and space exploration."
