Key Properties: Universal: applies to all masses everywhere; Conservative: path-independent, potential energy well-defined; Inverse-square: strength decreases with square of distance; Weakest fundamental force but dominates at large scales. Spherical Mass Theorem: Uniform spherical shell: no net gravitational force inside; Solid sphere: external gravitational field identical to point mass at center; Important for planetary applications. Superposition Principle: Net gravitational force = vector sum of individual forces; Multiple masses: $\\vec{F}_{net} = \\sum \\vec{F}_i$; Essential for complex systems. Gravitational Constant G: Measured by Cavendish experiment (1798); Very small value explains why we don't notice gravity between everyday objects; Fundamental constant of nature. Applications: Planetary motion and orbits; Tidal forces; Gravitational field calculations; Satellite dynamics; Astrophysics and cosmology. Problem-Solving Approach: 1) Identify all masses and distances; 2) Apply $F_g = G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$ for each pair; 3) Use vector addition for multiple masses; 4) Consider spherical symmetry where applicable; 5) Solve for unknown quantities.",

  "summary": "Universal gravitation describes the fundamental attractive force between all masses, governed by Newton's Law: $F_g = G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$. Gravitational fields ($g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}$) provide a powerful framework for understanding how mass influences surrounding space. Orbital motion represents a balance between gravitational attraction and inertia, with circular orbits following $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$ and $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}$. Key applications include satellite systems (geostationary orbits at 35,800 km altitude), space exploration, and understanding planetary motion. These principles form the foundation for modern space technology, planetary science, and our understanding of cosmic structure from satellite orbits to galactic dynamics."
