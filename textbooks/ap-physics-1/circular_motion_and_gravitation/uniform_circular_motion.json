Amusement Park Rides: Loop-the-loops: vertical circles with safety factors; Rotor rides: friction and normal forces; Swing rides: conical pendulum principles; Roller coasters: energy conservation with circular elements.

Centrifuges and Rotating Devices: High angular velocities; Large centripetal accelerations; Separation by density; Medical and industrial applications; Ultracentrifuges for biology.

  "summary": "Uniform circular motion involves objects moving in circular paths at constant speed, requiring centripetal acceleration directed toward the center. This acceleration results from a net centripetal force provided by various forces like tension, friction, normal force, or gravity. Key relationships include a_c = v²/r = ω²r, v = rω, and T = 2π/ω. Applications span from vehicle dynamics on curves to orbital motion, with important concepts including banked curves, vertical circles with minimum speed requirements, and apparent weight effects in rotating systems. Mastery of uniform circular motion provides foundation for understanding rotational dynamics and celestial mechanics."
