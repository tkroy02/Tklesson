Cars on Flat Curves: Simplest horizontal circle scenario; Only friction provides centripetal force; $\\mu_s mg = \\frac{mv^2}{r} \\Rightarrow v_{max} = \\sqrt{\\mu_s gr}$; No banking assistance; Common on local roads. Multiple Object Systems: Different masses at different radii; Each has own maximum angular speed; Object with largest $r$ slides first; $\\omega_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_s g}{r_{max}}}$ for system; Tension or normal forces may connect objects. Real-World Considerations: Road conditions affect $\\mu_s$; Wet vs dry pavement differences; Vehicle weight distribution; Tire quality and pressure; Safety margins in design. Problem-Solving Framework: 1) Identify all objects and radii; 2) Determine force providers; 3) Apply $f_{max} = \\mu_s N$ for each object; 4) Set $f = m\\omega^2 r$ for centripetal requirement; 5) Find limiting case (first object to slide); 6) Calculate critical speeds; 7) Consider connections between objects.
