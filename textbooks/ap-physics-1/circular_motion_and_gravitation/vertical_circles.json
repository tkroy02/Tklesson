Practical applications span roller coaster design (using clothoid loops for constant g-forces), amusement ride engineering, and various structural systems. Safety considerations include human tolerance limits (4-6g maximum), appropriate safety factors (2-10×), and careful design to maintain structural integrity while providing exciting user experiences.
