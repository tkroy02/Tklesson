Perfectly Inelastic Collisions: Maximum kinetic energy loss; Objects stick together; Common final velocity; $K_f$ minimum for given momentum; Examples: bullet embedding, railroad cars coupling.

Momentum Conservation: Still applies: m₁v₁i + m₂v₂i = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f; Combined with restitution equation gives complete solution. Energy Relationships: Kinetic energy not conserved; $K_f = K_i - Q$ where Q > 0; Q = energy converted to other forms; Maximum Q when e=0. General Solution Method: Two equations: momentum conservation + restitution definition; Solve simultaneously; Works for all e values; General formulas possible but complex. Special Case: Stationary target (v₂i=0): e = -v₁f/v₁i (for 1D); v₁f = -e·v₁i; Energy loss fraction depends on masses and e. Energy Loss Calculation: For given e and masses, can calculate exact energy loss; Maximum when m₁ = m₂ and e=0; Zero when e=1.

  "summary": "Collision analysis distinguishes between elastic collisions (conserving both momentum and kinetic energy) and inelastic collisions (conserving only momentum). The coefficient of restitution quantifies collision elasticity, with e=1 for perfectly elastic and e=0 for perfectly inelastic collisions. One-dimensional elastic collisions have complete analytical solutions using both conservation laws, while inelastic collisions require the restitution equation combined with momentum conservation. Real-world collisions typically have 0<e<1, with energy losses to deformation, heat, and sound. Mastery of these concepts enables analysis of diverse collision scenarios from sports impacts to vehicle crashes."
