  "summary": "Perfectly inelastic collisions, where objects stick together after impact, represent the maximum energy dissipation case while conserving momentum. These collisions are characterized by a common final velocity equal to the mass-weighted average of initial velocities. Ballistic pendulum applications combine perfectly inelastic collisions with pendulum motion to measure projectile velocities. Multi-object systems extend these principles to complex scenarios like vehicle pileups and particle aggregation. Real-world applications span automotive safety, industrial processes, forensic analysis, and astronomical phenomena, making perfectly inelastic collision analysis crucial across physics and engineering disciplines."
