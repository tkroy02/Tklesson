Relative Velocity: v₁i - v₂i = -(v₁f - v₂f) (vector equation); Relative speed constant, direction reversed; Useful geometric constraint. Stationary Target Analysis: v₂i = 0 simplifies equations; Common in scattering experiments; Final directions related to impact parameter; Energy: v₁i² = v₁f² + (m₂/m₁)v₂f². Coordinate System Choice: Often choose coordinates to simplify; Align one axis with initial relative velocity; Use laboratory frame or CM frame; Strategic choice reduces complexity. Geometric Interpretation: Momentum vectors form closed polygon; Energy constraint defines relationship between speeds; Visual methods helpful for understanding. Problem-Solving Approach: 1) Write all conservation equations; 2) Choose convenient coordinate system; 3) Use geometric constraints if available; 4) Solve system systematically; 5) Verify energy conservation.
