  "summary": "The motion of the center of mass follows elegant physical laws where the CM accelerates according to the net external force divided by total mass, regardless of complex internal motions. In isolated systems, the CM moves with constant velocity, providing powerful conservation principles for analyzing collisions, explosions, and multi-body dynamics. Advanced applications extend to variable mass systems like rockets, astronomical systems like binary stars, and complex engineering and biological systems. The center of mass frame often provides simplified analysis, particularly for collision problems. Mastery of CM motion concepts enables solving complex physical problems across classical mechanics, astrophysics, engineering, and modern physics."
