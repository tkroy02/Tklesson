CM Reference Frame: Coordinate system moving with CM; Often simplifies collision problems; In CM frame, total momentum = 0; Symmetric solutions common. Explosion Analysis: CM remains at original trajectory; Fragments move relative to CM; Vector sum of fragment momenta = 0 in CM frame; CM continues unaffected. Multi-Particle Systems: CM provides organizational framework; Can analyze complex systems as single entity; Useful for extended objects; Applications to rigid body dynamics. Problem-Solving Advantages: CM motion often simple even when parts complex; Provides check on solutions; Useful for incomplete information problems; Connects to other physics areas.
