CM Acceleration: $\\vec{a}_{CM} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum m_i\\vec{a}_i = \\frac{\\vec{F}_{net,ext}}{M}$; Determined only by external forces; Internal forces cancel in pairs. Motion Theorem: CM moves as if all mass concentrated there and all external forces applied there; Powerful simplification of complex systems. Isolated Systems: If $\\vec{F}_{net,ext} = 0$, then $\\vec{v}_{CM}$ constant; CM moves with constant velocity; Internal motions don't affect CM trajectory. Collision Applications: In any collision (isolated system), CM velocity unchanged; Useful reference frame for analysis; CM frame often simplifies mathematics. Explosion Scenarios: Fragments fly in all directions; CM continues original trajectory; Vector sum of fragment momenta = 0 in CM frame; Conservation of CM motion. Rocket Motion: Variable mass system; CM still follows $\\vec{F}_{ext} = M\\vec{a}_{CM}$; Thrust is internal force; Gravity external.

  "summary": "The center of mass represents the average position of mass distribution in a system, following simple motion determined by net external forces while internal forces cancel out. For discrete systems, CM is calculated as a mass-weighted average of positions, while continuous objects require integration. Symmetric objects often have CM at obvious geometric centers. The CM motion theorem states that the center of mass moves as if all mass were concentrated there and all external forces applied there, providing powerful simplifications for analyzing collisions, explosions, rocket motion, and complex multi-body systems. These concepts find applications across physics, engineering, sports science, and many other fields where system dynamics must be understood and optimized."
