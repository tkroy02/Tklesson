  "summary": "Momentum and impulse provide fundamental tools for analyzing motion changes and force interactions. Momentum (p=mv) quantifies motion as a vector quantity, while impulse (J=FΔt) describes how forces change momentum over time through the impulse-momentum theorem. These concepts find wide applications in safety engineering, sports analysis, propulsion systems, and collision investigation. Understanding the vector nature of momentum, the force-time relationship in impulse, and systematic problem-solving approaches enables analysis of complex real-world scenarios and design of safer, more efficient systems."
