Physical Interpretation: Work = energy transferred to/from object; Positive work: force adds energy to object; Negative work: force removes energy from object; Zero work: no energy transfer. Special Cases: Force parallel to displacement (θ = 0°): $W = Fd$ (maximum work); Force perpendicular to displacement (θ = 90°): $W = 0$ (no work); Force opposite displacement (θ = 180°): $W = -Fd$ (negative work). Units and Dimensions: Joule (J) = Newton-meter (N·m); 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s²; Everyday context: lifting apple 1 meter ≈ 1 J. Multiple Forces: Net work = sum of work by individual forces; $W_{net} = \\sum W_i = \\sum \\vec{F}_i \\cdot \\vec{d}$; Can also find net force first then calculate work. Work Against Gravity: Lifting objects: $W = mgh$ (against gravity); Lowering objects: $W = -mgh$ (gravity does work); Only vertical displacement matters for gravitational work.

  "summary": "Work is defined as energy transfer through the action of forces, calculated as $W = Fd\\cos\\theta$ for constant forces. The work-energy theorem ($W_{net} = \\Delta K$) connects forces to kinetic energy changes, providing powerful problem-solving tools. Power quantifies the rate of work done ($P = W/t = Fv$), with applications ranging from vehicle performance to human physiology. These concepts form the foundation for understanding energy transformations in mechanical systems, analyzing efficiency, and designing practical engineering solutions. Mastery of work and energy principles enables prediction and optimization of system performance across diverse real-world applications."
