Energy Transformation Sequences: Complex sequences possible; Example: spring PE → KE → gravitational PE → KE → spring PE; Total energy constant throughout. Force Superposition: Conservative forces add independently; Work done by each is path-independent; Total work = sum of individual works; Energy conservation holds for sum. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1) Identify all conservative forces; 2) Write complete energy equation; 3) Choose reference points; 4) Account for all energy forms; 5) Solve systematically; 6) Verify energy transformations.
