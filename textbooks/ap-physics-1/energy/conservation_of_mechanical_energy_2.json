System Isolation: Energy conservation applies to isolated systems; No external work done; System boundary definition important; Energy can transform but not disappear. Energy Transformations: Kinetic ↔ potential energy; Different forms of potential energy; Total remains constant; Energy bar charts visualize transformations. Problem-Solving Advantages: Often simpler than Newton's Laws; No need for acceleration or time information; Works for complex paths; Provides energy perspective. Verification Methods: Check that only conservative forces act; Verify energy transformations make physical sense; Compare with alternative methods; Check dimensional consistency. Applications: Projectile motion; Pendulums; Spring systems; Orbital motion; Inclined planes; Many mechanics problems.",

Geometrically Constrained Motion: Objects moving on prescribed paths; Examples: roller coasters, pendulum with string, beads on wires; Normal forces do no work; Energy conservation still applies. Multiple Energy Forms: Systems with translational, rotational, and multiple potential energies; $E = K_{trans} + K_{rot} + U_{grav} + U_{spring}$; Each form can transform independently; Total remains constant. Rotational Energy Inclusion: Rolling objects: $K_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{CM}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\\omega^2$; Rolling without slipping: $v_{CM} = R\\omega$; Energy conservation includes both terms. Conservative Field Motion: Motion in gravitational, electric fields; Potential energy defined for field; Path independence; Work done independent of path. Energy Optimization: Finding paths that minimize/maximize certain energies; Principle of least action; Applications to orbital transfers, mechanical design. Verification and Analysis: Energy bar charts for visualization; Computer simulations; Comparison with experimental data; Sensitivity analysis.

  "summary": "Mechanical energy conservation ($K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$) provides powerful problem-solving tools for systems with only conservative forces. This principle allows analysis of motion without detailed force calculations, often simplifying complex problems. Key applications include projectile motion, pendulum systems, inclined planes, roller coasters, and orbital mechanics. Advanced applications involve multi-stage energy transformations, geometrically constrained motion, and systems with multiple energy forms including rotational kinetic energy. Energy conservation methods offer significant advantages over force-based approaches for many problems, providing physical insight into energy transformations while often requiring less mathematical complexity. Mastery of these concepts enables efficient analysis of diverse mechanical systems across physics and engineering applications."
