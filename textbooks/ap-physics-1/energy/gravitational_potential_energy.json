Near planetary surfaces, the approximation $\\Delta U_g \\approx mgh$ is useful for small height changes. Energy conservation enables elegant solutions to orbital problems, with circular orbits satisfying $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r}$ and escape requiring $E \\geq 0$ ($v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$). Advanced applications include multi-body systems where total energy sums pairwise interactions, gravitational potential fields, tidal energy transfers, and astrophysical phenomena. These principles are essential for space mission planning, understanding celestial mechanics, and analyzing complex gravitational systems from planetary scales to galactic dynamics."
