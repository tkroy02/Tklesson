Kinetic Energy and Momentum: Relationship: $K = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$; Both describe motion but different properties; Momentum always conserved in isolated systems; KE conserved only in elastic collisions. Collision Analysis: Elastic collision: both momentum and KE conserved; Inelastic collision: momentum conserved, KE not conserved; Perfectly inelastic: maximum KE loss; Coefficient of restitution relates to KE conservation. Rotational Kinetic Energy: $K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$; I = moment of inertia; For rolling objects: $K_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{CM}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_{CM}\\omega^2$; Different distribution than pure translation.

Kinetic energy depends on the reference frame, is always non-negative, and relates to momentum through $K = p^2/2m$. Advanced concepts include analyzing kinetic energy in center of mass frames ($K_{total} = K_{CM} + K_{internal}$), understanding energy transformations in collisions, and applying relativistic corrections for high-speed objects. These principles enable sophisticated analysis of mechanical systems, from everyday motion to particle physics, providing powerful tools for understanding and predicting physical behavior across diverse applications."
