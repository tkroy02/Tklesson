Seismometers: Pendulum detects ground motion; Relative movement between mass and ground; Measure earthquake waves; Different pendulum orientations detect different wave types. Foucault Pendulum: Demonstrates Earth's rotation; Plane of oscillation rotates; Rate depends on latitude: 15°/hour × sin(latitude); Classic demonstration. Damped Pendulums: Real pendulums lose energy; Amplitude decreases exponentially; Quality factor Q measures damping; Critical damping stops oscillation fastest. Driven Pendulums: External force applied; Resonance when driving frequency = natural frequency; Large amplitude response; Parametric driving possible. Nonlinear Dynamics: Large amplitudes: period increases; Exact solution involves elliptic integrals; Complex motion patterns. Chaotic Pendulums: Double pendulums; Sensitive dependence on initial conditions; Unpredictable long-term behavior; Classic chaos demonstration. Torsional Pendulums: Rotational oscillation; τ = -κθ; T = 2π√(I/κ); Different from gravity-based pendulums.

Physical pendulums with distributed mass require moment of inertia analysis with T = 2π√(I/mgd). Real pendulums exhibit damping, can be driven to resonance, and may show chaotic behavior in complex configurations like double pendulums. Applications span timekeeping, gravitational measurement, seismology, and educational demonstrations, making pendulums both practically important and theoretically rich systems for studying oscillatory dynamics."
