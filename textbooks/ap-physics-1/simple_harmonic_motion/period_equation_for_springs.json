Damping Effects: Light damping: period almost unchanged; ω' = √(ω₀² - (b/2m)²) ≈ ω₀ for small b; Heavy damping changes period significantly. Experimental Methods: Measure T for different m; Plot T² vs m; Slope = 4π²/k; y-intercept related to spring mass. Non-Ideal Springs: Real springs have mass; k may not be constant at large amplitudes; Elastic limits; Hysteresis effects. Reduced Mass: For two masses connected by spring; μ = m₁m₂/(m₁ + m₂); T = 2π√(μ/k). Applications: Car suspensions; Laboratory experiments; Measuring instruments; Vibration isolation; Musical instruments; Seismic protection. Precision Measurements: Use multiple cycles for timing; Reduce experimental error; Statistical analysis of data; Account for systematic errors. Energy Methods: For complex systems; Equate maximum potential and kinetic energy; Often simpler than force analysis. Quality Factor: Q = ω₀/Δω; Related to damping; High Q means low damping and sharp resonance.",

  "summary": "The period equation T = 2π√(m/k) fundamentally describes spring-mass oscillators, with period depending only on mass and spring constant, independent of amplitude for ideal systems. Multiple spring configurations require calculation of effective spring constants (series: softer, parallel: stiffer), while real systems need corrections for spring mass (m_eff = m + m_spring/3). Experimental methods using T² vs m graphs provide accurate determination of spring constants, and the period equation applies to diverse applications from vehicle suspensions to precision instruments. Understanding these relationships enables prediction and design of oscillatory behavior across physics and engineering contexts."
