Special Values: At x = ±A: a = ∓ω²A (maximum magnitude); At x = 0: a = 0; Proportional to -x always. Graphical Analysis: All three functions sinusoidal; Different amplitudes; Phase shifts: position (reference), velocity (+90°), acceleration (+180°).

Position follows x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ), velocity is its derivative v(t) = -ωA sin(ωt + φ), and acceleration is a(t) = -ω²A cos(ωt + φ) = -ω²x(t). Key relationships include: velocity leads position by 90°, acceleration leads position by 180° (is always opposite to displacement), maximum speed v_max = ωA occurs at equilibrium, and maximum acceleration a_max = ω²A occurs at the extremes. These relationships form a complete kinematic description that applies to all simple harmonic oscillators regardless of their specific physical implementation."
