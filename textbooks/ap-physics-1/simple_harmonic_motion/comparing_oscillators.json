  "summary": "Oscillators exhibit profound mathematical unity while maintaining important physical differences. All simple harmonic oscillators obey the universal equation d²x/dt² + ω²x = 0 with sinusoidal solutions and continuous energy transformation between kinetic and potential forms. However, they differ in restoring mechanisms (elastic, gravitational, torsional, electromagnetic), parameter dependencies, practical limitations, and optimal applications. Spring-mass systems excel where linear restoration and energy absorption are needed, pendulums provide gravity-dependent timing, torsional systems offer precise rotational oscillations, and LC circuits achieve high frequencies for electronics. Understanding both the mathematical unity and physical distinctions enables optimal selection and design of oscillatory systems across physics, engineering, and technology applications."
