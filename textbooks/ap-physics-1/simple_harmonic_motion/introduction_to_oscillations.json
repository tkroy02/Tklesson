  "summary": "Oscillatory motion involves repetitive movement about equilibrium characterized by period, frequency, amplitude, and phase. Simple harmonic motion represents the idealized case with sinusoidal displacement and specific mathematical relationships. Various physical systems including spring-mass oscillators, pendulums, and electrical circuits exhibit oscillatory behavior with applications spanning timekeeping, engineering, music, and biological rhythms. Understanding oscillation fundamentals provides the basis for analyzing diverse periodic phenomena across physics."
