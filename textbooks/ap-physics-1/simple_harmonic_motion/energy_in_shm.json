  "summary": "Energy conservation is fundamental to understanding simple harmonic motion, with total mechanical energy E = ½kA² remaining constant in ideal systems while continuously transforming between kinetic and potential forms. Spring-mass systems exchange elastic potential energy with kinetic energy, while pendulums transform gravitational potential energy. Real systems experience damping, with energy decaying exponentially E(t) = E₀e^(-bt/m), characterized by quality factor Q. Driven systems can maintain oscillations through external energy input, with resonance occurring when driving frequency matches natural frequency. Energy methods often provide simpler solutions to oscillation problems than force-based approaches and offer deep insight into the behavior of diverse oscillating systems across physics and engineering."
