Velocity Relationship: Tangential speed v_tangential = ωA; x-component: v_x = -v_tangential sinθ = -ωA sin(ωt + φ); Matches SHM velocity.

Geometric Interpretation: Amplitude A = circle radius; Period T = time for one revolution = 2π/ω; Frequency f = 1/T = ω/2π. Energy Relationships: Total energy E = ½mω²A² = ½mv_tangential²; Kinetic energy in SHM = projection of rotational kinetic energy; Potential energy related to position. Vector Representation: Phasor of length A rotating at ω; Instantaneous projection gives SHM; Powerful for wave addition.

  "summary": "The relationship between simple harmonic motion and uniform circular motion provides profound insight into oscillatory phenomena. SHM can be exactly described as the projection of uniform circular motion, with the reference circle model giving geometric interpretation to amplitude (radius), frequency (angular speed), and phase (initial angle). Phasor diagrams and complex representations extend this analogy to provide powerful methods for analyzing multiple oscillators, wave phenomena, and coupled systems. The circular motion foundation enables understanding of normal modes in coupled systems, Lissajous figures in 2D motion, and wave propagation as phased oscillator arrays. This unified perspective reveals the fundamental mathematical unity underlying diverse oscillatory systems across physics, from mechanical vibrations to electromagnetic waves and quantum systems."
