Energy in Vertical Systems: Total E = ½kA² (same as horizontal); Reference point for PE important; Spring PE = ½kx² (x from equilibrium); Gravitational PE = mgh. Reduced Mass: When spring has significant mass; Effective mass: m_eff = m + m_spring/3; More accurate period: T = 2π√(m_eff/k). Damped Oscillations: Real systems lose energy; Amplitude decreases exponentially; x(t) = Ae^(-bt/2m)cos(ω't + φ); ω' = √(ω² - (b/2m)²). Driven Oscillations: External force applied; Resonance when driving frequency = natural frequency; Large amplitude response. Real-World Applications: Car suspensions; Building earthquake protection; Laboratory springs; Measuring instruments; Exercise equipment. Two-Spring Systems: Mass between two springs; Effective k = k₁ + k₂ (if both stretched/compressed); Various configurations possible. Nonlinear Systems: Large amplitudes; Spring constant not constant; Complex motion patterns; Chaos possible.",

  "summary": "Spring-block systems exhibit perfect simple harmonic motion when ideal, with Hooke's law (F = -kx) providing the restoring force. The oscillation period T = 2π√(m/k) depends only on mass and spring constant, not amplitude. Energy transforms continuously between kinetic (½mv²) and potential (½kx²) forms, with total energy conserved at ½kA². Vertical springs oscillate about a gravity-shifted equilibrium but maintain the same period as horizontal configurations. Real-world applications span from vehicle suspensions to measuring instruments, with advanced considerations including spring combinations, reduced mass effects, and damping."
