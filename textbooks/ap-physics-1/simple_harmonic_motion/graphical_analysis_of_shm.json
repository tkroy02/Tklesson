Position graphs show displacement variation, velocity graphs (slope of position) lead by 90°, and acceleration graphs (slope of velocity) lead by 180°. Energy graphs display kinetic and potential energy oscillating out of phase at double the frequency of position, with total energy remaining constant for ideal systems. Graphical differentiation and integration connect these relationships, while experimental data analysis enables determination of system parameters including damping characteristics. These graphical techniques are essential for analyzing real-world oscillatory systems across physics, engineering, and scientific applications."
