Comparison with Gravity Pendulums: Different physical principle; No small-angle limitation (for ideal torsion); Period independent of gravity; Used in precision measurements. Timekeeping Applications: Grandfather clocks; Historical time measurement; Pendulum must be very stable; Temperature compensation needed. Gravitational Measurements: g = 4π²L/T²; Measure T accurately to find g; Used in geophysics; Variations detect mineral deposits. Kater's Pendulum: Reversible pendulum; Two pivot points; Adjust until periods equal; Then L_red = distance between pivots; Precise g measurement. Foucault Pendulum: Demonstrates Earth's rotation; Plane of oscillation rotates; Rate: 15°/hour × sin(latitude); Classic demonstration.

All exhibit SHM for small angles, with period independent of mass but dependent on amplitude for large oscillations. Applications span timekeeping (exploiting period constancy), gravimetry (using g = 4π²L/T²), and various scientific instruments. Understanding these relationships enables precise time measurement, gravitational field mapping, and design of oscillatory systems across physics, engineering, and technology."
