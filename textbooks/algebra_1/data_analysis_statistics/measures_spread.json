  "expanded_description": "Measures of spread (also called measures of variability or dispersion) describe how spread out or varied the data values are. While measures of central tendency tell us about the center, measures of spread tell us about the consistency, reliability, and diversity of the data. The range is the simplest measure (maximum - minimum). The interquartile range (IQR) describes the spread of the middle 50% of data and is resistant to outliers. Standard deviation measures the average distance of each data point from the mean and is the most commonly used measure in statistics. Understanding spread is essential for comparing datasets, identifying outliers, and making statistical inferences.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values. $$\\text{Range} = \\text{Max} - \\text{Min}$$<br><br>**Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The difference between the third quartile (Q3) and first quartile (Q1). $$\\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1$$ It represents the spread of the middle 50% of data.<br><br>**Standard Deviation**: A measure of how much data values deviate from the mean. For a sample: $$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$",
    
    "explanation": "Think of measures of spread as describing how much variety exists in your data. If you're looking at test scores, a small spread means everyone scored similarly; a large spread means some students aced it while others struggled. The range tells you the total span from lowest to highest. The IQR tells you about the middle half - ignoring the extremes. Standard deviation tells you, on average, how far each score is from the mean. It's like measuring the typical \"miss distance\" from the center.",

        "context": "The range is useful for a quick overview but should be used cautiously. For example, if most students score between 75-85 but one student scores 0, the range would be 85-0 = 85, which doesn't reflect typical performance.",

  "summary": "Measures of spread describe how varied or dispersed data is. The range (max - min) is simplest but sensitive to outliers. Quartiles divide data into fourths: Q1 (25th percentile), median (50th), Q3 (75th). The five-number summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max) provides a complete picture. The interquartile range (IQR = Q3 - Q1) measures the spread of the middle 50% and is resistant to outliers. Using the 1.5×IQR rule, outliers are values below Q1 - 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR. Standard deviation measures the typical distance from the mean: for a sample, $s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$. Low standard deviation means data clusters around the mean; high standard deviation means data is spread out. For symmetric distributions, the Empirical Rule states about 68% of data falls within 1 SD, 95% within 2 SD, and 99.7% within 3 SD. Choose range for quick overview, IQR for data with outliers, and standard deviation for symmetric data without outliers. Understanding spread is essential for comparing datasets and making statistical inferences.",
