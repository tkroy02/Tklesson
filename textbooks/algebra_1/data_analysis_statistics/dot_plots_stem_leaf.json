  "expanded_description": "Dot plots and stem-and-leaf plots are simple yet powerful tools for displaying small to medium-sized datasets. A dot plot shows each data point as a dot above a number line, making it easy to see clusters, gaps, and outliers. A stem-and-leaf plot organizes data by splitting each value into a \"stem\" (leading digits) and a \"leaf\" (trailing digit), creating a visual distribution while retaining all original data values. Both displays are excellent for quick exploratory analysis and are particularly useful when you want to see every data point rather than just summary statistics. They bridge the gap between raw data and more abstract visualizations like histograms and box plots.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Dot Plot**:<br>• Draw a horizontal number line covering the data range<br>• Place a dot above the number line for each data point<br>• Stack dots vertically for repeated values<br>• Reveals clusters, gaps, outliers, and distribution shape<br><br>**Stem-and-Leaf Plot**:<br>• Split each data value into stem (leading digits) and leaf (last digit)<br>• List stems vertically in order<br>• Write leaves for each stem in increasing order<br>• Creates a visual distribution while preserving all data",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a dot plot as a pile of coins on a number line - each coin is a data point, and you can see where they cluster. A stem-and-leaf plot is like organizing numbers by their first digits - it's a histogram you can read! You get the visual shape of a histogram but with every original value still there. Both are like having your cake (the big picture) and eating it too (keeping the details).",

Dot plots place a dot above a number line for each value, with stacks for repeats - ideal for small datasets and non-technical audiences. Stem-and-leaf plots split each value into stem (leading digits) and leaf (last digit), creating a visual distribution that retains all original data - better for larger datasets and when exact statistics are needed. Back-to-back stem-and-leaf plots allow direct comparison of two distributions. Key features to identify in both displays include shape, center, spread, clusters, gaps, outliers, and mode(s). When creating stem-and-leaf plots, always order leaves for each stem and include a key (e.g., 2|3 = 23). Choose dot plots for very small datasets and general audiences; choose stem-and-leaf plots for larger datasets and when you need to calculate exact statistics. Both displays are essential tools in exploratory data analysis.",
