  "expanded_description": "Conditional relative frequency extends the analysis of two-way tables by focusing on specific subsets of data. It answers questions like \"What percentage of females prefer dogs?\" or \"Among those who exercise regularly, what percentage are healthy?\" By conditioning on one variable, we can compare distributions across groups and identify associations between categorical variables. Conditional relative frequencies are essential for understanding how the distribution of one variable changes depending on the category of another variable, providing deeper insights than overall percentages alone.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Conditional relative frequency is the proportion of a specific subgroup within a larger category. Calculated as:<br><br>$$\\text{Conditional Relative Frequency} = \\frac{\\text{Joint Frequency}}{\\text{Marginal Frequency}}$$<br><br>Two types:<br><br>• **Row conditional frequency**: Condition on row category (divide by row total)<br>• **Column conditional frequency**: Condition on column category (divide by column total)<br><br>These show how one variable is distributed within a specific category of the other variable.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of conditional frequency as zooming in on a particular group and asking about their characteristics. If you want to know about pet preferences among females, you ignore males entirely and look only at the female row - that's conditioning on gender. The percentages you calculate show the distribution of pet preference within the female group. It's like taking a subgroup and making it your whole world for that question.",

  "summary": "Conditional relative frequency examines the distribution of one variable within a specific category of another variable. Calculated as joint frequency divided by the marginal frequency of the condition (row or column total). Row conditionals show column variable distributions within each row category; column conditionals show row variable distributions within each column category. These are written in probability notation as P(A|B). If conditional distributions are identical across all categories, the variables are independent; if they differ, variables are associated. The greater the differences, the stronger the association. Conditional frequencies are essential for comparing groups and understanding relationships in categorical data. Common errors include using the wrong denominator (grand total instead of conditional total), confusing row and column conditionals, and misinterpreting independence. Understanding conditional relative frequency bridges descriptive statistics and probability theory, providing tools for deeper data analysis.",
