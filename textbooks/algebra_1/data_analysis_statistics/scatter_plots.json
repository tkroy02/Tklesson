  "expanded_description": "Scatter plots are powerful tools for visualizing the relationship between two quantitative variables. Each point on a scatter plot represents an individual data point with coordinates (x, y), where x is the value of one variable and y is the value of the other. By examining the pattern of points, we can identify correlations (positive, negative, or none), detect outliers, and observe the strength and form of relationships. Scatter plots are the foundation for correlation analysis and regression modeling, used extensively in fields from economics and medicine to environmental science and market research.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A scatter plot displays paired data (x, y) as points on a coordinate plane. Key features to examine:<br><br>• **Direction**: Positive (as x increases, y increases) or negative (as x increases, y decreases)<br>• **Form**: Linear, curved, or no pattern<br>• **Strength**: How closely points follow a pattern (strong, moderate, weak)<br>• **Outliers**: Points that deviate from the overall pattern<br><br>These features help determine if and how two variables are related.",
    
    "explanation": "Imagine plotting each person's height against their weight. If taller people tend to weigh more, the points will slope upward - that's a positive correlation. If there's no relationship, the points will look like a random cloud. Scatter plots turn abstract numbers into a visual story about how two things are connected. They're like a first date for your data - you get to see if there's chemistry before diving deeper.",

  "summary": "Scatter plots visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables by plotting points as (x, y) coordinates. Key features to examine include direction (positive/negative/none), form (linear/curved), strength (strong/moderate/weak), outliers, and clusters. Positive correlation means y increases as x increases; negative correlation means y decreases as x increases. Strength describes how closely points follow a pattern. Outliers are points that deviate from the overall pattern and may have high leverage or large residuals. Clusters suggest distinct subgroups that may be explained by a third variable. A fundamental principle: correlation does not imply causation - observed relationships may be due to lurking variables. When creating scatter plots, place the explanatory variable on the x-axis and response on y-axis, choose appropriate scales, and plot carefully. Scatter plots are essential for exploratory data analysis and form the foundation for correlation and regression analysis.",
