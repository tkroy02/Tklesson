  "expanded_description": "Histograms and frequency distributions are fundamental tools for visualizing and understanding data distributions. A histogram displays the shape, center, and spread of data by grouping values into intervals (bins) and showing the frequency or count of values in each bin. Unlike bar charts, histograms are used for continuous numerical data, and the bars touch to indicate the continuous nature of the data. Frequency distributions can be absolute (counts) or relative (percentages or proportions). Understanding how to create and interpret histograms is essential for exploratory data analysis, identifying patterns, detecting skewness, and making data-driven decisions in fields from business to science.",

    "principle": "**Frequency Distribution**: A table that shows how data values are distributed across categories or intervals.<br><br>**Histogram**: A graphical representation of a frequency distribution where:<br>• The horizontal axis represents the data values divided into equal intervals (bins)<br>• The vertical axis represents the frequency (count) or relative frequency (proportion)<br>• Bars are drawn for each bin with height equal to frequency<br>• Bars touch each other (unlike bar charts) to indicate continuous data<br><br>**Key features**: Shape (symmetric, skewed), center, spread, gaps, clusters, outliers.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a histogram as a skyline of your data. Each building (bar) represents how many data points fall into a particular neighborhood (bin). Tall buildings mean lots of data there; short buildings mean fewer. The shape of the skyline tells you about your data - is it a mountain peak (symmetric), leaning to one side (skewed), or flat (uniform)? Unlike a box plot that summarizes, a histogram shows you the actual landscape of your data distribution.",

To create a histogram: choose appropriate bin width, create frequency table, draw axes, and draw bars with heights equal to frequencies. Histograms reveal shape (symmetric, skewed left/right, uniform, bimodal), center (approximate middle), spread (range), and unusual features (gaps, outliers). Relative frequency histograms show proportions instead of counts, enabling comparison between different-sized datasets. Cumulative frequency histograms show running totals, useful for finding percentiles. Bin width selection is crucial - too wide hides detail, too narrow creates noise. Common errors include leaving gaps between bars (histograms require touching bars), using unequal bin widths, and confusing histograms with bar charts. Histograms are fundamental tools for exploratory data analysis and statistical communication.",
