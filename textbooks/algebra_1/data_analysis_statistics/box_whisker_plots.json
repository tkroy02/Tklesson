  "expanded_description": "A box and whisker plot (or simply box plot) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. This powerful visual tool shows the center, spread, and skewness of data at a glance. Box plots are particularly useful for comparing multiple datasets side by side and for identifying outliers. The \"box\" represents the interquartile range (IQR) containing the middle 50% of data, while the \"whiskers\" extend to the minimum and maximum values (or to fences, with outliers plotted as individual points). Understanding how to create and interpret box plots is essential for exploratory data analysis.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A box and whisker plot displays the five-number summary visually:<br><br>• **Minimum**: The smallest data point (excluding outliers)<br>• **Q1**: First quartile (25th percentile)<br>• **Median**: Second quartile (50th percentile)<br>• **Q3**: Third quartile (75th percentile)<br>• **Maximum**: The largest data point (excluding outliers)<br><br>The box spans from Q1 to Q3, with a line at the median. Whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 × IQR of the quartiles. Points beyond are plotted as outliers.",
    
    "explanation": "Imagine cutting a dataset into four equal piles. The box plot shows you these piles visually. The box holds the middle two piles (50% of your data) - the wider the box, the more spread out the middle half. The line inside the box is the median - if it's not centered, your data is skewed. The whiskers show the range of the rest of the data, and any dots beyond are outliers - unusual values that stand apart. It's like an X-ray of your data's structure.",

Whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values that are not outliers. Outliers are values beyond $Q1 - 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}$ or $Q3 + 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}$ and are plotted as individual points. Box plots reveal the center (median), spread (IQR and range), skewness (position of median in box and relative whisker lengths), and outliers at a glance. They are excellent for comparing multiple distributions side by side. However, they don't show detailed shape like modality or gaps. To create a box plot: calculate the five-number summary, determine fences and outliers, draw a scaled number line, draw the box from Q1 to Q3 with median line, draw whiskers to the last non-outlier values, and plot outliers as dots. Interpreting box plots involves comparing medians, IQRs, ranges, and outlier patterns. Box plots are a fundamental tool in exploratory data analysis and statistical communication.",
