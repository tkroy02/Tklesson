  "expanded_description": "Measures of central tendency are single values that attempt to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that dataset. The three main measures are the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value). Each measure provides different insights: the mean is sensitive to outliers, the median is resistant to extreme values, and the mode identifies the most common occurrence. Understanding when to use each measure is crucial for accurately interpreting data in fields ranging from education and business to science and social research.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Mean**: The arithmetic average - sum of all values divided by the number of values. $$\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x}{n}$$<br><br>**Median**: The middle value when data is arranged in order. For odd $n$, it's the middle value; for even $n$, it's the average of the two middle values.<br><br>**Mode**: The value that appears most frequently. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), multiple modes (multimodal), or no mode (if all values appear equally).",
    
    "explanation": "Think of these measures as different ways to answer \"What's typical?\" The mean is like splitting a pizza evenly among friends - everyone gets the same amount. The median is like finding the middle person in a line - half are taller, half are shorter. The mode is like the most popular color in a room - the one you see most often. Each tells you something different about your data, and the best choice depends on what you want to know.",

  "summary": "Measures of central tendency describe the center of a dataset. The mean (average) is the sum divided by the count, sensitive to outliers. The median is the middle value when data is ordered, resistant to outliers. The mode is the most frequent value, useful for categorical data. To find the median, always arrange data in order first - for odd n, take the middle value; for even n, average the two middle values. The mode may be one value, multiple values, or none. When outliers are present, the median typically provides a better representation of typical values than the mean. The weighted mean accounts for different importance levels, as in grade calculations. Choosing the appropriate measure depends on the data distribution and the question being asked. Understanding these measures is fundamental to data analysis and statistics.",
