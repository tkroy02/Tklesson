  "expanded_description": "Two-way frequency tables (also called contingency tables) organize data involving two categorical variables. They display the frequency (count) of observations for each combination of categories, allowing us to analyze relationships between variables like gender and preference, age group and product choice, or education level and opinion. From these tables, we can calculate joint frequencies (counts in each cell), marginal frequencies (row and column totals), and relative frequencies (proportions). Two-way tables are fundamental for analyzing categorical data in fields from market research to medical studies, providing insights into how variables are associated.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A two-way frequency table organizes data by two categorical variables. Structure:<br><br>• **Rows** represent categories of one variable<br>• **Columns** represent categories of the other variable<br>• **Cells** show the frequency (count) for each combination<br>• **Row totals** sum frequencies across each row<br>• **Column totals** sum frequencies down each column<br>• **Grand total** sums all frequencies<br><br>From these, we can find:<br>• **Joint frequency**: Count in a single cell<br>• **Marginal frequency**: Row or column totals<br>• **Relative frequency**: Proportion relative to total, row, or column",
    
    "explanation": "Imagine a table that cross-classifies every person by two characteristics - like gender and favorite ice cream flavor. Each cell tells you how many people fit both categories. The row totals tell you how many people are in each gender group overall; column totals tell you how many prefer each flavor. This table is like a map of how two categorical variables interact, showing patterns you might miss in separate lists.",

Joint frequencies are the counts in individual cells; marginal frequencies are the row and column totals. Relative frequencies can be calculated based on grand total (proportion of all observations), row totals (distribution of column variable within each row), or column totals (distribution of row variable within each column). These tables reveal associations between variables - if row percentages differ substantially across rows, the variables are associated. Missing values can be found using relationships with totals. Two-way tables can be visualized with segmented bar charts. Common errors include misinterpreting percentage types, incorrect marginal totals, and assuming causation from association. Two-way tables are fundamental for analyzing categorical data in research, business, and everyday decision-making.",
