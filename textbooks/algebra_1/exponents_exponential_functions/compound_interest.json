  "expanded_description": "Compound interest is one of the most important real-world applications of exponential functions. When interest is compounded, you earn interest not only on your initial principal but also on the interest that has been added previously. This creates exponential growth that can significantly increase the value of investments over time. Understanding compound interest is essential for personal finance, investing, and loans.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The compound interest formula is $A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$, where:<br>• $P$ = principal (initial amount)<br>• $r$ = annual interest rate (as a decimal)<br>• $n$ = number of times interest is compounded per year<br>• $t$ = time in years<br>• $A$ = amount after $t$ years<br><br>For continuous compounding, $A = Pe^{rt}$, where $e \\approx 2.71828$.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of compound interest as a snowball rolling down a hill. It starts small, but as it rolls, it picks up more snow (interest), and that new snow helps it pick up even more snow. The more frequently it compounds (the more times interest is calculated and added), the faster it grows. Continuous compounding is like a perfectly smooth hill where the snowball is always growing.",

  "summary": "Compound interest is exponential growth applied to finance. The formula $A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}$ calculates the future value of an investment, where $P$ is principal, $r$ is annual rate, $n$ is compounding frequency, and $t$ is time. More frequent compounding yields higher returns, with continuous compounding $A = Pe^{rt}$ as the theoretical maximum. APY (Annual Percentage Yield) standardizes returns across different compounding frequencies: $APY = (1 + r/n)^n - 1$. The formula can be rearranged to find principal (present value), time (using logarithms), or rate (using roots). Compound interest applies to savings, investments, loans, and inflation. Understanding these concepts is essential for financial literacy and making informed decisions about saving, borrowing, and investing.",
