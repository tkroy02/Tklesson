  "expanded_description": "Linear and exponential functions represent two fundamentally different types of growth. Linear functions add a constant amount each time, while exponential functions multiply by a constant factor. Understanding the differences between these two models is crucial for correctly interpreting real-world phenomena and making predictions. This section compares their equations, graphs, tables, and applications.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Linear functions have the form $f(x) = mx + b$ and show constant **additive** change. Exponential functions have the form $f(x) = ab^x$ and show constant **multiplicative** change. Key differences:<br>• Linear: constant rate of change (slope)<br>• Exponential: constant ratio between consecutive outputs<br>• Linear graphs are straight lines; exponential graphs are curves<br>• Linear growth is slow and steady; exponential growth accelerates rapidly",
    
    "explanation": "Think of linear growth as climbing a constant slope staircase—each step takes you up the same height. Exponential growth is like a chain reaction—each step multiplies what came before, leading to explosive growth over time. In the short term, they might look similar, but over longer periods, exponential always outpaces linear.",

  "summary": "Linear and exponential functions represent fundamentally different types of change. Linear functions have the form $f(x) = mx + b$ and are characterized by constant additive change—equal steps in x produce constant differences in y. Exponential functions have the form $f(x) = ab^x$ and are characterized by constant multiplicative change—equal steps in x produce constant ratios in y. Linear graphs are straight lines; exponential graphs are curves that either rise increasingly steeply (growth) or fall and level off (decay). In real-world applications, use linear models for constant amount changes (simple interest, constant speed, fixed depreciation) and exponential models for constant percentage changes (compound interest, population growth, radioactive decay). Exponential growth eventually outpaces any linear growth, while exponential decay approaches zero asymptotically. Understanding these differences is essential for correctly modeling real-world phenomena and making accurate predictions.",
