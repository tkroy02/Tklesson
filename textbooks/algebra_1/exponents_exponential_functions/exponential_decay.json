  "expanded_description": "Exponential decay occurs when a quantity decreases by the same factor over equal time intervals. Unlike linear decay, which subtracts the same amount each time, exponential decay multiplies by the same factor less than 1. This models many natural phenomena including radioactive decay, drug concentration in the body, and depreciation of assets.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An exponential decay function has the form $y = a(1 - r)^t$ or $y = ab^t$ where:<br>• $a$ is the initial amount (when $t = 0$)<br>• $r$ is the decay rate (as a decimal)<br>• $b = 1 - r$ is the decay factor (between 0 and 1)<br>• $t$ is time (or number of periods)<br>• $y$ is the amount after $t$ periods",
    
    "explanation": "Think of exponential decay like the way a medicine leaves your body. If a drug has a half-life of 4 hours, after 4 hours half remains, after 8 hours one-quarter remains, and so on. The amount decreases by the same fraction each time period, never quite reaching zero but getting closer and closer.",

The decay factor $b = 1-r$ is between 0 and 1. Half-life—the time for a quantity to reduce to half—is constant for exponential decay and can be calculated using logarithms. Real-world applications include radioactive decay (carbon dating), asset depreciation, and drug elimination from the body. When given data, the decay factor can be found by dividing later values by earlier values, and the decay rate is $1 - b$. Exponential decay differs from linear decay in that it multiplies by a constant factor rather than subtracting a constant amount, leading to decreases that are rapid initially but slow over time.",
