  "expanded_description": "Exponential growth occurs when a quantity increases by the same factor over equal time intervals. Unlike linear growth, which adds the same amount each time, exponential growth multiplies by the same factor. This leads to rapid increases that can model population growth, compound interest, and many natural phenomena.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An exponential growth function has the form $y = a(1 + r)^t$ or $y = ab^t$ where:<br>• $a$ is the initial amount (when $t = 0$)<br>• $r$ is the growth rate (as a decimal)<br>• $b = 1 + r$ is the growth factor (greater than 1)<br>• $t$ is time (or number of periods)<br>• $y$ is the amount after $t$ periods",
    
    "explanation": "Think of exponential growth like compound interest in a bank account. If you start with $\\$100$ and it grows by 10% each year, after one year you have $\\$110$, after two years $\\$121$, and so on. The growth builds on itself—each year's growth is larger because it's based on a larger amount. This is the power of exponential growth.",

The growth factor $b = 1+r$ must be greater than 1. Doubling time—the time for a quantity to double—is constant for exponential growth and can be estimated by the Rule of 70 ($T \\approx 70/r\\%$). Real-world applications include population growth, compound interest, and bacterial growth. When given data, the growth factor can be found by dividing later values by earlier values. Exponential growth differs from linear growth in that it multiplies by a constant factor rather than adding a constant amount, leading to increasingly rapid increases over time.",
