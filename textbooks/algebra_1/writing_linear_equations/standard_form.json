  "expanded_description": "Standard form $Ax + By = C$ is one of the most common ways to write linear equations, especially in contexts involving integer coefficients and constraints. Unlike slope-intercept form, which emphasizes slope and y-intercept, standard form highlights the relationship between x and y as a constant sum. This form is particularly useful in systems of equations, linear programming, and real-world constraint problems.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The standard form of a linear equation is $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are real numbers, and $A$ and $B$ are not both zero. Typically, $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers, and $A$ is non-negative. This form is useful for finding intercepts, solving systems, and modeling constraints.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of standard form as a balanced equation showing that a combination of x and y equals a constant. It's like a recipe: $A$ parts of x plus $B$ parts of y make $C$ total. This form is especially powerful when dealing with budgets, mixtures, and other real-world situations where two quantities add up to a fixed amount.",

  "summary": "The standard form of a linear equation is $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants, and $A$ and $B$ are not both zero. This form is particularly useful for finding intercepts quickly: set $x = 0$ to find the y-intercept $(0, \\frac{C}{B})$ (if $B \\neq 0$), and set $y = 0$ to find the x-intercept $(\\frac{C}{A}, 0)$ (if $A \\neq 0$). To graph using intercepts, plot both intercepts and draw the line through them. When the line passes through the origin, intercepts coincide, so an additional point is needed. The slope can be found directly from standard form: $m = -\\frac{A}{B}$ (when $B \\neq 0$). Converting between standard and slope-intercept forms is straightforward: $Ax + By = C$ becomes $y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}$, and $y = mx + b$ becomes $Ax + By = C$ after moving terms and clearing fractions. Special cases occur when $A = 0$ (horizontal line $y = \\frac{C}{B}$) or $B = 0$ (vertical line $x = \\frac{C}{A}$). Real-world applications include budget constraints, mixture problems, and resource allocation. Standard form is essential for systems of equations, linear programming, and modeling real-world constraints.",
