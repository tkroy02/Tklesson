  "expanded_description": "Linear equations can be written in several equivalent forms: slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), point-slope form ($y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$), and standard form ($Ax + By = C$). Each form has its advantages, and converting between them is an essential skill. Understanding these conversions demonstrates that different-looking equations can represent the same line and allows us to use the most convenient form for any task.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The three main forms of linear equations are equivalent and can be converted using algebraic manipulation:<br>• Slope-intercept to standard: $y = mx + b \\rightarrow mx - y = -b$ or $Ax + By = C$<br>• Standard to slope-intercept: $Ax + By = C \\rightarrow y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}$<br>• Point-slope to slope-intercept: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\rightarrow y = mx + (y_1 - mx_1)$<br>• Point-slope to standard: convert to slope-intercept first, then to standard",
    
    "explanation": "Think of equation forms as different languages describing the same line. Slope-intercept form tells you the slope and where it hits the y-axis. Point-slope form tells you the slope and a specific point. Standard form shows the intercepts clearly and is useful for systems of equations. Converting between forms is like translating between languages—the meaning stays the same, just the expression changes.",

  "summary": "Linear equations can be written in three equivalent forms: slope-intercept ($y = mx + b$), point-slope ($y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$), and standard ($Ax + By = C$). Converting between these forms is a fundamental algebraic skill. To convert from slope-intercept to standard, move the x term to the left and clear fractions if necessary. To convert from standard to slope-intercept, solve for y. To convert from point-slope to slope-intercept, distribute and isolate y. Point-slope to standard is often done via slope-intercept as an intermediate step. Standard to point-slope requires finding the slope and a point (often the y-intercept). Each form has advantages: slope-intercept for graphing, point-slope for when a point is known, standard for systems and intercepts. Mastery of these conversions demonstrates understanding that different-looking equations can represent the same line and provides flexibility in choosing the most convenient form for any task.",
