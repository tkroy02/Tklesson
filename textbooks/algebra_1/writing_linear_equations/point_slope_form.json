  "expanded_description": "Point-slope form is a versatile way to write linear equations, especially when we know a point on the line and its slope. Unlike slope-intercept form, which requires knowing the y-intercept, point-slope form works with any point. This makes it ideal for many real-world situations and serves as a bridge between the slope formula and other equation forms.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The point-slope form of a linear equation is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is any point on the line. This form is derived directly from the slope formula $m = \\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$ and is particularly useful when the y-intercept is not known or not convenient.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of point-slope form as a template that says: 'Starting from a known point $(x_1, y_1)$, as you move horizontally by some amount, you move vertically by the slope times that amount.' It's like having a starting location and a set of directions—you can describe the entire path from that one reference point.",

  "summary": "Point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ is a versatile way to write linear equations when you know a point on the line and its slope. It is derived directly from the slope formula $m = \\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$ and highlights both the slope and a specific point. This form is particularly useful when the y-intercept is not known or when working with the slope formula directly. To write an equation in point-slope form, substitute the slope $m$ and point coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ into the template. Converting to slope-intercept form involves distributing the slope and isolating $y$. Converting from slope-intercept to point-slope can be done using any point on the line, most simply the y-intercept $(0, b)$. When given two points, find the slope first, then use either point in point-slope form. Real-world applications are abundant when a rate (slope) and one data point are known. Care must be taken with signs, especially when point coordinates are negative. Point-slope form is an essential tool in the algebra toolkit, bridging the gap between the slope formula and other equation forms.",
