  "expanded_description": "Graphs provide a visual representation of linear relationships. Learning to read equations from graphs is a fundamental skill that connects the visual and algebraic worlds. By identifying key features like the y-intercept and slope, we can write the equation of any line shown on a coordinate plane.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To write the equation of a line from its graph: (1) Identify the y-intercept $b$ (where the line crosses the y-axis). (2) Find the slope $m$ by counting rise and run between two points on the line. (3) Write the equation in slope-intercept form: $y = mx + b$. If the line is vertical or horizontal, use the special forms $x = a$ or $y = b$.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a graph as a picture of an equation. The y-intercept is where the story starts—where the line meets the y-axis. The slope tells you how the story progresses—how much y changes for each step in x. By reading these two features, you can write the complete story as an equation.",

  "summary": "Writing equations from graphs involves identifying key features of the line. The y-intercept $b$ is found where the line crosses the y-axis at $(0, b)$. The slope $m$ is found by counting rise and run between two points on the line: $m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}$. Once $m$ and $b$ are known, the equation can be written in slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$. If the y-intercept is not clearly visible, use any two points on the line to calculate slope, then use point-slope form to find the equation. Horizontal lines have the form $y = b$ (slope 0), and vertical lines have the form $x = a$ (undefined slope). In real-world applications, the slope represents the rate of change with appropriate units, and the y-intercept represents the initial value. This skill connects visual representations to algebraic equations, enabling mathematical modeling of real situations.",
