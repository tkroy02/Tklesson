This skill is essential in real-world situations where we know a rate of change and one data point, and need to model the entire relationship.",

    "principle": "Given a slope $m$ and a point $(x_1, y_1)$ on the line, we can write the equation using point-slope form: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. Then simplify to slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ by solving for $y$, or leave in point-slope form as needed.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of point-slope form as a template. The point $(x_1, y_1)$ is a specific location you know, and the slope $m$ tells you the direction. The equation says: 'the vertical distance from your point equals the slope times the horizontal distance from your point.' This creates the entire line.",

  "summary": "Given a slope $m$ and a point $(x_1, y_1)$ on a line, we can write the equation using point-slope form: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. This form comes directly from the slope formula and is ideal for this situation. From point-slope form, we can convert to slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ by distributing the slope and solving for $y$. Alternatively, we can find the y-intercept directly using $b = y_1 - m x_1$ and then write $y = mx + b$. Special attention is needed when the given point has negative coordinates, as $x - x_1$ becomes addition. Fractional slopes are handled the same way, requiring careful fraction arithmetic. Real-world applications include situations where we know a rate of change (slope) and one measurement (point), allowing us to model the entire relationship and make predictions. This skill is fundamental for writing linear equations and for understanding how lines are determined by slope and a single point.",
