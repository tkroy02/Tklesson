  "expanded_description": "Parallel lines are everywhere—from railroad tracks to parking lot lines, from rows in a garden to the edges of a book. In coordinate geometry, parallel lines share the same slope but have different y-intercepts. Understanding how to write equations of parallel lines allows us to model these real-world relationships and solve geometric problems.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. Vertical lines (with undefined slope) are parallel to each other. To write the equation of a line parallel to a given line through a point $(x_1, y_1)$: (1) Find the slope $m$ of the given line. (2) Use the same slope $m$ with the point in point-slope form: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. (3) Simplify to the desired form.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of parallel lines as train tracks—they run alongside each other, always the same distance apart, never meeting. The slope is like the direction they're heading. If two lines point in the exact same direction (same slope), they'll never cross, no matter where they start (different y-intercepts).",

  "summary": "Parallel lines are lines that never intersect. In coordinate geometry, non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. Vertical lines (with undefined slope) are parallel to each other. To write the equation of a line parallel to a given line through a point $(x_1, y_1)$: (1) Find the slope $m$ of the given line (extracting it from whatever form it's in). (2) Use the same slope $m$ with the point in point-slope form: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. (3) Simplify to the desired form (slope-intercept or standard). For vertical lines, the parallel line is also vertical: $x = x_1$. In systems of equations, parallel lines represent inconsistent systems with no solution. Real-world applications include parallel streets, railroad tracks, building columns, and ruled paper. Understanding parallel lines is essential for geometry, design, and solving systems of equations.",
