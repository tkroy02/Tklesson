  "expanded_description": "Word problems are the bridge between abstract mathematics and real-world situations. Learning to translate verbal descriptions into linear equations is one of the most valuable skills in algebra. This section provides strategies for identifying variables, recognizing rates and initial values, and writing equations that accurately model practical scenarios from business, science, travel, and everyday life.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a word problem by writing a linear equation: (1) Identify what quantities are changing and what remains constant. (2) Define variables for the unknown quantities. (3) Look for a rate of change (slope) and an initial value (y-intercept). (4) Write the equation in the form $y = mx + b$ or $Ax + By = C$ as appropriate. (5) Use the equation to answer the question.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of word problems as stories with missing numbers. Your job is to find the missing numbers by 'translating' the story into the language of math. Key words act as clues: 'per' often indicates slope, 'initial' or 'starting' indicates y-intercept, 'total' often leads to standard form. Learning to spot these clues makes translation automatic.",

  "summary": "Solving word problems by writing linear equations is a critical skill that connects algebra to real-world situations. The process involves: (1) Reading carefully to understand the situation and identify what is being asked. (2) Defining variables clearly, stating what each represents. (3) Recognizing keywords: 'per' indicates slope, 'initial' or 'starting' indicates y-intercept, 'total' often leads to standard form. (4) Choosing the appropriate equation form: slope-intercept $y = mx + b$ for situations with a rate and initial value; standard form $Ax + By = C$ for totals and constraints; point-slope $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ when a rate and one data point are known. (5) Writing the equation and solving. (6) Interpreting the solution in context—checking for reasonableness, appropriate units, and rejecting solutions that don't make sense (like negative quantities). Common applications include business (cost, revenue, profit), travel (distance, speed, time), science (temperature change, growth rates), and everyday situations (shopping, phone plans, rentals). Mastering word problems develops mathematical modeling skills essential for advanced math and real-world decision-making.",
