  "expanded_description": "Section 15.2 provides a comprehensive review of linear functions, which are the foundation of algebraic thinking. Linear functions model relationships with a constant rate of change and are characterized by their graphs being straight lines. This section covers slope, intercepts, various forms of linear equations, parallel and perpendicular lines, and applications. Understanding linear functions is essential for interpreting real-world situations involving constant rates, such as speed, cost per unit, or any situation where change happens at a steady rate. Mastery of linear concepts prepares students for more complex function families and for using linear models in data analysis.",

    "principle": "**Linear Function Essentials**:<br><br>• **Slope (rate of change)**: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}$<br>• **Slope-intercept form**: $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is slope, $b$ is y-intercept<br>• **Point-slope form**: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, useful when given a point and slope<br>• **Standard form**: $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, $C$ are integers, $A \\geq 0$<br>• **Intercepts**: x-intercept (set $y=0$), y-intercept (set $x=0$)<br>• **Parallel lines**: Equal slopes ($m_1 = m_2$)<br>• **Perpendicular lines**: Slopes are negative reciprocals ($m_1 \\cdot m_2 = -1$)<br>• **Applications**: constant rate problems, linear modeling, predictions",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a linear function as a story where things change at a steady pace. If you're saving $10 per week, your savings follow a linear function. The slope tells you how fast you're saving (the rate), and the y-intercept tells you where you started (initial amount). Different forms of the equation are like different ways to tell the same story: slope-intercept gives you the rate and starting point directly, point-slope is perfect when you know one moment in the story and the rate, and standard form is useful for finding both intercepts easily.",

  "summary": "Section 15.2 provides a comprehensive review of linear functions. Slope $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ measures rate of change and determines line direction. Three main forms are used: slope-intercept ($y = mx + b$) directly shows slope and y-intercept; point-slope ($y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$) is useful when given a point and slope; standard form ($Ax + By = C$) makes finding intercepts easy. Parallel lines have equal slopes; perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals ($m_1 \\cdot m_2 = -1$). Linear models in applications use slope for rate of change and y-intercept for initial value. Common errors include confusing the slope formula order, misreading slope from non-slope-intercept equations, and using the wrong sign for perpendicular slopes. Mastery of linear functions is essential for understanding more complex functions and for data analysis applications.",
