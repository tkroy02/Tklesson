  "expanded_description": "Section 15.3 provides a comprehensive review of exponential functions, which model situations involving growth or decay by a constant percentage rate. Unlike linear functions that change by a constant amount, exponential functions change by a constant factor. This section covers the general form $y = a \\cdot b^x$, identifying growth versus decay, calculating growth/decay rates, compound interest, half-life, doubling time, and applications in population growth, radioactive decay, and finance. Understanding exponential functions is essential for interpreting real-world phenomena ranging from bacterial growth to investment returns to carbon dating.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Exponential Function Essentials**:<br><br>• **General form**: $y = a \\cdot b^x$, where $a$ is initial value (when $x=0$), $b$ is growth/decay factor<br>• **Growth**: $b > 1$ (increases as $x$ increases)<br>• **Decay**: $0 < b < 1$ (decreases as $x$ increases)<br>• **Growth/decay rate**: $r = b - 1$ (if $b > 1$) or $r = 1 - b$ (if $b < 1$), expressed as percentage<br>• **Compound interest**: $A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$ where $P$ is principal, $r$ annual rate, $n$ compounding periods per year, $t$ years<br>• **Half-life**: Time for quantity to reduce by half: $A = A_0(\\frac{1}{2})^{t/h}$<br>• **Doubling time**: Time for quantity to double: $A = A_0(2)^{t/d}$<br>• **Graphs**: Pass through $(0,a)$, horizontal asymptote at $y=0$, increasing for growth, decreasing for decay",
    
    "explanation": "Think of exponential growth as a snowball rolling downhill - it starts small but gets bigger and bigger faster as it goes. Exponential decay is like a radioactive isotope - it loses half its mass at regular intervals, always decreasing but never quite reaching zero. The key difference from linear is that linear adds the same amount each time, while exponential multiplies by the same factor. A 10% raise each year is exponential; a $1000 raise each year is linear. Which would you rather have after 20 years?",

  "summary": "Section 15.3 provides a comprehensive review of exponential functions. Exponential functions take the form $y = a \\cdot b^x$, where $a$ is the initial value and $b$ is the growth/decay factor. When $b > 1$, the function models exponential growth; when $0 < b < 1$, it models exponential decay. The growth/decay rate $r$ is related to the factor by $b = 1 + r$ (growth) or $b = 1 - r$ (decay). Compound interest uses $A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$ where more frequent compounding yields slightly higher returns. Half-life problems use $A = A_0(\\frac{1}{2})^{t/h}$ and doubling time uses $A = A_0(2)^{t/d}$. To find an exponential function from two points, use the ratio of y-values to find $b$, then solve for $a$. Exponential growth eventually outpaces linear growth, even with modest rates. Common errors include confusing growth rate with growth factor, mishandling time units in exponents, and forgetting to include the initial value. Exponential functions are essential for modeling real-world phenomena from finance to biology to physics.",
