  "expanded_description": "Section 15.7 focuses on multi-step problem solving, where students must integrate multiple mathematical concepts to solve complex, real-world problems. Unlike isolated exercises that practice a single skill, multi-step problems require strategic thinking, planning, and the ability to select and apply appropriate mathematical tools from throughout the course. These problems often involve multiple representations (equations, graphs, tables), require interpretation of results in context, and may have multiple solution paths. Developing proficiency with multi-step problems is essential for success in advanced mathematics, standardized tests, and real-world applications where problems don't come with instructions on which method to use.",

    "principle": "**Multi-Step Problem Solving Strategy**:<br><br>1. **Understand** the problem: Read carefully, identify what's given and what's asked, note any constraints<br>2. **Plan** your approach: Break the problem into smaller steps, decide which concepts apply, choose appropriate methods<br>3. **Solve** step by step: Show clear work, check intermediate results, use proper notation<br>4. **Check** your answer: Does it make sense in context? Does it satisfy given conditions?<br>5. **Interpret** the result: Answer the original question in complete sentences with appropriate units<br><br>**Key skills**: Recognizing problem types, selecting efficient methods, making connections between concepts, verifying reasonableness.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of multi-step problems as puzzles where you have to figure out which tools from your mathematical toolbox to use and in what order. Unlike following a recipe, you're the chef deciding how to combine ingredients. Sometimes you'll need to use an equation to find a value, then use that value in a function, then interpret the result on a graph. These problems mirror real life, where challenges don't come with a label saying 'use quadratic formula here.' The strategy is your roadmap - understand where you're going, plan your route, take it step by step, and check that you've arrived at the right destination.",

  "summary": "Section 15.7 focuses on multi-step problem solving, requiring students to integrate multiple mathematical concepts to solve complex, real-world problems. The systematic approach involves understanding the problem, planning a solution strategy, solving step by step, checking work, and interpreting results in context. Business problems combine cost, revenue, and profit functions, requiring optimization and break-even analysis. Geometry problems use the Pythagorean theorem and area formulas to create quadratic equations. Physics problems, especially projectile motion, use quadratic functions to model height over time. Mixture and investment problems create systems of linear equations. Data analysis problems combine statistics with linear modeling. Multi-concept problems deliberately integrate different areas of mathematics. Common errors include rushing past understanding, losing track of units, and not checking reasonableness of answers. Developing proficiency with multi-step problems is essential for success in advanced mathematics, standardized tests, and real-world applications where problems don't come with instructions on which method to use.",
