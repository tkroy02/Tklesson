  "expanded_description": "Section 15.1 provides a comprehensive review of solving equations and inequalities, covering all major types encountered throughout the course. From simple linear equations to multi-step problems, absolute value equations, proportions, and literal equations, this section reinforces the fundamental skill of isolating variables and finding solution sets. Inequalities extend these concepts with special attention to reversing inequality signs when multiplying or dividing by negatives. Mastery of equation solving is essential for success in all subsequent algebra topics, as it forms the foundation for working with functions, systems, and mathematical modeling.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Equation Solving Strategies**:<br><br>• **Linear equations**: Isolate variable using inverse operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division)<br>• **Inequalities**: Solve like equations, but flip inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number<br>• **Absolute value equations**: $|x| = a$ gives two cases: $x = a$ or $x = -a$ (provided $a \\geq 0$)<br>• **Proportions**: Cross-multiply when $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ gives $ad = bc$<br>• **Literal equations**: Solve for a specific variable in terms of others using same inverse operations<br>• **Checking solutions**: Always verify in original equation, especially for absolute value and rational equations where extraneous solutions may occur",
    
    "explanation": "Think of equation solving as a detective game where you're trying to uncover the unknown number. The equation is a locked box with the variable inside. Each operation you perform - adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing - is like turning a dial or opening a lock. Your goal is to systematically undo everything that's been done to the variable until it stands alone. Inequalities are similar, but there's a special rule: if you multiply or divide by a negative, the inequality sign flips directions - like a mirror image of the truth.",

  "summary": "Section 15.1 provides a comprehensive review of solving equations and inequalities. Linear equations are solved by isolating the variable using inverse operations. Linear inequalities follow the same process, but require flipping the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number. Absolute value equations $|expression| = k$ require considering two cases: $expression = k$ and $expression = -k$ when $k > 0$, one case when $k = 0$, and have no solution when $k < 0$. Proportions are solved by cross-multiplying, but always check that solutions don't make denominators zero. Literal equations are solved for a specific variable by treating all other variables as constants and using the same inverse operations. Common errors include forgetting to flip inequality signs, missing the negative case in absolute value equations, and dividing by variables that could be zero. Mastery of these fundamental skills is essential for success in all subsequent mathematics topics.",
