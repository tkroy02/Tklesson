  "expanded_description": "Unit 15 serves as a comprehensive culmination of the entire year's study of algebra and data analysis. This end-of-year review and capstone section is designed to consolidate learning, identify areas for additional practice, and demonstrate mastery through multi-step problem solving and a cumulative project. The unit systematically revisits each major concept from the course: equations and inequalities, linear, exponential, and quadratic functions, polynomials, and radicals. Students then apply this integrated knowledge to complex, real-world problems. The final project allows for creative application of mathematical thinking, while the practice final exam builds confidence and readiness for summative assessment. The unit concludes with a mathematical reflection, encouraging students to recognize connections between topics and see how the year's learning forms a foundation for future mathematical study.",

    "principle": "The end-of-year review is organized to:<br><br>• **Revisit and reinforce** key concepts from each unit<br>• **Identify connections** between different areas of mathematics<br>• **Apply multiple concepts** to solve complex, multi-step problems<br>• **Demonstrate mastery** through a cumulative project<br>• **Prepare for assessment** with comprehensive practice<br>• **Reflect on learning** and connect to future mathematics",
    
    "explanation": "Think of this unit as the grand finale of your mathematical journey this year. Like a championship game where you use all the skills you've practiced, or a final performance where every technique comes together, this unit asks you to draw on everything you've learned. But it's more than just review - it's about seeing the big picture: how equations, functions, and data analysis are all connected tools for understanding and solving problems. This is where you become not just a student of math, but a mathematical thinker.",

  "summary": "Unit 15 provides comprehensive end-of-year review and synthesis. Sections 15.1-15.6 systematically revisit equations, linear functions, exponential functions, polynomials, quadratics, and radicals - the core topics of the course. Section 15.7 challenges students with multi-step problems requiring integration of multiple concepts. The final project (15.8) offers choice in applying mathematical thinking to real-world scenarios. Section 15.9 provides a complete practice exam to prepare for summative assessment. The unit concludes with mathematical reflection (15.10), encouraging students to recognize connections between topics and appreciate their growth. This culminating unit transforms discrete topics into an integrated understanding of algebra and data analysis, preparing students for future mathematics courses and real-world problem solving.",
