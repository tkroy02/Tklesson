  "expanded_description": "With multiple methods available for solving systems of equations—graphing, substitution, and elimination—knowing which method to use is a valuable skill. The choice depends on the form of the equations, the coefficients, and personal preference. This section provides guidelines for selecting the most efficient method and gives practice in recognizing which approach will work best for a given system.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The choice of solution method depends on the system's characteristics:<br>• **Graphing**: Best for visualizing solutions, checking work, or when an approximate answer is sufficient.<br>• **Substitution**: Best when one variable is already isolated or has coefficient 1 or -1.<br>• **Elimination**: Best when coefficients are opposites, the same, or can be easily made opposites; also good for avoiding fractions.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of solution methods as tools in a toolbox. You wouldn't use a sledgehammer to hang a picture, nor a tack hammer to break concrete. Similarly, each system-solving method has its strengths. Learning to match the method to the system makes you a more efficient and effective problem-solver.",

  "summary": "Choosing the right method for solving a system of equations can significantly affect efficiency and accuracy. Graphing is best for visualization, estimation, and checking work, but is imprecise for non-integer solutions. Substitution is ideal when a variable is already isolated or has coefficient 1 or -1, making it easy to express one variable in terms of the other. Elimination shines when coefficients are opposites, the same, or have common factors that allow easy creation of opposites. A systematic approach: check for isolated variables first, then look for coefficient 1, then check for opposites or same coefficients, then consider common factors. When in doubt, either algebraic method will work—choose based on personal preference. Solving the same system with multiple methods provides verification and deeper understanding. In real-world contexts, the way information is presented often suggests a method. Mastering method selection develops mathematical maturity and problem-solving efficiency.",
