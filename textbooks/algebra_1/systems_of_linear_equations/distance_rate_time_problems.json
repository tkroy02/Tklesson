  "expanded_description": "Distance-rate-time problems are a classic application of systems of equations. The fundamental relationship $d = r \\times t$ connects these three quantities. When two different trips or vehicles are involved, or when conditions like wind or current affect speed, we often need a system to find the unknown rates or times.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The distance-rate-time relationship is $d = rt$, where $d$ is distance, $r$ is rate (speed), and $t$ is time. When solving DRT problems with systems:<br>• Identify what is constant (often distance) and what varies (rate, time).<br>• Set up equations for each trip or condition.<br>• Use the relationships between rates (e.g., with wind, $r = p + w$ and $r = p - w$) to create the system.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of DRT problems as stories about travel. The same distance might be covered at different speeds (like going uphill and downhill), or two travelers might start from different points and meet. The equation $d = rt$ is your basic tool, and systems help when you have multiple trips to compare.",

  "summary": "Distance-rate-time problems use the fundamental relationship $d = rt$. When solving, ensure units are consistent (e.g., miles and hours, or convert minutes to hours). For meeting problems where objects move toward each other, the sum of distances equals the initial separation, and combined rate × time = distance. For catch-up problems, set distances equal, accounting for head starts. For wind and current problems, speed with the medium is $r + w$, against it is $r - w$, and the same distance gives two equations. Average speed is total distance divided by total time, not the arithmetic mean of the speeds. Systems of equations arise when multiple unknowns must be found from multiple conditions. DRT problems are excellent applications of algebra and appear frequently in real-world contexts involving travel, transportation, and navigation.",
