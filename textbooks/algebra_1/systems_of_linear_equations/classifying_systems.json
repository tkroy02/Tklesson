  "expanded_description": "Not all systems of equations are the same. Some have exactly one solution, some have none, and some have infinitely many. Classifying systems helps us understand what kind of solution to expect before we even begin solving, and it provides insight into the relationship between the equations. The terminology—consistent, inconsistent, independent, dependent—is essential for communicating about systems.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Systems of linear equations can be classified by their number of solutions:<br>• **Consistent and independent**: Exactly one solution (lines intersect at one point)<br>• **Inconsistent**: No solution (lines are parallel)<br>• **Consistent and dependent**: Infinitely many solutions (lines are coincident)<br>The type can be determined by comparing slopes and intercepts without graphing.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of classification like labeling animals. 'Consistent' means the system has at least one solution (like animals that exist). 'Inconsistent' means no solution (like mythical creatures). Among consistent systems, 'independent' means exactly one solution (like a unique animal), while 'dependent' means infinitely many (like a species with many individuals).",

  "summary": "Systems of linear equations can be classified into three types based on their solutions. A consistent and independent system has exactly one solution, occurring when lines have different slopes and intersect at a single point. An inconsistent system has no solution, occurring when lines are parallel (same slope, different intercepts). A consistent and dependent system has infinitely many solutions, occurring when lines are coincident (same slope and intercept—the same line). To classify without graphing, compare slopes and intercepts when equations are in slope-intercept form. For equations in standard form $Ax + By = C$, compare the ratios $\\frac{A_1}{A_2}$, $\\frac{B_1}{B_2}$, and $\\frac{C_1}{C_2}$. If all ratios are equal, the system is dependent. If $\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{B_1}{B_2} \\neq \\frac{C_1}{C_2}$, the system is inconsistent. If $\\frac{A_1}{A_2} \\neq \\frac{B_1}{B_2}$, the system is independent. Real-world interpretations: independent systems give unique solutions (e.g., specific prices), inconsistent systems represent impossible conditions, and dependent systems represent redundant information. Understanding these classifications helps in choosing solution methods and interpreting results.",
