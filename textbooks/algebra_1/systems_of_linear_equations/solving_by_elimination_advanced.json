  "expanded_description": "The elimination method becomes even more powerful when applied to complex systems involving fractions, decimals, or equations that need rearrangement. This section builds on basic elimination skills and introduces strategies for handling more challenging systems, including those with three variables. Students will learn to clear fractions and decimals before eliminating, and to make strategic choices about which variable to eliminate first.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Advanced elimination follows the same principles as basic elimination, but requires additional algebraic preparation: putting equations in standard form, clearing fractions and decimals, and choosing strategic multipliers. The goal remains to eliminate one variable, solve for another, and back-substitute to find all values.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of advanced elimination as preparing ingredients before cooking. You might need to chop (simplify), measure (clear fractions), and combine in the right order (choose elimination strategy). The recipe is the same, but the preparation requires more care. With practice, you'll learn to look at a system and see the most efficient path through the complexity.",

  "summary": "Advanced elimination extends the basic method to more complex systems, requiring additional preparation and strategic thinking. Always start by putting equations in standard form $Ax + By = C$ (or with three variables). Clear fractions by multiplying each equation by its LCD, and clear decimals by multiplying by appropriate powers of 10. Choose which variable to eliminate strategically—look for coefficients with common factors to minimize multipliers. For three-variable systems, eliminate the same variable from two different pairs of equations to obtain a two-variable system, then solve that system and back-substitute. Throughout, maintain careful algebra, track your steps, and check solutions in the original equations. Special cases (no solution or infinite solutions) can be identified when variables cancel, leaving true or false statements. Advanced elimination builds algebraic fluency and prepares students for linear algebra and more advanced mathematical applications.",
