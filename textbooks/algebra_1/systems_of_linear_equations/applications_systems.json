  "expanded_description": "Systems of equations are powerful tools for solving real-world problems that involve multiple conditions. Whether determining prices, mixing solutions, or finding break-even points, systems allow us to find values that satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously. This section focuses on translating word problems into systems and interpreting the solutions in context.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a real-world problem with a system of equations: (1) Identify the unknown quantities and define variables. (2) Translate each condition or relationship into an equation. (3) Write the system of equations. (4) Choose an appropriate method (substitution, elimination, or graphing) and solve. (5) Interpret the solution in the context of the original problem, checking for reasonableness.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of real-world problems as stories with missing numbers. Each sentence gives a clue—a relationship between the unknowns. Your job is to turn those clues into equations, then solve the puzzle. The solution must make sense in the story, not just mathematically.",

  "summary": "Systems of equations are powerful tools for solving real-world problems. The process begins with clearly defining variables that represent the unknown quantities. Each condition in the problem translates to an equation, creating a system. Business applications include finding unit prices from purchase combinations, break-even analysis, and ticket sales. Mixture problems involve combining substances with different concentrations or costs to achieve a desired mixture. Geometry applications use formulas for perimeter, area, and angle relationships. Number and digit problems explore relationships between numbers and their digits. Motion problems use the distance-rate-time formula, often comparing different trips or vehicles. When solving, choose the most efficient method based on the system's structure. Always check that your solution makes sense in context—quantities should be positive, countable items should be integers, and answers should be reasonable. Mastering these applications demonstrates the practical value of algebra and prepares students for real-world problem-solving.",
