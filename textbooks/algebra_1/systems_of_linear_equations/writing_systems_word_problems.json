  "expanded_description": "The ability to translate word problems into systems of equations is one of the most valuable skills in algebra. It requires careful reading, identification of unknowns, recognition of relationships, and accurate translation into mathematical language. This section provides strategies and practice for creating systems from verbal descriptions, preparing students to tackle real-world problems independently.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To write a system of equations from a word problem: (1) Read the problem carefully, identifying all unknown quantities. (2) Define variables for each unknown, choosing meaningful letters. (3) Identify the relationships or conditions described. (4) Translate each condition into an equation. (5) Write the system and check that it makes sense in context.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a word problem as a story with missing numbers. Each sentence gives a clue about how the numbers relate. Your job is to decode those clues into mathematical statements, then solve the puzzle. The variables are the characters, the equations are the plot, and the solution is the resolution.",

  "summary": "Writing systems of equations from word problems is a multi-step process that requires careful reading and systematic translation. Start by identifying all unknown quantities—these become your variables. Define each variable clearly, using meaningful letters and including units. Recognize the type of problem (number, business, mixture, geometry, motion) to anticipate the kind of equations needed. Translate each relationship or condition into an equation, paying attention to phrases like 'sum,' 'difference,' 'more than,' and 'less than.' Common patterns include total quantity equations, cost/revenue equations, concentration equations, geometric formulas, and distance-rate-time relationships. After writing the system, check for consistency—do the equations make sense with the problem statement? Are the units consistent? Taking time to write systems correctly saves time and prevents errors when solving. Mastering this skill enables you to tackle real-world problems independently and is essential for advanced mathematics and applications.",
