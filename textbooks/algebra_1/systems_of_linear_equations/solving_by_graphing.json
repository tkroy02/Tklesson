  "expanded_description": "A system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations considered together. The solution to a system is the ordered pair (or pairs) that satisfies all equations simultaneously. Graphing is the most visual method for solving systems—the solution is the point where the lines intersect. This method provides intuition about the nature of the solution before moving to algebraic methods.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a system of two linear equations by graphing: (1) Graph each line on the same coordinate plane. (2) Find the point where the lines intersect. (3) The intersection point $(x, y)$ is the solution to the system. If the lines are parallel, there is no solution. If the lines are the same (coincident), there are infinitely many solutions.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of each equation as a path. The solution to a system is where the paths cross—the one place you can stand that's on both paths simultaneously. If the paths never cross (parallel lines), there's no common point. If the paths are the same line (coincident), every point on that line is a common point—infinitely many solutions.",

  "summary": "Solving systems of linear equations by graphing involves graphing each line on the same coordinate plane and finding their intersection point. This point $(x, y)$ is the solution—the values that satisfy both equations simultaneously. The graphing method visually reveals the three possible outcomes: intersecting lines (one unique solution), parallel lines (no solution), and coincident lines (infinitely many solutions). To graph accurately, use slope-intercept form or the intercept method, and always check your solution by substituting back into the original equations. When intersection points have non-integer coordinates, estimate as accurately as possible. Real-world applications include finding break-even points where cost equals revenue. While graphing provides intuition and visual understanding, it has limitations—accuracy depends on precise graphing, and non-integer solutions are only estimated. In the following sections, we'll learn algebraic methods that give exact solutions.",
