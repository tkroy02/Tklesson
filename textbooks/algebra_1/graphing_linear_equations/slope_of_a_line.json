  "expanded_description": "Slope is a fundamental concept in algebra that measures the steepness and direction of a line. It describes how a line rises or falls as we move along it. Understanding slope is essential for graphing lines, interpreting rates of change, and analyzing linear relationships in mathematics and the real world.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Slope ($m$) is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between any two points on a line: $m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, where $x_1 \\neq x_2$. Slope indicates both the steepness and direction of a line: positive slope rises left to right, negative slope falls left to right, zero slope is horizontal, and undefined slope is vertical.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of slope as the 'steepness' of a line—like the steepness of a roof or a hill. A slope of 2 means for every step right, you go up 2 steps (very steep). A slope of 1/2 means for every step right, you go up half a step (gentle). Negative slope means you go down instead of up. Slope tells you how quickly something is changing.",

  "summary": "Slope ($m$) measures the steepness and direction of a line. It is calculated as the ratio of vertical change (rise) to horizontal change (run): $m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Positive slope means the line rises from left to right; negative slope means it falls. Zero slope indicates a horizontal line (constant function); undefined slope indicates a vertical line (not a function). Slope can be found from two points using the formula, from a graph by counting rise and run, from a table by calculating rate of change, or from an equation by identifying the coefficient of $x$ in slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ or by solving for $y$ in standard form. Slope is constant for linear relationships and represents the rate of change between variables. Understanding slope is essential for graphing lines, interpreting rates in real-world contexts, and building foundations for calculus.",
