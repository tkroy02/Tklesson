  "expanded_description": "Data often comes in tables—lists of input and output values. Creating graphs from tables allows us to visualize relationships, identify patterns, and determine whether the data represents a linear function. This skill is essential for analyzing real-world data and for understanding how tabular information translates to graphical form.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To graph from a table, plot each ordered pair (x, y) as a point on the coordinate plane. Then examine the pattern of points: if they form a straight line, the relationship is linear and you can draw the line. If not, the relationship is nonlinear. For linear data, you can find the slope using any two points and write the equation.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a table as a set of coordinates waiting to be placed on a map. Each row gives you a location (x, y). When you plot them all, you can see the shape of the data—are they marching in a straight line? Curving? Scattered? The graph reveals the story the numbers are telling.",

  "summary": "Graphing from tables involves plotting each ordered pair (x, y) from the table onto a coordinate plane. Once plotted, examine the pattern of points to determine if the relationship is linear. A linear relationship shows constant first differences (Δy is constant for equal Δx intervals) and points that lie on a straight line. For linear data, draw the line through the points and find the equation by calculating slope $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$ and finding the y-intercept (either directly from the table if x=0 is present, or by solving using a point). Nonlinear patterns include quadratic (constant second differences) and exponential (constant ratios). Real-world data from science, business, and sports can be graphed from tables to visualize trends and make predictions. Accuracy in plotting and careful checking of patterns are essential for correct interpretation.",
