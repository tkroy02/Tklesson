  "expanded_description": "The standard form of a linear equation, $Ax + By = C$, is particularly useful for finding intercepts quickly and for working with systems of equations. While slope-intercept form emphasizes slope and y-intercept, standard form emphasizes the intercepts and is often easier to work with when dealing with integer coefficients and constants.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The standard form of a linear equation is $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants, and $A$ and $B$ are not both zero. To graph from standard form, find the intercepts: set $x = 0$ to find the y-intercept, and set $y = 0$ to find the x-intercept. Plot these two points and draw the line through them.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of standard form as a 'shopping list' of intercepts. By plugging in zero for x, you find where the line crosses the y-axis. By plugging in zero for y, you find where it crosses the x-axis. These two points are usually easy to find and give you everything you need to draw the line.",

  "summary": "The standard form of a linear equation is $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants, and $A$ and $B$ are not both zero. This form is particularly useful for finding intercepts quickly: set $x = 0$ to find the y-intercept $(0, \\frac{C}{B})$ (if $B \\neq 0$), and set $y = 0$ to find the x-intercept $(\\frac{C}{A}, 0)$ (if $A \\neq 0$). To graph using intercepts, plot both intercepts and draw the line through them. When the line passes through the origin, intercepts coincide, so an additional point is needed. Standard form can be converted to slope-intercept form by solving for $y$, yielding $y = -\\frac{A}{B}x + \\frac{C}{B}$. Special cases occur when $A = 0$ (horizontal line $y = \\frac{C}{B}$) or $B = 0$ (vertical line $x = \\frac{C}{A}$). Real-world applications include budget constraints ($p_1x + p_2y = \\text{total}$) and mixture problems. Mastering standard form provides an alternative, often more efficient method for graphing linear equations.",
