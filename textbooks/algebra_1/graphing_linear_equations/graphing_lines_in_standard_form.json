  "expanded_description": "Not all lines are slanted. Horizontal and vertical lines are special cases that complete our understanding of linear graphs. Horizontal lines have slope zero and represent constant functions. Vertical lines have undefined slope and are not functions, but they appear frequently in real-world contexts like boundaries, asymptotes, and constraints.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Horizontal lines have the form $y = b$, where $b$ is a constant. Their slope is $0$, and they cross the y-axis at $(0, b)$. Vertical lines have the form $x = a$, where $a$ is a constant. Their slope is undefined, and they cross the x-axis at $(a, 0)$. Horizontal lines are functions; vertical lines are not.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of horizontal lines as 'flat'—no matter how far left or right you go, the height stays the same. Like a calm lake surface. Vertical lines are like a fence—all points have the same x-coordinate, like a boundary line on a map. They go straight up and down forever.",

  "summary": "Horizontal and vertical lines are special cases in graphing. Horizontal lines have the form $y = b$, where $b$ is a constant. Their slope is $0$, they are functions, and they have a y-intercept at $(0, b)$ but no x-intercept (unless $b = 0$). Vertical lines have the form $x = a$, where $a$ is a constant. Their slope is undefined, they are not functions, and they have an x-intercept at $(a, 0)$ but no y-intercept (unless $a = 0$). The x-axis is the horizontal line $y = 0$, and the y-axis is the vertical line $x = 0$. In real-world contexts, horizontal lines represent constant values (flat fees, constant speed, steady temperature), while vertical lines represent boundaries or fixed points (deadlines, price limits, physical barriers). Understanding these special cases completes our ability to graph and interpret all linear equations.",
