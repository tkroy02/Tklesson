  "expanded_description": "Parallel lines are everywhere—railroad tracks, lanes on a highway, rows in a garden, lines on ruled paper. In mathematics, parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. Understanding this relationship allows us to identify parallel lines from equations, graph them, and solve real-world problems involving parallel structures.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. Vertical lines are parallel to each other (all have undefined slope). Parallel lines never intersect. In slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$, lines with the same $m$ but different $b$ are parallel.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of parallel lines as train tracks—they run alongside each other, always the same distance apart, never meeting. The slope is like the direction they're heading. If two lines point in the exact same direction (same slope), they'll never cross, no matter where they start (different y-intercepts).",

Vertical lines (with undefined slope) are parallel to each other. To write the equation of a line parallel to a given line through a point: (1) Find the slope of the given line, (2) Use the same slope with the point in point-slope form. To determine if two lines are parallel, compare their slopes—convert each to slope-intercept form if necessary. Lines with equal slopes are parallel (or coincident if they also share the same intercept). Real-world applications include railroad tracks, parallel streets, building columns, and ruled paper. Understanding parallel lines is essential in geometry, engineering, architecture, and design, as well as for solving problems involving constant rates and consistent spacing.",
