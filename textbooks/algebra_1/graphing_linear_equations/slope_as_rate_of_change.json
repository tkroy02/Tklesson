  "expanded_description": "Slope is more than just a mathematical concept—it represents the rate at which one quantity changes with respect to another. In real-world contexts, slope tells us how fast something is happening: miles per hour, dollars per item, degrees per hour. Understanding slope as rate of change allows us to interpret graphs, make predictions, and understand relationships in business, science, and everyday life.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Slope $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$ represents the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$. In context, slope tells how much the dependent variable changes for each 1-unit increase in the independent variable. Units of slope are (units of $y$)/(units of $x$).",
    
    "explanation": "Think of slope as 'how much y changes per one x'. If you're driving, distance changes with time—slope is speed (miles per hour). If you're shopping, cost changes with quantity—slope is price per item. If you're heating water, temperature changes with time—slope is heating rate (degrees per minute). Slope gives the 'per' relationship.",

  "summary": "Slope $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$ represents the rate of change—how much the dependent variable changes per unit change in the independent variable. In real-world contexts, slope always has units: (units of y)/(units of x). On distance-time graphs, slope is speed (miles per hour). On cost-quantity graphs, slope is unit cost (dollars per item). On temperature-time graphs, slope is heating or cooling rate (degrees per minute). On financial graphs, slope can be savings rate, loan payment rate, or profit per item. Positive slope means quantities increase together; negative slope means they change in opposite directions; zero slope means no change. Interpreting slope in context requires understanding what the axes represent and attaching appropriate units. This concept connects abstract mathematics to practical situations in science, business, and everyday life, making slope one of the most useful mathematical ideas.",
