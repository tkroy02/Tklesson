  "expanded_description": "Not all slopes are nice, whole numbers. Many real-world relationships involve fractional slopes—gentle hills instead of steep cliffs, slow changes instead of rapid ones. Graphing lines with fractional slopes requires careful attention to the rise and run, but the same principles apply: plot the y-intercept, then use the fraction as directions to find another point.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Fractional slopes are handled the same way as integer slopes: $m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}$. The numerator tells how many units to move up or down, and the denominator tells how many units to move right. For example, slope $\\frac{2}{3}$ means up 2, right 3; slope $-\\frac{3}{4}$ means down 3, right 4.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of fractional slopes as more precise directions. Instead of 'go up 2' (which would be slope 2), a slope of $\\frac{2}{3}$ says 'go up 2 for every 3 you go right.' It's a gentler incline. The denominator is the horizontal distance you need to travel to see a whole-number rise. This makes fractional slopes excellent for modeling gradual changes.",

  "summary": "Fractional slopes $m = \\frac{p}{q}$ are handled the same way as integer slopes: the numerator $p$ tells the vertical change (rise), and the denominator $q$ tells the horizontal change (run). To graph, plot the y-intercept, then move right $q$ units and up/down $p$ units to find a second point. Positive slopes go up, negative slopes go down. Decimal slopes can be converted to fractions for easier graphing (e.g., $0.75 = \\frac{3}{4}$, $0.6 = \\frac{3}{5}$). Comparing fractional slopes involves comparing their decimal equivalents or using cross-multiplication; steeper slopes have larger absolute values. Parallel lines have identical slopes, whether fractional or integer. Real-world applications include fuel efficiency ($\\frac{1}{32}$ gallons per mile), unit pricing ($\\frac{3}{4}$ dollars per pound), and gradual temperature changes. Mastering fractional slopes expands our ability to model and graph a wider range of real-world relationships.",
