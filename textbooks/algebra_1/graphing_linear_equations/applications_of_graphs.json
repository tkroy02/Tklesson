  "expanded_description": "Graphs are not just abstract mathematical objects—they are powerful tools for understanding and solving real-world problems. From business profits to scientific experiments, from sports statistics to population trends, graphs help us visualize relationships, make predictions, and communicate information clearly. This section explores practical applications of linear graphs across various fields.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Linear graphs model real-world situations where there is a constant rate of change. The slope represents the rate (e.g., speed, cost per item, growth rate), and the y-intercept represents the initial value (e.g., starting distance, fixed cost, initial population). By interpreting these features in context, we can analyze situations, make predictions, and solve problems.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a graph as a story told with lines. The slope tells you how fast the story is progressing—the speed of a car, the rate of saving money, the growth of a plant. The y-intercept tells you where the story began—the starting point. By reading the graph, you can understand what happened, predict what will happen next, and answer questions about the situation.",

  "summary": "Linear graphs model countless real-world situations where relationships have constant rates of change. In business, cost functions have y-intercept = fixed costs and slope = variable cost per unit; revenue functions pass through origin with slope = price per unit; break-even occurs where cost equals revenue. In travel, distance-time graphs have slope = speed, horizontal segments = stops, negative slope = return. In finance, savings grow linearly with slope = deposit rate; loans decrease linearly with slope = -payment rate. In science, temperature change graphs have slope = heating/cooling rate; force-extension graphs (Hooke's Law) have slope = spring constant reciprocal. Population growth can be linear with constant annual increase. Interpreting graphs in context means connecting mathematical features to real meanings: slope becomes rate (with units), intercepts become starting values, and the direction tells whether quantities are increasing or decreasing. Understanding these applications transforms abstract mathematics into powerful tools for analysis and decision-making.",
