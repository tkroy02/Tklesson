  "expanded_description": "The slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ is the most intuitive form for graphing linear equations. It directly reveals two key features: the y-intercept $b$ tells where the line crosses the y-axis, and the slope $m$ tells how to move from that point to find other points on the line. Mastering this form makes graphing quick and efficient.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept (the y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis). To graph: plot the y-intercept at $(0, b)$, then use the slope $m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}$ to find another point, and draw the line through both points.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of slope-intercept form as a set of instructions: 'Start at $b$ on the y-axis, then move according to the slope.' If slope is $\\frac{2}{3}$, you go up 2 and right 3 to find your next point. If slope is $-\\frac{4}{1}$, you go down 4 and right 1. This makes graphing as simple as following directions.",

  "summary": "The slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ is the most convenient form for graphing linear equations. The coefficient $m$ is the slope, telling how steep the line is and in which direction it goes. The constant $b$ is the y-intercept, the y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis at $(0, b)$. To graph from this form: (1) Plot the y-intercept at $(0, b)$. (2) Write slope as a fraction $m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}$. (3) From the y-intercept, move right by the run and up/down by the rise to find a second point. (4) Draw a straight line through both points, extending in both directions with arrows. Special cases include horizontal lines ($m = 0$, $y = b$) and lines through the origin ($b = 0$, $y = mx$). Equations not in slope-intercept form can be converted by solving for $y$. This method makes graphing quick, efficient, and accurate, and it directly connects the equation to its visual representation.",
