  "expanded_description": "Not all rates of change are equal. Some relationships change quickly, others slowly. Comparing rates of change allows us to understand which quantities are growing or declining faster, make predictions, and choose between options in real-world situations. This section develops skills in analyzing and comparing slopes across different linear functions.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The slope $m$ represents the rate of change. When comparing linear functions, a larger absolute value of slope indicates a steeper line and a faster rate of change. Positive slopes indicate increase, negative slopes indicate decrease. To compare rates, we compare their numerical values, paying attention to units and context.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of slopes as speeds on different highways. A slope of 60 mph is faster than a slope of 30 mph. A slope of -50 mph (going backward) is a faster rate of change than -20 mph, even though both are negative. The steeper the line, the faster the change, regardless of direction.",

  "summary": "Comparing rates of change means comparing slopes of linear functions. The steepness of a line is determined by the absolute value of the slope $|m|$—larger absolute value means steeper line and faster rate of change. When comparing slopes on the same graph, steeper lines have greater rates. When rates are given in different units, convert to common units before comparing. Rates can be extracted from equations, tables, graphs, and verbal descriptions—always find the numerical slope value for comparison. Context matters: for speed, higher rate is better; for cost, lower rate is better; for growth, higher rate is better (positive) or lower rate for decline. Intercepts also matter when comparing total amounts over time. Understanding rate comparisons enables informed decision-making in real-world situations involving speed, cost, growth, and other changing quantities.",
