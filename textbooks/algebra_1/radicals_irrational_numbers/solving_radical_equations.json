  "expanded_description": "Solving radical equations involves equations where the variable appears under a square root (or other root) symbol. The key strategy is to isolate the radical on one side and then raise both sides to the appropriate power to eliminate the radical. For square root equations, this means squaring both sides. However, this process can introduce extraneous solutions - solutions that satisfy the transformed equation but not the original one. Therefore, checking all potential solutions in the original equation is essential. Radical equations appear in geometry (Pythagorean Theorem), physics (pendulum formulas), and many other real-world contexts.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve equations containing square roots:<br><br>1. **Isolate** the radical term on one side of the equation<br>2. **Square** both sides to eliminate the radical<br>3. **Solve** the resulting equation<br>4. **Check** all solutions in the original equation (critical step!)<br><br>For equations with multiple radicals, isolate and eliminate one at a time.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of solving radical equations like unwrapping a present. The radical is like a box containing the variable. To get the variable out, you need to \"undo\" the square root by squaring both sides. But be careful - squaring is like using a powerful tool that can create \"fake\" solutions, like a magician's trick. That's why you must always check your answers in the original equation. If a solution doesn't work, it's extraneous - discard it!",

  "summary": "Solving radical equations requires a systematic approach: isolate the radical, square both sides, solve the resulting equation, and check all solutions in the original equation. The checking step is crucial because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions - values that satisfy the squared equation but not the original. When a radical is isolated and equals a negative number, there is no solution (since principal square roots are non-negative). For equations with two radicals, isolate and eliminate them one at a time, which may require squaring twice. In geometry applications, remember that lengths must be positive. Common errors include forgetting to check for extraneous solutions, squaring without isolating the radical first, and incorrectly squaring binomials. Mastering radical equations is essential for solving problems involving the Pythagorean Theorem, physics formulas, and many other real-world applications.",
