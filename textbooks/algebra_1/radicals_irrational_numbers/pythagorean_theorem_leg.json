  "expanded_description": "The Pythagorean Theorem is not only for finding the hypotenuse - it's equally useful for finding a missing leg when the hypotenuse and one leg are known. Given a right triangle with hypotenuse $c$ and one leg $a$, the other leg $b$ can be found using $b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2}$. This variation appears in countless real-world situations: finding the height of a ladder against a wall, determining how far a boat is from shore, calculating the depth of a pond, or finding the missing dimension in construction. Understanding when to subtract (rather than add) is critical, as is recognizing that the hypotenuse is always the longest side, so $c^2 - a^2$ must be positive.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a right triangle with hypotenuse $c$ and legs $a$ and $b$, the Pythagorean Theorem $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ can be rearranged to find a missing leg. If leg $a$ is known and leg $b$ is unknown: $$b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2}$$ Similarly, if leg $b$ is known and leg $a$ is unknown: $$a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2}$$ The key difference from finding the hypotenuse is that we subtract the square of the known leg from the square of the hypotenuse, then take the square root.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of the Pythagorean Theorem as a mathematical balance scale. When finding the hypotenuse, you're combining the two legs to find the total. When finding a leg, you know the total (hypotenuse) and one part - you subtract to find the missing part. It's like having a 13-foot ladder leaning against a wall with the base 5 feet from the wall. The height up the wall isn't 13+5 or 13-5 - it's $\\sqrt{13^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{169-25} = \\sqrt{144} = 12$ feet. The ladder (hypotenuse) minus the base distance gives you the height.",

        "context": "This is sometimes called the \"Pythagorean subtraction\" case. It's crucial to remember that the hypotenuse is always the largest number, so $c^2 - a^2$ will always be positive when $a < c$ (which must be true for a right triangle).",

  "summary": "To find a missing leg in a right triangle when the hypotenuse and one leg are known, use $b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2}$ (or $a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2}$). This is the subtraction form of the Pythagorean Theorem. Always identify the hypotenuse correctly - it's the longest side and opposite the right angle. When $c^2 - a^2$ is a perfect square, the missing leg is a whole number; otherwise, leave the answer in simplified radical form (e.g., $\\sqrt{275} = 5\\sqrt{11}$). Common real-world applications include ladder problems (finding how high a ladder reaches or how far its base is from a wall), guy wire problems, and boat anchor problems. Typical errors include using addition instead of subtraction, misidentifying the hypotenuse, and forgetting to take the square root. Mastering leg-finding is essential for solving right triangle problems in geometry, construction, navigation, and many other fields.",
