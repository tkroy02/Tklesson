  "expanded_description": "Numbers can be classified into different sets based on their properties. Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers (a fraction), while irrational numbers cannot be expressed as simple fractions. This distinction is fundamental in mathematics. Rational numbers include integers, terminating decimals, and repeating decimals. Irrational numbers include non-repeating, non-terminating decimals like $\\pi$, $e$, and square roots of non-perfect squares (e.g., $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$). Understanding this classification helps in recognizing when answers should be left in radical form versus decimal form, and is essential for more advanced mathematics.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "**Rational Numbers**: Numbers that can be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\neq 0$. In decimal form, they either terminate (e.g., 0.75) or repeat (e.g., 0.333...).<br><br>**Irrational Numbers**: Numbers that cannot be written as a ratio of integers. In decimal form, they are non-terminating and non-repeating (e.g., $\\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356...$, $\\pi = 3.14159265...$).<br><br>Together, rational and irrational numbers form the **real numbers**.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of rational numbers as numbers that play nice - they can be written as neat fractions, their decimals eventually settle into patterns or end. Irrational numbers are the rebels - they never repeat, never end, and can't be captured by a simple fraction. $\\frac{1}{3} = 0.333...$ is rational because it repeats; $\\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356...$ is irrational because it never repeats. Both are equally valid numbers, just different species in the number kingdom.",

  "summary": "Real numbers are divided into two main categories: rational and irrational. Rational numbers can be expressed as a ratio of two integers $\\frac{p}{q}$ (with $q \\neq 0$). They include integers, fractions, terminating decimals (like 0.75), and repeating decimals (like 0.\\overline{3}). Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as fractions - their decimal expansions never terminate and never repeat. They include square roots of non-perfect squares (like $\\sqrt{2}$), special constants (like $\\pi$ and $e$), and non-repeating patterned decimals. Square roots of perfect squares (like $\\sqrt{25} = 5$) are rational. When performing operations: rational + rational = rational; rational × rational = rational; rational + irrational = irrational; rational × irrational = irrational (unless the rational factor is 0); irrational + irrational or × irrational could be either. Understanding number classification is essential for knowing when to leave answers in radical form versus decimal form, and for deeper mathematical understanding.",
