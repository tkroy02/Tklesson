  "expanded_description": "Square roots are fundamental to understanding irrational numbers and form the basis for the Pythagorean Theorem, the Distance Formula, and radical operations. A square root of a number $x$ is a number $r$ such that $r^2 = x$. While every positive number has two square roots (positive and negative), the radical symbol $\\sqrt{x}$ denotes the principal (non-negative) square root. Understanding perfect squares, estimating non-perfect squares, and working with square roots is essential for more advanced topics like simplifying radicals, solving quadratic equations, and applying the Pythagorean Theorem in real-world contexts.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For any non-negative real number $x$, the principal square root $\\sqrt{x}$ is the non-negative number whose square equals $x$. That is, if $\\sqrt{x} = r$, then $r^2 = x$ and $r \\geq 0$.<br><br>Key principles:<br>• Perfect squares: numbers like $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ...$ have integer square roots<br>• $\\sqrt{0} = 0$<br>• $\\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$ (not simply $x$)<br>• For $x > 0$, the equation $r^2 = x$ has two solutions: $r = \\sqrt{x}$ and $r = -\\sqrt{x}$",
    
    "explanation": "Think of square roots as asking the question: 'What number multiplied by itself gives me this number?' If someone asks for $\\sqrt{25}$, they're asking 'What number times itself equals 25?' The answer is 5 (since 5×5=25). The radical symbol $\\sqrt{\\phantom{x}}$ is like a question mark waiting to be answered. When you see it, you're being asked to find the number that squares to the value inside.",

  "summary": "Square roots are the inverse operation of squaring. The principal square root $\\sqrt{x}$ (for $x \\geq 0$) is the non-negative number whose square is $x$. Perfect squares like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, and 225 have integer square roots. Numbers that are not perfect squares have irrational square roots that can be estimated by finding the perfect squares on either side. For variables, $\\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$, but we often assume variables are non-negative to write $\\sqrt{x^2} = x$. Square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers. Common errors include distributing square roots over addition ($\\sqrt{a+b} \\neq \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}$), forgetting the $\\pm$ when solving $x^2 = a$, and misunderstanding $\\sqrt{x^2}$. Mastery of square roots is essential for the Pythagorean Theorem, simplifying radicals, and solving radical equations.",
