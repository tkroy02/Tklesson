  "expanded_description": "The Pythagorean Theorem is not just a theoretical concept - it has countless practical applications in the real world. From construction and navigation to sports and design, right triangles appear everywhere. When you need to find the height of a building without climbing it, determine if a corner is square, calculate the distance across a lake, or figure out how long a ramp needs to be, the Pythagorean Theorem provides the solution. These applications require identifying right triangles in real situations, correctly applying either the hypotenuse or leg formula, and interpreting results in context. Understanding these applications demonstrates the power of mathematics to solve everyday problems.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Real-world applications of the Pythagorean Theorem generally fall into these categories:<br><br>• **Finding distances** that cannot be measured directly (across lakes, up walls, etc.)<br>• **Checking for right angles** in construction and design<br>• **Calculating dimensions** of objects from given measurements<br>• **Solving navigation problems** involving horizontal and vertical distances<br>• **Determining if triangles are right** using the converse of the theorem<br><br>Key steps: identify the right triangle, determine which side is the hypotenuse, choose the correct formula ($c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ or $a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2}$), solve, and interpret with units.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of the Pythagorean Theorem as a mathematical detective tool. When you can't measure something directly - like the height of a tree or the distance across a canyon - you can measure two sides of an imaginary right triangle and let Pythagoras find the third. It's like having a secret formula that reveals hidden distances. The real world is full of right angles: walls meet floors, streets intersect, objects fall straight down. Wherever you see a right angle, the Pythagorean Theorem is waiting to help.",

In construction, diagonal braces follow $d = \\sqrt{w^2 + h^2}$. Navigation problems use east-north distances to find direct distance: $d = \\sqrt{\\text{east}^2 + \\text{north}^2}$. Ramp problems use $\\text{ramp length} = \\sqrt{\\text{rise}^2 + \\text{run}^2}$, often with building code slope requirements. Sports applications include baseball diamond diagonals ($90\\sqrt{2}$ ft) and basketball court diagonals. Heights of objects can be found indirectly using $h = \\sqrt{\\text{hypotenuse}^2 - \\text{distance}^2}$, remembering to add eye height when applicable. Common errors include misidentifying the hypotenuse, mixing units, and forgetting to add eye height. Mastering these applications shows how a 2,500-year-old mathematical theorem remains essential in modern life.",
