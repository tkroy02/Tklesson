  "expanded_description": "The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most famous and useful relationships in mathematics, stating that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. For a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$, the theorem is $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. When finding the hypotenuse, we solve for $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. This fundamental relationship appears throughout geometry, physics, engineering, and real-world applications - from construction and navigation to computer graphics and surveying.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In any right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$ (the side opposite the right angle), the Pythagorean Theorem states: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ To find the hypotenuse when given the two legs: $$c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$ The hypotenuse is always the longest side and is opposite the right angle. The theorem only applies to right triangles.",
    
    "explanation": "Imagine walking 3 blocks east, then 4 blocks north. The direct distance back to your starting point forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem tells you that distance is 5 blocks ($\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$). It's like finding the shortcut - the straight-line distance between two points when you know the horizontal and vertical distances.",

To find the hypotenuse given both legs, use $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. When the sum is a perfect square, the hypotenuse is a whole number; otherwise, leave the answer in simplified radical form (e.g., $\\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}$). Common Pythagorean triples like (3,4,5), (5,12,13), and (8,15,17) and their multiples appear frequently and can speed up problem-solving. Applications include finding diagonal lengths of rectangles ($d = \\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}$) and squares ($d = s\\sqrt{2}$). Common errors include adding legs before squaring, forgetting to take the square root, and misidentifying the hypotenuse. Mastery of finding the hypotenuse is essential for more advanced topics like finding legs, the distance formula, and real-world applications.",
