  "expanded_description": "Graphs are powerful visual tools that convey information about relationships between quantities. Learning to analyze graphs—to read, interpret, and draw conclusions from them—is an essential skill in mathematics, science, economics, and everyday life. This section develops the ability to extract meaningful information from graphical representations.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Graph analysis involves examining key features: intercepts (where graph crosses axes), slope/rate of change (steepness), increasing/decreasing behavior (direction), maximum/minimum points (peaks and valleys), and end behavior (what happens as $x$ approaches extremes). These features together tell the story of the relationship.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a graph as a picture of a story. The axes tell you what the story is about (time and distance, price and quantity, etc.). The line or curve is the plot. Intercepts are where the story begins or where something hits zero. Increasing parts are action rising, decreasing parts are action falling. Peaks are climactic moments. Learning to read these features is like learning to read the story the graph tells.",

  "summary": "Graph analysis is the skill of extracting meaningful information from visual representations of functions and data. Key features to identify include: intercepts (where graph crosses axes), increasing/decreasing intervals (where graph goes up or down), maximum and minimum points (peaks and valleys), slope or rate of change (steepness), and end behavior (what happens far left and right). In real-world contexts, these features translate to meaningful interpretations: intercepts represent starting values or zeros; increasing/decreasing represent growth or decline; maxima/minima represent peaks or valleys (highest profit, lowest temperature); slope represents speed or rate; end behavior represents long-term trends. Accurate graph analysis requires careful attention to scale, correct reading of coordinates, and proper identification of intervals. Mastering these skills enables understanding of data, functions, and real-world relationships presented in graphical form.",
