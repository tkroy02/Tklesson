  "expanded_description": "The Cartesian coordinate system provides a visual way to represent mathematical relationships. By plotting points using ordered pairs (x, y), we can see patterns, analyze data, and graph equations.

    "principle": "The coordinate plane is formed by two perpendicular number lines: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis. Their intersection at (0,0) is called the origin.

    "explanation": "Think of the coordinate plane as a city grid. The x-axis is like Main Street running east-west, and the y-axis is like First Avenue running north-south. Every location has an address: (x, y). The origin is the intersection of Main and First. Positive x is east, negative x is west, positive y is north, negative y is south.",

  "summary": "The coordinate plane (or Cartesian plane) is a two-dimensional surface formed by the intersection of a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis at the origin (0,0). Points are located using ordered pairs (x, y), where the x-coordinate indicates horizontal position (right for positive, left for negative) and the y-coordinate indicates vertical position (up for positive, down for negative). The axes divide the plane into four quadrants with specific sign patterns: Quadrant I (+,+), Quadrant II (-,+), Quadrant III (-,-), and Quadrant IV (+,-). Points on the axes have one coordinate equal to zero. Plotting points requires starting at the origin, moving horizontally according to the x-coordinate, then vertically according to the y-coordinate. The scale of the axes determines how units are represented and must be chosen appropriately for the data being graphed. Real-world applications include city grids, GPS coordinates, and computer graphics. Common errors include mixing up the order of coordinates and misinterpreting negative signs. Understanding the coordinate plane is essential for graphing equations, analyzing relationships, and interpreting real-world grid systems.",
