  "summary": "The **coordinate plane** (or Cartesian plane) is a two-dimensional surface formed by the intersection of a horizontal **x-axis** and a vertical **y-axis** at the **origin** (0,0). Points are located using **ordered pairs** (x, y), where the x-coordinate indicates horizontal position (right for positive, left for negative) and the y-coordinate indicates vertical position (up for positive, down for negative). The axes divide the plane into four **quadrants** with specific sign patterns: Quadrant I (+,+), Quadrant II (-,+), Quadrant III (-,-), and Quadrant IV (+,-). Points on the axes have one coordinate equal to zero. Plotting points requires starting at the origin, moving horizontally according to the x-coordinate, then vertically according to the y-coordinate. Understanding the coordinate plane is essential for graphing equations, analyzing relationships, and interpreting real-world grid systems like maps and city layouts.",
