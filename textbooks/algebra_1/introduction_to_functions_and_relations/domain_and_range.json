  "expanded_description": "Every function has a set of allowable inputs called the domain and a set of possible outputs called the range. Understanding domain and range is crucial for interpreting functions, graphing them correctly, and applying them to real-world situations where inputs and outputs may be restricted by practical considerations.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. The range is the set of all possible output values (y-values) that result from using the domain. Domain and range can be expressed using set notation, inequalities, or interval notation.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a function as a vending machine. The domain is all the button combinations that actually work—buttons that are not broken and have items behind them. The range is all the snacks you can actually get from the machine. Some buttons might do nothing (not in domain), and some snacks might never come out (not in range). Real-world functions often have natural restrictions—you can't have negative time, negative distance, or half a person.",

  "summary": "The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values ($x$) for which the function is defined. Domain restrictions come from: division by zero (exclude values making denominator zero), even roots (radicand must be ≥ 0), and real-world constraints (non-negative time, integer quantities, etc.). The range is the set of all possible output values ($y$) that result from using the domain. Range depends on function type: linear functions (unrestricted) have range all real numbers; quadratics have range starting at or ending at the vertex y-value; square roots have range starting at minimum y; absolute value has range starting at vertex y. Domain and range are expressed using interval notation: parentheses ( ) for excluded endpoints, brackets [ ] for included endpoints, union $\\cup$ for separated intervals. Infinity $\\infty$ always gets parentheses. In real-world contexts, domain and range reflect practical limitations. Understanding domain and range is essential for graphing functions correctly and interpreting them in applications.",
