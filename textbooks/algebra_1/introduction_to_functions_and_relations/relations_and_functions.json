  "expanded_description": "Understanding the difference between relations and functions is fundamental to algebra. A relation is any set of ordered pairs, while a function is a special type of relation where each input has exactly one output. This distinction forms the basis for function notation, domain and range, and all subsequent work with functions.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A relation is a set of ordered pairs. A function is a relation in which each input (x-value) has exactly one output (y-value). In other words, no two ordered pairs in a function can have the same first element with different second elements. The set of all inputs is the domain; the set of all outputs is the range.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a function as a vending machine. You press a button (input) and get exactly one snack (output). If pressing the same button could give you different snacks at different times, that would be confusing—that's not how vending machines work. A relation is like a list of who likes what snack—one person might like multiple snacks, and multiple people might like the same snack, but in a function, each input has exactly one output.",

  "summary": "A relation is any set of ordered pairs (x, y). Relations can be represented as sets, tables, graphs, or mapping diagrams. A function is a special type of relation where each input (x-value) has exactly one output (y-value). This means no two ordered pairs in a function can have the same first element with different second elements. The vertical line test provides a quick visual way to determine if a graph represents a function: if any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, the graph is not a function. Functions can be one-to-one (each input has unique output and each output has unique input) or many-to-one (multiple inputs can share the same output). The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs; the range is the set of all possible outputs. Real-world examples of functions include temperature as a function of time, cost as a function of quantity, and area as a function of radius. Understanding the distinction between relations and functions is fundamental to all advanced work in algebra, calculus, and mathematical modeling.",
