  "expanded_description": "Intercepts are the points where a graph crosses the coordinate axes. The y-intercept is where the graph crosses the y-axis (x = 0), and the x-intercept is where the graph crosses the x-axis (y = 0). These points provide valuable information about a function's behavior and are essential for graphing, solving equations, and interpreting real-world situations.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The y-intercept is the point where a graph crosses the y-axis, found by setting $x = 0$ and solving for $y$. The x-intercept(s) are where the graph crosses the x-axis, found by setting $y = 0$ and solving for $x$. A function may have zero, one, or multiple x-intercepts, but at most one y-intercept (since it must pass the vertical line test).",
    
    "explanation": "Think of intercepts as the places where your graph touches the 'walls' of the coordinate plane. The y-intercept is where you start on the y-axis before moving left or right. The x-intercepts are like landing points where the graph touches the ground (the x-axis). In real life, intercepts often represent starting values (y-intercept) or break-even points (x-intercepts).",

  "summary": "Intercepts are the points where a graph crosses the coordinate axes. The y-intercept is found by setting $x = 0$ and solving for $y$, giving the point $(0, y)$. A function has at most one y-intercept. The x-intercept(s) are found by setting $y = 0$ (or $f(x) = 0$) and solving for $x$, giving points $(x, 0)$. A function may have 0, 1, or multiple x-intercepts. For linear functions $f(x) = mx + b$: y-intercept at $(0, b)$, x-intercept at $(-b/m, 0)$. For quadratic functions, the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac$ determines the number of x-intercepts: two if positive, one if zero, none if negative. Intercepts are useful for graphing—plotting both intercepts gives two points to draw a line. In real-world applications, the y-intercept often represents an initial value or fixed cost, while x-intercepts represent break-even points or times when a quantity reaches zero. Understanding intercepts is essential for graphing, solving equations, and interpreting mathematical models.",
