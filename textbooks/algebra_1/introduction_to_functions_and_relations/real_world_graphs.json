  "expanded_description": "Graphs are everywhere—in newspapers, business reports, scientific journals, and social media. They tell stories about real-world phenomena: how temperatures change, how profits fluctuate, how populations grow, how distances vary with time. Learning to interpret these graphs in context is an essential life skill that connects mathematical understanding to practical applications.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Real-world graphs have context: the axes represent specific quantities with units, and the graph itself tells a story. Analyzing real-world graphs means connecting mathematical features (intercepts, slope, maxima/minima, increasing/decreasing) to real-world meanings (starting point, rate of change, peak values, trends). The shape of the graph reveals the story.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a real-world graph as a photograph of a process. The x-axis is like time or some other input; the y-axis is what you're measuring. The line or curve shows how the measurement changed. A steep slope means rapid change; a flat line means no change. A peak is the high point of the story; a valley is the low point. Your job is to read the photograph and describe what happened.",

  "summary": "Real-world graphs tell stories about practical situations. In distance-time graphs, slope represents speed, horizontal lines indicate stops, and negative slope means returning. In speed-time graphs, slope represents acceleration, and area under the curve gives distance traveled. Temperature-time graphs show daily or seasonal patterns, with peaks and valleys indicating extremes. Business graphs show cost (with y-intercept as fixed costs), revenue (through origin), and profit. Break-even occurs where cost equals revenue. Supply and demand graphs intersect at equilibrium price and quantity; above equilibrium creates surplus, below creates shortage. Growth graphs can be linear (constant rate), exponential growth (J-curve), or exponential decay (reverse-J). When interpreting real-world graphs, always consider units and context—connect mathematical features (intercepts, slopes, maxima) to real-world meanings (starting point, speed, peak temperature). Understanding these interpretations enables informed decision-making in business, science, and everyday life.",
