  "expanded_description": "Linear functions are the foundation of algebra. They represent relationships with a constant rate of change and graph as straight lines. Mastering how to graph linear functions from equations and write equations from graphs is essential for understanding more complex functions and real-world applications.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A linear function can be written in the form $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope (rate of change) and $b$ is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis). The graph of a linear function is a straight line. To graph, you need either: (1) two points, or (2) one point and the slope.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a linear function as a hiking trail with a constant incline. The slope $m$ tells you how steep the trail is—positive slope means going uphill, negative means downhill. The y-intercept $b$ is your starting elevation. Every step right (increase in x) changes your elevation by $m$ units. This consistent pattern is what makes it linear.",

The slope $m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$ measures steepness: positive slope (line rises), negative slope (line falls), zero slope (horizontal line), undefined slope (vertical line). The slope-intercept form $f(x) = mx + b$ shows slope $m$ and y-intercept $b$ directly. To graph: plot y-intercept, use slope as rise/run to find another point, draw line. The point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ is useful when you know a point and slope. To write equations from graphs: identify y-intercept and slope, or find two points and use point-slope. Horizontal lines: $y = b$; vertical lines: $x = a$ (not functions). Real-world applications include cost functions ($C(x) = mx + b$ with fixed cost $b$ and per-unit cost $m$), temperature conversion, distance-time, and many others where one quantity changes at a constant rate relative to another.",
