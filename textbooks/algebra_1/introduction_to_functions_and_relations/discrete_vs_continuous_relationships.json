  "expanded_description": "Not all relationships are the same. Some involve quantities that can only take on specific, separate values—like the number of students in a class. Others can take on any value within a range—like the temperature throughout a day. This distinction between discrete and continuous relationships is fundamental to understanding data, functions, and real-world modeling.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A discrete relationship has a domain consisting of distinct, separate values—often integers or countable quantities. A continuous relationship has a domain that includes all real numbers within an interval—any value is possible. The graph of a discrete relationship is a set of unconnected points; the graph of a continuous relationship is a connected line or curve.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of discrete relationships as things you can count: apples in a basket, people in a room, steps on a staircase. You can't have 2.5 people or 3.7 apples (in whole contexts). Continuous relationships are things you can measure: height, weight, time, temperature. You can have 5.27 feet or 98.6 degrees. The graph of discrete data looks like dots on a page; continuous data connects into a smooth line or curve.",

  "summary": "Relationships can be classified as discrete or continuous based on their domain. Discrete relationships involve countable quantities where inputs can only take specific, separate values—typically integers or whole numbers. Their graphs consist of unconnected points, and domain/range are written as sets (e.g., $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$). Examples include number of students, tickets sold, or items produced. Continuous relationships involve measurable quantities where inputs can take any value within an interval. Their graphs are connected lines or curves with no gaps, and domain/range are written using interval notation (e.g., $[0, \\infty)$). Examples include time, temperature, height, and weight. The same function rule can produce either a discrete or continuous graph depending on the specified domain. When graphing, it's essential to connect points for continuous data and leave points unconnected for discrete data. Understanding this distinction is crucial for correctly modeling real-world situations and interpreting graphical information.",
