  "expanded_description": "Just as we translate word problems into equations, we must also translate them into inequalities. The key difference is that inequalities describe ranges of possible values rather than exact amounts. Recognizing the language of inequalities—words like 'at least,' 'no more than,' 'between'—is essential for modeling real-world constraints and limitations.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To write an inequality from a verbal description: (1) Identify the unknown quantity and define a variable. (2) Look for key phrases that indicate inequality relationships. (3) Determine which inequality symbol matches the phrase. (4) Write the inequality, being careful with the order of terms (e.g., 'x is at least 5' means $x \\geq 5$, not $5 \\geq x$).",
    
    "explanation": "Think of inequality phrases as vocabulary words in a new language. 'At least' means $\\geq$, like a minimum requirement. 'No more than' means $\\leq$, like a budget limit. 'More than' means $>$, like exceeding a threshold. Learning to translate these phrases automatically is like building your mental dictionary.",

  "summary": "Writing inequalities from verbal descriptions is a critical skill for modeling real-world situations. Key phrases correspond to specific inequality symbols: 'at least', 'minimum', 'no less than' indicate $\\geq$; 'at most', 'maximum', 'no more than' indicate $\\leq$; 'greater than', 'more than', 'exceeds' indicate $>$; 'less than', 'fewer than', 'below' indicate $<$; and 'not equal to', 'different from' indicate $\\neq$. For compound situations, 'between' often indicates an AND inequality (e.g., $a \\leq x \\leq b$), while 'outside of' indicates an OR inequality (e.g., $x < a$ or $x > b$). Pay careful attention to whether endpoints are included (inclusive language like 'at least', 'no more than', 'through') or excluded (strict language like 'more than', 'less than'). Real-world applications include age requirements, height restrictions, budget limits, and measurement constraints. Mastering this translation skill enables students to set up and solve problems involving inequalities in practical contexts.",
