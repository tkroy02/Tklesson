  "expanded_description": "Multi-step inequalities combine all the concepts learned so far: distributing, combining like terms, variables on both sides, and the critical sign-flip rule. These problems require careful organization and attention to detail, but the same principles apply—isolate the variable using inverse operations, and remember to flip the inequality sign whenever multiplying or dividing by a negative number.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a multi-step inequality: (1) Simplify each side by distributing and combining like terms. (2) Move variable terms to one side using addition/subtraction. (3) Move constant terms to the other side. (4) Multiply or divide to isolate the variable, flipping the inequality sign if multiplying or dividing by a negative number. (5) Graph the solution on a number line.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of solving a multi-step inequality like untangling a complex knot—you work step by step, simplifying as you go. Each step should bring you closer to having the variable alone. The inequality sign is like a delicate thread—it stays the same unless you multiply or divide by a negative, at which point it must be flipped to keep the relationship true.",

  "summary": "Solving multi-step inequalities requires combining all previously learned skills in a systematic way. Begin by simplifying each side using the distributive property and combining like terms. Next, collect variable terms on one side using addition or subtraction—the inequality sign remains unchanged during these steps. Then isolate the variable term by moving constants to the other side. Finally, multiply or divide to solve for the variable, remembering to flip the inequality sign if you multiply or divide by a negative number. When fractions are present, multiply both sides by the least common denominator to clear them; be aware that if you multiply by a negative number, you must flip the sign. Decimals can be handled directly or cleared by multiplying by powers of 10. Some inequalities may simplify to statements that are always true (all real numbers) or always false (no solution). Real-world applications include comparing costs with taxes, temperature formulas, and savings comparisons. Mastering multi-step inequalities prepares students for more advanced topics in algebra and for modeling complex real-world constraints.",
