  "expanded_description": "OR compound inequalities represent situations where a value can satisfy either one condition or the other (or both). The solution is the union of the two individual solution sets. Unlike AND inequalities, which give a single connected interval, OR inequalities often result in two separate regions on the number line.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An 'or' compound inequality, such as $x < 2$ or $x > 5$, means that $x$ can satisfy either condition. The solution is the set of values that are less than 2 OR greater than 5. Graphically, this shows as two separate shaded regions on the number line—one to the left of 2 and one to the right of 5.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of 'or' compound inequalities as a restaurant menu offering two options: you can choose the chicken OR the fish. Either choice is acceptable. On a number line, it's like having two separate parking lots—you can park in either one, and both are valid options.",

  "summary": "OR compound inequalities represent the union of two conditions—a value can satisfy either one. To solve, treat each inequality separately and combine their solution sets. The graph typically shows two separate shaded regions, though overlapping conditions may simplify to a single interval or all real numbers. Special cases occur when one condition is contained within the other (e.g., $x > 3$ or $x > 7$ simplifies to $x > 3$) or when the union covers the entire number line (e.g., $x \\geq 0$ or $x \\leq 5$ gives all real numbers). Real-world applications include alternative eligibility criteria (child or senior discount), extreme conditions (below freezing or above boiling), and optional payment methods. Unlike AND inequalities, OR inequalities cannot be written in a compact form with the variable in the middle (unless they simplify to a single interval). Understanding the difference between AND and OR is essential for correctly modeling and solving real-world problems.",
