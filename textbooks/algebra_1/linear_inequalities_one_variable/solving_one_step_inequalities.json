  "expanded_description": "Solving inequalities is similar to solving equations, with one crucial difference: when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality sign. This rule is essential because it maintains the truth of the inequality. Understanding this concept is the foundation for all inequality solving.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a one-step inequality, use inverse operations to isolate the variable, just as with equations. However, if you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality symbol ($<$ becomes $>$, $\\leq$ becomes $\\geq$, and vice versa). The solution set can be graphed on a number line.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of an inequality as a balanced scale. Multiplying or dividing by a negative number is like flipping the scale upside down—everything reverses. For example, if $2 < 3$ is true, then multiplying by $-1$ gives $-2 > -3$, which is also true. The inequality must flip to stay correct.",

Addition and subtraction inequalities never require flipping—just add or subtract the same number from both sides. For multiplication and division, first identify whether the number you're multiplying or dividing by is positive or negative. If positive, the inequality sign remains the same. If negative, flip the sign ($<$ becomes $>$, $\\leq$ becomes $\\geq$, and vice versa). Always check your solution by substituting a value from the solution set into the original inequality. Real-world applications include minimum requirements, maximum limits, and budget constraints. Mastering one-step inequalities builds the foundation for solving more complex inequalities and understanding how inequalities differ from equations.",
