  "expanded_description": "Inequalities are powerful tools for modeling real-world situations involving limits, constraints, and ranges. Unlike equations, which give exact values, inequalities describe acceptable ranges—how much you can spend, how long you can wait, how many items you can buy. Learning to translate real-world problems into inequalities is an essential skill for decision-making in business, science, and everyday life.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a real-world problem using an inequality: (1) Identify the unknown quantity and define a variable. (2) Determine the constraint or condition (e.g., at least, at most, between, more than). (3) Write an inequality that models the situation. (4) Solve the inequality. (5) Interpret the solution in the context of the problem, considering practical limitations like whole numbers or positive values.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of inequalities as the boundaries of what's possible. A budget isn't about spending exactly $\\$50$—it's about spending no more than $\\$50$. A height requirement isn't about being exactly 48 inches—it's about being at least 48 inches. Inequalities give us the flexibility to model these real-world limits.",

  "summary": "Inequalities are essential for modeling real-world situations involving limits, constraints, and ranges. Key application areas include business (budgets, profits, pricing), science (temperature ranges, measurement tolerances, pH levels), travel (speed limits, arrival times, fuel range), age requirements (driving, voting, eligibility), and manufacturing (production capacity, quality control, resource constraints). To solve these problems: (1) Define a variable for the unknown quantity. (2) Identify the inequality keywords and choose the correct symbol. (3) Write an inequality that models the situation. (4) Solve the inequality using standard techniques. (5) Interpret the solution in context, including appropriate units and considering practical limitations like whole numbers for countable items. Always check that your answer makes sense in the real world—for example, negative values for age or distance usually don't make sense. Mastering these applications demonstrates the practical value of algebra and prepares students for decision-making in business, science, and everyday life.",
