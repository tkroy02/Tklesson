  "expanded_description": "Number lines provide a visual way to represent solution sets of inequalities. Unlike equations, which typically have a single solution, inequalities often have infinitely many solutions. Graphing these solutions on a number line makes the range of possible values immediately clear and helps in understanding the meaning of inequality symbols.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To graph an inequality on a number line: (1) Draw a number line with appropriate scale. (2) Locate the boundary point (the number in the inequality). (3) Use an open circle (○) for $<$ or $>$ (strict inequalities) and a closed circle (●) for $\\leq$ or $\\geq$ (inclusive inequalities). (4) Shade in the direction that represents all numbers satisfying the inequality.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of the number line as a road and the inequality as directions. A closed circle means 'including this location'—like a rest stop you can enter. An open circle means 'up to but not including'—like a property boundary you can approach but not cross. The shaded arrow shows which direction to go—all the numbers that satisfy the condition.",

  "summary": "Graphing inequalities on a number line provides a visual representation of solution sets. The boundary point is marked with a circle: open for strict inequalities ($<$ and $>$) and closed for inclusive inequalities ($\\leq$ and $\\geq$). The line is shaded in the direction of the inequality: right for greater than, left for less than. For the special case $x \\neq a$, an open circle is placed at $a$ and both directions are shaded. Compound inequalities combine two conditions: 'AND' inequalities graph as the overlap (between two points), while 'OR' inequalities graph as two separate regions. Real-world constraints like 'at least', 'at most', and 'between' can be translated to inequalities and graphed. Mastering number line graphs builds intuition for solution sets and prepares students for solving inequalities algebraically.",
