  "expanded_description": "Not all inequalities have a solution set that is a simple interval or union of intervals. Some inequalities are true for all real numbers, while others have no solution at all. Recognizing these special cases is crucial for complete understanding and prevents students from incorrectly stating solutions that don't exist or missing solutions that are always true.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "When solving an inequality, if the variable cancels out completely, examine the resulting statement: if it's true (like $0 < 5$ or $2 \\geq -3$), the inequality is an identity and the solution is all real numbers. If it's false (like $0 > 5$ or $-2 \\geq 1$), the inequality has no solution. These are called special cases.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of these special cases as extreme outcomes in a negotiation. Sometimes, no matter what value you propose, the condition is always met—like a store policy that 'all items are under $\\$100$' which is always true if nothing costs that much. Other times, the condition is impossible—like 'you must be both under 10 and over 20 years old,' which no one can satisfy.",

If the statement is true (e.g., $3 > -2$, $0 \\leq 5$, $-4 < 1$), then the inequality is an identity and the solution is all real numbers. If the statement is false (e.g., $3 < -2$, $0 \\geq 5$, $-4 > 1$), then the inequality is a contradiction and has no solution. These special cases also appear in compound inequalities: AND inequalities may have no solution if the conditions don't overlap, while OR inequalities may give all real numbers if the conditions together cover all values. In real-world contexts, always consider the domain—'all real numbers' mathematically may be restricted by practical considerations (e.g., age cannot be negative). Recognizing these special cases prevents errors and deepens understanding of the nature of inequalities.",
