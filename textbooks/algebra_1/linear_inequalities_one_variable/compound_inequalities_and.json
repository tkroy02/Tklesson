  "expanded_description": "Compound inequalities involve two separate inequalities joined by the words 'and' or 'or'. 'And' compound inequalities require that a value satisfy both inequalities simultaneously—the solution is the intersection of the two solution sets. These are often written in compact form as $a < x < b$ and represent values between two endpoints.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An 'and' compound inequality, such as $x > 2$ and $x < 5$, means that $x$ must satisfy both conditions. The solution is the set of values that are greater than 2 AND less than 5, which can be written compactly as $2 < x < 5$. Graphically, this is the overlapping region on a number line—the values between the two endpoints.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of 'and' compound inequalities as a bouncer at a club checking two requirements: you must be at least 18 AND have a valid ID. Both must be true. On a number line, it's like a fenced area between two fences—you're inside only if you're past the left fence AND before the right fence.",

  "summary": "AND compound inequalities require that a value satisfy two conditions simultaneously. They can be written in compact form as $a < x < b$ (or with ≤ or ≥) or as separate statements like $x > a$ and $x < b$. To solve compact AND inequalities, perform the same operation on all three parts—left, middle, and right. When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, remember to flip both inequality signs. For separate AND inequalities, solve each individually and then find the intersection of the solution sets. Special cases include no solution when the conditions contradict (like $x > 5$ and $x < 2$) and cases where one condition is automatically satisfied by the other (like $x < 1$ and $x < 3$ giving $x < 1$). Real-world applications include age ranges, temperature windows, budget constraints, and any situation where a value must fall within a specific interval. Graphing AND inequalities on a number line shows a shaded segment between two endpoints, with open or closed circles indicating whether endpoints are included.",
