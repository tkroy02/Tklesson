  "expanded_description": "Two-step inequalities combine the concepts of two-step equations with the special rules of inequalities. Just like with equations, we undo operations in reverse order—first addition/subtraction, then multiplication/division. Throughout the process, we must remember the critical rule: multiplying or dividing by a negative number flips the inequality sign.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a two-step inequality: (1) Undo addition or subtraction first by adding or subtracting the same number from both sides. (2) Undo multiplication or division by multiplying or dividing both sides by the same number. (3) If you multiply or divide by a negative number, reverse the inequality symbol. (4) Graph the solution on a number line.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of solving a two-step inequality like unwrapping a package—first remove the outer layer (addition/subtraction), then the inner layer (multiplication/division). But there's a warning label: if the inner layer involves a negative number, the package gets flipped (inequality reverses) when you remove it.",

  "summary": "Solving two-step inequalities follows the same process as two-step equations: first undo addition or subtraction, then undo multiplication or division. The critical difference is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number in the second step, the inequality sign must be reversed. Addition and subtraction never affect the inequality sign. When variables appear on both sides, first collect variable terms on one side. Real-world applications include savings goals, temperature limits, and comparing costs. Always check solutions by testing values in the original inequality. Mastering two-step inequalities builds a foundation for more complex multi-step inequalities and for understanding how inequalities model real-world constraints.",
