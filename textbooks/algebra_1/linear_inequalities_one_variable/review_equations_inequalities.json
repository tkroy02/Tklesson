  "expanded_description": "Equations and inequalities are fundamental tools in algebra. While they share many solving techniques, the critical difference lies in how we handle the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by negative numbers. This review section brings together all the concepts from solving equations and inequalities, highlighting similarities, differences, and helping you develop a unified approach to solving both types of problems.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Both equations and inequalities are solved by isolating the variable using inverse operations. The key difference: when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality sign must be flipped, while equations remain unchanged. The solution to an equation is typically a single value (or set of values), while the solution to an inequality is a range of values, often represented on a number line.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of equations and inequalities as two sides of the same coin. Equations ask 'what exactly makes this true?' while inequalities ask 'what range makes this true?' The solving process is nearly identical, but inequalities have an extra rule—like a warning label that says 'Caution: Negative numbers flip the sign!'",

  "summary": "This review section has compared and contrasted equations and inequalities, highlighting their similarities and critical differences. Both are solved by isolating the variable using inverse operations, following the same order of operations. The key difference is the sign-flip rule: when multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be reversed. One-step, two-step, and multi-step problems follow the same sequence for both equations and inequalities. Special cases occur when the variable cancels—if the resulting statement is true, the solution is all real numbers; if false, there is no solution. Compound statements include systems of equations (solved for ordered pairs) and compound inequalities (solved for intervals using AND or OR). Solutions to equations are typically points on a number line, while inequality solutions are shaded regions. Real-world applications use both equations (exact values) and inequalities (ranges, limits). Mastering both types of problems provides a complete foundation for algebra and prepares students for more advanced topics in mathematics.",
