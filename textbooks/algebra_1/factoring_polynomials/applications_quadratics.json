  "expanded_description": "Quadratic equations model many real-world situations, from the path of a thrown ball to the dimensions of a rectangle, from profit maximization to the time it takes for an object to hit the ground. Solving these problems requires translating the situation into a quadratic equation, solving it (often by factoring), and interpreting the solutions in context—sometimes rejecting solutions that don't make sense.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a real-world problem with a quadratic equation:<br>1. Identify the unknown quantity and define a variable.<br>2. Translate the situation into a quadratic equation.<br>3. Write the equation in standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.<br>4. Solve by factoring (or other methods).<br>5. Interpret the solutions in context, rejecting any that don't make sense (e.g., negative time, negative length).",
    
    "explanation": "Think of quadratic applications as stories where the numbers are missing. The situation gives you clues—relationships between quantities—that lead to a quadratic equation. Once you solve it, you get possible answers, but you must check which ones fit the story. A negative length doesn't make sense for a rectangle, and negative time doesn't make sense for most real-world events.",

  "summary": "Quadratic equations model many real-world situations. In number problems, relationships between unknown numbers lead to quadratic equations. In geometry, area and Pythagorean theorem problems create quadratics when dimensions are related. Projectile motion uses the quadratic formula $h = -16t^2 + v_0 t + h_0$ (in feet) to model height over time, allowing us to find when an object hits the ground or its maximum height. Business applications use quadratic profit and revenue functions to find break-even points and maximum profit. Work problems combine rates to form quadratic equations. When solving application problems, always define variables clearly, set up the correct equation, solve, and interpret results in context—rejecting solutions that don't make sense (like negative time or length). Quadratic applications demonstrate the power of algebra to solve practical problems in physics, business, geometry, and everyday life.",
