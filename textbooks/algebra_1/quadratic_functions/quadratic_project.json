  "expanded_description": "The Quadratic Project provides an opportunity to apply all the concepts learned throughout this unit to a realistic, multi-step problem. Students will model a real-world situation with a quadratic function, analyze its properties, interpret key features in context, and communicate their findings clearly. This culminating project integrates graphing, solving equations, finding vertices, interpreting discriminants, and choosing appropriate methods - all while developing mathematical communication and problem-solving skills. The project emphasizes not just getting answers, but understanding what those answers mean in the real world and explaining the reasoning process.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A complete quadratic modeling project should include:<br><br>• **Situation Analysis**: Understanding the real-world context and what is being asked<br>• **Variable Definition**: Clearly defining what each variable represents<br>• **Model Development**: Creating the quadratic function that models the situation<br>• **Analysis**: Finding and interpreting key features (vertex, intercepts, discriminant)<br>• **Conclusions**: Answering the original questions in complete sentences with units<br>• **Verification**: Checking that answers make sense in context<br>• **Presentation**: Communicating findings clearly with appropriate mathematical notation",
    
    "explanation": "Think of this project as telling a complete mathematical story. You're not just a calculator - you're a detective, a reporter, and a explainer. Your job is to take a messy real-world situation, translate it into clean mathematics, solve the mathematical problem, and then translate those solutions back into meaningful answers that anyone could understand. The quadratic is your tool; the story is what matters.",

  "summary": "The Quadratic Project is the culmination of Unit 12, bringing together all concepts in a real-world application. Students select from options including fountain design (vertex form application), profit analysis (revenue/cost optimization), suspension bridge engineering (parabolic cable modeling), or a self-designed scenario. A successful project requires: (1) clear definition of variables with units, (2) correct derivation of the quadratic model from given conditions, (3) thorough analysis including vertex, intercepts, and discriminant where relevant, (4) step-by-step calculations shown clearly, (5) interpretation of all results in the context of the problem, (6) identification and handling of extraneous solutions, and (7) professional presentation with complete sentences and organization. The project emphasizes that mathematics is not just about getting answers, but about understanding what those answers mean and communicating that understanding effectively. By completing this project, students demonstrate mastery of quadratic functions and their real-world applications.",
