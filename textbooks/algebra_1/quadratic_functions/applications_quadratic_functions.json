  "expanded_description": "Quadratic functions model numerous real-world phenomena, from projectile motion to area optimization to economic profit analysis. When an object is thrown, the height follows a quadratic path. When you need to maximize an area with fixed perimeter, the relationship is quadratic. Business profits often form parabolic patterns. Understanding how to apply quadratic functions to real situations involves translating word problems into equations, identifying what is being asked (often maximum/minimum values or specific points), and interpreting solutions in context. These applications demonstrate the practical power of quadratic models beyond abstract mathematics.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Real-world quadratic applications typically fall into these categories:<br><br>• **Projectile Motion**: Height as function of time: $h(t) = -16t^2 + v_0t + h_0$ (feet) or $h(t) = -4.9t^2 + v_0t + h_0$ (meters)<br>• **Area Optimization**: Maximizing area given fixed perimeter: $A(x) = x(\\frac{P}{2} - x)$<br>• **Revenue/Profit**: $R(x) = (\\text{price})(\\text{quantity})$ often forms a quadratic<br>• **Free Fall**: Distance fallen: $d(t) = 16t^2$ (feet) or $d(t) = 4.9t^2$ (meters)<br><br>Key skills: identify the quadratic model, find vertex for maximum/minimum, find zeros for intercepts, interpret results in context.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of quadratic applications as stories that follow a parabolic plot. The graph tells the story: the vertex is the climax (maximum height, maximum profit), the x-intercepts are where the story begins and ends (when the object hits the ground, when profit becomes zero), and the y-intercept is the starting point. Your job is to translate the story into math, find the key moments, and explain what they mean in the real world.",

  "summary": "Quadratic functions model numerous real-world phenomena. In projectile motion, height follows $h(t) = -16t^2 + v_0t + h_0$ (feet) or $h(t) = -4.9t^2 + v_0t + h_0$ (meters), with the vertex giving maximum height and positive x-intercepts giving time to ground. Area optimization problems use $A(x) = x(\\frac{P}{2} - x)$ to maximize rectangular area with fixed perimeter. Revenue applications combine linear price-demand relationships to form quadratic revenue functions $R(x) = (\\text{price})(\\text{quantity})$, with the vertex giving optimal pricing. Free fall follows $d(t) = 16t^2$ or $d(t) = 4.9t^2$ for distance fallen. Stopping distance combines linear reaction distance with quadratic braking distance. Given three data points, we can find a unique quadratic model $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ by solving a system of equations. Throughout all applications, careful attention to units, correct formulas, and real-world interpretation (discarding negative or impossible solutions) is essential. These applications demonstrate the practical power of quadratic functions in science, business, and everyday life.",
