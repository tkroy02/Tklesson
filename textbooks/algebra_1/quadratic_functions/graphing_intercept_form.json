  "expanded_description": "The intercept form of a quadratic function, $f(x) = a(x - p)(x - q)$, directly reveals the x-intercepts $p$ and $q$. This form is especially useful for graphing because we immediately know where the parabola crosses the x-axis. The vertex lies on the axis of symmetry halfway between the intercepts, and its y-coordinate can be found by substituting that x-value into the function.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a quadratic in intercept form $f(x) = a(x - p)(x - q)$:<br>• The x-intercepts are $x = p$ and $x = q$.<br>• The axis of symmetry is the vertical line $x = \\frac{p + q}{2}$ (midpoint of the intercepts).<br>• The vertex has x-coordinate $h = \\frac{p + q}{2}$ and y-coordinate $k = f(h)$.<br>• The parabola opens up if $a > 0$, down if $a < 0$.<br>• The y-intercept is $f(0) = a \\cdot p \\cdot q$.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of intercept form as a blueprint that shows you where the parabola meets the ground (the x-intercepts). The vertex is always perched symmetrically above or below the midpoint of these intercepts. The coefficient $a$ tells you whether the parabola smiles or frowns and how wide it is.",

  "summary": "The intercept form $f(x) = a(x-p)(x-q)$ directly reveals the x-intercepts $p$ and $q$. The axis of symmetry is the vertical line halfway between the intercepts: $x = \\frac{p+q}{2}$. The vertex has x-coordinate $h = \\frac{p+q}{2}$ and y-coordinate $k = f(h)$. The y-intercept is $(0, apq)$. To graph, plot the intercepts, vertex, and y-intercept, then draw a smooth parabola through these points using symmetry. When $p = q$, the quadratic has a double root, and the vertex lies on the x-axis. Intercept form can be converted to standard form by multiplying the factors. This form is particularly useful when the quadratic is already factored, making graphing quick and efficient.",
