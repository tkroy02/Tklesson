  "expanded_description": "Linear inequalities in two variables, such as $y > 2x + 1$ or $3x + 2y \\leq 6$, have solution sets that are entire regions of the coordinate plane, not just lines. Graphing these inequalities involves drawing a boundary line and shading the region where the inequality holds. Understanding this concept is essential for solving systems of inequalities and real-world optimization problems.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To graph a linear inequality in two variables: (1) Graph the boundary line by replacing the inequality symbol with an equals sign. Use a solid line for $\\leq$ or $\\geq$ (inclusive) and a dashed line for $<$ or $>$ (exclusive). (2) Choose a test point not on the line (usually $(0,0)$ if not on the line). (3) Substitute the test point into the inequality. If true, shade the side containing the test point; if false, shade the opposite side.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of the boundary line as a fence. The inequality tells you which side of the fence contains the solutions. A solid fence means the fence itself is included; a dashed fence means it's not. The test point is like a scout checking which side is the right one—if the scout's position satisfies the inequality, that's the side to shade.",

  "summary": "Graphing linear inequalities in two variables involves representing the solution set as a shaded region of the coordinate plane. The boundary line is graphed by replacing the inequality symbol with an equals sign—solid for $\\leq$ or $\\geq$, dashed for $<$ or $>$. A test point (often the origin) determines which side to shade: if the test point satisfies the inequality, shade that side; otherwise, shade the opposite side. For inequalities in slope-intercept form $y > mx + b$ or $y \\geq mx + b$, shade above the line; for $y < mx + b$ or $y \\leq mx + b$, shade below. When the origin lies on the boundary line, choose another convenient test point. The resulting graph visually represents the infinite set of points that satisfy the inequality. Mastering this skill is essential for solving systems of inequalities and for applications in linear programming and optimization.",
