  "expanded_description": "This culminating project brings together everything you've learned about systems of equations and inequalities. You'll tackle a realistic business scenario that requires defining variables, setting up constraints, graphing systems, and using linear programming to find optimal solutions. The project emphasizes real-world decision-making, interpretation of results, and clear communication of findings.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Real-world projects require: (1) Understanding the problem context and identifying key variables. (2) Translating constraints into mathematical inequalities. (3) Graphing the feasible region. (4) Finding corner points. (5) Optimizing an objective function. (6) Interpreting results in context and making recommendations. (7) Communicating findings clearly.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of this project as running your own business consulting firm. You've been hired to help a company make better decisions. You'll analyze their constraints, find the best possible outcomes, and present your recommendations. This is where math meets the real world—your solutions will have practical consequences.",

The process involves: understanding the problem, defining variables, translating constraints into inequalities, graphing the feasible region, finding corner points, evaluating the objective function, interpreting results, and making recommendations. Sensitivity analysis explores how changes in constraints or profits would affect the optimal solution. The final project deliverables include a complete mathematical analysis and a clear executive summary communicating findings to management. This project demonstrates the power of mathematical modeling in real-world decision-making and prepares students for using algebra in business, economics, and operations research. Extensions show how problems can grow in complexity, highlighting the need for more advanced techniques in real applications.",
