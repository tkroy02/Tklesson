  "expanded_description": "Systems of equations and systems of inequalities are powerful tools for modeling real-world situations. While equations give exact solutions, inequalities describe regions of possible solutions. This review brings together all the concepts from solving systems of equations (graphing, substitution, elimination) and systems of inequalities (graphing, interpreting feasible regions, linear programming), helping you see the connections and choose the right approach for any problem.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Systems of equations and inequalities share the concept of multiple conditions that must be satisfied simultaneously. Key differences:<br>• **Equations**: Solutions are points (or sets of points) that make all equations true. Methods include graphing, substitution, and elimination.<br>• **Inequalities**: Solutions are regions in the plane. Solved by graphing, with optimal solutions found via linear programming at corner points.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of equations as precise targets—you must hit exactly the right spot. Inequalities are like zones—you can be anywhere within an area. Both involve multiple constraints, but the nature of the answer is different. This review helps you see the big picture and choose the right tool for each job.",

  "summary": "This review has covered both systems of equations and systems of inequalities, highlighting their similarities and differences. Systems of equations are solved by finding intersection points using graphing, substitution, or elimination. They can have one solution, no solution (parallel lines), or infinitely many solutions (coincident lines). Systems of inequalities are solved by graphing to find feasible regions, with solutions being entire areas of the plane. Linear programming extends inequality systems to find optimal solutions by evaluating an objective function at corner points. When choosing a method, consider the structure of the system: substitution for isolated variables, elimination for opposite coefficients, graphing for visualization or inequalities. Special cases must be recognized to avoid incorrect conclusions. Mastering both types of systems provides a comprehensive toolkit for modeling and solving real-world problems involving multiple conditions and constraints.",
