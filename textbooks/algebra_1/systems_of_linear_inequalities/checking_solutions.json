  "expanded_description": "Once we have graphed an inequality or a system of inequalities, we can check whether a specific point is a solution by substituting its coordinates into each inequality. This algebraic verification confirms whether the point lies in the shaded region and helps us understand the relationship between the graph and the inequalities.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A point is a solution to an inequality if, when its coordinates are substituted into the inequality, the resulting statement is true. For a system of inequalities, the point must satisfy **all** inequalities in the system. This is the algebraic equivalent of checking whether the point lies in the shaded region of the graph.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of checking solutions like testing a key in a lock. If the key (point) works in all locks (inequalities), it opens the door (is a solution). Substituting the coordinates is like trying the key—if it turns smoothly (inequality true), you're in; if it jams (inequality false), you're not.",

  "summary": "Checking solutions for inequalities and systems of inequalities involves substituting the coordinates of a point into each inequality and determining whether the resulting statements are true. For a single inequality, the point is a solution if the inequality holds. For a system, the point must satisfy **all** inequalities. Points on boundary lines require special attention: they are solutions only for inclusive inequalities ($\\leq$ or $\\geq$) and not for strict inequalities ($<$ or $>$). This algebraic verification corresponds to the graphical interpretation where solutions lie in the shaded region (including solid boundaries). Real-world applications use this process to test whether proposed solutions meet all constraints, such as budget limits, resource availability, or nutritional requirements. Mastering solution checking builds a bridge between algebraic and graphical understanding and is essential for optimization problems in linear programming.",
