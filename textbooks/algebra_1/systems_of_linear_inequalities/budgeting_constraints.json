  "expanded_description": "Budgeting is one of the most practical applications of systems of inequalities. Whether managing personal finances, planning a business budget, or allocating resources, we constantly face constraints: income limits, spending caps, savings goals, and minimum requirements. This section explores how to model these financial situations using inequalities and how to interpret the feasible region to make informed financial decisions.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Budgeting constraints typically involve:<br>• **Income constraint**: Total spending ≤ income<br>• **Minimum savings**: Savings ≥ goal amount<br>• **Category limits**: Spending in certain categories ≤ limits<br>• **Minimum requirements**: Essential expenses ≥ minimums<br>• **Non-negativity**: Cannot spend negative amounts<br>These create a feasible region of possible spending plans.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of your budget as a map of financial possibilities. Each constraint is like a boundary line—you can't spend more than you earn, you must save at least something, you need to cover essentials. The feasible region shows all the ways you could allocate your money that satisfy all your rules. Finding the right point in that region is personal financial planning.",

  "summary": "Budgeting constraints are practical applications of systems of inequalities in personal and business finance. The fundamental budget constraint is that total spending cannot exceed income: $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n \\leq I$. Additional constraints include minimum spending on essentials ($x_i \\geq m_i$), maximum limits ($x_i \\leq M_i$), savings goals ($s \\geq S$), and debt payment minimums. These constraints create a feasible region of possible spending plans. Two-category budgets can be graphed to visualize trade-offs between categories like essentials vs discretionary or savings vs spending. Multi-category budgets are represented algebraically. Savings goals introduce time-based constraints, linking monthly savings to future targets. Debt constraints include minimum payments and debt-to-income ratios. Understanding these constraints helps in financial planning, making informed decisions about spending, saving, and debt management. This section demonstrates the practical value of systems of inequalities in everyday financial decision-making.",
