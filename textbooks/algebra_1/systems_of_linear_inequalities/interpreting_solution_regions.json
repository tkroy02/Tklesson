  "expanded_description": "Once we have graphed a system of inequalities, the resulting shaded region tells us which combinations of values are possible. Interpreting this region—understanding its shape, boundaries, and meaning—is crucial for applying systems to real-world problems. This section focuses on describing solution regions, identifying whether they are bounded or unbounded, and understanding what the corner points represent.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The solution region of a system of inequalities represents all points that satisfy every constraint simultaneously. Its characteristics reveal important information: bounded regions have finite area and represent limited possibilities; unbounded regions extend infinitely and represent unlimited possibilities within constraints. Corner points are often where optimal solutions occur in optimization problems.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of the solution region as a 'possibility space'—a map of all the combinations that work. Bounded regions are like fenced-in areas where you have limited options. Unbounded regions are like open plains—you can go far in some directions but still must stay within certain boundaries. The corners are like landmarks where different boundaries meet.",

  "summary": "Interpreting the solution region of a system of inequalities involves understanding what the region represents, its shape, and its boundaries. Bounded regions have finite area and are enclosed on all sides; unbounded regions extend infinitely in at least one direction. Corner points (vertices) are where boundaries intersect and represent extreme feasible combinations. In real-world contexts, the region shows all possible combinations that satisfy the constraints. Points inside are feasible but may underutilize resources; points on boundaries exactly meet constraints; points outside are impossible. Reading information from the graph—such as maximum values, ranges, and corner points—provides quick insights. Understanding these interpretations is essential for applying systems of inequalities to real-world problems and prepares students for linear programming and optimization, where the goal is to find the best point within the feasible region.",
