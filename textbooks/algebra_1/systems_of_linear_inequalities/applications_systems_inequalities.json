  "expanded_description": "Systems of inequalities are powerful tools for modeling real-world situations with multiple constraints. Budget limits, resource availability, time restrictions, and minimum requirements can all be represented as inequalities. The feasible region shows all possible options that satisfy all constraints, helping decision-makers understand their choices and find optimal solutions.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a real-world problem with a system of inequalities: (1) Identify the variables and define them clearly. (2) Translate each constraint into an inequality. (3) Graph the system to find the feasible region. (4) Interpret the region and its corner points in context. (5) If optimization is needed, evaluate the objective function at each corner point.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of constraints as the rules of a game—you have to work within them. The feasible region is the playing field—all the moves you can make. Each corner point represents an extreme strategy—going all-in on one option or finding a balanced approach. Understanding the playing field helps you make the best possible decision.",

  "summary": "Systems of inequalities model real-world situations with multiple constraints. Manufacturing problems involve resource limits (labor, materials) and sometimes minimum production requirements. Diet and nutrition problems combine minimum requirements (protein) with maximum limits (fat). Budget and finance problems involve spending limits, minimum purchases, and investment caps. Mixture problems deal with combining ingredients subject to availability and quality constraints. To set up these problems: (1) Define variables clearly. (2) Translate each constraint into an inequality—use $\\leq$ for limits, $\\geq$ for minimums. (3) Always include non-negativity constraints ($x \\geq 0$, $y \\geq 0$) for quantities that cannot be negative. (4) Graph the system to visualize the feasible region. The feasible region shows all possible solutions that satisfy every constraint. Corner points represent extreme feasible combinations. Understanding these applications prepares students for linear programming and optimization, where we find the best solution within the feasible region.",
