  "expanded_description": "A system of linear inequalities consists of two or more inequalities that must be satisfied simultaneously. The solution is the region of the coordinate plane where all inequalities overlap—the intersection of their individual solution sets. Graphing these systems visually represents feasible regions and is the foundation for linear programming and optimization problems.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To graph a system of linear inequalities: (1) Graph each inequality separately on the same coordinate plane, using the correct line style (solid or dashed) and shading for each. (2) The solution to the system is the region where the shading overlaps—the area that satisfies all inequalities. (3) If there is no overlap, the system has no solution.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of each inequality as a colored filter. Alone, each filter lets light through a certain region. When you stack the filters, only the areas where all filters are transparent let light through—that's your solution region. If no area is common to all filters, no light gets through (no solution).",

  "summary": "Graphing systems of linear inequalities involves plotting each inequality on the same coordinate plane and identifying the region where all inequalities are satisfied simultaneously. The solution region is the intersection of the individual solution sets. Use different shading patterns or colors to distinguish inequalities. The region may be bounded (a polygon) or unbounded, and its vertices (corner points) are found by solving pairs of boundary line equations. If the shaded regions do not overlap at all, the system has no solution—the conditions are contradictory. In real-world applications, non-negativity constraints ($x \\geq 0$, $y \\geq 0$) are common and restrict the region to the first quadrant. Mastering system graphing is essential for linear programming and optimization problems, where we find the best solution within a feasible region.",
