  "expanded_description": "Horizontal and vertical lines create special cases in inequality graphing. Unlike slanted lines, these boundaries are parallel to the axes and divide the plane into simple regions: above/below for horizontal lines, and left/right for vertical lines. Understanding these cases is essential for graphing systems and for real-world constraints like 'height must be at least 48 inches' or 'age must be less than 65 years.'",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For horizontal lines: $y > b$ shades above the horizontal line $y = b$; $y < b$ shades below. For vertical lines: $x > a$ shades to the right of the vertical line $x = a$; $x < a$ shades to the left. Use solid lines for $\\leq$ or $\\geq$, dashed lines for $<$ or $>$, just as with slanted lines.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of horizontal boundaries as floors and ceilings. $y > 3$ means 'above the 3rd floor'—everything higher than that level. $y \\leq -2$ means 'at or below the basement level -2.' Vertical boundaries are like east-west boundaries: $x > 5$ means 'east of the line x=5,' while $x < 5$ means 'west of that line.'",

For horizontal inequalities of the form $y > b$ or $y \\geq b$, shade above the horizontal line $y = b$; for $y < b$ or $y \\leq b$, shade below. For vertical inequalities of the form $x > a$ or $x \\geq a$, shade to the right of the vertical line $x = a$; for $x < a$ or $x \\leq a$, shade to the left. Use dashed lines for strict inequalities ($<$, $>$) and solid lines for inclusive inequalities ($\\leq$, $\\geq$). Combining horizontal and vertical inequalities creates rectangular regions, which are useful for modeling real-world constraints like height requirements, age limits, temperature ranges, and budget limits. When graphing, pay careful attention to which variable is being constrained—$y$ inequalities are horizontal, $x$ inequalities are vertical. These simple boundaries form the foundation for more complex systems of inequalities and linear programming applications.",
