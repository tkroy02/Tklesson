The main subsets, from most specific to broadest, are Natural Numbers (1, 2, 3...), Whole Numbers (0, 1, 2...), Integers (...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...), Rational Numbers (any number that can be a fraction, including integers and repeating/terminating decimals), and Irrational Numbers (non-repeating, non-terminating decimals like π and √2). All rational and irrational numbers together form the set of Real Numbers. Understanding this structure and how to classify numbers is the essential first step in mastering algebra. Remember to simplify numbers like square roots before classifying, and use the context of a word problem to guide you."
