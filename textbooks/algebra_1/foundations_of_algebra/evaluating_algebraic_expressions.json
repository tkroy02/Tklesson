Key points: 1) **Substitute carefully**: Replace each variable with its given value, using parentheses especially with negatives, fractions, and decimals. 2) **Follow PEMDAS**: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division (left to right), Addition/Subtraction (left to right). 3) **Watch for common errors**: Forgetting parentheses with negatives, mishandling order of operations, making sign errors with subtraction of negatives. 4) **Check your work**: Use estimation, unit analysis, and substitution back into original. 5) **Apply to formulas**: Real-world formulas use the same evaluation process. Mastering evaluation makes algebra practical and prepares you for solving equations and using mathematics in daily life.",
