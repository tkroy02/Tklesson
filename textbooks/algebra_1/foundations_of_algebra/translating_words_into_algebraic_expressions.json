Key points: 1) Learn the common **operation words**: sum/addition, difference/subtraction, product/multiplication, quotient/division. 2) Watch for **order reversals** with phrases like 'less than' and 'subtracted from'—these often flip the order of quantities. 3) Use **parentheses** when an operation applies to a combined quantity. 4) Choose **meaningful variables** and define them clearly. 5) **Read carefully**, break complex phrases into parts, and use test numbers to verify your translation. Mastering this skill allows you to convert real-world problems into solvable algebraic equations, connecting language to mathematics.",
