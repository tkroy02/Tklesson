  "summary": "Exponents provide compact notation for repeated multiplication: bⁿ means b multiplied by itself n times. Key points: 1) **Notation**: bⁿ has base b and exponent n. b² is 'b squared', b³ is 'b cubed'. 2) **Special cases**: b¹ = b, b⁰ = 1 (b ≠ 0). 3) **Geometric meaning**: Squaring (exponent 2) gives area of squares; cubing (exponent 3) gives volume of cubes. 4) **Exponent laws**: bᵐ × bⁿ = bᵐ⁺ⁿ (add exponents when multiplying same base), bᵐ ÷ bⁿ = bᵐ⁻ⁿ (subtract when dividing), (bᵐ)ⁿ = bᵐ×ⁿ (multiply when raising power to power). 5) **Scientific notation**: Expresses large/small numbers as number between 1-10 times power of 10. 6) **Common errors**: Multiplying bases instead of adding exponents, wrong operation for (bᵐ)ⁿ, forgetting exponent applies to coefficients in parentheses. Exponents are essential for algebra, geometry, science, and modeling growth/decay in real world.",
