    "principle": "The distributive property states that multiplying a number by a sum (or difference) is the same as multiplying the number by each term in the sum (or difference) and then adding (or subtracting) the results.",
    "explanation": "Think of the distributive property as 'sharing' or 'distributing' multiplication over addition or subtraction. It's like handing out invitations to a party: if you have 3 envelopes, each containing 2 party invitations and 1 map, you could calculate total items as 3×(2+1) = 3×3 = 9, or as (3×2)+(3×1) = 6+3 = 9. Both methods give the same result.",

Key points: 1) **Distribution**: Multiply the outside term by EACH term inside parentheses. 2) **Signs matter**: Negative multipliers flip signs; -a(b - c) = -ab + ac. 3) **Variables distribute**: x(a + b) = ax + bx; multiply coefficients and add exponents. 4) **Factoring (reverse)**: ab + ac = a(b + c); find GCF of all terms. 5) **Common errors**: Forgetting to distribute to all terms, sign errors with negatives, confusing with other operations. 6) **Multi-step problems**: Distribute all parentheses first, then combine like terms. The distributive property simplifies expressions, solves equations, factors polynomials, and models real-world situations involving groups and scaling.",
