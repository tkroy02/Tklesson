  "summary": "The three fundamental properties of real numbers are powerful tools for manipulation. The **Commutative Property** (for + and ×) allows you to change the *order* of numbers. The **Associative Property** (for + and ×) allows you to change the *grouping* of numbers. The **Distributive Property** connects addition and multiplication, allowing you to multiply a number across a sum: a(b + c) = ab + ac. Remember, commutative and associative properties do **NOT** apply to subtraction or division. These properties are not just rules to memorize—they are reasoning tools that justify every step you take when simplifying expressions and solving equations, forming the logical backbone of algebra.",
