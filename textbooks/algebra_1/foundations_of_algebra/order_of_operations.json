  "summary": "Order of operations, remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction), provides the rules for evaluating mathematical expressions consistently. Key points: 1) Always start with calculations inside **parentheses** (or other grouping symbols), working from innermost outward. 2) Calculate **exponents** next. 3) Perform **multiplication and division** from left to right—they have equal priority. 4) Perform **addition and subtraction** from left to right—they have equal priority. Common mistakes include doing all multiplication before division or all addition before subtraction—remember the left-to-right rule for equal priority operations. PEMDAS ensures everyone gets the same answer to the same mathematical expression, making it essential for mathematics, science, finance, and daily life.",
