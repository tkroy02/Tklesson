  "summary": "Equations are classified by their solution sets into three types. **Conditional equations** have a finite number of solutions (typically one) and are the most common type solved in algebra. **Identities** are true for all values of the variable; when solved, the variable cancels completely, leaving a true statement like $0=0$, $2=2$, or $-3=-3$. The solution set is 'all real numbers' (or all numbers for which the equation is defined). **Contradictions** (equations with no solution) are false for every value of the variable; when solved, the variable cancels completely, leaving a false statement like $0=5$ or $3=7$. The solution set is empty, often denoted as $\\varnothing$ or 'no solution'. To determine the type: 1) Simplify both sides completely. 2) If variable terms remain, solve for the variable (conditional). 3) If variable terms cancel completely, examine the resulting constant statement: if true, it's an identity; if false, it has no solution. Recognizing these special cases prevents errors and deepens understanding of equation structure.",
