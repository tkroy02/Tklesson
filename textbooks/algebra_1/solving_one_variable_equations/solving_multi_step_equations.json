    "explanation": "Solving multi-step equations is like cleaning a messy room before you can find what you're looking for. First, you tidy up (simplify both sides by distributing and combining like terms). Then, you systematically eliminate obstacles (use inverse operations to isolate the variable). The order matters—you prepare the equation before applying solving techniques learned in one-step and two-step equations.",

Key principles: 1) **Simplify first**: Use distributive property to eliminate parentheses and combine like terms on each side separately. 2) **Move variables if needed**: If variable terms appear on both sides, use inverse operations to collect them on one side. 3) **Solve simplified equation**: Apply two-step or one-step solving techniques. 4) **Check thoroughly**: Substitute solution into original equation to verify. 5) **Recognize special cases**: Identities (infinite solutions) occur when simplification yields a true statement like 5=5; no solution occurs when simplification yields a false statement like 3=7. 6) **Common errors**: Distribution mistakes (especially with negatives), incorrect combination of unlike terms, sign errors when moving terms. 7) **Strategic choices**: Clear fractions early, move the smaller variable coefficient, distribute negative signs carefully. Mastering multi-step equations prepares for solving complex real-world problems and advanced algebraic concepts.",
