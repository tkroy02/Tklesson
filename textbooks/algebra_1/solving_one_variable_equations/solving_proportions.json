  "expanded_description": "A proportion is an equation stating that two ratios are equal. Proportions are powerful tools for solving problems involving scaling, similar figures, unit conversion, and many real-world situations. Solving proportions relies on the concept of cross-multiplication and understanding the relationship between equivalent ratios.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A **proportion** is an equation of the form $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}$, where $b \\neq 0$ and $d \\neq 0$. In a proportion, the cross products are equal: $a \\times d = b \\times c$. This property allows us to solve for an unknown term when three of the four values are known.",
    "explanation": "Think of proportions as balanced scales where the ratios on each side are equivalent. Cross-multiplication is like verifying that the scales are balanced by comparing the products of opposite terms. If $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{6}$, then $2 \\times 6 = 3 \\times 4$ (both equal 12).",

  "summary": "A **proportion** is an equation stating that two ratios are equal, written as $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}$ where $b \\neq 0$ and $d \\neq 0$. The fundamental property of proportions is that **cross products are equal**: $a \\times d = b \\times c$. This property allows us to solve for an unknown term when three terms are known. Proportions have widespread applications: **scale drawings and maps** (using scale ratios), **unit conversion** (using conversion factors), **recipes and mixtures** (scaling ingredients), and **percent problems** (using $\\frac{\\text{part}}{\\text{whole}} = \\frac{\\text{percent}}{100}$). When solving proportions, always cross-multiply correctly (numerator of first times denominator of second equals denominator of first times numerator of second), ensure units are consistent, and check that solutions don't make any denominator zero. Mastery of proportions provides a powerful tool for solving real-world problems involving constant relationships and equivalent ratios.",
