    "principle": "To solve a word problem: 1) Read carefully and identify what is being asked. 2) Define a variable for the unknown quantity. 3) Translate the words into a mathematical equation using operations and relationships. 4) Solve the equation. 5) Interpret the solution in the context of the original problem.",
    "explanation": "Think of word problems as stories with missing numbers. Your job is to find the missing numbers by 'translating' the story into the language of math. Key words act as clues: 'is' becomes $=$, 'more than' becomes $+$, 'of' often means multiplication, and 'per' indicates division or rates.",

  "summary": "Solving word problems is a multi-step process that bridges real-world situations and algebraic equations. The key steps are: 1) **Read carefully** to understand the situation and what is being asked. 2) **Define a variable** clearly, stating what it represents. 3) **Translate** the words into an equation using keyword cues: 'is' becomes $=$, 'more than' becomes $+$, 'less than' becomes $-$ (watch order!), 'of' often means multiplication, 'per' indicates division. 4) **Solve** the resulting equation using techniques from previous sections (one-step, two-step, multi-step, variables on both sides, fractions/decimals). 5) **Interpret** the solution in the original context—check for reasonableness, appropriate units, and reject any solutions that don't make sense (like negative dimensions). Common pitfalls include reversing subtraction phrases, mixing units, and forgetting to interpret solutions. Mastery of word problems develops mathematical modeling skills essential for advanced math and real-world applications.",
