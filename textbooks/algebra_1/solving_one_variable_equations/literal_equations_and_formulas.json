  "expanded_description": "Literal equations are equations that contain two or more variables. Formulas, such as those from geometry, physics, or finance, are common examples of literal equations. Solving a literal equation for a specific variable means isolating that variable on one side of the equation, treating all other variables as constants. This skill is essential for rearranging formulas to solve for different quantities.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve a literal equation for a specified variable, use the same inverse operations as solving regular equations, treating the other variables as constants. The goal is to isolate the target variable on one side of the equation.",
    "explanation": "Think of a literal equation as a recipe with multiple ingredients. If you want to know how much of one ingredient is needed based on the others, you rearrange the recipe. The operations are the same as solving for x—add, subtract, multiply, divide—but you work with symbols instead of numbers.",

  "summary": "**Literal equations** are equations with multiple variables, often representing formulas from geometry, science, or finance. Solving for a specific variable means isolating that variable on one side of the equation using the same inverse operations as solving regular equations, treating all other variables as constants. The key steps are: 1) Identify the target variable. 2) Apply inverse operations in reverse order of operations (undo addition/subtraction first, then multiplication/division). 3) If the target variable appears in multiple terms, collect those terms, factor out the variable, then divide by the remaining factor. 4) If the variable is squared, take square roots; if inside a square root, square both sides. 5) If the variable is in a denominator, isolate the fraction containing it, then take reciprocals or cross-multiply. Mastery of literal equations is essential for rearranging formulas in science, engineering, and finance, allowing you to solve for any quantity in a relationship when the others are known.",
