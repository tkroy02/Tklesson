  "expanded_description": "Ratios and rates are used to compare quantities. A ratio compares two quantities of the same type, while a rate compares quantities of different types. Unit rates simplify comparisons by expressing a rate with a denominator of 1. These concepts are essential for understanding proportions, scaling, and real-world applications like speed, pricing, and efficiency.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A **ratio** is a comparison of two quantities using division, often written as $a:b$, $a/b$, or 'a to b'. A **rate** is a ratio comparing quantities with different units (e.g., miles per hour). A **unit rate** is a rate simplified to have a denominator of 1 (e.g., 60 miles per 1 hour).",
    "explanation": "Think of ratios as recipes—they tell you the relative amounts of ingredients. Rates tell you how one quantity changes with another, like speed (distance per time). Unit rates give you a standard for comparison, like price per ounce—they help you find the best deal.",

  "summary": "Ratios and rates are fundamental tools for comparing quantities. A **ratio** compares quantities with the same units and can be written as $a:b$, $\\frac{a}{b}$, or 'a to b'. Ratios should be simplified to lowest terms. A **rate** compares quantities with different units, such as miles per hour or dollars per pound. A **unit rate** is a rate with a denominator of 1, found by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Unit rates are extremely useful for comparison, such as determining the best value when shopping. When working with rates, always ensure units are consistent before comparing. For average rates, use total quantities (total distance ÷ total time) rather than averaging the individual rates. Mastery of ratios and rates provides the foundation for understanding proportions, scaling, and many real-world applications including speed, pricing, efficiency, and mixture problems.",
