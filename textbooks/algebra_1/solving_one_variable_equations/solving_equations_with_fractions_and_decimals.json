To solve equations with decimals: 1) Clear decimals by multiplying both sides by an appropriate power of 10. 2) Solve the resulting integer-coefficient equation using standard methods.",
    "explanation": "Think of fractions and decimals as 'messy numbers' that complicate calculations. Clearing them is like cleaning a dirty window—once cleared, you can see the problem clearly. For fractions, the LCD acts as a common cleaner that removes all denominators. For decimals, multiplying by 10, 100, or 1000 shifts the decimal point to create whole numbers. After clearing, the equation becomes familiar and solvable.",

  "summary": "Equations with fractions and decimals require special handling. Key principles: 1) **Clearing fractions**: Find LCD of all denominators, multiply EVERY term by LCD. This eliminates denominators, creating an equivalent equation with integer coefficients. 2) **Clearing decimals**: Multiply by 10^n where n is the largest number of decimal places in any term. This shifts decimal points to create whole numbers. 3) **Solve resulting equation**: After clearing, use standard solving techniques (one-step, two-step, multi-step, variables on both sides). 4) **Strategic choices**: Clearing is generally best for complex equations; simple ones may be solved directly. 5) **Common errors**: Incorrect LCD/power of 10, not multiplying all terms, arithmetic mistakes in clearing step. 6) **Special cases**: Equations with variables on both sides AND fractions/decimals—clear first, then move variable terms. 7) **Real-world applications**: Money, measurements, recipes, scientific concentrations. 8) **Checking solutions**: Always substitute back into ORIGINAL equation. Mastering these techniques enables solving real-world problems involving non-integer quantities efficiently and accurately.",
