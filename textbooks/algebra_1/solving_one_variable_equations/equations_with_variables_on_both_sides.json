The goal is to get all the variable players on one side so you can work with them together.",

  "summary": "Equations with variables on both sides require strategic movement of terms. Key principles: 1) **Simplify first**: Use distributive property and combine like terms on each side separately. 2) **Move variable terms**: Use addition/subtraction to get all variable terms on one side (typically move the term with smaller coefficient). 3) **Solve resulting equation**: Use two-step or one-step solving techniques. 4) **Recognize special cases**: If variables cancel leaving true statement (e.g., 5=5)→identity (all real numbers). If false statement (e.g., 3=7)→no solution. 5) **Handle fractions/decimals**: Clear fractions by multiplying by LCD; clear decimals by multiplying by power of 10. 6) **Check solutions**: Substitute into original equation. For special cases, test multiple values. 7) **Common errors**: Incorrect sign when moving terms, distribution errors (especially with negatives), misidentifying special cases. 8) **Real-world applications**: Comparing plans, motion problems, break-even analysis. Mastering these equations enables solving complex comparison problems across many contexts.",
