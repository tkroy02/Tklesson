    "principle": "A polynomial is an expression of the form $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0$, where $a_n \\neq 0$ and the exponents are whole numbers. Key vocabulary:<br>• **Term**: A product of a number and a variable raised to a power<br>• **Coefficient**: The numerical factor of a term<br>• **Degree**: The highest exponent in the polynomial<br>• **Leading coefficient**: The coefficient of the term with highest degree<br>• **Constant term**: The term with no variable ($a_0$)<br>• **Monomial**: One term<br>• **Binomial**: Two terms<br>• **Trinomial**: Three terms",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a polynomial as a sentence made up of words (terms). Each word has a number (coefficient) and possibly a variable with an exponent. The degree tells you the 'power' of the sentence—how strong the highest term is. Just as we classify sentences as simple, compound, or complex, we classify polynomials by how many terms they have.",

  "summary": "Polynomials are algebraic expressions with non-negative integer exponents. Each part of a polynomial has a name: **terms** are the parts separated by addition/subtraction; the **coefficient** is the numerical factor of a term; the **degree** is the highest exponent; the **leading coefficient** is the coefficient of the highest-degree term; and the **constant term** has no variable. Polynomials are classified by number of terms (monomial, binomial, trinomial) and by degree (constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic). Writing polynomials in **standard form** (descending powers) makes these features easy to identify. Understanding this vocabulary is essential for all polynomial operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as for solving polynomial equations and graphing polynomial functions.",
