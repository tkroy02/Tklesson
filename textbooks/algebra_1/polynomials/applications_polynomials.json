  "expanded_description": "Polynomials are not just abstract mathematical expressions—they model countless real-world situations. From calculating areas and volumes to predicting profits and projectile motion, polynomials help us understand and solve practical problems. This section explores various applications where polynomial operations are used to find solutions in geometry, business, physics, and more.",
  
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "To solve real-world problems with polynomials:<br>1. Identify the unknown quantities and define variables.<br>2. Translate the situation into polynomial expressions (using formulas like area, volume, profit = revenue - cost, etc.).<br>3. Perform polynomial operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) as needed.<br>4. Interpret the results in the context of the problem.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of polynomials as mathematical models that describe real situations. A rectangle's area is a product of its dimensions—if those dimensions are variable, the area becomes a polynomial. A company's profit is revenue minus cost—both can be polynomials. By working with these polynomials, we can predict outcomes and make decisions.",

  "summary": "Polynomials model a wide range of real-world situations. In geometry, area and perimeter of shapes with variable dimensions lead to polynomial expressions; volume problems produce cubic polynomials. In business, revenue, cost, and profit functions are often polynomials, and break-even points are found by solving polynomial equations. In physics, projectile motion is modeled by quadratic polynomials that give height as a function of time, allowing us to find maximum height and time of flight. Number problems involving consecutive integers lead to polynomial equations that can be solved by factoring. In economics, supply and demand functions intersect at equilibrium points found by solving linear or quadratic equations. When solving application problems, always define variables clearly, set up the correct polynomial expression, solve, and interpret results in context—including rejecting solutions that don't make sense (like negative dimensions). Polynomial applications demonstrate the power of algebra to solve practical problems in business, science, and everyday life.",
