  "summary": "Urine formation is a sophisticated three-stage process beginning with glomerular filtration, where blood plasma is forced through a selective barrier creating protein-free filtrate. Tubular reabsorption then reclaims 99% of this filtrate, including essential nutrients, ions, and water, through active and passive transport mechanisms. Finally, tubular secretion actively adds specific substances like H⁺, K⁺, and organic ions to fine-tune elimination. The countercurrent multiplier system in the loop of Henle establishes a medullary concentration gradient enabling water conservation, while hormonal controls including ADH, aldosterone, and the renin-angiotensin system precisely regulate urine composition in response to physiological needs. Understanding these processes explains both normal kidney function and the origins of various renal disorders revealed by abnormal urine composition."
