The nephron, as the functional unit, performs three essential processes: filtration of blood in the glomerulus, selective reabsorption of valuable substances in the tubules, and active secretion of wastes. This system not only removes metabolic wastes like urea, ammonia, and uric acid but also precisely regulates water balance, electrolyte concentrations, and blood pressure through hormonal controls including ADH and RAAS. The kidney's ability to process 180 liters of plasma daily while producing only 1-2 liters of urine demonstrates its remarkable efficiency in maintaining the body's internal environment."
