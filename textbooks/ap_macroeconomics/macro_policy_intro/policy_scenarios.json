          "final_answer": "The financial crisis requires a comprehensive, phased response: Phase 1 (Months 1-3) provides emergency liquidity through unlimited central bank lending, expanded deposit insurance, and immediate rate cuts to zero to prevent systemic collapse. Phase 2 (Months 3-18) implements financial system repair through stress tests, forced recapitalization, toxic asset purchases ($1-2T), and temporary nationalizations to restore lending capacity. Phase 3 (Months 1-36) supports macroeconomic stabilization with massive fiscal stimulus (5-6% of GDP, $1-1.2T) and quantitative easing ($3-4T) to offset demand collapse. Phase 4 (Years 2-5) guides recovery through gradual normalization, regulatory reforms, and structural adjustments. International coordination through swap lines, synchronized stimulus, and regulatory harmonization is crucial. The exit strategy should be conditional on credit normalization and unemployment below 7%, following a careful sequence of first ending emergency facilities, then fiscal consolidation, and finally rate increases, with clear communication throughout. This comprehensive approach addresses both the financial system breakdown and the resulting macroeconomic collapse, recognizing that normal stabilization tools are insufficient during systemic crises.",

          "statement": "During systemic economic crises—financial collapses, pandemics, major wars—normal policy rules and constraints may be temporarily suspended in favor of extraordinary measures that would be inappropriate during normal times, including massive fiscal deficits, experimental monetary tools, direct market interventions, and suspended inflation targets, with the immediate priority being crisis containment and prevention of irreversible economic damage rather than traditional stabilization objectives.",
          "application": "This principle explains the scale and nature of crisis policy responses, justifies extraordinary measures during emergencies, guides the sequencing of crisis management, demonstrates why different economic thinking applies during collapses, and highlights the importance of having crisis frameworks prepared before emergencies occur.",
          "example": "The global response to the 2008 financial crisis demonstrated this principle—central banks deployed trillions in unconventional liquidity, governments guaranteed banking systems, fiscal deficits reached wartime levels, and normal inflation targeting was suspended, all of which would have been unthinkable during normal times but were essential to prevent total economic collapse.",
          "analogy": "Like emergency medicine—during a heart attack (financial crisis), doctors use extreme measures (defibrillation, strong drugs) that would be dangerous for healthy patients but are essential to save lives, followed by recovery care (restructuring) and eventually a return to normal health maintenance (standard policy), with the understanding that the emergency required temporarily suspending normal medical guidelines.",

  "summary": "Policy scenarios analysis involves applying appropriate fiscal and monetary policies to different economic conditions, with successful stabilization requiring accurate diagnosis of the economic problem, proper tool selection, effective implementation timing, and careful policy coordination. Demand shocks allow relatively straightforward countercyclical responses, while supply shocks create difficult inflation-output tradeoffs requiring balanced approaches. Crisis scenarios necessitate extraordinary measures beyond normal stabilization tools, including financial system interventions, massive stimulus, and international coordination. Effective policy requires understanding these different scenarios, recognizing the distinct challenges each presents, and implementing tailored responses that consider timing, magnitude, sequencing, and exit strategies while managing the inherent limitations and tradeoffs of macroeconomic management."
