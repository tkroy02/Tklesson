          "final_answer": "The growth acceleration strategy requires a comprehensive supply-side policy package shifting both short-run and long-run AS curves rightward. The $500B annual public investment (2.5% of GDP) should target R&D (1% of GDP increase), education (0.5% of GDP increase), and infrastructure (1% of GDP increase) to boost productivity growth from 1.2% to 1.8%. Complementary private investment incentives ($150B annually in tax expenditures) should increase the investment rate from 20% to 23% of GDP, accelerating capital deepening. This coordinated approach will increase potential output growth from 2% to 3% annually, reaching $26.88T in year 10 versus $24.38T under baseline growth—a $2.5T permanent output increase. The policy requires careful demand management to ensure AD grows at 3% annually to match the expanding supply potential without creating inflationary gaps. Financing through expenditure reprioritization, future growth dividends, and temporary deficits is feasible, with net fiscal benefits turning positive after 8 years. The AD-AS framework demonstrates that sustainable growth acceleration requires permanent AS curve shifts through productivity enhancements and capital accumulation, coordinated with stable demand growth to realize the full benefits without macroeconomic instability.",

          "application": "This principle explains the fundamental drivers of long-term prosperity, guides growth-oriented policy design, demonstrates why supply-side measures have permanent effects unlike demand management, shows the importance of policy coordination across time horizons, and highlights the role of institutions and human capital in economic development.",
          "example": "The information technology revolution (1990s) demonstrated this principle—productivity growth from computerization and internet adoption shifted the LRAS rightward, enabling the 'Goldilocks economy' with strong growth and low inflation, showing how supply-side improvements can simultaneously achieve multiple policy objectives.",

  "summary": "The AD-AS framework provides a comprehensive analytical tool for understanding macroeconomic policy goals and their implementation. Output and employment stabilization policies operate primarily through AD shifts to close output gaps, while price stability policies manage AD to control inflation, with the disinflation tradeoff creating temporary output costs. Long-run growth policies focus on shifting AS curves through productivity enhancements and structural reforms to increase potential output. Successful macroeconomic management requires understanding these different policy mechanisms, recognizing the tradeoffs between objectives, coordinating demand and supply measures appropriately, and implementing policies with proper timing, magnitude, and sequencing while accounting for economic conditions, policy lags, and expectations formation within the integrated AD-AS system."
