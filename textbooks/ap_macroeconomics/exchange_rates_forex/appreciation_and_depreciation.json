  "summary": "Currency appreciation and depreciation represent fundamental price adjustments in international economics with complex causes and far-reaching consequences. These movements are driven by multiple factors including interest rate differentials, inflation expectations, current account dynamics, economic growth prospects, commodity prices, and risk sentiment, with different drivers dominating in different contexts. The economic impacts are multifaceted and often contradictory—depreciation typically improves trade competitiveness but increases inflation and foreign debt burdens, while appreciation has opposite effects. Measurement requires multiple approaches including nominal vs real rates and bilateral vs effective indices to capture different economic dimensions. Critically, exchange rate movements create significant redistribution between sectors and groups, generating both winners and losers that make exchange rate management politically contentious. Successful navigation of currency value changes requires understanding these complex dynamics and implementing complementary policies to manage the adjustment process and mitigate undesirable distributional consequences while harnessing the potential benefits for economic rebalancing and growth."
