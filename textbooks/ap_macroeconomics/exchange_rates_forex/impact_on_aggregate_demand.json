          "application": "This principle explains why exchange rate depreciation doesn't always stimulate economic growth, demonstrates the importance of estimating trade elasticities, shows why the J-curve phenomenon occurs, illustrates the conditions for successful expenditure switching, and highlights that countries with inelastic trade may need complementary supply-side policies to benefit from exchange rate changes.",
          "example": "A commodity-exporting country with price-inelastic exports (where volumes don't respond much to price changes) may find that currency depreciation reduces export revenues in foreign currency terms, worsening the trade balance despite the nominal depreciation, particularly if imports are also essential and price-inelastic.",

          "example": "In many emerging markets, currency depreciation stimulates immediate inflation because industries lack spare capacity to increase production, causing the multiplier effect to manifest as price increases rather than output expansion, unlike in economies with significant unemployment and idle capacity where the same depreciation can generate substantial real growth.",

  "summary": "Exchange rates exert powerful influence on aggregate demand primarily through the net export channel, where depreciation typically stimulates economic activity by improving trade competitiveness and increasing net exports, while appreciation has contractionary effects. The effectiveness of this transmission depends critically on the Marshall-Lerner condition being satisfied and adequate trade elasticities. The initial impact multiplies through the economy via consumption and investment channels, though supply constraints often limit the realization of theoretical multiplier values. Policy use of exchange rates for demand management involves complex tradeoffs with inflation control, financial stability, and income distribution objectives, requiring integrated policy frameworks that combine exchange rate adjustments with complementary monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential measures. Successful demand management through exchange rates necessitates careful calibration, timing consideration of J-curve effects, protection of vulnerable groups, maintenance of financial stability, and clear communication to manage expectations. The exchange rate thus represents a potent but double-edged policy instrument that can significantly influence economic activity but requires sophisticated multi-instrument management to harness its benefits while mitigating its costs and risks."
