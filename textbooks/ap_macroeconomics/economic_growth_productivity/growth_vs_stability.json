          "application": "This principle explains why successful economic transitions typically follow stability-then-growth sequences, demonstrates how to prioritize policy objectives in different conditions, shows why simultaneous pursuit of multiple objectives often fails, illustrates the importance of institutional prerequisites for growth policies, and highlights that optimal policy design involves temporal sequencing rather than attempting to resolve tradeoffs instantaneously.",
          "example": "Chile's successful economic development in the 1990s followed a sequence of first achieving macroeconomic stability through fiscal discipline and inflation control, then implementing structural reforms and growth-oriented policies, avoiding the instability that plagued other Latin American countries attempting simultaneous stabilization and reform.",

  "summary": "The growth-stability dilemma represents one of the most fundamental challenges in economic policymaking, involving tensions between pursuing rapid long-term expansion and maintaining short-term stability across monetary, fiscal, structural, and external policy domains. Effective approaches involve recognizing that these tradeoffs cannot be eliminated but can be managed through careful policy design, strategic sequencing, adequate compensation, and institutional frameworks that balance rules with flexibility. Macroeconomic policy frameworks should combine clear stability anchors with constrained discretion, structural reform implementation requires sequencing that builds momentum while managing transition costs, and political economy strategies must build support through coalition-building and communication. Successful growth-stability balancing typically follows sequences that establish stability foundations before pursuing growth acceleration, uses compensation mechanisms to address adjustment costs, maintains policy credibility through consistent frameworks, and employs continuous monitoring and adjustment based on outcomes. While specific approaches depend on economic conditions, institutional capacity, and social preferences, the common theme is that neither growth nor stability can be sustainably achieved without attention to the other, requiring integrated strategies rather than isolated interventions."
