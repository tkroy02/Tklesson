          "application": "This principle explains why growth successes are context-specific and difficult to replicate, demonstrates the importance of implementation analysis in policy design, shows why binding constraint identification is crucial for effective intervention, illustrates the gap between theoretical optimal policies and practical feasibility, and highlights that successful growth strategies require both good design and effective implementation capacity.",
          "example": "China's growth success involved pragmatic, sequenced reforms that addressed binding constraints (starting with agricultural incentives, then special economic zones, then SOE reform) rather than comprehensive big-bang approaches, with continuous adaptation based on implementation experience and local conditions.",
          "analogy": "Like repairing a complex machine—first diagnose which component is most critically malfunctioning (binding constraint), then acquire the right tools and skills for that specific repair (targeted intervention), recognizing that even with perfect diagnosis and tools, the repair might require multiple attempts, adjustments, and dealing with unexpected complications (implementation challenges) before the machine operates optimally.",

  "summary": "The Long Run Aggregate Supply curve represents the economy's productive potential at full employment, with economic growth occurring through rightward LRAS shifts driven by capital accumulation, technological progress, human capital development, and institutional improvements. Growth theories provide complementary frameworks for understanding these expansion processes—neoclassical models emphasizing catch-up through investment and technology adoption, endogenous growth theories explaining innovation-driven advancement, and institutional approaches highlighting governance and incentive structures. Practical growth policy requires identifying binding constraints through diagnostics and designing targeted interventions, while addressing substantial implementation challenges including political economy constraints, state capacity limitations, and contextual specificity. Successful growth strategies combine theoretical insights with pragmatic adaptation, careful sequencing, and continuous learning from implementation experience. The LRAS framework thus provides both a theoretical understanding of long-run economic capacity and a practical guide for designing policies that sustainably expand productive potential and improve living standards over time."
