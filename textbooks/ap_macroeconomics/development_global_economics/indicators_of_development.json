          "application": "This principle explains why unadjusted GDP comparisons can misrepresent development levels, demonstrates the importance of PPP adjustments for meaningful international comparisons, shows how sectoral analysis reveals development stages, illustrates why growth rates must be interpreted in convergence context, and highlights that economic indicators alone cannot capture human development progress.",

    "Sustainability Indicators"
  ],
  "summary": "Economic development measurement has evolved from narrow economic indicators to comprehensive multidimensional frameworks capturing health, education, inequality, sustainability, and institutional dimensions. Traditional metrics like GDP and GNI provide essential economic scale measurements but require critical adjustments for population (per capita), prices (real values), and international comparisons (PPP) while acknowledging limitations in capturing non-market activities, environmental costs, and distributional aspects. Human development indicators, particularly the Human Development Index, expand measurement to capability expansion through health, education, and living standards dimensions, often revealing education as the binding constraint in developing countries. Modern development assessment further incorporates inequality measures tracking benefit distribution, sustainability metrics evaluating environmental impacts, and governance indicators measuring institutional quality. Comprehensive development analysis demonstrates that successful development requires balanced progress across economic, social, and environmental dimensions, with appropriate strategies varying by development level but all requiring transitions toward more inclusive and sustainable patterns that meet current needs without compromising future generations' capabilities, supported by global cooperation and differentiated responsibilities based on historical contributions and current capacities."
