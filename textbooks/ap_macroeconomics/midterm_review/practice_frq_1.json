  "summary": "Effective FRQ performance requires integrating content knowledge with strategic exam skills. Successful approaches begin with careful analysis of question requirements and point allocation, followed by systematic time management that allocates minutes proportionally to points. Organization is crucial—clear labeling of each part, logical flow within responses, and professional presentation that makes grading straightforward. Graphical components must be correctly constructed with proper labels, curves, shifts, and equilibrium points. Calculations should show all work with correct formulas and units. Explanations must demonstrate economic reasoning using proper terminology rather than just stating conclusions. Common errors—confusing nominal and real values, misdrawing graphs, oversimplifying policy analysis—can be avoided through awareness and systematic checking. Strategic approaches like answering easier questions first, showing work for partial credit, and building in review time can significantly improve scores. Ultimately, FRQ success tests both economic understanding and the ability to communicate that understanding clearly, completely, and efficiently within time constraints, making strategic practice as important as content review."
