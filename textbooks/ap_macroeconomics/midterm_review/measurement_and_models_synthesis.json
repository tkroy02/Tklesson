The life-cycle model performs best overall with highest R² (0.88), lowest AIC (1150), best out-of-sample forecast accuracy (RMSE=1.8), and no specification problems. The Keynesian model provides reasonable short-run predictions but shows specification issues (RESET test p=0.02). The permanent income hypothesis has theoretical appeal but poorer empirical performance (RMSE=3.1) and heteroskedasticity issues. The life-cycle model's estimates (MPC from current income=0.60, wealth effect=0.08) are economically sensible and close to theoretical predictions. However, different models may be preferred for different applications: life-cycle for comprehensive analysis and forecasting, PIH for long-run theoretical consistency, and Keynesian for pedagogical simplicity. The analysis demonstrates that model selection should consider both statistical performance and the specific purpose of the analysis, with the life-cycle model emerging as the preferred choice for most empirical applications while recognizing the theoretical insights from all frameworks.",

  "summary": "The synthesis of measurement and models represents the core of modern economic analysis, bridging abstract theoretical frameworks with concrete empirical reality. Economic indicators provide the measurable quantities that models attempt to explain, while models provide the conceptual frameworks for understanding what these measurements mean. Statistical methods enable parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, but require careful attention to identification problems that prevent causal interpretation. Model selection involves evaluating competing frameworks based on multiple criteria including in-sample fit, theoretical consistency, forecasting performance, and robustness, with different models often excelling for different purposes. This integration has transformed economics into an empirically-driven science while maintaining theoretical rigor, creating a continuous feedback loop where measurement improvements enable better model testing and refinement, while theoretical advances guide more meaningful measurement. Successful economic analysis requires recognizing that all models are approximations, that measurement always involves error, and that the optimal approach depends on the specific question being asked and the available data quality. The synthesis demonstrates that economic understanding emerges from the careful, iterative integration of theoretical insight with empirical evidence."
