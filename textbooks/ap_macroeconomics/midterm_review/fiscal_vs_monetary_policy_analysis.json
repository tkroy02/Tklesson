The optimal approach involves coordination: $300B fiscal stimulus with 50bp monetary easing produces $600B output gain (60% gap closure) while minimizing individual policy risks. Given the proximity to the zero lower bound (rates at 0.5%), fiscal policy takes precedence with monetary accommodation to prevent crowding out.

          "final_answer": "The policy coordination game reveals a fundamental conflict between fiscal and monetary authorities in the current economic environment (6% unemployment, 3% inflation). Without coordination, the strategic interaction produces cycling between contradictory policies—fiscal stimulus met by monetary offset, followed by fiscal austerity with monetary accommodation—resulting in mediocre growth (2%) with elevated inflation (3.25%). This non-cooperative equilibrium represents a significant welfare loss compared to coordinated outcomes. The analysis identifies two superior coordinated solutions: (1) Austerity with monetary accommodation produces 1% growth with 2.5% inflation, sacrificing some growth for better inflation control; or (2) A modified mandate approach where both authorities internalize the other's objectives. The optimal institutional design involves clear policy assignments with built-in coordination mechanisms—such as joint forecasting, explicit reaction functions, and escape clauses for extreme conditions—that prevent the coordination failures inherent in separate decision-making. This demonstrates that in intermediate economic conditions where objectives conflict, explicit coordination or institutional redesign is necessary to achieve superior macroeconomic outcomes.",

  "summary": "The comparative analysis of fiscal and monetary policy reveals distinct strengths, limitations, and appropriate domains for each tool. Fiscal policy excels during deep recessions, especially at the zero lower bound, with potentially large multipliers but suffers from implementation lags and political constraints. Monetary policy provides quicker response for normal fluctuations but faces transmission lags and effectiveness limits near the zero bound. Policy effectiveness is strongly state-dependent, with optimal instrument choice varying over the business cycle. Implementation constraints—particularly different lag structures—create natural sequencing where monetary policy serves as first responder while fiscal policy provides sustained support. Policy interactions can be complementary (mutual reinforcement) or contradictory (offsetting effects), requiring careful coordination or clear assignment of responsibilities. The modern consensus assigns monetary policy to price stability with operational independence, while fiscal policy focuses on long-term growth and distribution, with automatic stabilizers handling normal cyclical stabilization. During extreme conditions, coordinated response becomes essential. Successful macroeconomic management requires understanding these comparative advantages, institutional constraints, and interaction effects to deploy the right policy mix for specific economic circumstances while maintaining credible long-term frameworks."
