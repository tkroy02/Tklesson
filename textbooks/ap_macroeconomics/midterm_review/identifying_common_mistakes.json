  "summary": "Systematic error analysis reveals that most student mistakes follow predictable patterns that can be categorized as conceptual misunderstandings, graphical/technical errors, or computational/procedural mistakes. Conceptual errors are most consequential, representing fundamental gaps in economic understanding that affect multiple applications. Graphical errors often reflect failures in economic communication despite conceptual knowledge. Computational errors typically stem from procedural failures rather than mathematical inability. Effective error prevention requires targeted strategies: for conceptual errors, focus on deep understanding and conditional reasoning; for graphical errors, use systematic construction checklists; for computational errors, implement verification procedures and reality checks. The most successful approach involves transforming error analysis from reactive correction to proactive learning—identifying personal error patterns, developing prevention strategies, and using mistakes as opportunities to deepen economic understanding. By categorizing errors, analyzing root causes, and implementing systematic prevention approaches, students can significantly improve performance while developing more robust economic reasoning skills that serve beyond examination contexts."
