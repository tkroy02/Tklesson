  "summary": "Comparative advantage revisited reveals the sophisticated dynamics of international specialization beyond simple static models. The fundamental insight remains that countries benefit from specializing based on relative opportunity costs rather than absolute productivity, with gains distributed according to the terms of trade. However, comparative advantage evolves dynamically through learning effects, technological progress, and strategic policies, allowing countries to develop new advantages over time. The distributional consequences are crucial—while trade creates aggregate gains, it also produces winners and losers based on factor abundances, with unskilled workers in developed countries often facing adjustment costs. Successful trade policy requires not only opening markets but also managing transitions through compensation mechanisms, adjustment assistance, and strategic industrial policies. Understanding these complexities enables more nuanced trade policy that maximizes benefits while addressing legitimate concerns about distributional effects and adjustment costs, creating the potential for trade to contribute to broad-based economic development rather than just aggregate growth."
