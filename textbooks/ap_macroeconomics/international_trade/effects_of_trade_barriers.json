  "summary": "The effects of trade barriers extend across multiple dimensions with generally negative economic consequences. Static efficiency losses from misallocated resources and reduced consumption create immediate welfare reductions, while dynamic effects on innovation, productivity, and technological progress can permanently lower economic growth trajectories. Distributionally, protectionism typically creates regressive transfers from consumers to protected producers at high cost per job saved. Systemically, trade barriers can trigger retaliatory cycles that disrupt global value chains and reduce economic resilience, with costs that often exceed benefits by large multiples. While specific circumstances may justify limited, temporary protection under strict conditions, the overwhelming economic evidence indicates that open trade policies generally produce superior outcomes for economic growth, innovation, and living standards. Successful trade policy requires addressing legitimate concerns about adjustment costs and distributional effects through targeted measures like adjustment assistance and social safety nets rather than blanket protectionism that creates larger economic costs than the problems it aims to solve."
