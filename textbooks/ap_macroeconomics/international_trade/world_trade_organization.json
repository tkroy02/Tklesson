Success requires balancing the need for updated rules with maintaining the inclusivity that gives the WTO its legitimacy.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that WTO reform involves complex tradeoffs between efficiency and inclusivity, legal certainty and flexibility, and addressing new challenges while maintaining existing achievements. No single solution exists, but a package approach with gradual implementation offers the best prospects for maintaining a rules-based multilateral trading system.",

  "summary": "The World Trade Organization represents the institutional embodiment of the multilateral trading system, providing the legal and organizational framework for global trade governance. Built on core principles of non-discrimination, transparency, and rules-based dispute settlement, the WTO has contributed significantly to trade liberalization and economic growth since its establishment. However, the organization faces profound challenges including the paralysis of its dispute settlement system, difficulties in multilateral negotiations, and the need to address new trade issues like digital commerce and environmental sustainability. Successful reform requires balancing the need for updated rules with maintaining the inclusivity that gives the WTO its legitimacy, addressing both institutional issues like the Appellate Body crisis and substantive gaps in coverage. The future relevance of the WTO depends on its ability to adapt to changing global economic realities while preserving the core principles that have made the rules-based trading system a foundation of post-war prosperity. As trade continues to evolve with technological change and shifting global power dynamics, the WTO must find ways to maintain its role as the central institution for global trade governance while accommodating diverse member interests and addressing contemporary challenges."
