This inflationary gap triggers automatic adjustment mechanisms: labor shortages push wages up, capacity constraints push prices up, and the SRAS curve shifts leftward. The economy gradually moves toward long-run equilibrium at potential output of $20T with a higher price level of approximately 108.8. The adjustment involves temporary inflation as the price level increases from 105 to 108.8 overall, with the economy experiencing both demand-pull inflation (initial move from 105 to 108) and cost-push inflation (subsequent move from 108 to 108.8). This demonstrates the self-correcting nature of market economies and the different time dimensions of economic adjustments—short-run equilibria can persist away from potential output, but long-run equilibrium always returns to potential output through wage and price flexibility.",

          "final_answer": "The policy stabilization analysis reveals different approaches to addressing a $800B recessionary gap: A $400B infrastructure program would increase output by $600B, covering 75% of the gap with direct job creation but facing implementation lags. A 2% interest rate cut could increase output by $1,400B through investment stimulation, more than covering the gap but risking overshooting and future inflation. A combined approach using $200B fiscal stimulus and 1% rate cut would increase output by $1,000B, effectively closing the gap while minimizing individual policy risks. The comparison shows fiscal policy offers targeted benefits but faces political and implementation delays, while monetary policy provides potent broad stimulus but with less control and inflation risks. The combined approach leverages the strengths of both while mitigating their individual limitations. However, all demand-side policies face implementation lags (6-18 months for full effect) and cannot permanently increase output beyond potential—they only accelerate the return to potential output. The analysis highlights that effective stabilization requires considering not just the magnitude of response but also timing, risks, coordination, and the balance between temporary demand management and permanent supply-side improvements.",

  "summary": "Macroeconomic equilibrium occurs where aggregate demand equals aggregate supply, simultaneously determining output, employment, and price levels. The AD-AS model provides the framework for analyzing economic fluctuations, with business cycles resulting from shifts in AD and AS curves that create new equilibrium positions. Demand shocks cause output and prices to move together in the short run, while supply shocks cause them to move in opposite directions. The economy features self-correcting mechanisms that automatically move it toward long-run equilibrium at potential output, though this adjustment can be slow and painful. Stabilization policies using fiscal and monetary tools can moderate fluctuations by shifting aggregate demand, but face limitations including implementation lags, forecasting uncertainties, and difficult tradeoffs between competing objectives like output stabilization and price stability. Effective economic management requires correctly identifying shock types, choosing appropriate policy responses, considering timing and coordination issues, and balancing short-run stabilization with long-run growth objectives. The AD-AS framework demonstrates why both demand-side and supply-side policies are important and why understanding equilibrium dynamics is crucial for effective macroeconomic stewardship."
