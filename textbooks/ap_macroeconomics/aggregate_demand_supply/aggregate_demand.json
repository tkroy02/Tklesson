The net result is a $775 billion AD decrease (4% contraction), demonstrating how monetary conditions and exchange rates can overwhelm fiscal policy in influencing aggregate demand. The analysis highlights investment's sensitivity to interest rates, the significant impact of exchange rates on trade balances, the moderate wealth effect on consumption, and the substantial but limited power of fiscal stimulus. This illustrates why coordinated macroeconomic policy—aligning monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies—is often more effective than relying on any single policy tool.",

          "final_answer": "The analysis clearly distinguishes AD movements from shifts: The price level increase causes movement along the AD curve as the wealth, interest rate, and trade effects reduce the quantity of real GDP demanded. All other scenarios cause AD shifts—infrastructure spending shifts AD rightward through fiscal policy, interest rate increases shift AD leftward through monetary policy, consumer confidence declines shift AD leftward through expectations, trading partner recessions shift AD leftward through reduced exports, and currency depreciation shifts AD rightward through improved trade competitiveness. This distinction is crucial for macroeconomic analysis: movements along AD represent the economy's automatic response to price changes, while AD shifts represent fundamental changes in spending behavior due to policy, expectations, or external factors. Understanding this difference helps predict how various economic events will affect output and prices—movements along AD primarily affect quantity demanded given the curve's slope, while AD shifts change the entire relationship between price level and output, potentially creating new equilibrium positions in the AD-AS framework.",

          "application": "This principle provides the logical foundation for AD-AS analysis, explains why economic shocks have different effects than price adjustments, guides policy impact prediction, enables clear distinction between different types of economic changes, and forms the basis for comparative statics in macroeconomic modeling.",
          "example": "The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act represented an AD shift—increased government spending shifted the AD curve rightward at every price level, while the price level changes during the recovery represented movements along the new AD curve as the economy adjusted.",

  "summary": "Aggregate demand represents the total spending on goods and services in an economy at different price levels, consisting of consumption (determined by income, wealth, and expectations), investment (influenced by interest rates, technology, and business confidence), government spending (policy-determined), and net exports (affected by exchange rates and foreign income). The aggregate demand curve slopes downward due to three effects: the wealth effect (price changes affect real balances and consumption), the interest rate effect (price changes influence money demand and interest-sensitive spending), and the international trade effect (price changes alter international competitiveness). Crucially, movements along a fixed AD curve occur due to price level changes, while shifts of the entire AD curve result from changes in its underlying determinants like fiscal policy, monetary policy, consumer confidence, and external conditions. Understanding aggregate demand components, slope determinants, and shift factors provides the foundation for analyzing economic fluctuations, designing stabilization policies, and predicting how various shocks will affect output and prices in the complete AD-AS framework."
