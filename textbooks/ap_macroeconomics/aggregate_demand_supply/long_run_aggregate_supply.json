In Scenario A, a 10% AD increase would initially boost output toward potential through movement along the SRAS curve, but in the long run, the economy would return to the $20T potential output level through wage and price adjustments, with the ultimate price level depending on monetary conditions. In Scenario B, an 8% AD decrease would deepen the recession initially but would still eventually return to $20T potential output through even larger price and wage adjustments. The key insight is that in the long run, regardless of AD changes, output returns to potential because nominal variables fully adjust—wages become flexible, prices clear markets, and expectations align with reality. This demonstrates money neutrality in the long run: nominal demand changes affect only the price level, not real output, which is determined solely by the economy's productive capacity. The adjustment typically takes 2-4 years as contracts expire and expectations update.",

          "final_answer": "The SRAS-LRAS transition analysis demonstrates the economy's self-correcting mechanism: Beginning with a $1T recessionary gap (5% below potential at $19T output), an AD increase initially moves the economy to a $20.5T inflationary gap (2.5% above potential) with prices rising to 105. In the short run, the economy operates above potential due to sticky wages and prices. However, this situation triggers automatic adjustments: labor shortages push wages up, capacity constraints push prices up, and the SRAS curve gradually shifts leftward. Over approximately 2 years, the economy returns to long-run equilibrium at potential output of $20T but with a higher price level of 110. This transition involves temporary inflation (5% in the first year, 4.8% in the second) as the price level adjusts to the increased AD. The analysis demonstrates several key principles: (1) The economy naturally returns to potential output in the long run through wage and price flexibility, (2) Demand changes affect output only temporarily but prices permanently, (3) There's a short-run tradeoff between inflation and output but no long-run tradeoff, and (4) Policy choices involve balancing the speed of adjustment against inflation costs.",

          "application": "This principle explains business cycle patterns, justifies the vertical long-run Phillips curve, demonstrates the limits of demand management, predicts inflation dynamics during adjustments, and highlights the importance of considering both short-run and long-run effects in policy design.",
          "example": "The Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s demonstrated this principle—tight monetary policy initially caused deep recession (short-run output effect) but eventually reduced inflation without permanent output loss (long-run money neutrality) as wages and prices adjusted to the new monetary regime.",

  "summary": "The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical at the economy's potential output level, representing the maximum sustainable production when all resources are fully employed at their normal utilization rates. Potential output is determined solely by real supply-side factors including the quantity and quality of labor, physical and human capital, natural resources, technology, and economic institutions. The vertical LRAS reflects the classical dichotomy and money neutrality—in the long run, changes in aggregate demand affect only the price level, not real output, as wages and prices become fully flexible. Economic growth occurs through rightward shifts of the LRAS curve driven by accumulation of productive resources and increases in total factor productivity. The crucial distinction between SRAS (upward-sloping due to nominal rigidities) and LRAS (vertical with full flexibility) explains why demand policies have only temporary output effects but supply policies can permanently increase potential output. The economy automatically adjusts from short-run equilibria to long-run potential output through wage-price adjustments and expectation updates, demonstrating self-correcting mechanisms that ensure output returns to its natural level in the long run regardless of short-run demand fluctuations."
