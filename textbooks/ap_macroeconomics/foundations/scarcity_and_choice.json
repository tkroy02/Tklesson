The command economy attempts equitable distribution through central planning but typically results in chronic shortages, poor quality, and black markets due to information problems and lack of incentives. The mixed economy seeks to balance efficiency and equity through market mechanisms supplemented by affordable housing programs, rent controls, and zoning regulations, though it faces challenges of regulatory complexity and unintended consequences. No system perfectly solves the scarcity problem—each represents a different trade-off between efficiency and equity, with the mixed approach attempting to mitigate the worst shortcomings of both pure systems while accepting some inefficiencies and implementation challenges.",

  "summary": "Scarcity—the fundamental economic problem of limited resources and unlimited wants—necessitates choice and underlies all economic activity. This condition forces trade-offs measured by opportunity costs, the value of forgone alternatives. Different economic systems emerge as institutional responses to scarcity: market economies rely on price signals and decentralized decision-making, command economies use central planning, and mixed economies combine both approaches. The concept of scarcity applies universally, affecting individuals' time allocation, businesses' capital investment decisions, and societies' budget priorities. Understanding scarcity and opportunity cost provides the foundation for rational decision-making, efficient resource allocation, and analysis of how societies organize economic activity to address the perpetual challenge of limited resources meeting unlimited human wants."
