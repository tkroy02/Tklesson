With terms of trade of 1 car = 0.8 computers, both countries benefit from specialization and exchange. Country A gains 0.3 computers for each car traded (receiving 0.8 computers vs. producing 0.5 domestically), while Country B effectively obtains cars at a cost of 0.8 computers each vs. 1.0 computer domestically.

  "summary": "Opportunity cost and tradeoffs form the foundation of economic decision-making, representing the true cost of choices as the value of the next best alternative forgone. Cost-benefit analysis provides a systematic framework for evaluating decisions by quantifying and comparing all relevant costs and benefits, including opportunity costs, while properly accounting for the time value of money through discounting. The production possibilities curve graphically illustrates societal tradeoffs and opportunity costs, showing how resources allocated to one good reduce production of another. Comparative advantage, determined by opportunity cost differences, enables gains from specialization and trade that allow countries to consume beyond their production possibilities. Understanding these concepts enables more rational decision-making at individual, business, and societal levels, ensuring that scarce resources are allocated to their highest-valued uses and that the true costs of choices are properly considered in pursuit of economic efficiency and welfare maximization."
