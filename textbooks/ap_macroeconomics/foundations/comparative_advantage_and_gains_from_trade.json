          "final_answer": "While the basic comparative advantage model provides the fundamental insight that trade benefits all countries through specialization based on opportunity cost differences, real-world trade patterns are influenced by multiple additional factors. Economies of scale can create advantages beyond initial resource endowments. Rapid technological change makes comparative advantages dynamic rather than static. Government policies like subsidies can artificially create or destroy comparative advantages. Environmental regulations affect production costs and trade patterns. These factors help explain why countries trade similar products (intra-industry trade), why comparative advantages shift over time (as seen with East Asian technological development), and why simple resource-based predictions sometimes fail. The basic comparative advantage principle remains valid—countries benefit from specializing where their opportunity costs are relatively low—but the determinants of those opportunity costs are more complex than the simple model suggests, involving scale, technology, policy, and dynamic learning effects.",

  "summary": "Comparative advantage provides the fundamental economic rationale for international trade by demonstrating that countries benefit from specializing in goods where they have lower opportunity costs and trading for other goods. This principle shows that trade is mutually beneficial even when one country has absolute advantage in all goods, as long as opportunity cost differences exist. Gains from trade arise because specialization enables more efficient global resource allocation, allowing countries to consume beyond their production possibilities frontiers. While the basic model focuses on static comparative advantage determined by existing opportunity costs, real-world trade patterns are also influenced by economies of scale, product differentiation, technological change, and government policies. Countries can actively develop dynamic comparative advantages through investment in education, technology, and infrastructure. Understanding comparative advantage is essential for analyzing trade patterns, evaluating trade policies, and recognizing how globalization creates mutual benefits through voluntary exchange while also explaining why countries develop particular specialization patterns in the global economy."
