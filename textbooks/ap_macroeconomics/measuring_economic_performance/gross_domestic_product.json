However, the more comprehensive Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) of $18.5 trillion indicates welfare is actually 7.5% below GDP, reflecting significant environmental costs ($2T), income inequality ($1T adjustment), and defensive expenditures ($1.5T for defense). The large leisure value adjustment ($5T) substantially affects results but is methodologically controversial. Per capita measures range from $57,813 (GPI) to $65,625 (NEW), compared to $62,500 for GDP per capita. These results demonstrate that while GDP provides a useful measure of market economic activity, it significantly misrepresents overall economic welfare by excluding valuable non-market production, ignoring environmental costs, and failing to account for distributional concerns. Policymakers seeking to maximize societal wellbeing should consider these complementary measures alongside traditional GDP growth.",

  "summary": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) serves as the primary measure of national economic output, calculable through three equivalent approaches—expenditure (summing consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports), income (summing factor payments plus adjustments), and value-added (summing value added at each production stage). The crucial distinction between nominal GDP (measured in current prices) and real GDP (adjusted for inflation using constant prices) enables accurate assessment of economic growth and living standards changes. While GDP provides essential information about market economic activity and serves as the foundation for business cycle analysis and policy evaluation, it has significant limitations as a comprehensive welfare measure, excluding non-market production, ignoring environmental costs, and failing to account for income distribution and quality-of-life factors. This has stimulated development of alternative indicators including Net Economic Welfare, Genuine Progress Indicator, and Human Development Index that provide more complete assessments of societal wellbeing. Understanding both the power and limitations of GDP is essential for meaningful economic analysis, effective policy design, and comprehensive assessment of economic progress and living standards."
