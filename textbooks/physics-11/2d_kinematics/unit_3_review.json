  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review of all topics covered in Unit 3: 2D Kinematics. It synthesizes the key concepts of vector resolution, projectile motion, and relative velocity in two dimensions, preparing students for assessment and future applications in dynamics and circular motion.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Unit 3 extends kinematics to two dimensions by treating perpendicular directions independently. Vector resolution, projectile motion, and relative velocity all rely on the same fundamental principle: motion in the x‑ and y‑directions can be analyzed separately using 1D kinematics, then combined to find resultant vectors.",
    "explanation": "The independence of perpendicular motions allows us to break complex 2D problems into simpler 1D components. Whether analyzing a projectile's curved path, a boat crossing a river, or an airplane flying in wind, the component method provides a systematic approach. Understanding these connections is essential for success in dynamics, circular motion, and beyond.",

  "summary": "Unit 3: 2D Kinematics extended motion analysis to two dimensions using vector components. Vectors are resolved into perpendicular x‑ and y‑components using $v_x = v \\cos \\theta$ and $v_y = v \\sin \\theta$, and reconstructed using $v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$ and $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(v_y/v_x)$ (with quadrant adjustment). Projectile motion combines constant horizontal velocity with constant vertical acceleration ($g$). Key formulas for same‑height launches: time of flight $T = 2v_i \\sin \\theta / g$, maximum height $H = (v_i \\sin \\theta)^2/(2g)$, range $R = v_i^2 \\sin 2\\theta / g$. Symmetry gives equal times up/down, equal speeds at equal heights, and complementary angles ($\\theta$ and $90°-\\theta$) yielding the same range. Relative velocity in 2D is vector subtraction: $\\vec{v}_{AB} = \\vec{v}_A - \\vec{v}_B$. River crossing ($\\vec{v}_{bg} = \\vec{v}_{bw} + \\vec{v}_{wg}$) and airplane wind problems ($\\vec{v}_{pg} = \\vec{v}_{pa} + \\vec{v}_{ag}$) are common applications. Common mistakes include angle reference errors, misusing the range formula for different heights, forgetting that horizontal velocity persists at the projectile's apex, sign errors in relative velocity, and assuming vectors are perpendicular when they are not. Mastering these concepts is essential for success in dynamics, circular motion, and energy."
