  "expanded_description": "This section extends vector concepts from one dimension to two dimensions. In 2D, vectors have both magnitude and direction, and can be resolved into perpendicular components (usually horizontal and vertical) to simplify calculations. Understanding vector resolution is essential for analyzing projectile motion, forces in two dimensions, and relative velocity.",

    "principle": "Any two-dimensional vector can be broken down into two perpendicular component vectors (typically x and y) whose vector sum equals the original vector. These components are independent and can be analyzed separately.",
    "explanation": "Working with components simplifies 2D problems because the perpendicular directions are independent. Motion in the x-direction does not affect motion in the y-direction, allowing us to treat each direction separately using one-dimensional kinematics.",

  "summary": "Vectors in two dimensions have both magnitude and direction. They can be represented in magnitude-angle form $(v, \\theta)$ or in component form $(v_x, v_y)$. Vector resolution is the process of finding perpendicular components using trigonometry: $v_x = v \\cos \\theta$, $v_y = v \\sin \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. Given components, magnitude is $v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$ and direction is $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(v_y/v_x)$ with quadrant adjustment based on the signs of $v_x$ and $v_y$. Unit vector notation $\\vec{v} = v_x\\hat{i} + v_y\\hat{j}$ provides a compact way to write vectors. Adding vectors by components is the most reliable method: resolve each vector, sum x-components to get $R_x$, sum y-components to get $R_y$, then combine to find resultant magnitude and direction. Common mistakes include using the wrong angle reference, not trusting trig functions for signs, quadrant errors when finding direction, and using scalar addition for magnitude. Mastering vector resolution is essential for analyzing projectile motion, forces, and relative velocity in two dimensions."
