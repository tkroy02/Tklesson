  "expanded_description": "This section covers projectiles launched at an angle to the horizontal. The initial velocity has both horizontal and vertical components, leading to a parabolic trajectory that is symmetric when launch and landing heights are equal. We derive the equations for time of flight, range, maximum height, and the shape of the path, and develop a systematic problem‑solving approach.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a projectile launched at an angle $\\theta$ with initial speed $v_i$, the motion is the superposition of constant horizontal velocity ($v_{ix} = v_i \\cos \\theta$) and constant vertical acceleration ($a_y = -g$). The trajectory is a parabola, and when launch and landing heights are the same, the path is symmetric about the apex.",
    "explanation": "The angle determines how the initial speed is split between horizontal and vertical components. A larger angle gives more vertical speed, increasing height and time of flight but reducing horizontal speed and range (up to 45°, which maximizes range on level ground). Understanding these relationships allows prediction and analysis of any angled projectile situation.",

  "summary": "Projectiles launched at an angle have initial velocity components $v_{ix}=v_i\\cos\\theta$ and $v_{iy}=v_i\\sin\\theta$. Horizontal motion is constant velocity; vertical motion has constant acceleration $a_y=-g$. Key formulas for same‑height launches: time of flight $T = 2v_i\\sin\\theta/g$, maximum height $H = (v_i\\sin\\theta)^2/(2g)$, range $R = v_i^2\\sin2\\theta/g$. The range is maximum at $\\theta=45°$, and angles $\\theta$ and $90°-\\theta$ give the same range. For problems with different launch and landing heights, use the full vertical displacement equation $y = v_{iy}t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$ to solve for time. Symmetry implies equal times to and from the apex and equal speeds at the same height. A systematic problem‑solving approach: resolve initial velocity, apply vertical motion to find time, then horizontal to find distance. Common mistakes include misusing the range formula when heights differ, sign errors, forgetting constant horizontal velocity, and calculator mode errors. Mastering angled projectiles is essential for understanding real‑world projectile motion."
