  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on projectiles launched horizontally, a special case where the initial velocity is entirely horizontal ($v_{iy}=0$). These problems are the simplest introduction to projectile motion because the vertical motion reduces to free fall from rest. The time of flight is determined solely by the height, and the horizontal range is then found by multiplying constant horizontal velocity by that time.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a horizontally launched projectile, the initial vertical velocity is zero. The vertical motion is identical to that of an object dropped from rest, and the horizontal motion is at constant velocity. The two motions are linked by the common time of flight.",
    "explanation": "Because there is no initial vertical velocity, the time the projectile stays in the air depends only on the vertical height and gravity. During that time, the horizontal velocity carries it forward a distance equal to $v_x \\times t$. This makes horizontally launched projectiles straightforward to analyze.",
