  "expanded_description": "This section explores the symmetry properties of projectile motion when launch and landing heights are equal. The trajectory is symmetric about the vertical line through the highest point, leading to important relationships: the time to rise equals the time to fall, the speed at a given height is the same on the way up and down, and complementary launch angles yield the same range. We derive formulas for time of flight, maximum height, and range, and examine how these quantities depend on launch angle and speed.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a projectile launched from and landing at the same height, the trajectory is symmetric about the apex. This symmetry gives rise to simple formulas for time of flight $T = \\frac{2v_i \\sin \\theta}{g}$, maximum height $H = \\frac{(v_i \\sin \\theta)^2}{2g}$, and range $R = \\frac{v_i^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}$. Complementary angles ($\\theta$ and $90°-\\theta$) produce the same range.",
    "explanation": "These relationships are direct consequences of the independence of horizontal and vertical motions and the constant acceleration due to gravity. They allow quick calculation of key quantities and provide insight into how angle affects the trajectory.",

The time of flight is $T = 2v_i \\sin \\theta / g$, the maximum height is $H = (v_i \\sin \\theta)^2/(2g)$, and the range is $R = v_i^2 \\sin 2\\theta / g$. Range is maximized at $\\theta = 45°$, and complementary angles ($\\theta$ and $90°-\\theta$) give the same range. Symmetry implies the time to rise equals the time to fall, and the speed at a given height is the same on the way up and down. These relationships allow quick solution of many projectile problems without detailed step‑by‑step integration. Common mistakes include using the range formula when heights differ, confusing total time with time to apex, and forgetting that horizontal velocity persists at the apex. Mastery of these symmetry properties is essential for efficient problem solving in two‑dimensional kinematics."
