  "expanded_description": "This section extends relative velocity concepts to two dimensions. When objects move in a plane, relative velocity becomes a vector quantity that must be added and subtracted using vector methods. This is essential for analyzing situations such as boats crossing rivers with currents, airplanes flying in crosswinds, and any scenario where velocities are not collinear.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In two dimensions, the velocity of object A relative to object B is the vector difference: $\\vec{v}_{AB} = \\vec{v}_A - \\vec{v}_B$, where both velocities are measured in the same frame (usually the ground). Vector addition and subtraction must account for both magnitude and direction.",
    "explanation": "Because velocities are vectors, their relative nature involves both speed and direction. A boat moving in a river has a velocity relative to the water and the water has a velocity relative to the ground; the boat's ground velocity is the vector sum of these. Similarly, the apparent wind direction on a moving vehicle depends on the vector difference between wind velocity and vehicle velocity.",

  "summary": "In two dimensions, relative velocity is a vector quantity given by $\\vec{v}_{AB} = \\vec{v}_A - \\vec{v}_B$, with subtraction performed component‑wise. This concept is essential for analyzing situations such as boats crossing rivers ($\\vec{v}_{bg} = \\vec{v}_{bw} + \\vec{v}_{wg}$), airplanes flying in wind ($\\vec{v}_{pg} = \\vec{v}_{pa} + \\vec{v}_{ag}$), and moving observers (e.g., rain appearing angled to a moving car). River crossing problems illustrate how perpendicular components add; aiming upstream to cancel drift requires $v_{bw} \\sin \\theta = v_{wg}$. General problems are solved by resolving all velocities into components, subtracting, then finding resultant magnitude and direction. Common mistakes include using addition instead of subtraction, sign errors in component subtraction, forgetting direction in answers, mixing up frames, and incorrectly assuming perpendicularity. Mastering 2D relative velocity is crucial for navigation, meteorology, and advanced kinematics."
