  "expanded_description": "This section examines the magnetic component of the Lorentz force law, which describes how magnetic fields exert forces on moving charged particles.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A magnetic field exerts a force on a moving charged particle that is perpendicular to both the particle's velocity and the magnetic field direction. This force does no work and only changes the direction of motion, not the speed.",
    "explanation": "The magnetic force causes charged particles to move in curved paths, typically circles or helices. Unlike electric forces, magnetic forces cannot speed up or slow down charged particles—they only alter their direction."

Despite the high speed, the force is quite small due to the small charge."

  "summary": "The magnetic force on a moving charge is F_B = qv×B, always perpendicular to both velocity and magnetic field. For v⊥B, particles undergo uniform circular motion with radius r = mv/qB and cyclotron frequency ω = qB/m. The force does no work, so kinetic energy remains constant. For velocities with components both parallel and perpendicular to B, particles follow helical paths."
