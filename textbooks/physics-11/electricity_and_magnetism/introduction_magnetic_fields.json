    "principle": "Magnetic fields are produced by moving charges (currents) and permanent magnets. They exert forces on other moving charges and magnetic materials, but unlike electric fields, they do no work on charged particles.",
    "explanation": "Magnetic fields are characterized by field lines that form continuous closed loops, emerging from north poles and entering south poles. The field strength and direction determine the magnitude and direction of magnetic forces."

Identify where the field is strongest and describe how the field pattern changes as you move away from the magnet.\n\n**Answer:** **Field Line Analysis:**\n\n**Field Pattern:**\n- Lines emerge from north pole, curve through space, enter south pole\n- Continue inside magnet from south to north pole\n- Highest density near poles ⇒ strongest field\n- Nearly uniform near center between poles\n\n**Spatial Variation:**\n- **Near poles:** Dense, radial pattern, strong field\n- **Midway between poles:** Parallel, uniform field\n- **Far from magnet:** Dipole pattern, weak field (~1/r³)\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Field lines never cross\n- Continuous closed loops\n- No magnetic monopoles exist\n- Field strength decreases rapidly with distance\n\n**Interpretation:** The field pattern explains why magnets attract/repel and why the force decreases quickly with separation."

  "summary": "Magnetic fields (B) are vector fields produced by moving charges and magnets, measured in teslas. Field lines form closed loops from north to south poles. The Biot-Savart law calculates fields from current elements, with special formulas for straight wires (B = μ₀I/2πr), circular loops (B = μ₀I/2R), and solenoids (B = μ₀nI). The right-hand rule determines field direction around current-carrying conductors."
