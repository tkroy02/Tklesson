          "principle": "Dielectric Polarization",
          "statement": "When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, its molecules become polarized - positive and negative charges separate slightly. This polarization creates an internal field opposing the applied field, reducing the net field between plates. For the same charge, this means lower voltage, hence higher capacitance: C = κC₀.",
          "application": "Use this principle to understand how dielectrics increase capacitance, calculate fields in dielectric-filled capacitors, and select appropriate dielectrics for specific voltage and capacitance requirements",
          "example": "With a dielectric of κ=5, the capacitance increases 5×, and for the same charge, the voltage and field decrease 5×, allowing higher voltage operation before breakdown",
          "analogy": "Like adding shock absorbers to a spring system - they oppose the motion, allowing more 'compression' (charge) for the same force (voltage)",

  "summary": "Capacitors store electrical energy by maintaining separated equal and opposite charges. Capacitance C = Q/V measures charge storage capacity. Parallel plate capacitors have C = ε₀A/d. Dielectrics increase capacitance by factor κ. Capacitors combine in parallel (C_eq = ΣC_i) and series (1/C_eq = Σ1/C_i). Stored energy U = ½CV² = ½QV = Q²/2C. Practical capacitors use dielectrics to achieve high capacitance in small sizes. Applications range from energy storage in camera flashes to filtering in power supplies and timing in electronic circuits."
