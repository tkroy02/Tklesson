  "expanded_description": "This section extends the magnetic force concept to current-carrying conductors, showing how magnetic fields exert forces on wires carrying electric current.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A magnetic field exerts a force on a current-carrying wire due to the cumulative effect of magnetic forces on the moving charges within the wire. The force is perpendicular to both the current direction and the magnetic field.",
    "explanation": "The force on a current-carrying wire is fundamentally the sum of Lorentz forces on all moving charges in the wire. This principle underlies the operation of electric motors, speakers, and many electromechanical devices."

  "summary": "A current-carrying wire experiences magnetic force F = IL×B in a magnetic field. For straight wires, F = ILBsinθ perpendicular to both current and field. Current loops experience torque τ = μ×B where μ = NIA is the magnetic moment. Parallel wires with currents in the same direction attract, while opposite currents repel, with force F/L = μ₀I₁I₂/2πd. These principles form the basis for electric motors and many electromagnetic devices."
