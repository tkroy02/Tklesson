  "summary": "The electric field $\\vec{E} = \\vec{F}/q_0$ is a vector field that exists in space around charges. For point charges, $\\vec{E} = kQ/r² \\hat{r}$. The superposition principle allows calculation of fields from multiple charges. Field lines visually represent fields, with density indicating strength and tangent indicating direction. Continuous distributions require integration: $\\vec{E} = ∫ k dq/r² \\hat{r}$. Symmetry greatly simplifies calculations. Applications range from fundamental physics to technology like inkjet printers. The electric field concept provides a powerful framework for analyzing electrostatic systems without constant reference to specific test charges."
