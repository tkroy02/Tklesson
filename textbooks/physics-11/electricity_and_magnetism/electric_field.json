  "summary": "The electric field E = F/q₀ is a vector field that represents the force per unit charge. For point charges, E = kq/r² in the radial direction. Electric field lines visually represent fields, with density indicating strength and direction showing force on positive charges. The superposition principle allows calculation of net fields from multiple sources by vector addition."
