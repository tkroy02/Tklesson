  "summary": "Complex circuit analysis employs systematic methods including mesh analysis (KVL-based loop currents), nodal analysis (KCL-based node voltages), and superposition (individual source contributions). Network theorems like Thevenin's and Norton's equivalents simplify complex networks for load analysis. Special configurations like Wheatstone bridges often require delta-wye transformations. The choice of method depends on circuit topology - mesh analysis for fewer loops, nodal analysis for fewer nodes, transformations for bridge circuits. These advanced techniques ensure any linear DC circuit can be analyzed systematically regardless of complexity."
