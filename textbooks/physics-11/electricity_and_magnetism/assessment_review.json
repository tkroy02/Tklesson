The magnetic force on a moving charge is F_B = q(v×B), which is always perpendicular to the velocity vector.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n- Magnetic forces cannot change the speed of a charged particle, only its direction\n- Work done = F·ds, but F ⟂ v ⇒ F·ds = 0 ⇒ no work done\n- An electron at rest experiences zero magnetic force\n\n**Correct Analysis:**\n- To accelerate an electron from rest, you need an electric field\n- Once moving, a magnetic field can deflect the electron but not speed it up or slow it down\n- The electron's kinetic energy remains constant in a pure magnetic field\n\n**Physical Insight:** This explains why particle accelerators use electric fields for acceleration and magnetic fields for steering and focusing."
