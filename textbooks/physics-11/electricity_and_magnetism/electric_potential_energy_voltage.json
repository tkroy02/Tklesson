  "summary": "Electric potential energy U represents energy stored in charge configurations, with U = kq₁q₂/r for two charges. Electric potential V = U/q₀ is potential energy per unit charge, a scalar field. For point charges, V = kQ/r. Potential difference ΔV represents work per unit charge. Equipotential surfaces are surfaces of constant potential, perpendicular to electric field lines. Energy conservation governs charge motion: ½mv² + qV = constant. The electronvolt (1 eV = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ J) is a convenient energy unit. These concepts provide an energy-based approach to analyzing electrical systems, complementing force-based field analysis."
