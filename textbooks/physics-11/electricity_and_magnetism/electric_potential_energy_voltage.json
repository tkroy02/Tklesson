  "expanded_description": "This section explores electric potential energy as the energy stored in charge configurations and electric potential (voltage) as the potential energy per unit charge, providing an energy-based perspective on electrostatics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Electric potential energy represents the work required to assemble a charge configuration, while electric potential (voltage) is the potential energy per unit charge at a point in space. Both are scalar quantities that provide an energy-based alternative to force-based analysis.",
    "explanation": "Electric potential energy depends on the relative positions of charges, analogous to gravitational potential energy. Electric potential is a property of space itself, created by source charges, and exists whether a test charge is present or not."
