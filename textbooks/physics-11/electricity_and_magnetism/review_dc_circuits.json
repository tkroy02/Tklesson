Equivalent resistance:**\n- R₁ and R₂ series: R₁₂ = 2 + 4 = 6 Ω\n- R₁₂ and R₃ parallel: $\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$ ⇒ R_eq = 3 Ω\n\n**2. Total current:** $I_{total} = \\frac{V}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4$ A\n\n**3. Current division:**\n- Since R₁₂ = R₃ = 6 Ω, current splits equally: I₁₂ = 2 A, I₃ = 2 A\n\n**4. Voltage drops:**\n- Across R₁: V₁ = I₁₂R₁ = 2 × 2 = 4 V\n- Across R₂: V₂ = I₁₂R₂ = 2 × 4 = 8 V\n- Across R₃: V₃ = 12 V (parallel with battery)\n\n**5. Power calculations:**\n- P₁ = I₁₂²R₁ = 4 × 2 = 8 W\n- P₂ = I₁₂²R₂ = 4 × 4 = 16 W  \n- P₃ = I₃²R₃ = 4 × 6 = 24 W\n- Total power: 8 + 16 + 24 = 48 W = I_total²R_eq = 16 × 3 = 48 W ✓\n\n**Key Insight:** The 6 Ω resistor in parallel dissipates the most power despite having the same resistance as the series combination, because it has the full battery voltage across it."

  "summary": "DC circuit analysis relies on Ohm's Law (V=IR), power equations (P=IV=I²R=V²/R), and Kirchhoff's Laws (KCL for currents, KVL for voltages). Resistors in series add directly, while parallel resistors combine as reciprocal sums. Voltage dividers distribute voltage proportionally to resistance in series, while current dividers distribute current inversely to resistance in parallel."
