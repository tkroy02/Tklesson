  "summary": "DC circuit analysis is based on Ohm's Law (V=IR), Kirchhoff's Current Law (sum I=0 at nodes), and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (sum V=0 in loops). Resistors combine in series (R_eq=ΣR_i) and parallel (1/R_eq=Σ1/R_i). Power is calculated as P=IV=I²R=V²/R. Complex circuits can be analyzed using mesh current or node voltage methods. Thevenin's theorem allows replacement of complex networks with simple equivalents. Maximum power transfer occurs when R_load=R_source. Practical design must consider loading effects, power ratings, and efficiency trade-offs. These principles provide a complete framework for analyzing and designing DC resistive circuits."
