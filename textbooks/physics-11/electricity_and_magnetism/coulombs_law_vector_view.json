  "summary": "Coulomb's Law in vector form $\\vec{F}_{12} = k\\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\\hat{r}_{12}$ completely specifies electrostatic forces with both magnitude and direction. The unit vector $\\hat{r}_{12}$ points from charge 2 to charge 1, determining that like charges repel and opposite charges attract. For multiple charges, the superposition principle applies: net force equals the vector sum of individual forces. Analysis typically uses component methods, resolving forces into coordinate system components. Applications include equilibrium problems (net force = 0) and practical systems where electrostatic forces dominate over gravity for small masses. The vector formulation provides the foundation for electric field concepts and more advanced electromagnetic theory."
