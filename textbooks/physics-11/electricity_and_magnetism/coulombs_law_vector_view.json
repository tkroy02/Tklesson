  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Coulomb's Law with emphasis on its vector nature, providing the foundation for understanding electrostatic forces as vector quantities with both magnitude and direction.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Coulomb's Law states that the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, acting along the line joining the charges.",
    "explanation": "The vector nature of Coulomb's Law is crucial for determining both the magnitude and direction of electrostatic forces. Like charges repel, unlike charges attract, and the force follows the inverse-square law with distance."
