Identify and correct the error in this reasoning.\n\n**Answer:** **Wave Speed Analysis:**\n\n**The student's error** is in misunderstanding the relationship between tension and frequency. The correct relationship is:\n- Wave speed: $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$\n- Fundamental frequency: $f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L} = \\frac{1}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$\n\n**Correction:** Doubling tension increases wave speed by $\\sqrt{2} ≈ 1.414$, so frequency increases by the same factor, not doubles. To double frequency, tension must be quadrupled:\n- $f_{new} = 2f_1$ ⇒ $\\frac{1}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{T_{new}}{\\mu}} = 2 × \\frac{1}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$\n- $\\sqrt{T_{new}} = 2\\sqrt{T}$ ⇒ $T_{new} = 4T$\n\n**Physical insight:** Frequency depends on the square root of tension, not directly on tension."
