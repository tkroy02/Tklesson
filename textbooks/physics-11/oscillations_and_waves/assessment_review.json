  "summary": "Wave physics integrates diverse phenomena through common principles: waves transport energy without mass transport, obey v = fλ, and are described mathematically by y(x,t) = A sin(kx ± ωt + φ). Interference follows superposition y_total = Σy_i, with constructive interference when path difference = nλ and destructive when = (n+½)λ. Standing waves form from boundary conditions, with strings (fixed ends: f_n = nv/2L), open pipes (f_n = nv/2L), and closed pipes (f_n = (2n-1)v/4L). Energy in waves is proportional to A²ω². Fourier analysis decomposes complex waves into sinusoidal components. Applications span music, medicine, communications, and fundamental physics, demonstrating the universal nature of wave behavior across physical systems."
