    "principle": "Waves are disturbances that transfer energy from one point to another without transferring matter. They are characterized by their ability to transport energy through oscillations while the medium (if present) returns to its equilibrium position.",
    "explanation": "Waves can be classified by the direction of disturbance relative to propagation (transverse vs. longitudinal) and by their medium requirements (mechanical vs. electromagnetic). All waves share common properties like wavelength, frequency, and speed."

  "summary": "Waves are classified as transverse (oscillation perpendicular to propagation) or longitudinal (oscillation parallel to propagation), and as mechanical (require medium) or electromagnetic (travel through vacuum). All waves are characterized by wavelength (λ), frequency (f), period (T), amplitude (A), and speed (v = λf). Harmonic waves can be described mathematically by functions like y(x,t) = Asin(kx - ωt + φ), where k = 2π/λ and ω = 2πf."
