  "summary": "Waves are disturbances that propagate through space, transferring energy without net mass transport. They are classified as mechanical (require medium) or electromagnetic (no medium), and as transverse (oscillation perpendicular to propagation) or longitudinal (oscillation parallel). Wave motion is described mathematically by y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ) with v = fλ = ω/k. Waves exhibit superposition (algebraic addition), interference (constructive and destructive), reflection, refraction, and diffraction. The wave equation ∂²y/∂t² = v²∂²y/∂x² governs linear wave motion. Wave intensity I = ½ρvω²A² describes energy transport. These principles underlie diverse phenomena from sound and light to seismic waves and quantum mechanics."
