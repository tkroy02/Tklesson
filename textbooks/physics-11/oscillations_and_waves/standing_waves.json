  "expanded_description": "This section examines standing waves, which result from the interference of two waves traveling in opposite directions, creating stationary patterns of nodes and antinodes.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Standing waves are formed when two identical waves travel in opposite directions and interfere. They create a stationary pattern where certain points (nodes) have zero amplitude and other points (antinodes) have maximum amplitude.",
    "explanation": "Unlike traveling waves that transport energy through space, standing waves store energy in stationary patterns. The wave appears to stand still because the pattern doesn't propagate, though the medium still oscillates locally."

  "summary": "Standing waves result from interference of identical waves traveling in opposite directions, creating stationary patterns of nodes (zero amplitude) and antinodes (maximum amplitude). The wave function is y(x,t) = 2Asin(kx)cos(ωt). For bounded systems, only specific resonant frequencies produce standing waves, forming harmonic series. Energy oscillates locally without net transport, constantly transforming between kinetic and potential forms."
