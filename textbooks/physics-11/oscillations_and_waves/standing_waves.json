  "summary": "Standing waves are stationary patterns formed by interference of identical waves traveling in opposite directions, described by y(x,t) = 2Asin(kx)cos(ωt). They feature nodes (zero amplitude) and antinodes (maximum amplitude) at fixed positions. Boundary conditions determine allowed wavelengths and frequencies: fixed-fixed or free-free systems allow L = nλ/2, fixed-free systems allow L = (2n-1)λ/4. Standing waves store energy that oscillates between kinetic (maximum at nodes) and potential (maximum at antinodes) forms. Applications include musical instruments, resonant cavities, and quantum systems where standing wave patterns explain atomic structure. The quantization of standing wave frequencies provides the fundamental connection between classical wave behavior and quantum mechanics."
