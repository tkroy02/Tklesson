  "summary": "Wave interference results from superposition according to y_total = Σy_i. Constructive interference (path difference = nλ) enhances amplitude, while destructive interference (path difference = (n+½)λ) reduces it. Standing waves form from counter-propagating waves, with nodes and antinodes determined by boundary conditions. Beats occur at frequency f_beat = |f₁ - f₂| when waves of similar frequencies interfere. Multi-source interference creates complex patterns with sharp principal maxima. Fourier analysis decomposes complex waves into sinusoidal components. These interference phenomena underlie musical instruments, communications technology, medical imaging, and quantum mechanics, demonstrating the fundamental wave nature of physical systems."
