    "principle": "Wave interference occurs when two or more waves overlap in space. The principle of superposition states that the net displacement at any point equals the sum of the displacements of the individual waves.",
    "explanation": "When waves interfere, they can combine constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively (canceling each other), depending on their phase relationship. This leads to stable interference patterns for coherent waves."

What type of interference occurs?\n\n**Answer:** **Path Difference Analysis:**\n- **Path difference:** $\\Delta r = |r_1 - r_2| = |4.5 - 4.0| = 0.5$ m\n- **Wavelength:** λ = 1.0 m\n- **Comparison:** $\\frac{\\Delta r}{\\lambda} = \\frac{0.5}{1.0} = 0.5$\n\n**Interpretation:** Since the path difference equals λ/2, this is destructive interference. The waves arrive exactly out of phase and cancel each other.\n\n**General rule:** Destructive interference when $\\Delta r = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$"

  "summary": "Wave interference follows the superposition principle where net displacement equals the sum of individual wave displacements. Constructive interference occurs when waves are in phase (path difference = nλ), while destructive interference occurs when waves are out of phase (path difference = (n+½)λ). Beats result from interference of waves with slightly different frequencies, producing a pulsating amplitude at the beat frequency f_beat = |f₁ - f₂|."
