  "topic": "8.8 Standing Waves in Strings",
  "expanded_description": "This section focuses specifically on standing waves in strings with fixed ends, which form the basis for understanding stringed musical instruments and wave behavior in one-dimensional bounded systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Strings with fixed ends support standing waves only at specific resonant frequencies determined by the string length, tension, and linear density. These frequencies form a harmonic series where each harmonic is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency.",
    "explanation": "The fixed boundary conditions require nodes at both ends, constraining the possible wavelengths to integer fractions of twice the string length. This quantization leads to discrete musical notes."

              "explanation": "**Question:** A guitar string (L = 0.65 m, μ = 0.002 kg/m) is tuned to 330 Hz. What tension is required? If the string is fingered to shorten it to 0.55 m, what is the new frequency?\n\n**Answer:** **Tension and Length Effects:**\n- **From fundamental frequency:** $f_1 = \\frac{1}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$\n- **Solve for tension:** $T = \\mu(2Lf_1)^2 = 0.002 × (2 × 0.65 × 330)^2$\n- $T = 0.002 × (429)^2 = 0.002 × 184,041 = 368$ N\n\n- **New frequency with shortened string:** $f_{new} = f_1 × \\frac{L}{L_{new}} = 330 × \\frac{0.65}{0.55} = 390$ Hz\n\n**Interpretation:** Shortening the string by 15% increases the frequency by 18%, demonstrating why frets get closer together toward the bridge."

  "summary": "Standing waves in fixed-end strings occur only at specific resonant frequencies f_n = nv/2L, where v = √(T/μ) is the wave speed. The fundamental frequency (n=1) determines the pitch, while higher harmonics (n=2,3,...) create the timbre. Wave speed depends only on tension and linear density, not frequency or amplitude, explaining why string instruments use tension adjustments and finger positioning to control pitch."
