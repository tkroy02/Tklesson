Plucking at a fraction p of the length from one end produces harmonics with amplitudes proportional to $\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sin(n\\pi p)$. This explains why different plucking positions create different timbres.",

          "example": "Plucking at the center (p=0.5) gives A_n ∝ 1/n² for odd n, zero for even n, creating a hollow sound; plucking very near the end (p≈0) gives A_n ∝ 1/n, creating a bright, rich sound",

  "summary": "Standing waves in strings form with nodes at fixed ends and wavelengths λ_n = 2L/n. Resonant frequencies are f_n = (n/2L)√(T/μ), with wave speed v = √(T/μ). The fundamental (n=1) has the lowest frequency, with harmonics at integer multiples. Energy in standing waves remains constant while oscillating between kinetic (maximum at nodes) and potential (maximum at antinodes) forms. Musical applications use these principles, with plucking position determining harmonic content through Fourier relationships. Real string behavior includes damping, dispersion, and complex excitation mechanisms that create the rich variety of sounds in string instruments."
