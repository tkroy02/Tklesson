  "summary": "Simple pendulums approximate SHM for small angles (θ < 15°) with period T = 2π√(L/g), independent of mass and amplitude. The motion follows from the small-angle approximation sinθ ≈ θ. Energy is conserved between gravitational potential and kinetic forms. Physical pendulums generalize this to any rigid body with period T = 2π√(I/mgd). Applications include timekeeping, gravity measurement, and seismology. The pendulum provides a fundamental example of oscillatory motion that bridges simple harmonic theory with real-world physical systems."
