  "summary": "A simple pendulum exhibits SHM for small angles (θ < 10°) with period T = 2π√(L/g), independent of mass. The restoring force comes from the tangential component of gravity. Physical pendulums (extended objects) have periods T = 2π√(I/mgd) that depend on mass distribution through the moment of inertia. Both types convert energy between potential and kinetic forms during oscillation."
