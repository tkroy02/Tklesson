  "topic": "8.9 Standing Waves in Air Columns",
  "expanded_description": "This section examines standing waves in air columns, which form the physical basis for wind instruments and organ pipes. The behavior depends on whether the ends are open or closed to the atmosphere.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Air columns support standing sound waves with displacement antinodes at open ends (pressure nodes) and displacement nodes at closed ends (pressure antinodes). The resonant frequencies depend on the column length and whether ends are open or closed.",
    "explanation": "In open-open tubes, both ends are pressure nodes; in closed-open tubes, the closed end is a pressure antinode and the open end is a pressure node. These boundary conditions determine the possible standing wave patterns."

What is the length of a closed-open pipe with the same fundamental frequency?\n\n**Answer:** **Tube Comparison:**\n- **Open-open fundamental:** $f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L} = \\frac{344}{2 × 0.5} = 344$ Hz ✓\n- **This is indeed the fundamental**\n\n- **Closed-open fundamental:** $f_1 = \\frac{v}{4L_{closed}}$\n- **Same frequency:** $344 = \\frac{344}{4L_{closed}}$ ⇒ $L_{closed} = 0.25$ m\n\n**Interpretation:** A closed-open pipe needs only half the length of an open-open pipe to produce the same fundamental frequency, explaining why bass clarinets can be shorter than equivalent flutes."

  "summary": "Standing waves in air columns depend on end conditions: open-open tubes support all harmonics (f_n = nv/2L) while closed-open tubes support only odd harmonics (f_n = (2n-1)v/4L). Open ends are pressure nodes (displacement antinodes) and closed ends are pressure antinodes (displacement nodes). Real pipes require end corrections (L_effective = L + 0.6r) and temperature affects frequency through sound speed variations."
