          "statement": "The speed of sound in air depends on temperature as v = 331√(1 + T/273) m/s, where T is Celsius temperature. This causes wind instruments to play sharper when warm and flatter when cold. For small temperature changes near room temperature, the approximation v ≈ 331 + 0.6T m/s is often used.",
          "application": "Use this principle to understand why wind instruments require warming up, calculate necessary tuning adjustments for different environments, and design instruments with temperature compensation mechanisms",
          "example": "At 20°C, v = 343 m/s; at 30°C, v = 349 m/s - a 1.7% increase that raises all frequencies proportionally, requiring significant retuning",

  "summary": "Standing waves in air columns form with specific boundary conditions: open ends are displacement antinodes (pressure nodes), closed ends are displacement nodes (pressure antinodes). Open pipes support all harmonics f_n = nv/2L, while closed pipes support only odd harmonics f_n = (2n-1)v/4L. The effective pipe length includes end correction beyond physical openings. Temperature affects tuning through sound speed dependence v ∝ √T. Musical applications include flutes (open-open), clarinets (closed-open), and brass instruments (closed-open with lip reed). Advanced techniques like overblowing exploit harmonic relationships to access different registers. These principles explain the diverse sounds and playing characteristics of wind instruments."
