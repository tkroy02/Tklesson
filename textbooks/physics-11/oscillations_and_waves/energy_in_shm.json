  "summary": "In ideal simple harmonic motion, total mechanical energy E = ½kA² remains constant, oscillating between kinetic energy K = ½mv² and potential energy U = ½kx². Different oscillators (mass-spring, pendulum, LC circuit) share this energy conservation with system-specific parameters. Energy components oscillate at twice the mechanical frequency. Advanced concepts include damped oscillations with exponential energy decay E(t) = E₀e^(-t/τ), driven oscillations with resonance energy transfer, and quantum harmonic oscillators with discrete energy levels E_n = (n + ½)ℏω. The quality factor Q = ω₀/2γ characterizes energy decay rate and resonance sharpness. These energy principles underpin applications from timekeeping to modern technology."
