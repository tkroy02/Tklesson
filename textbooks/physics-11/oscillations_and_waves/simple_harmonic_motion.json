  "summary": "Simple harmonic motion is characterized by a restoring force proportional to displacement (F = -kx) leading to sinusoidal motion x(t) = Acos(ωt + φ). Key parameters include amplitude A, angular frequency ω = 2πf = 2π/T, and phase constant φ. For mass-spring systems, ω = √(k/m); for pendulums, ω = √(g/L) for small angles. Energy oscillates between kinetic and potential forms while total energy E = ½kA² remains constant. SHM connects fundamentally to uniform circular motion through reference circle analysis. Applications span timekeeping, vibration control, musical instruments, and molecular physics. The constant period independent of amplitude (isochronism) is a distinctive feature exploited in many practical devices."
