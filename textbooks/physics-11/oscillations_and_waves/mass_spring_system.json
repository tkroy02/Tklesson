  "summary": "Mass-spring systems exhibit simple harmonic motion with ω = √(k/m) and T = 2π√(m/k). Horizontal systems have equilibrium at spring natural length; vertical systems have equilibrium shifted by Δy = mg/k due to gravity but identical oscillation dynamics. Springs combine in parallel (k_eff = k₁ + k₂ + ...) and series (1/k_eff = 1/k₁ + 1/k₂ + ...). Energy conservation gives E = ½kA² = ½mv² + ½kx². Real systems require effective mass correction m_eff = m + m_spring/3 and account for damping. These principles underpin applications from precision measurement to vibration control across engineering and physics."
