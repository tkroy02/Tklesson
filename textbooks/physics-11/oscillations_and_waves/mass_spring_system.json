  "expanded_description": "This section analyzes the classic example of simple harmonic motion: a mass attached to an ideal spring. It demonstrates how spring constant and mass determine the oscillation characteristics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A mass-spring system executes simple harmonic motion with a period determined solely by the mass and spring constant, independent of amplitude (for small oscillations).",
    "explanation": "The spring provides the restoring force F = -kx that drives the harmonic motion. The system's inertia (mass) and stiffness (spring constant) combine to set the natural frequency of oscillation."

  "summary": "Mass-spring systems provide the fundamental example of simple harmonic motion. The period T = 2π√(m/k) depends only on mass and spring constant, not amplitude. Vertical systems oscillate with the same period as horizontal ones, with gravity only shifting the equilibrium position. Energy transforms between kinetic and spring potential forms while total mechanical energy remains constant."
