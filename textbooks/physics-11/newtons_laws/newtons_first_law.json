  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Newton's First Law of Motion, often called the law of inertia. It states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced (net) force. This law defines the concept of inertia and establishes the condition for equilibrium.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Newton's First Law: An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion with constant velocity (constant speed in a straight line) unless acted upon by a net external force.",
    "explanation": "This law introduces the idea of inertia: the natural tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion. It also defines an inertial reference frame – one in which the law holds. A key consequence is that when the net force on an object is zero, its acceleration is zero, meaning it is either at rest or moving with constant velocity.",

  "summary": "Newton's First Law, the law of inertia, states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. This law defines inertia as the resistance to changes in motion; mass is a measure of inertia. When the net force on an object is zero, it is in equilibrium – either static (at rest) or dynamic (constant velocity). Equilibrium requires that all forces balance in every direction, as can be seen in free body diagrams. The law holds only in inertial reference frames (non‑accelerating frames). Common misconceptions include believing that a continuous force is needed to sustain motion (friction is usually the cause of slowing), that stationary objects have no forces (they have balanced forces), and that constant velocity implies a net force (it implies zero net force). Newton's first law lays the groundwork for understanding the relationship between forces and motion, which is quantified in the second law."
