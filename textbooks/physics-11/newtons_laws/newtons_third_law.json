  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Newton's Third Law of Motion, often summarized as 'for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.' It describes how forces always come in pairs, with each force acting on a different object. Understanding action‑reaction pairs is essential for analyzing interactions between objects and for correctly applying Newton's laws in systems with multiple bodies.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Newton's Third Law: Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. These two forces are called an action‑reaction pair. They are always of the same type (e.g., both gravitational, both normal) and act on different objects.",
    "explanation": "Forces are interactions between two objects. Therefore, a single isolated force cannot exist. When you push on a wall, the wall pushes back on you with the same magnitude but opposite direction. These forces do not cancel because they act on different bodies; each affects the motion of only the object it acts upon.",

        "definition": "For every force that one object exerts on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force back on the first. Mathematically, if object A exerts force $\\vec{F}_{A\\text{ on }B}$ on object B, then object B exerts force $\\vec{F}_{B\\text{ on }A}$ on object A, and $\\vec{F}_{B\\text{ on }A} = -\\vec{F}_{A\\text{ on }B}$.",

          "application": "When identifying forces, always ask: \"What other object is involved in this interaction?\" The answer gives the other half of the pair.",
          "example": "A book resting on a table: Earth pulls down on the book (gravity), and the book pulls up on Earth (gravity). The table pushes up on the book (normal force), and the book pushes down on the table (normal force)."

Common examples include gravitational attraction (Earth on object, object on Earth), normal forces (table on book, book on table), friction (foot on ground, ground on foot), and tension (rope on object, object on rope). A frequent mistake is confusing action‑reaction pairs with balanced forces acting on the same object. Another is incorrectly pairing forces of different types (e.g., weight with normal force). Correct application of Newton's third law is essential for analyzing systems with multiple objects, such as connected masses and pulleys."
