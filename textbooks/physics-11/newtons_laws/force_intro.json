We classify forces by their nature (contact vs. long-range) and learn to represent them visually using free body diagrams, which are essential tools for applying Newton's laws.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A force is a vector quantity that represents an interaction between two objects. Forces cause changes in motion (acceleration) and are measured in newtons (N). Understanding the types of forces and how to represent them with free body diagrams is the first step in analyzing any dynamics situation.",
    "explanation": "Every interaction in the universe involves forces: gravity pulls objects down, friction slows moving objects, tension pulls along ropes, and normal forces support objects against surfaces. By identifying all forces acting on an object and representing them with arrows in a free body diagram, we can apply Newton's laws to predict motion.",

  "summary": "A force is a push or pull resulting from an interaction between two objects. It is a vector quantity measured in newtons (N). Forces are classified as contact forces (requiring touch, such as normal force, friction, tension) or field forces (acting at a distance, such as gravity). The most common forces in mechanics problems are weight ($\\vec{F}_g = m\\vec{g}$ downward), normal force ($\\vec{F}_N$ perpendicular to a surface), friction ($\\vec{f}$ parallel to a surface opposing motion), tension ($\\vec{T}$ along a rope), and applied force ($\\vec{F}_{app}$ from a push or pull). A free body diagram (FBD) is a essential tool: it isolates the object of interest and represents all forces acting on it as vectors. To draw an FBD: (1) isolate the object, (2) identify all forces from interactions, (3) draw arrows for each force with labels, (4) choose a coordinate system. Common mistakes include forgetting gravity, including non-existent forces like 'force of motion', confusing action-reaction pairs, and drawing friction in the wrong direction. Mastering force identification and FBDs is the foundation for applying Newton's laws to solve dynamics problems."
