  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review of all topics covered in Unit 4: Newton's Laws. It synthesizes the key concepts of force, Newton's three laws, mass vs. weight, friction, and their applications to problems involving tension, pulleys, and inclined planes. Mastering these interconnected ideas is essential for understanding dynamics and preparing for more advanced topics like circular motion and energy.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics. The first law defines inertia and equilibrium; the second law quantifies the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration ($\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$); the third law describes action‑reaction pairs. These laws, combined with force identification and free body diagrams, allow us to analyze a wide range of physical situations, from objects at rest to complex systems with friction, tension, and inclined planes.",
    "explanation": "Unit 4 builds a complete framework for dynamics. We learned to identify and represent forces using free body diagrams, distinguish between mass and weight, and apply Newton's second law in both one and two dimensions. We explored friction (static and kinetic), tension in ropes, pulley systems, and objects on inclined planes. The problem‑solving strategy – draw FBD, choose coordinates, resolve forces, write equations, solve – unifies all these topics.",

  "summary": "Unit 4: Newton's Laws established the fundamental principles of dynamics. Forces are vectors representing interactions; they are identified and represented in free body diagrams. Newton's first law (inertia) states that objects maintain constant velocity unless acted on by a net force. The second law quantifies this: $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$, applied component‑wise. The third law states that forces come in equal‑and‑opposite pairs acting on different objects. Mass is an intrinsic property (kg), while weight is the gravitational force ($W=mg$). Friction opposes motion: static friction ($f_s \\le \\mu_s N$) and kinetic friction ($f_k = \\mu_k N$). Tension in ideal ropes is constant; pulleys change direction without changing magnitude. Inclined planes are analyzed by rotating coordinates and resolving weight into $mg\\sin\\theta$ (parallel) and $mg\\cos\\theta$ (perpendicular). A systematic problem‑solving strategy – FBD, coordinates, components, equations – unifies all applications. Common mistakes include incorrect FBDs, sign errors, mass‑weight confusion, misapplied friction, pulley acceleration constraints, and inclined‑plane component swaps. Mastering these concepts is essential for circular motion, energy, and momentum."
