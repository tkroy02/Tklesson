  "expanded_description": "This section introduces friction, a force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact. Friction plays a crucial role in everyday life – it allows us to walk, enables cars to grip the road, and brings moving objects to a stop. We distinguish between static friction (preventing motion) and kinetic friction (opposing motion), and introduce the coefficients of friction that quantify these effects.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Friction is a force that resists the relative motion (or attempted motion) of two surfaces in contact. It always acts parallel to the surfaces and opposite to the direction of motion or attempted motion. The magnitude of friction depends on the nature of the surfaces and the normal force pressing them together.",
    "explanation": "Friction arises from microscopic interactions between surface irregularities. Static friction prevents an object from starting to move, while kinetic friction acts on a moving object. Static friction can vary from zero up to a maximum value, while kinetic friction is typically constant for a given pair of surfaces. Both are proportional to the normal force, with the proportionality constants called coefficients of friction.",

  "summary": "Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact. It is parallel to the surfaces and depends on the materials and the normal force. Static friction ($f_s$) acts when there is no relative motion, preventing objects from starting to slide. It can vary from zero up to a maximum $f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N$, where $\\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction. Once motion begins, kinetic friction ($f_k = \\mu_k N$) takes over, opposing the sliding. Typically $\\mu_k < \\mu_s$, meaning it's easier to keep an object moving than to start it. The direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion (for kinetic) or opposite to the direction of attempted motion (for static). Friction depends on the normal force and surface materials but is generally independent of contact area. Common mistakes include using $\\mu_s N$ for any static situation (forgetting that static friction only reaches that maximum at the threshold), confusing static and kinetic friction, drawing friction in the wrong direction, and treating coefficients of friction as having units. Understanding friction is essential for analyzing motion on horizontal surfaces, inclined planes, and in many real‑world applications."
