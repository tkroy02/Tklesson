  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the analysis of objects on inclined planes (ramps). By tilting the coordinate system to align with the incline, we simplify the problem: the weight force must be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the plane. This allows us to apply Newton's second law along the incline and perpendicular to it, accounting for normal force, friction, and any applied forces. Inclined planes are a classic application of force decomposition and are essential for understanding more complex dynamics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "On an inclined plane, it is convenient to rotate the coordinate system so that the x‑axis is parallel to the slope and the y‑axis is perpendicular to the slope. The weight force $\\vec{F}_g = m\\vec{g}$ is then resolved into two components: $mg\\sin\\theta$ down the incline (parallel) and $mg\\cos\\theta$ perpendicular into the plane.",
    "explanation": "This coordinate choice simplifies the equations because the acceleration (if any) is along the incline, and the normal force is perpendicular. The perpendicular component of weight is balanced by the normal force when there is no acceleration in that direction. The parallel component, along with friction and other applied forces, determines the motion down or up the ramp.",

      "introduction": "An inclined plane (ramp) allows us to study the effects of gravity at an angle. Instead of the full weight acting vertically, only a component of weight pulls the object along the surface. This makes it easier to move objects upward (mechanical advantage) and introduces the need to decompose forces.",

        "definition": "An inclined plane is a flat surface tilted at an angle $\\theta$ to the horizontal.

The parallel component, together with friction and any applied forces, determines the acceleration along the incline. For a frictionless incline, acceleration is $g\\sin\\theta$. With kinetic friction, $a = g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu_k\\cos\\theta)$ (down) or up if pulled. Static friction holds the block if $\\tan\\theta \\le \\mu_s$. Common mistakes include swapping sine and cosine, forgetting to resolve weight, using the wrong friction coefficient, and misassigning friction direction. Mastering inclined planes is essential for applying Newton's laws in a wide range of practical situations."
