  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on applying Newton's Second Law ($\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$) to solve a variety of force problems. Building on the concepts of force identification, free body diagrams, and friction, we develop a systematic problem-solving strategy that can be applied to any dynamics situation involving constant mass and constant or variable forces.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Applying Newton's Second Law requires a systematic approach: (1) Identify the object of interest, (2) Draw a free body diagram showing all forces acting on it, (3) Choose a coordinate system, (4) Resolve forces into components, (5) Write $\\sum F_x = ma_x$ and $\\sum F_y = ma_y$, (6) Solve for unknowns, and (7) Check the answer for reasonableness.",
    "explanation": "Newton's Second Law is a powerful tool, but it must be applied correctly. The key steps are drawing an accurate free body diagram and carefully handling vector components. Once the equations are set up, solving them is often straightforward algebra. This section provides practice with various scenarios, from simple horizontal motion to problems involving friction, inclined planes, and connected objects.",

  "summary": "Applying Newton's Second Law ($\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$) requires a systematic approach: (1) identify the object, (2) draw a free body diagram showing all forces, (3) choose a convenient coordinate system, (4) resolve forces into components, (5) write $\\sum F_x = ma_x$ and $\\sum F_y = ma_y$, (6) solve for unknowns, and (7) check the answer. This strategy works for a wide range of problems, including horizontal motion with and without friction, vertical motion (e.g., elevators), and forces applied at angles. Key points: friction must be correctly identified as static or kinetic; normal force may be affected by vertical force components; for connected objects, separate FBDs are needed; always use consistent sign conventions. Common mistakes include incorrect FBDs (missing forces or including $ma$ as a force), sign errors in component equations, confusing mass and weight, forgetting to draw separate FBDs for connected objects, and misapplying friction formulas. Mastering this problem-solving approach is essential for success in all future dynamics topics."
