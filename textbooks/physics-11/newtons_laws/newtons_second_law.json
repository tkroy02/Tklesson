  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Newton's Second Law of Motion, the quantitative relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This law is the cornerstone of classical mechanics, allowing us to predict motion from forces and vice versa.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Newton's Second Law: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of the acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force. Mathematically: $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$.",
    "explanation": "This law quantifies how forces affect motion. A larger net force produces a larger acceleration; a larger mass results in a smaller acceleration for the same force. The equation $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$ is a vector equation, so it applies component‑wise: $\\sum F_x = ma_x$, $\\sum F_y = ma_y$. This law is used to solve dynamics problems by relating forces to acceleration.",

To solve problems: draw a free body diagram, choose a coordinate system, resolve forces into components, apply $\\sum F_x = ma_x$ and $\\sum F_y = ma_y$, and solve for unknowns. Common applications include finding acceleration from known forces, finding an unknown force from known acceleration, and relating weight to mass via $W = mg$. Typical mistakes include using a single force instead of net force, confusing mass and weight, sign errors in component equations, and incorrectly analyzing connected objects. Mastery of Newton's second law is essential for all subsequent topics in dynamics."
