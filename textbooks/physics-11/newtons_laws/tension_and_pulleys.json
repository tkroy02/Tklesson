  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on tension forces in ropes, strings, and cables, and how to analyze systems involving pulleys. Tension is a pulling force transmitted through a flexible connector. In ideal pulleys (massless and frictionless), tension is uniform throughout a rope and changes direction without changing magnitude. Understanding tension and pulley systems is essential for solving problems with connected objects, such as Atwood machines and multi‑block arrangements.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Tension is a force transmitted through a rope, string, or cable when it is pulled taut. It always acts along the rope and pulls away from the object to which it is attached. For an ideal (massless, frictionless) pulley, the tension is the same on both sides, and the pulley merely changes the direction of the tension force.",
    "explanation": "In many problems, we assume ropes are massless and inextensible, and pulleys are massless and frictionless. Under these assumptions, the tension is constant throughout the rope, and all objects connected by the rope have the same acceleration magnitude (though possibly different directions). These simplifications allow us to apply Newton's second law to each object and relate their motions through the constraint of the rope length.",

  "summary": "Tension is the force transmitted through a rope, always directed along the rope away from the object. In ideal ropes (massless, inextensible) and ideal pulleys (massless, frictionless), tension is constant throughout the rope and pulleys merely change its direction. Analyzing pulley systems involves drawing free body diagrams for each object, applying Newton's second law, and using the constraint that the rope length is constant to relate accelerations. Common configurations include the Atwood machine (two masses over a fixed pulley), a mass on a table connected to a hanging mass, and multiple pulley systems that provide mechanical advantage. In a system with a movable pulley supported by two rope segments, the upward force is $2T$ and the acceleration constraint must account for the displacement relationship. Key steps: choose consistent sign conventions, write $\\sum F = ma$ for each object, relate accelerations, and solve. Mistakes to avoid include assuming tension equals weight, inconsistent acceleration signs, neglecting pulley mass when it matters, ignoring rope mass, and misidentifying acceleration constraints in multiple pulley systems. Mastering tension and pulley problems is essential for understanding more complex dynamics and for applying Newton's laws to systems of connected objects."
