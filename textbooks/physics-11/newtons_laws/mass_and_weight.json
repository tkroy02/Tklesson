  "expanded_description": "This section clarifies the crucial distinction between mass and weight, two terms often used interchangeably in everyday language but with very different meanings in physics. Mass is a fundamental property of an object that measures its inertia and the amount of matter it contains. Weight is the gravitational force exerted on an object by a planet or other massive body. Understanding this difference is essential for correctly applying Newton's laws.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Mass is a scalar quantity that measures an object's inertia (resistance to acceleration) and the amount of matter it contains. Weight is a vector quantity that measures the gravitational force exerted on an object. They are related by $\\vec{W} = m\\vec{g}$, where $\\vec{g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.",
    "explanation": "Mass is an intrinsic property of an object that does not change with location. A 10 kg object has the same mass on Earth, the Moon, or in deep space. Weight, however, depends on the local gravitational field. The same 10 kg object weighs about 98 N on Earth, about 16 N on the Moon, and is weightless in deep space. This distinction is fundamental to understanding the difference between inertial and gravitational properties.",

They are related by $W = mg$, where $g$ is the local acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.8$ m/s² on Earth). Mass does not change with location; an object has the same mass on Earth, the Moon, or in deep space. Weight changes with location because $g$ varies. An object in free fall (e.g., in orbit) is weightless but still has the same mass. Common mistakes include using kilograms for weight, thinking mass changes with gravity, forgetting to convert between weight and mass when using $F=ma$, and confusing the roles of mass and weight in dynamics problems. Correctly distinguishing mass and weight is essential for applying Newton's laws and understanding gravitational interactions."
