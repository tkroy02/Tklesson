  "summary": "Relative velocity describes how motion appears from different reference frames. The fundamental relationship is $\\vec{v}_{AB} = \\vec{v}_{AC} - \\vec{v}_{BC}$, where A and B are objects and C is a common reference frame (usually ground). For navigation problems, $\\vec{v}_{OG} = \\vec{v}_{OM} + \\vec{v}_{MG}$, where O is an object, M is a medium (air/water), and G is ground. In 2D problems, use vector components and the Pythagorean theorem. Key concepts include: all motion is relative to a chosen frame, relative velocity between two objects is frame-independent, and choosing the right reference frame can simplify problem solving. Common applications include river crossings (boat velocity relative to water + water velocity relative to ground), airplane navigation (airspeed + wind velocity = ground speed), and collision analysis using relative approach velocities."
