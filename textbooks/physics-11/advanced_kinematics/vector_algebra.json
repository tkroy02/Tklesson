Vector addition is commutative and associative, performed component-wise. Scalar multiplication scales vector magnitude by factor k, reversing direction if k < 0. Dot product $\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} = A_xB_x + A_yB_y + A_zB_z = |\\vec{A}||\\vec{B}|\\cos\\theta$ gives scalar result measuring parallel components, used for work calculations ($W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{d}$), angle determination, and testing perpendicularity (dot product = 0). Cross product $\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B}$ gives vector perpendicular to both inputs with magnitude $|\\vec{A}||\\vec{B}|\\sin\\theta$ equal to parallelogram area, following right-hand rule for direction, used for torque ($\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$) and rotational quantities. Key properties: dot product is commutative, cross product is anti-commutative ($\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B} = -\\vec{B} \\times \\vec{A}$); both operations are distributive over addition. Vector projection: $\\text{proj}_{\\vec{B}}\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B}}{|\\vec{B}|^2}\\vec{B}$ gives component of A parallel to B."
