  "summary": "Angled launch projectiles follow symmetrical parabolic trajectories when launched and landing at the same height. Key equations: Initial components $v_{x0} = v_0\\cos\\theta$, $v_{y0} = v_0\\sin\\theta$; Time of flight $T = \\frac{2v_0\\sin\\theta}{g}$; Maximum height $h_{max} = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin^2\\theta}{2g}$; Range $R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g}$. Maximum range occurs at 45° for level ground. Complementary angles (θ and 90°-θ) produce equal ranges with the same initial speed. The trajectory is symmetric about the vertical through the maximum height point, with equal speeds at equal heights and equal ascent/descent times. Applications include sports strategy, obstacle clearance calculations, and optimizing for specific objectives like maximum hang time or clearance height."
