  "summary": "Projectile motion describes objects moving under gravity alone, following parabolic trajectories. Key principles: (1) Horizontal and vertical motions are independent, (2) Horizontal acceleration = 0 (constant horizontal velocity), (3) Vertical acceleration = -g = -9.8 m/s². Basic equations: Horizontal: $x = x_0 + v_{x0}t$, $v_x = v_{x0}$; Vertical: $y = y_0 + v_{y0}t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$, $v_y = v_{y0} - gt$. Special formulas: Time of flight $T = \\frac{2v_{y0}}{g}$ (level ground), Maximum height $h_{max} = \\frac{v_{y0}^2}{2g}$, Range $R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g}$. Maximum range occurs at 45° launch angle, and complementary angles (θ and 90°-θ) give equal ranges. Problem-solving strategy: resolve initial velocity into components, use vertical motion to find time, then apply time to horizontal motion equations."
