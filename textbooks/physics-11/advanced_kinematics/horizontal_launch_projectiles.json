  "summary": "Horizontal launch projectiles have zero initial vertical velocity ($v_{y0} = 0$) and move with constant horizontal velocity ($v_x = v_0$) while accelerating vertically due to gravity ($a_y = -g$). Key equations: Time of flight $t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}$ depends only on height, Range $R = v_0\\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}$ depends on both height and initial speed, Impact velocity $v = \\sqrt{v_0^2 + (gt)^2}$, Impact angle $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{gt}{v_0}\\right)$ below horizontal. The vertical motion is identical to free fall from rest, clearly demonstrating the independence of horizontal and vertical motions. Applications include safety calculations, sports analysis, and educational demonstrations like the monkey and hunter experiment."
