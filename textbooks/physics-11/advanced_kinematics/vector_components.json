  "summary": "Vector components allow any vector to be broken into perpendicular parts, typically along the x and y axes. Given a vector with magnitude A and angle θ from the x-axis, its components are $A_x = A\\cos\\theta$ and $A_y = A\\sin\\theta$. To reconstruct a vector from its components, use $A = \\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2}$ for magnitude and $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{A_y}{A_x}\\right)$ for direction, with quadrant adjustments based on component signs. The component method for vector addition involves: (1) resolving all vectors into components, (2) summing x-components and y-components separately, (3) calculating the resultant magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem, and (4) finding the resultant direction using inverse tangent with proper quadrant determination. This method provides an accurate, systematic approach to vector operations that works for any number of vectors in any directions."
