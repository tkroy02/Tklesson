  "summary": "1D kinematics describes motion along a straight line using position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The fundamental kinematic equations for constant acceleration are: $v_f = v_i + at$, $d = v_it + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$, $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$, and $d = \\frac{v_i+v_f}{2}t$. Uniform velocity motion ($a = 0$) follows $d = vt$, while non-uniform motion requires the full equations. Average velocity $v_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ simplifies complex motion analysis. Motion under gravity represents constant acceleration $a = -g = -9.8$ m/s² (with upward positive), with free fall from rest following $v_f = -gt$ and $d = -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2$. Vertical projection upward shows symmetric motion with maximum height $h_{max} = \\frac{v_i^2}{2g}$ and time to maximum height $t = \\frac{v_i}{g}$. Graphical analysis provides powerful tools: slope of position-time gives velocity, slope of velocity-time gives acceleration, and area under velocity-time gives displacement."
