The fundamental kinematic equations for constant acceleration are: $v = u + at$, $s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$, $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$, and $s = \\frac{u+v}{2}t$. Uniform velocity motion ($a = 0$) follows $s = vt$, while non-uniform motion requires the full equations. Average velocity $v_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ simplifies complex motion analysis. Motion under gravity represents constant acceleration $a = -g = -9.8$ m/s² (with upward positive), with free fall from rest following $v = -gt$ and $s = -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2$. Vertical projection upward shows symmetric motion with maximum height $h_{max} = \\frac{u^2}{2g}$ and time to maximum height $t = \\frac{u}{g}$. Graphical analysis provides powerful tools: slope of position-time gives velocity, slope of velocity-time gives acceleration, and area under velocity-time gives displacement."
