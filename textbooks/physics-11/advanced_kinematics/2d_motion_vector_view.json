  "summary": "2D motion analysis uses vector methods with position $\\vec{r}(t) = x(t)\\hat{i} + y(t)\\hat{j}$, velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt}$, and acceleration $\\vec{a}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}$. Projectile motion has $a_x = 0$, $a_y = -g$ with equations: $x(t) = x_0 + v_{x0}t$, $y(t) = y_0 + v_{y0}t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$, range $R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g}$, max height $h_{max} = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin^2\\theta}{2g}$, time of flight $T = \\frac{2v_0\\sin\\theta}{g}$. Uniform circular motion has constant speed but centripetal acceleration $a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} = r\\omega^2$ toward center, with tangential velocity $v = r\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$. The key principle is component independence: perpendicular motions can be analyzed separately using 1D kinematics."
