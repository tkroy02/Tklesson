Effective assessment preparation involves deliberate practice with varied problem types, development of systematic problem-solving approaches, time management skills, and metacognitive awareness. Success requires both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency, with regular practice integrating multiple concepts and mirroring assessment conditions."
