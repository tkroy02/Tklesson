  "summary": "Projectile range on level ground is given by $R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g}$, with maximum at $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ where $R_{max} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g}$. Complementary angles (summing to 90°) produce equal ranges. The trajectory follows a parabolic path $y = x\\tan\\theta - \\frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2\\cos^2\\theta}$, with scaling such that doubling initial speed quadruples both range and maximum height. Advanced applications include elevated launches with extended range, obstacle clearance calculations, and the envelope of safety defining all reachable points. Real-world scenarios often require modifying these ideal equations for practical constraints like different launch and landing heights, obstacles, and environmental factors."
