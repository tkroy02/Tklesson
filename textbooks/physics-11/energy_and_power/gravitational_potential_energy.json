  "summary": "The universal gravitational potential energy is $U_g = -\\frac{GMm}{r}$, with zero defined at infinite separation. Total mechanical energy $E = KE + U_g$ determines orbital characteristics: negative E → bound orbits, zero E → parabolic escape trajectory, positive E → hyperbolic trajectories. For circular orbits, $E = \\frac{1}{2}U_g$ and $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$. Escape velocity $v_{escape} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$ gives the minimum speed to reach infinity with zero kinetic energy and is independent of the escaping object's mass. The Virial Theorem states $\\langle KE \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\langle U_g \\rangle$ for stable gravitational systems. These concepts form the foundation for understanding orbital mechanics, space mission planning, and celestial phenomena."
