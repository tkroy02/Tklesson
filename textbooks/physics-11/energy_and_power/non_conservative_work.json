  "summary": "Non-conservative forces are characterized by path-dependent work and mechanical energy dissipation. The work done by non-conservative forces equals the change in total mechanical energy: $W_{nc} = \\Delta KE + \\Delta PE$. Common examples include kinetic friction ($W_f = -\\mu_k N d$) and air resistance. The generalized work-energy theorem provides complete energy accounting: $W_{nc} = \\Delta E_{mech}$. Efficiency measures useful energy output: $\\eta = (useful\\ output/total\\ input) \\times 100\\%$. Power dissipation is $P = |W_{nc}|/\\Delta t$. While mechanical energy decreases in dissipative systems, total energy is conserved, with mechanical energy converting to thermal energy and other forms. These concepts are essential for analyzing real-world systems where energy losses occur and for designing efficient mechanical systems."
