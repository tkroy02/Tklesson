  "summary": "Power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy: $P = \\frac{W}{\\Delta t}$ for average power, $P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$ for instantaneous power. For mechanical systems, $P = Fv$ (linear motion) or $P = \\tau\\omega$ (rotational motion). Electrical power is $P = IV$ for DC circuits. Efficiency is $\\eta = \\frac{P_{useful}}{P_{input}} \\times 100\\%$, always less than 100% in real systems. Energy consumption is $E = P\\Delta t$, with electrical energy typically measured in kilowatt-hours (1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J). Power concepts connect physics to practical considerations like vehicle performance, energy costs, and system efficiency. Understanding power helps analyze how quickly energy transformations occur and optimize systems for performance and economy."
