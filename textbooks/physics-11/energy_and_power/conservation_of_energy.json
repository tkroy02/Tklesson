  "summary": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed or transferred. For mechanical systems with only conservative forces, total mechanical energy is conserved: $KE + PE = constant$. Conservative forces (gravity, springs) are path-independent and allow complete energy recovery. Non-conservative forces (friction, air resistance) dissipate mechanical energy as heat or other forms, with $W_{nc} = \\Delta KE + \\Delta PE$. The work-energy theorem provides the complete framework: $W_{net} = \\Delta KE$. Power measures energy transfer rate: $P = W/\\Delta t = Fv$ for constant force. Efficiency ($\\eta$) measures useful energy output relative to total input. These principles form the foundation for analyzing all mechanical systems and understanding energy transformations in the physical world."
