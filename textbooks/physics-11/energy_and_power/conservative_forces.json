  "summary": "Conservative forces are characterized by three equivalent properties: (1) work independence of path, (2) zero work over closed paths, and (3) existence of a potential energy function with $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$. In 3D, a force is conservative if $\\nabla \\times \\vec{F} = 0$. Common examples include gravity, spring forces, and electrostatic forces. The relationship $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$ allows conversion between force and energy descriptions. Equilibrium occurs where $\\nabla U = 0$, with stability determined by the curvature of U. For systems with only conservative forces, mechanical energy $E = K + U$ is conserved. These concepts provide powerful methods for analyzing physical systems without solving differential equations of motion directly."
