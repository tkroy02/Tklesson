  "summary": "Energy bar charts provide visual representations of energy distribution and transformations. They show different energy forms (KE, PE_grav, PE_elastic, E_thermal, etc.) as colored bars, with heights proportional to energy amounts. For conservative systems, the total bar height remains constant as energy transforms between forms. For systems with non-conservative forces, bars for work (W) and thermal energy (E_thermal) show energy entering/leaving the system or being dissipated. LOL diagrams are a specific type of energy bar chart that clearly separates energy in the system from energy transfers across system boundaries. Energy bar charts serve as powerful problem-solving tools by organizing information visually, helping identify appropriate energy principles to apply, and revealing energy flow patterns that might be missed in purely mathematical approaches. They are particularly valuable for developing conceptual understanding of energy conservation and dissipation."
