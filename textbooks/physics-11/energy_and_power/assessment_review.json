  "summary": "The complete energy framework integrates: work ($W = Fd\\cos\\theta$), kinetic energy ($KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$), gravitational potential energy ($PE_g = mgh$ or $U_g = -\\frac{GMm}{r}$), elastic potential energy ($PE_{spring} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$), conservation principles ($KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$ for conservative systems), work-energy theorem ($W_{nc} = \\Delta KE + \\Delta PE$ for non-conservative systems), and power ($P = \\frac{W}{\\Delta t} = Fv$). Energy bar charts provide visual representation of energy transformations. Efficiency ($\\eta = \\frac{useful\\ output}{total\\ input}$) quantifies energy utilization. Successful problem-solving requires systematic approach: identify forces, select appropriate method, apply equations, solve, and verify. Common misconceptions must be addressed through conceptual clarification and multiple verification methods."
