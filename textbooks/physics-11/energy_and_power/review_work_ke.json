  "summary": "Work in physics is defined as $W = Fd\\cos\\theta$ for constant forces, where only the force component parallel to displacement contributes. Work can be positive (energy added), negative (energy removed), or zero (no energy transfer). Kinetic energy is $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and represents energy of motion. The work-energy theorem states $W_{net} = \\Delta KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$, providing a powerful alternative to Newton's laws for solving motion problems. For multiple forces, $W_{net} = \\sum W_i = \\Delta KE$. Key applications include braking distance calculations, inclined plane problems with friction, and systems with energy dissipation. The work-energy approach is particularly useful when forces and displacements are known but time or acceleration are not needed explicitly."
