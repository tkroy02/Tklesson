  "summary": "Hooke's Law states $F_s = -kx$ for ideal springs, with the spring constant k measuring stiffness. Elastic potential energy is $PE_{elastic} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, representing work done to deform the spring and the area under the F-x curve. This energy increases with the square of displacement, so doubling compression quadruples stored energy. In conservative systems, total mechanical energy is conserved: $KE + PE_{gravitational} + PE_{elastic} = constant$. Maximum speed occurs at the equilibrium position where spring force is zero. Vertical spring systems involve all three energy forms, while horizontal systems involve only elastic and kinetic energy. These principles form the foundation for understanding oscillatory motion, mechanical energy storage, and elastic systems in engineering and physics."
