  "summary": "Work by variable forces requires integration: $W = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x)  dx$. For springs obeying Hooke's Law ($F = -kx$), the work is $W = \\frac{1}{2}k(x_f^2 - x_i^2)$, which equals the change in elastic potential energy. Graphically, work equals the area under the force vs. position curve. Estimation methods include counting squares and numerical integration techniques like the trapezoidal rule. The work-energy theorem extends to variable forces: $\\int F_{net}(x)  dx = \\Delta KE$. Key applications include spring systems, gravitational fields, and experimental data analysis. These methods handle real-world situations where forces change continuously with position, providing complete energy accounting for complex physical systems."
