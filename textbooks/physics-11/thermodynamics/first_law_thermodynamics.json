  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a system equals the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system on its surroundings.",
    "explanation": "This law represents energy accounting for thermal systems: energy enters as heat, leaves as work, and any difference changes the system's internal energy stored in molecular motion and interactions."

  "summary": "The First Law of Thermodynamics (ΔU = Q - W) is the principle of energy conservation for thermal systems. Internal energy changes result from the balance between heat added to the system and work done by the system. For ideal gases, internal energy depends solely on temperature, enabling powerful predictions about system behavior."
