  "summary": "The First Law of Thermodynamics, $\\Delta U = Q - W$, expresses energy conservation in thermal systems. Internal energy changes balance heat transfer into the system minus work done by the system. Work in expansion/compression is $W = \\int P\\, dV$, represented by the area under P-V curves. Key processes include isobaric (constant P), isochoric (constant V), isothermal (constant T), and adiabatic (no heat transfer). For ideal gases, internal energy depends only on temperature. In complete cycles, $\\Delta U = 0$ and $Q_{\\text{net}} = W_{\\text{net}}$. The First Law governs energy transformations in engines, refrigerators, and all thermal systems, preventing perpetual motion and setting fundamental limits on energy conversion efficiency."
