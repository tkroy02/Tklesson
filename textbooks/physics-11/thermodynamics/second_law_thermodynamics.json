  "summary": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy of an isolated system never decreases, explaining why processes have preferred directions and perfect heat engines are impossible. Entropy measures disorder through $S = k_B \\ln W$ (statistical) or $\\Delta S = \\int dQ_{rev}/T$ (thermodynamic). Key implications include: heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold, all natural processes are irreversible, and maximum heat engine efficiency is $\\eta_{max} = 1 - T_C/T_H$. Refrigerators and heat pumps require work input to transfer heat against its natural flow. The Second Law governs everything from microscopic processes to cosmological evolution, setting fundamental limits on energy conversion and explaining why complex structures require continuous energy input to maintain organization against the universal trend toward disorder."
