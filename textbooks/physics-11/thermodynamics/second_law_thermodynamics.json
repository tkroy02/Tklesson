  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that natural processes tend to proceed in the direction of increasing total entropy. It explains why heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold, why engines cannot be 100% efficient, and why some processes are irreversible.",
    "explanation": "While the First Law concerns energy conservation, the Second Law governs the direction and quality of energy transformations. It introduces the concept of entropy as a fundamental property that quantifies the irreversibility of natural processes."

  "summary": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the direction of natural processes through the concept of entropy, which always increases for isolated systems. It sets fundamental limits on heat engine efficiency (η ≤ 1 - T_C/T_H) and explains why complete conversion of heat to work is impossible. Entropy quantifies energy dispersal and the irreversibility of real processes."
