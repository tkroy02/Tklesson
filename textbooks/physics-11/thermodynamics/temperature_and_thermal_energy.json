  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the fundamental concepts of thermal physics, distinguishing between temperature, thermal energy, and heat. It establishes the basis for understanding how energy transfers between systems and how we measure thermal states.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance, while thermal energy represents the total internal energy of all particles. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between systems due to temperature differences.",
    "explanation": "Temperature is an intensive property (independent of amount), measured in degrees Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. Thermal energy is an extensive property (depends on amount) measured in joules. Heat flows spontaneously from higher temperature to lower temperature regions until thermal equilibrium is reached."

Assume no heat loss to surroundings.\n\n**Answer:** **Energy Conservation Approach:**\n- Heat lost by hot water = Heat gained by cold water\n- $m_1c(T_1 - T_f) = m_2c(T_f - T_2)$\n- $(0.2)(4186)(80 - T_f) = (0.3)(4186)(T_f - 20)$\n- Cancel specific heat capacity (c): $(0.2)(80 - T_f) = (0.3)(T_f - 20)$\n- $16 - 0.2T_f = 0.3T_f - 6$\n- $22 = 0.5T_f$\n- $T_f = 44°C$\n\n**Key Insight:** The final temperature is closer to the temperature of the larger mass, as expected."
