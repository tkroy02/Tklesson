  "summary": "Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles and is an intensive property, while thermal energy is the total internal energy and is extensive. Heat represents thermal energy transfer due to temperature difference. The zeroth law of thermodynamics defines temperature through thermal equilibrium. Different temperature scales (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) serve various purposes with specific conversion relationships. Heat transfer calculations use Q = mcΔT, with specific heat capacity varying by material. Thermal expansion follows ΔL = αL₀ΔT for linear expansion and must be accommodated in engineering designs. Understanding these fundamental concepts provides the foundation for thermodynamics, heat transfer, and numerous practical applications in engineering, environmental science, and daily life."
