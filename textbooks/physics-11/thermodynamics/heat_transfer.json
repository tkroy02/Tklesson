  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Heat transfer occurs through three primary mechanisms: conduction (direct molecular contact), convection (fluid motion), and radiation (electromagnetic waves). The rate of heat transfer depends on material properties, temperature differences, and geometric factors.",
    "explanation": "Conduction involves energy transfer through molecular collisions in solids or stationary fluids. Convection requires bulk fluid motion to transport heat. Radiation transfers energy through electromagnetic waves that can travel through vacuum, requiring no medium."
