  "summary": "Heat transfers through three fundamental mechanisms: conduction (Q/t = kAΔT/Δx) through molecular interactions in materials, convection (Q/t = hAΔT) through fluid motion, and radiation (Q/t = εσAT⁴) through electromagnetic waves. Conduction dominates in solids, convection in fluids, and radiation at high temperatures or in vacuum. Most real systems involve multiple mechanisms, with the dominant mechanism depending on the situation. Understanding these heat transfer principles enables efficient thermal management in engineering systems, building design, energy conversion, and environmental control."
