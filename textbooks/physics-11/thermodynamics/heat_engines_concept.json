  "summary": "Heat engines convert thermal energy to mechanical work through thermodynamic cycles, with efficiency limited by the second law to $\\eta \\leq 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}$. The Carnot cycle provides the theoretical maximum efficiency, while practical engines use cycles like Otto (gasoline), Diesel (diesel), and Brayton (gas turbines). Efficiency improves with higher compression ratios and temperature differences between reservoirs. Advanced systems like combined cycle plants and cogeneration achieve high overall fuel utilization by maximizing work output and useful heat application. Real engines have efficiencies significantly below theoretical limits due to friction, heat losses, and other irreversibilities. Understanding heat engine principles is essential for energy system design, efficiency optimization, and sustainable energy planning across transportation, power generation, and industrial applications."
