  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A heat engine is a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle, absorbing heat from a high-temperature reservoir, converting part of this heat into work, and rejecting the remaining heat to a low-temperature reservoir.",
    "explanation": "Heat engines follow a continuous cycle where the working substance returns to its initial state, allowing continuous operation. The efficiency of this energy conversion is limited by the temperatures of the heat reservoirs."

All these devices obey the First Law of Thermodynamics in their energy accounting."
