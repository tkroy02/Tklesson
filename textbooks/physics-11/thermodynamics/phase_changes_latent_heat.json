  "summary": "Phase changes occur at constant temperature with energy absorption or release as latent heat. Latent heat of fusion ($L_f$) applies to solid-liquid transitions, while latent heat of vaporization ($L_v$) applies to liquid-gas transitions, with $Q = mL$ for energy calculations. Heating curves show temperature plateaus during phase changes where energy input doesn't increase temperature. Water has exceptionally high latent heats ($L_f = 334,000$ J/kg, $L_v = 2,260,000$ J/kg) due to hydrogen bonding. Phase change temperatures depend on pressure according to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Applications include refrigeration, evaporative cooling, thermal storage, and climate regulation, leveraging the substantial energy transfers during phase transitions."
