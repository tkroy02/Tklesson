  "topic": "7.4 Phase Changes and Latent Heat",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores the energy transfers involved when substances change phase (solid, liquid, gas) without changing temperature, introducing the concept of latent heat as the 'hidden' energy of transformation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "During phase changes, energy is absorbed or released while temperature remains constant. This energy, called latent heat, breaks or forms molecular bonds rather than increasing kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "Latent heat is the energy required per unit mass to change phase at constant temperature. Fusion (melting/freezing) and vaporization (boiling/condensation) have distinct latent heat values characteristic of each substance."

  "summary": "Phase changes occur at constant temperature but require significant energy transfer. Latent heat (L) quantifies the energy per mass needed for phase transitions. Complete thermal analysis must account for both sensible heat (Q = mcΔT) during temperature changes and latent heat (Q = mL) during phase transitions."
