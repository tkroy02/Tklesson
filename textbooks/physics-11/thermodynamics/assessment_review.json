  "summary": "Thermodynamics integrates energy conservation (First Law: $\\Delta U = Q - W$) with directional constraints (Second Law: $\\Delta S_{universe} \\geq 0$). Key concepts include: heat engines convert thermal to mechanical work with maximum efficiency $\\eta_{max} = 1 - T_C/T_H$; entropy measures disorder and always increases in isolated systems; reversible processes represent ideal limits while real processes are irreversible with entropy generation. Advanced applications span combined energy systems, biological processes, and environmental thermodynamics. Problem-solving requires systematic application of both laws, careful definition of system boundaries, and verification against fundamental limits. Thermodynamics provides essential tools for analyzing energy systems, understanding natural processes, and designing efficient technologies across all fields of science and engineering."
