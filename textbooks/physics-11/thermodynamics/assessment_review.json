Define the System and Process Type:**\n   - Identify the working substance and its boundaries.\n   - Classify the process: isobaric, isochoric, isothermal, adiabatic, or other.\n   - Determine if it's a single process or a cycle.\n\n**2. Identify Energy Transfers:**\n   - **Heat (Q):** Identify heat sources/sinks and calculate Q using appropriate methods.\n   - **Work (W):** Calculate work using W = ∫PdV or process-specific formulas.\n   - **Internal Energy (ΔU):** Relate to temperature changes or use First Law.\n\n**3. Apply the Correct Thermodynamic Law:**\n   - **First Law:** ΔU = Q - W (always valid)\n   - **Second Law:** For efficiency limits and process direction\n   - **Special Cases:** Use process-specific simplifications\n\n**4. Execute Calculations:**\n   - **Heat Transfer:** Q = mcΔT (sensible), Q = mL (latent), Q = ∫TdS (advanced)\n   - **Work:** W = PΔV (isobaric), W = 0 (isochoric), W = nRTln(Vf/Vi) (isothermal)\n   - **Efficiency:** η = W_net/Q_H for engines, COP = Q_C/W_in for refrigerators\n\n**5. Check Consistency:**\n   - Verify energy conservation (First Law).\n   - Check entropy changes comply with Second Law.\n   - Ensure units are consistent throughout.",

They argue that since their design uses special materials, it can exceed the Carnot limit.

The Carnot efficiency (η_Carnot = 1 - T_C/T_H = 1 - 300/400 = 25%) represents the maximum possible efficiency for ANY heat engine operating between these temperatures, regardless of the working substance or engine design.\n\n**Correct Principle:** No engine, no matter how cleverly designed or what materials are used, can exceed the Carnot efficiency between the same two temperature reservoirs. This is a fundamental limit imposed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, not a technological limitation."

In the standard thermodynamics sign convention:\n- W represents work done BY the system\n- Work done ON the system is therefore negative\n\n**Correct Calculation:**\n- Q = -300 J (heat released FROM system)\n- W = -500 J (work done ON system = negative work BY system)\n- ΔU = Q - W = (-300) - (-500) = -300 + 500 = +200 J\n\n**Interpretation:** The gas gains 200 J of internal energy despite losing heat, because more work is done on it than heat it loses."

Does its internal energy increase, decrease, or stay the same?** (Answer: It increases because both temperature and volume increase in isobaric expansion of an ideal gas.)\n4.  **Can a heat engine be 100% efficient? Why or why not?** (Answer: No, it would violate the Second Law by converting heat completely to work with no heat rejection.)\n5.  **What is the difference between a refrigerator's COP and a heat engine's efficiency?** (Answer: COP = desired effect/work input; efficiency = work output/heat input. COP can be >1.)\n6.  **Why must heat be rejected in a power plant?** (Answer: The Second Law requires that not all heat can be converted to work; some must be rejected to a cold reservoir.)"
