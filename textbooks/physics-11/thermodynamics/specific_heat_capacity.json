  "expanded_description": "This section quantifies how different substances respond to the addition or removal of thermal energy, introducing the concept of specific heat capacity as a measure of a material's thermal inertia.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The specific heat capacity of a substance determines the amount of heat required to change its temperature. Substances with high specific heat capacities require more energy to change temperature and are effective at storing thermal energy.",
    "explanation": "Specific heat capacity (c) is an intensive property that characterizes how much energy per unit mass is needed to raise a substance's temperature by one degree. The same amount of heat will cause different temperature changes in different materials."

  "summary": "Specific heat capacity (c) quantifies a material's resistance to temperature change. The heat equation Q = mcΔT allows calculation of energy transfers during heating and cooling. Materials with high specific heat capacities, like water, are excellent thermal energy reservoirs and experience smaller temperature changes for the same heat input."
