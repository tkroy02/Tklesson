Calorimetry applies energy conservation to determine unknown thermal properties. Water's high specific heat capacity ($4186\\, \\text{J/kg·°C}$) makes it exceptional for temperature regulation. Advanced applications involve multiple substances, phase changes, and real systems with heat loss. Understanding heat capacity enables analysis of thermal storage, climate systems, engineering design, and energy efficiency across numerous practical applications."
