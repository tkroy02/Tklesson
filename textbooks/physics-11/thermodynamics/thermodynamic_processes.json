Each process has distinct work, heat transfer, and internal energy relationships governed by the first law $\\Delta U = Q - W$. Isobaric processes involve significant work done during volume change, isochoric processes convert all heat to internal energy change, and isothermal processes require heat transfer that exactly balances work done. Understanding these fundamental processes provides the foundation for analyzing complex thermodynamic cycles and real-world energy conversion systems."
