  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Thermodynamic processes are characterized by which state variables (pressure, volume, temperature) remain constant. Each type of constrained process follows specific relationships between heat, work, and internal energy changes.",
    "explanation": "The path taken between initial and final states determines the work done and heat transfer, even when the endpoints are identical. Different constrained paths lead to different energy exchanges with the surroundings."
