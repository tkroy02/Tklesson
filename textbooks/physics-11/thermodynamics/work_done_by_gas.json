  "summary": "Work done by gases during expansion and compression is calculated as $W = \\int P\\, dV$ and equals the area under the process path on PV diagrams. Work is path-dependent, with different processes between the same states involving different work amounts. Specific formulas apply for common processes: isobaric ($W = P\\Delta V$), isothermal ($W = nRT\\ln(V_f/V_i)$), and adiabatic ($W = (P_fV_f - P_iV_i)/(\\gamma-1)$). In thermodynamic cycles, net work equals the enclosed area on PV diagrams and determines engine performance. The mean effective pressure (MEP) standardizes work comparison across different engines. Understanding gas work is fundamental to analyzing heat engines, compressors, and all thermodynamic energy conversion systems."
