  "expanded_description": "This section focuses specifically on calculating the work done by or on a gas during expansion and compression processes, emphasizing the graphical interpretation and mathematical formulation of thermodynamic work.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The work done by a gas during a volume change equals the area under the pressure-volume (PV) curve. Work is path-dependent, meaning the same initial and final states can involve different amounts of work depending on the process path.",
    "explanation": "Unlike internal energy which is a state function, work depends on the specific path taken between states. Expansion work (ΔV > 0) is positive (work done BY gas), while compression work (ΔV < 0) is negative (work done ON gas)."

For variable pressure processes, integration or geometric area methods are required."
