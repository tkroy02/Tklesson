  "expanded_description": "This section introduces parallel circuits, the second fundamental way to connect circuit components. In a parallel circuit, components are connected across the same two points, providing multiple paths for current flow. Understanding parallel circuits is essential for analyzing household wiring and complex networks. Key characteristics include the same voltage across all components, the division of total current among branches, and the reciprocal addition of resistances to find the equivalent resistance.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A parallel circuit has components connected such that each is directly connected across the voltage source, providing multiple paths for current. The voltage $V$ is the same across every branch. The total current supplied by the source equals the sum of the currents through each branch: $I_{\\text{total}} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + \\dots$. The equivalent resistance $R_{\\text{eq}}$ of a parallel combination is given by $\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{1}{R_3} + \\dots$. For two resistors in parallel, this simplifies to $R_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$.",
    "explanation": "In a parallel circuit, each component provides an independent path for current. This means that if one component fails (opens), current continues to flow through the other paths. The voltage across each component is the same because they are all connected directly to the same two points. The total current is the sum of the branch currents, following Kirchhoff's current law. The equivalent resistance is less than the smallest individual resistance because adding more paths makes it easier for current to flow. These principles allow us to analyze parallel circuits and predict current distribution, power dissipation, and the effect of adding or removing components.",

        "context": "Parallel circuits are ubiquitous in real‑world applications because they allow independent operation of loads.

The total current supplied by the source is the sum of the branch currents: $I_{\\text{total}} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + \\dots$ (Kirchhoff's current law). The equivalent resistance of a parallel combination is found from $\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{1}{R_3} + \\dots$. For two resistors, this simplifies to $R_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$. The equivalent resistance is always less than the smallest individual resistance. Current divides among branches inversely with resistance: smaller resistance carries more current. The current divider rule for two resistors is $I_1 = \\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} I_{\\text{total}}$, $I_2 = \\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} I_{\\text{total}}$. Power dissipated in each branch is $P_i = V^2 / R_i = V I_i$, and total power is the sum of branch powers. If one branch opens, others continue to operate normally. Common mistakes include confusing series and parallel resistance formulas, assuming voltage divides, misapplying the current divider rule, and unit errors. Understanding parallel circuits is essential for analyzing household wiring and complex networks."
