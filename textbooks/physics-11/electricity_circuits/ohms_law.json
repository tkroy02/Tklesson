  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Ohm's law, one of the most fundamental relationships in electric circuits. Named after German physicist Georg Ohm, this law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across those points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor. Ohm's law provides the mathematical foundation for analyzing simple circuits and understanding how voltage, current, and resistance interact. While not all materials obey Ohm's law (they are called non‑ohmic), many common circuit elements like resistors and wires do, making this law essential for circuit analysis.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Ohm's law states that the current $I$ through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage $V$ applied across it and inversely proportional to its resistance $R$. Mathematically, $V = IR$, where $V$ is the potential difference in volts (V), $I$ is the current in amperes (A), and $R$ is the resistance in ohms ($\\Omega$). The law applies to ohmic materials where the resistance remains constant over a range of voltages.",
    "explanation": "Ohm's law expresses the linear relationship between voltage and current for ohmic conductors. If you double the voltage across a resistor, the current doubles, provided the resistance remains constant. The constant of proportionality is the resistance, which depends on the material's geometry and intrinsic resistivity. The law can be rearranged to solve for any of the three quantities: $V = IR$, $I = V/R$, or $R = V/I$. It is important to note that Ohm's law is not a fundamental law of nature but an empirical relationship that holds for many materials under certain conditions (constant temperature, etc.).",

Ohm's law applies to ohmic materials (like most metal wires and resistors) at constant temperature; non‑ohmic materials (diodes, filaments) have a nonlinear $I$‑$V$ relationship. In circuit analysis, careful attention must be paid to units (converting mA, k$\\Omega$, etc.) and to the sign convention for voltage and current.
