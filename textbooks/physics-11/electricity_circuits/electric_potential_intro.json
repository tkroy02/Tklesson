  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the concept of electric potential, a scalar quantity that describes the potential energy per unit charge at a point in an electric field. Often simply called \"voltage,\" electric potential is fundamental to understanding how charges move in electric circuits and how energy is transferred in electrical systems. The related concept of potential difference (voltage) between two points determines the work done when moving a charge between those points.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Electric potential $V$ at a point is the electric potential energy per unit positive charge that would be possessed by a test charge placed at that point: $V = \\frac{U}{q_0}$. The potential difference $\\Delta V$ between two points is the work done per unit charge to move a charge between those points: $\\Delta V = V_B - V_A = -\\frac{W_{AB}}{q_0}$ (where $W_{AB}$ is work done by the electric field). The SI unit of electric potential is the volt (V), where $1 \\,\\text{V} = 1 \\,\\text{J/C}$.",
    "explanation": "Electric potential is analogous to gravitational potential: just as a mass has gravitational potential energy due to its position in a gravitational field, a charge has electric potential energy due to its position in an electric field. Unlike the electric field (a vector), potential is a scalar, making calculations simpler in many situations. The potential difference, or voltage, is what drives current in circuits. For a point charge $Q$, the electric potential at a distance $r$ is $V = k\\frac{Q}{r}$ (taking $V = 0$ at infinity). Equipotential surfaces connect points of equal potential; they are always perpendicular to electric field lines.",

      "introduction": "When we work with electric fields, we often want to know how much energy a charge has due to its position. Electric potential provides this information in a way that is independent of the charge itself, making it a powerful tool for analyzing electric systems.",
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "Electric potential $V$ at a point in an electric field is defined as the electric potential energy $U$ per unit positive charge: $V = \\frac{U}{q_0}$. It is a scalar quantity measured in volts (V), where $1 \\,\\text{V} = 1 \\,\\text{J/C}$. The potential difference $\\Delta V$ between point A and point B is $\\Delta V = V_B - V_A$.",
        "context": "Electric potential (often simply called \"voltage\") is a practical concept because it relates directly to energy transfers in circuits. A battery provides a fixed potential difference (e.g., 1.5 V) between its terminals, meaning that each coulomb of charge gains 1.5 J of energy as it passes through the battery. Potential is also crucial in understanding capacitors, where the voltage across the plates determines the stored energy."

  "summary": "Electric potential $V$ is a scalar quantity defined as the electric potential energy per unit positive charge: $V = U/q_0$. Its SI unit is the volt (V), where $1 \\,\\text{V} = 1 \\,\\text{J/C}$. Potential difference $\\Delta V$ between two points is related to the work done to move a charge: $W = q \\Delta V$ (for work by an external agent). For a point charge $Q$, $V = kQ/r$ (taking $V=0$ at infinity). Potential obeys superposition algebraically (scalar addition), making it easier to work with than electric field. Equipotential surfaces connect points of equal potential; they are perpendicular to electric field lines. The electric field is related to the potential gradient: $\\vec{E} = -\\nabla V$, or in one dimension $E_x = -dV/dx$. Common mistakes include confusing potential $V$ with potential energy $U$, sign errors when including charges in superposition, unit confusion, and misapplying the work‑potential relationship. Understanding electric potential is essential for analyzing circuits, capacitors, and energy transfers in electric systems."
