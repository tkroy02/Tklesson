  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the concept of an electric field, a fundamental idea in physics that describes how electric charges influence the space around them. Rather than thinking of forces as acting instantaneously at a distance, the electric field model envisions that a charge creates a field in the surrounding space, and another charge experiences a force due to that field. This field concept is essential for understanding electromagnetism and is the foundation for electric potential, capacitors, and electromagnetic waves.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An electric field $\\vec{E}$ is a vector field that exists in the region around any charged object. It represents the force per unit positive charge that would be experienced by a test charge placed at that point. Mathematically, $\\vec{E} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{q_0}$, where $\\vec{F}$ is the force on a small positive test charge $q_0$. For a point charge $Q$, the electric field at a distance $r$ is $E = k\\frac{|Q|}{r^2}$, directed radially outward from $Q$ if $Q$ is positive, and inward if $Q$ is negative.",
    "explanation": "The electric field provides a way to visualize and calculate the influence of charges without invoking action at a distance. Once we know the electric field at a point, the force on any charge placed there is simply $\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E}$. Electric fields obey the superposition principle: the total field due to multiple charges is the vector sum of the individual fields. Field lines (lines of force) are a useful visual representation: they point in the direction of the field, start on positive charges and end on negative charges, and their density indicates field strength.",

      "introduction": "How does one charge 'know' that another charge is nearby? The concept of an electric field provides the answer: charges create fields in space, and other charges respond to those fields. This idea, introduced by Michael Faraday, revolutionized our understanding of electricity and magnetism.",
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "An electric field $\\vec{E}$ is a vector quantity defined as the electric force $\\vec{F}$ experienced by a small positive test charge $q_0$ divided by that charge: $\\vec{E} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{q_0}$. The electric field exists independently of the test charge; it is a property of the charge distribution that creates it.",
        "context": "The electric field concept is powerful because it separates the cause (source charges) from the effect (force on another charge). It allows us to calculate fields from complex charge distributions and then determine forces on any charge placed in that field. Electric fields are fundamental to understanding capacitors, electric potential, and electromagnetic waves."

  "summary": "The electric field $\\vec{E}$ is a vector field that describes the influence of electric charges on the space around them. It is defined as the force per unit positive test charge: $\\vec{E} = \\vec{F}/q_0$. For a point charge $Q$, $E = k|Q|/r^2$, directed radially away from positive charges and toward negative charges. Electric fields obey the superposition principle: the total field due to multiple charges is the vector sum of the individual fields. Field lines provide a visual representation: they start on positive charges, end on negative charges, never cross, and their density indicates field strength. Once the field is known, the force on any charge $q$ is $\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E}$. Common mistakes include confusing field with force, direction errors (especially for negative charges), sign errors in superposition, unit conversion errors, and misinterpreting field line diagrams. Understanding electric fields is essential for analyzing electric potential, capacitors, and electromagnetic phenomena."
