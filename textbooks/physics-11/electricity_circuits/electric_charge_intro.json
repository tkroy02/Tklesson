  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the fundamental concept of electric charge, a property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Electric charge is the foundation of all electrical phenomena, from the attraction between a rubbed balloon and hair to the operation of complex electronic devices. We explore the two types of charge, the principle of conservation of charge, and the quantization of charge, laying the groundwork for understanding Coulomb's law, electric fields, and electric circuits.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that comes in two types: positive and negative. Like charges repel, unlike charges attract. Charge is conserved (cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred) and quantized (exists in integer multiples of the elementary charge $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ C).",
    "explanation": "All matter is composed of atoms containing positively charged protons, negatively charged electrons, and neutral neutrons. Objects become charged when there is an imbalance in the number of protons and electrons. The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C). The principle of conservation of charge states that the total charge in an isolated system remains constant. The quantization of charge means that any observable charge is an integer multiple of the electron's charge, reflecting the discrete nature of charge carriers.",

Protons carry positive charge, electrons carry negative charge, and neutrons are neutral. Like charges repel, unlike charges attract. Charge is conserved: the total charge in an isolated system remains constant. Charge is also quantized: any observable charge is an integer multiple of the elementary charge $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ C. Objects can be charged by friction (electron transfer through rubbing), contact (direct transfer when touching), or induction (charge separation without contact). A neutral object can be attracted to a charged object through polarization. Understanding these basic properties of charge is essential for studying Coulomb's law, electric fields, electric potential, and electric circuits."
