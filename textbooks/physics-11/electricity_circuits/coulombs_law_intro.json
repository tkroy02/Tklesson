  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Coulomb's law, the fundamental law of physics that describes the electric force between charged objects. Discovered by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in the 18th century, this law states that the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Coulomb's law is the electrostatic analogue of Newton's law of universal gravitation and forms the foundation for understanding electric fields, electric potential, and all of electrostatics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Coulomb's law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by $F = k\\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$, where $k = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\,\\text{N·m}^2/\\text{C}^2$ is Coulomb's constant. The force is directed along the line connecting the charges: repulsive for like charges, attractive for unlike charges.",
    "explanation": "Coulomb's law quantifies the force between charges, revealing that the force decreases rapidly with distance (inverse square law) and increases with the magnitude of the charges. The constant $k$ is related to the permittivity of free space $\\varepsilon_0$ by $k = 1/(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0)$. Like gravitational force, electrostatic force is a central force (acts along the line joining the centers) and obeys the superposition principle: the net force on a charge due to multiple other charges is the vector sum of the individual forces. Understanding Coulomb's law is essential for analyzing electric fields, electric potential, and the behavior of charged particles.",

  "summary": "Coulomb's law describes the electrostatic force between two point charges: $F = k\\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$, where $k = 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\,\\text{N·m}^2/\\text{C}^2$. The force acts along the line connecting the charges and is repulsive for like charges, attractive for unlike charges. It is an inverse square law, meaning the force decreases rapidly with distance. When multiple charges are present, the net force on any charge is the vector sum of the forces due to each other charge (superposition principle). Coulomb's law is analogous to Newton's law of gravitation but with the important difference that electrostatic forces can be both attractive and repulsive. Common mistakes include forgetting to square the distance, sign errors in determining direction, unit conversion errors, and confusing Coulomb's constant with the gravitational constant. Understanding Coulomb's law is essential for analyzing electric fields, electric potential, and the behavior of charged particles in various configurations."
