  "expanded_description": "This section introduces series circuits, one of the two fundamental ways to connect circuit components. In a series circuit, components are connected end‑to‑end, forming a single path for current flow. Understanding series circuits is essential for analyzing more complex networks, as they exhibit predictable relationships between current, voltage, and resistance. Key characteristics include the same current through all components, the division of total voltage among components, and the simple addition of resistances to find the equivalent resistance.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A series circuit has all components connected in a single loop, so there is only one path for current. The current $I$ is the same through every component. The total voltage supplied by the source equals the sum of the voltage drops across each component: $V_{\\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + \\dots$. The equivalent resistance $R_{\\text{eq}}$ of a series combination is the sum of the individual resistances: $R_{\\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \\dots$.",
    "explanation": "In a series circuit, charge has no choice but to travel through each component in turn. This means the current is identical everywhere. Each component drops some voltage according to Ohm's law: $V_i = I R_i$. Adding these voltage drops gives the total supplied voltage (Kirchhoff's voltage law). The equivalent resistance is simply the sum because the same current must push through each resistance sequentially; the total opposition is the sum of the individual oppositions. These principles allow us to analyze series circuits and predict current, voltage drops, and power dissipation.",

  "summary": "In a series circuit, components are connected end‑to‑end, forming a single path for current. The current is the same through every component. The total voltage supplied by the source equals the sum of the individual voltage drops (Kirchhoff's voltage law). The equivalent resistance of a series combination is the sum of the individual resistances: $R_{\\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \\dots$. Individual voltage drops can be found using the voltage divider rule: $V_i = \\frac{R_i}{R_{\\text{eq}}} V_{\\text{total}}$. Power dissipated in each resistor is $P_i = I^2 R_i$, and total power supplied is $P_{\\text{total}} = I V_{\\text{total}} = I^2 R_{\\text{eq}}$. If any component fails open, current stops everywhere. Common mistakes include forgetting that current is constant, misapplying the voltage divider rule, confusing series and parallel resistance formulas, and ignoring internal resistance of batteries. Understanding series circuits is essential for analyzing more complex networks and practical applications like voltage dividers."
