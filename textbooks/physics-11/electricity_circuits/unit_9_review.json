  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review of all topics covered in Unit 9: Electricity and Circuits. It synthesizes the key concepts of electric charge, Coulomb's law, electric fields, electric potential, current, Ohm's law, resistance, and series and parallel circuits. Mastering these interconnected ideas is essential for understanding how electric circuits work, from simple battery‑and‑bulb arrangements to complex electronic devices.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Electricity and circuits are governed by fundamental principles: charge is conserved and quantized; Coulomb's law describes the force between charges; electric fields and potentials provide alternative ways to analyze electric interactions; current is the flow of charge; Ohm's law relates voltage, current, and resistance; resistance depends on material, geometry, and temperature; series and parallel circuits exhibit distinct behaviors for current, voltage, and equivalent resistance. These concepts unify to explain the operation of all electric circuits.",
    "explanation": "Unit 9 builds a complete framework for understanding electricity. We began with the nature of electric charge and the forces between charges (Coulomb's law). The electric field concept provided a way to visualize forces without action at a distance, and electric potential gave us a scalar alternative to fields. In circuits, we defined current as charge flow, learned that voltage drives current, and discovered Ohm's law relating them. Resistance was explored as a property depending on material, length, area, and temperature. Finally, we analyzed series and parallel circuits, learning how current, voltage, and resistance behave in each configuration. These concepts are essential for all of electronics and electrical engineering.",

  "summary": "Unit 9: Electricity and Circuits established the fundamental concepts for understanding electric charge at rest and in motion. Electrostatics introduced charge properties, Coulomb's law, electric fields, and electric potential. Current electricity defined current as charge flow, Ohm's law relating voltage, current, and resistance, and the factors affecting resistance ($R = \\rho L/A$, temperature dependence). Circuit analysis covered series circuits (same current, voltages add, resistances add) and parallel circuits (same voltage, currents add, reciprocals add for resistance). Key formulas include $F = kq_1q_2/r^2$, $E = kQ/r^2$, $V = kQ/r$, $I = \\Delta Q/\\Delta t$, $V = IR$, $R = \\rho L/A$, $R_T = R_0[1+\\alpha(T-T_0)]$, series $R_{\\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + \\dots$, parallel $\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\dots$, voltage divider $V_i = \\frac{R_i}{R_{\\text{total}}} V_{\\text{total}}$, and current divider $I_1 = \\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} I_{\\text{total}}$. Common mistakes include unit conversions, confusing series and parallel rules, sign errors in Coulomb's law, and misapplying Ohm's law to non‑ohmic materials. Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding electronics, power systems, and advanced physics."
