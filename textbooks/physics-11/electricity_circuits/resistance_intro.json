  "expanded_description": "This section explores the concept of electrical resistance, which quantifies how much a material opposes the flow of electric current. Resistance is a fundamental property that determines how much current will flow for a given applied voltage. We examine the factors that affect resistance: the type of material, its length, its cross-sectional area, and its temperature. Understanding these factors is essential for designing circuits, selecting appropriate wires and components, and explaining why some materials are conductors while others are insulators.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Resistance $R$ is a measure of the opposition to the flow of electric current. For a conductor, resistance depends on four factors: the material's intrinsic resistivity $\\rho$, the length $L$, the cross-sectional area $A$, and the temperature $T$. The relationship is $R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$. Resistivity $\\rho$ is a material property that quantifies how strongly the material opposes current flow; it varies with temperature.",
    "explanation": "At the atomic level, resistance arises from collisions between charge carriers (usually electrons) and the atoms of the conductor. Different materials have different atomic structures, leading to different resistivities. A longer conductor offers more resistance because electrons must travel through more material, encountering more collisions. A thicker conductor (larger cross-sectional area) offers less resistance because there are more paths for electrons to flow. Temperature affects resistance because increased atomic vibrations (at higher temperatures) cause more frequent collisions, increasing resistance in most conductors. Superconductors are materials that, below a critical temperature, have zero resistance.",

  "summary": "Resistance $R$ is the opposition to current flow, related to voltage and current by Ohm's law: $R = V/I$. For a uniform conductor, resistance depends on material (resistivity $\\rho$), length $L$, and cross-sectional area $A$: $R = \\rho L/A$. Longer conductors have higher resistance; thicker conductors have lower resistance. Resistivity $\\rho$ is a material property, measured in $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}$, with metals having low resistivity and insulators having extremely high resistivity. Temperature also affects resistance: for most metals, resistance increases with temperature according to $R_T = R_0[1 + \\alpha(T - T_0)]$, where $\\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient. Superconductors, below a critical temperature, have zero resistance. Common mistakes include unit conversion errors (mm² to m², diameter vs. radius), confusing resistivity with resistance, and misapplying the temperature formula. Understanding resistance factors is essential for circuit design, wire sizing, and selecting appropriate components."
