Vectors require both a magnitude and a direction to be fully specified. This distinction is fundamental because vector quantities follow different mathematical rules—they can be added, subtracted, and multiplied in ways that account for direction, not just size.",

    "explanation": "Imagine telling a friend to meet you '5 kilometers away.' That's not enough—they need to know which direction: north, east, etc. The distance (5 km) is a scalar; the displacement (5 km north) is a vector. Many physical quantities, like force, velocity, and acceleration, are vectors because direction matters. Understanding this distinction is the first step toward analyzing motion and interactions.",

Vectors have both magnitude and direction (e.g., displacement, velocity, acceleration, force). Vectors are represented graphically as arrows—length indicates magnitude, arrowhead indicates direction. Symbolically, vectors are written with an arrow ($\\vec{v}$) or in bold, and magnitude as $|\\vec{v}|$ or $v$. Key properties: two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction; the negative of a vector has same magnitude but opposite direction; multiplying a vector by a positive scalar changes magnitude only, by a negative scalar reverses direction. Common confusions include distance vs displacement and speed vs velocity—the vector versions include direction.
