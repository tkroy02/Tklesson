  "summary": "Scalars and vectors are two fundamental types of physical quantities. Scalars have only magnitude (size) and include quantities like mass, time, temperature, energy, and speed. They follow ordinary arithmetic rules and are fully described by a number and unit. Vectors have both magnitude and direction, including quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, and momentum. Vectors require special mathematical treatment - they do not add like ordinary numbers because direction matters. Vectors can be represented graphically as arrows (length = magnitude, arrowhead = direction), symbolically with notation like $\\vec{F}$ or **F**, or mathematically using components. Breaking vectors into perpendicular components ($v_x = v \\cos \\theta$, $v_y = v \\sin \\theta$) is a powerful technique that allows separate treatment of horizontal and vertical directions. Given components, magnitude is found using the Pythagorean theorem $v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$, and direction using $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(v_y/v_x)$. Understanding whether a quantity is scalar or vector is essential for correctly applying physical laws and solving problems in physics."
