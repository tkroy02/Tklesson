By plotting experimental data, we can see trends, determine mathematical relationships, and make predictions through interpolation and extrapolation. Proper graphing techniques include labeling axes with quantities and units, choosing appropriate scales, drawing best-fit lines, and calculating slopes and intercepts to extract physical meaning.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Graphs reveal the relationship between variables. The shape of the graph indicates the type of relationship (linear, quadratic, inverse), and the slope and intercept often have physical significance.",
    "explanation": "When you drop a ball, plotting distance vs time squared gives a straight line whose slope relates to acceleration. This shows that graphing transforms raw data into a form that connects directly to physical laws. By mastering graphing techniques, you can analyze experimental data to confirm theories, determine constants, and predict behavior.",

  "summary": "Graphing is a powerful tool in physics for visualizing relationships, analyzing data, and communicating results. A proper graph includes labeled axes with units, a title, appropriate scales, data points, and a best‑fit line or curve. From linear graphs, we calculate the slope and intercept, which often correspond to physical quantities like speed, acceleration, or spring constants. When data follow a non‑linear relationship, linearization—replotting with transformed axes—allows us to use linear analysis. Interpolation estimates values within the data range; extrapolation extends beyond it but is less reliable. Error bars indicate measurement uncertainty, and scatter around the best‑fit line reflects precision. Avoiding common mistakes like poor scaling, missing labels, or connecting dots ensures that graphs accurately represent experimental results.",
