  "summary": "Graphing and data analysis are essential skills in physics for visualizing relationships between variables and interpreting experimental results. A proper graph includes a title, labeled axes with units, appropriate scales, data points, and a best-fit line or curve. The independent variable always goes on the x-axis, the dependent variable on the y-axis. Different relationships produce characteristic graph shapes: linear (straight line) shows constant rate of change, while non-linear (curved) shows changing rate. Best-fit lines smooth out random errors and show the overall trend, with points balanced above and below. Interpreting trends means describing in words the direction of change (positive or negative) and the rate of change (constant, increasing, or decreasing). Common mistakes include poor scale choices, connecting dots instead of drawing best-fit lines, reversing axes, and omitting labels. Proper graphing techniques allow physicists to communicate findings clearly and draw meaningful conclusions from experimental data."
