  "summary": "Laboratory safety and proper equipment use are fundamental to successful physics experiments. General safety practices include being prepared, staying attentive, and maintaining a clean workspace. Personal protective equipment (safety goggles, lab coats, closed-toe shoes) protects against specific hazards. Physics labs have unique risks including electrical shock, burns, mechanical injuries, and optical damage from intense light sources. Each requires specific precautions. Measurement tools must be used correctly for accurate results: rulers require proper alignment and parallax-free reading; balances must be zeroed; stopwatches need consistent technique; thermometers require proper immersion and stabilization time; graduated cylinders are read at the meniscus. Good technique includes checking for zero error, taking multiple trials, using consistent methods, and reading at eye level to avoid parallax. Proper care of equipment - cleaning after use, gentle handling, correct storage, and reporting problems - extends instrument life and ensures reliability. Understanding common mistakes helps students avoid errors and produce better experimental results."
