  "summary": "Laboratory safety and proper equipment use are fundamental to successful physics experiments. General safety practices include being prepared, staying attentive, and maintaining a clean workspace. Personal protective equipment (safety goggles, lab coats, closed-toe shoes, gloves) creates barriers against specific hazards. Physics labs have unique risks: electrical hazards (shock, short circuits), thermal hazards (burns from hot/cold equipment), mechanical hazards (moving parts, falling objects), and optical hazards (lasers, bright light). Each requires specific precautions and understanding of how the hazard causes injury. Measurement tools must be used correctly: rulers require proper alignment and parallax-free reading; balances must be zeroed and handled gently; stopwatches need consistent technique and multiple trials; thermometers require proper immersion and stabilization time; graduated cylinders are read at the meniscus at eye level. Proper technique includes checking for zero error, taking multiple trials, using consistent methods, and recording appropriate significant figures. Equipment care involves cleaning after use, gentle handling, proper storage, and reporting problems. Understanding common mistakes - from parallax error to touching container walls with thermometers - helps students avoid them and produce reliable measurements. These skills form the foundation for all future physics experiments."
