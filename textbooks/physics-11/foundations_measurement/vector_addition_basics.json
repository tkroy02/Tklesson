  "expanded_description": "This section introduces vector addition, a fundamental operation for combining vectors. Since vectors have both magnitude and direction, they cannot be added like ordinary numbers. Instead, we use graphical methods (tip-to-tail) and mathematical methods (component addition) to find the resultant vector.",

    "principle": "Vector addition combines two or more vectors to produce a single resultant vector that has the same effect as all the original vectors combined.",
    "explanation": "When multiple forces act on an object, or when an object undergoes multiple displacements, we need to find their combined effect. Vector addition provides the tools to do this accurately, whether using graphical methods for visualization or component methods for precision.",

  "summary": "Vector addition is the process of combining vectors to find a single resultant vector with the same net effect. Because vectors have direction, they cannot be added like ordinary numbers. Graphical methods include the tip-to-tail method (placing vectors sequentially) and the parallelogram method (drawing vectors from a common point and finding the diagonal). The most accurate method is component addition: break each vector into x and y components using $v_x = v \\cos \\theta$ and $v_y = v \\sin \\theta$, sum all x-components to get $R_x$ and all y-components to get $R_y$, then find the resultant magnitude $R = \\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}$ and direction $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(R_y/R_x)$, adjusting for the correct quadrant. Special cases include vectors in the same direction (add magnitudes), opposite directions (subtract magnitudes), and perpendicular vectors (Pythagorean theorem). Vector addition is commutative ($\\vec{A} + \\vec{B} = \\vec{B} + \\vec{A}$) and associative. Common mistakes include adding magnitudes without considering direction, forgetting quadrant adjustment when using arctan, and sign errors in components. Mastering vector addition is essential for analyzing forces, velocities, displacements, and many other physical situations."
