  "expanded_description": "Adding vectors is different from adding ordinary numbers because direction matters. When combining vectors, we must account for both magnitude and direction. The result of adding two or more vectors is a single vector called the resultant, which has the same effect as all the original vectors combined. Vector addition is essential in physics for finding net displacement, net force, net velocity, and more.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Vectors are added geometrically by connecting them tip-to-tail or by constructing a parallelogram. The resultant vector represents the combined effect.",
    "explanation": "Imagine walking 3 m east, then 4 m north. You don't end up 7 m away—you end up 5 m northeast. Adding vectors must account for direction. The tip-to-tail method visually shows how vectors combine: place the tail of the second at the tip of the first; the resultant runs from the first tail to the last tip. Mathematically, for perpendicular vectors, the Pythagorean theorem gives magnitude, and trigonometry gives direction.",

Graphically, the tip-to-tail method connects vectors sequentially; the resultant runs from the first tail to the last tip. The parallelogram method draws both vectors from a common origin, then uses the diagonal. For perpendicular vectors, the Pythagorean theorem gives resultant magnitude ($R = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$) and trigonometry gives direction ($\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(B/A)$). Vector subtraction is addition of a negative vector: $\\vec{A} - \\vec{B} = \\vec{A} + (-\\vec{B})$. Vector addition is commutative and associative, allowing flexible grouping. Common mistakes include adding magnitudes directly without regard to direction and misstating angles. Mastery of vector addition is essential for analyzing forces, velocities, displacements, and other vector quantities in physics.",

      "question": "Add the following vectors using the tip-to-tail method (describe the process): $\\vec{A} = 5\\text{ m}$ east, $\\vec{B} = 3\\text{ m}$ east.",
      "answer": "Draw $\\vec{A}$ 5 units east. From its tip, draw $\\vec{B}$ 3 units east. Resultant is 8 units east. (Magnitude 8 m, direction east.)"

    {
      "question": "Two forces act on an object: 30 N north and 40 N east. Find the resultant force magnitude and direction.",
      "answer": "$R = \\sqrt{30^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{900+1600} = \\sqrt{2500} = 50\\text{ N}$. Direction: $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(30/40) \\approx 36.9^\\circ$ north of east."

    {
      "question": "What is $\\vec{A} - \\vec{B}$ if $\\vec{A} = 12\\text{ m}$ south and $\\vec{B} = 5\\text{ m}$ east?",
      "answer": "$-\\vec{B} = 5\\text{ m}$ west. Then $\\vec{A} + (-\\vec{B})$: south and west are perpendicular. $R = \\sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{144+25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\\text{ m}$. Direction: $\\tan\\theta = 5/12 \\approx 0.4167$, $\\theta \\approx 22.6^\\circ$ west of south (or south of west?). Better: angle from south toward west."

    {
      "question": "Explain why the parallelogram method and tip-to-tail method give the same resultant.",
      "answer": "Both methods represent the same vector addition. In tip-to-tail, vectors are placed sequentially; in parallelogram, they are placed tail-to-tail and the diagonal completes the triangle. The diagonal of a parallelogram is equivalent to the vector from the tail of the first to the tip of the second when placed tip-to-tail."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the magnitude of the resultant ever be less than the magnitude of either original vector? Give an example.",
      "answer": "Yes, if the vectors point in opposite directions. For example, $\\vec{A} = 10\\text{ m}$ east, $\\vec{B} = 6\\text{ m}$ west. Resultant = $4\\text{ m}$ east, which is less than $|\\vec{A}|$."
    },
    {
      "question": "Demonstrate the commutative property of vectors using a sketch.",
      "answer": "Draw $\\vec{A}$ then $\\vec{B}$ tip-to-tail; measure resultant. Then draw $\\vec{B}$ then $\\vec{A}$ tip-to-tail; the resultant should be the same vector (same length and direction)."
