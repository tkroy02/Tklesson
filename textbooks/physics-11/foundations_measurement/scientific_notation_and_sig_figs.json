  "expanded_description": "Scientific notation provides a compact way to express very large and very small numbers using powers of ten. Significant figures indicate the precision of a measurement, showing which digits are reliable. Together, these tools ensure that calculations properly reflect the accuracy of the original measurements and prevent false precision in results.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Measurements in physics have limits on their precision. Scientific notation handles the scale of numbers efficiently, while significant figures track which digits are meaningful. Both are essential for honest, accurate scientific communication.",
    "explanation": "Imagine measuring a table's length with a ruler marked in centimeters. You might estimate it as 1.25 m, but you can't honestly report it as 1.250000 m—your ruler isn't that precise. Significant figures tell readers how precise your measurement actually is. Similarly, physics deals with enormous ranges—the distance to a star (billions of meters) and the size of an atom (trillionths of meters). Scientific notation handles these extremes without writing endless zeros.",

  "summary": "Scientific notation expresses numbers as a coefficient (1 ≤ N < 10) times a power of ten: N × 10ⁿ. Large numbers have positive exponents; small numbers have negative exponents. Multiplication adds exponents; division subtracts exponents; addition/subtraction requires matching exponents first. Significant figures indicate measurement precision. Rules: all non-zero digits are significant; zeros between non-zero digits are significant; leading zeros are never significant; trailing zeros after a decimal are significant; trailing zeros without a decimal are ambiguous. In calculations: multiplication/division results have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement; addition/subtraction results have the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement. Round final answers appropriately, carrying extra digits through intermediate steps. Common mistakes include miscounting leading zeros, forgetting trailing zeros count, rounding prematurely, and applying the wrong rule to operations. Mastering these concepts ensures honest, accurate scientific communication.",
