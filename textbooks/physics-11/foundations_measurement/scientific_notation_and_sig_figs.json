  "summary": "Scientific notation and significant figures are fundamental tools for handling measurements in physics. Scientific notation expresses numbers as a coefficient between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of ten, making very large and very small numbers manageable. Multiplication and division in scientific notation involve operating on coefficients and exponents separately, while addition and subtraction require equal exponents first. Significant figures indicate the precision of measurements, with specific rules for identifying them: non-zero digits always count; zeros between non-zero digits count; leading zeros never count; trailing zeros count only with a decimal point. In calculations, multiplication and division results must have as many significant figures as the least precise measurement, while addition and subtraction results must have as many decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places. Understanding precision (consistency of measurements) versus accuracy (closeness to true value) and properly expressing uncertainty ensures that scientific results communicate reliable information about the physical world."
