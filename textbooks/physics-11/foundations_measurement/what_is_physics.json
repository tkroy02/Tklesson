    "introduction": {
      "text": "Physics is the most fundamental of the natural sciences. It is the systematic study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them. At its core, physics seeks to understand the fundamental laws that govern everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies in the universe.",
      "etymology": "The word 'physics' comes from the ancient Greek word physis (φύσις), meaning 'nature.' True to its origin, physics is essentially the science of nature—asking and answering questions about how the physical world works."
    },
    "core_concept": {
      "definition": "Physics is the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. It includes the study of mechanics, heat, light, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms.",
      "explanation": "Physics is unique among the sciences because it describes the fundamental rules that all other sciences follow. Chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy all rely on physical principles. When a chemist studies chemical reactions, they are observing electrons rearranging—a process governed by physics. When a biologist studies how birds fly, they are observing aerodynamic principles discovered through physics."

It seeks to discover universal laws that explain phenomena from the subatomic to the cosmic scale. Physics is divided into classical mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, acoustics, and modern physics—each focusing on different aspects of physical reality. Physics is not abstract; it explains everyday experiences from walking to using smartphones. It also serves as the foundation for all other sciences, providing principles that chemistry, biology, astronomy, and geology all depend on. Physics advances through the scientific method, ensuring that knowledge is based on testable evidence rather than speculation. Understanding physics helps us comprehend the world around us and enables technologies that shape modern life.",
