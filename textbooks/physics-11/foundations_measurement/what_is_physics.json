  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Physics is the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. It provides the foundational principles that all other sciences build upon.",
    "explanation": "Physics is unique because it describes the fundamental rules that chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy all follow. When a chemist studies reactions, they observe electrons rearranging—a process governed by physics. When a biologist studies bird flight, they observe aerodynamic principles discovered through physics. Understanding physics helps you comprehend not just the subject itself, but the entire physical world.",

  "summary": "Physics is the fundamental science that studies matter, energy, and their interactions. It seeks to discover universal laws that explain phenomena from the subatomic to the cosmic scale. Physics is organized into branches including classical mechanics (motion and forces), thermodynamics (heat and temperature), electromagnetism (electricity and magnetism), optics (light), acoustics (sound), and modern physics (relativity and quantum mechanics). Physics is not abstract—it explains everyday experiences from walking to using smartphones. It also serves as the foundation for all other sciences, providing principles that chemistry, biology, astronomy, and geology depend on. Physics advances through the scientific method: observation, question, hypothesis, prediction, experiment, analysis, and conclusion. Well-tested explanations become theories or laws, which must be reproducible and falsifiable. Understanding physics helps us comprehend the world around us and enables the technologies that shape modern life.",
  "practice_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which branch of physics would you use to study why a ball follows a curved path when thrown?",
      "answer": "Classical mechanics, specifically the study of projectile motion under gravity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does physics explain the operation of a microwave oven?",
      "answer": "Microwaves use electromagnetic radiation (electromagnetism) to transfer energy to water molecules in food, causing them to vibrate and heat up (thermodynamics)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is physics considered the 'foundation' of other sciences?",
      "answer": "Because all natural phenomena ultimately obey physical laws. Chemical reactions, biological processes, geological events, and astronomical observations all involve matter and energy interactions that physics describes."
    },
    {
      "question": "A student proposes that objects fall because they are 'seeking their natural place.' Is this a scientific hypothesis? Why or why not?",
      "answer": "No, this is not a scientific hypothesis because it cannot be tested experimentally. Scientific hypotheses must make testable predictions that can be verified or falsified through observation. There is no experiment that could prove or disprove that objects 'seek their natural place.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a scientific theory and a scientific law?",
      "answer": "A scientific law describes what happens in nature, often as a mathematical relationship (like F = ma). A scientific theory explains why it happens (like Einstein's theory of relativity explaining gravity). Both are supported by extensive evidence."
