  "expanded_description": "Measurement is the process of quantifying physical properties by comparing them to standard reference values called units. The International System of Units (SI) provides a universal framework of seven base units from which all other measurement units are derived. Understanding this system is essential for precise scientific communication and calculation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "All physical measurements consist of a numerical value and a unit. The SI system ensures consistency by defining seven base units that measure fundamental quantities; all other units are derived from these seven.",
    "explanation": "Imagine trying to build something with a friend who uses inches while you use centimeters—without standardized units, collaboration is impossible. The SI system solves this by providing a global measurement language. Whether you're in Canada, Japan, or Brazil, 1 meter means exactly the same length. This universality allows scientists worldwide to share and verify results, and it ensures that engineering specifications work across borders.",

        "context": "Every measurement has two parts: a number and a unit. '5' alone means nothing—5 what? 5 meters, 5 seconds, 5 kilograms? The unit gives the number meaning and allows others to understand exactly what was measured."

  "summary": "Measurement is the process of quantifying physical properties using standardized units. The SI system provides seven base units—meter (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount), and candela (luminous intensity)—defined by fundamental physical constants. SI prefixes (kilo-, milli-, micro-, etc.) allow convenient expression of very large or small quantities. Derived units are formed by combining base units according to physical definitions: area (m²), volume (m³), speed (m/s), acceleration (m/s²), and density (kg/m³). Many derived units have special names honoring scientists: Newton (force = kg·m/s²), Joule (energy = kg·m²/s²), Watt (power = kg·m²/s³), Pascal (pressure = kg/(m·s²)), and Hertz (frequency = s⁻¹). Derived units can be constructed from defining equations: identify the formula, substitute units, simplify, and check for special names. Dimensional analysis uses unit consistency to verify equations—both sides must have identical units. Common mistakes include forgetting to square/cube prefixes in area/volume conversions, confusing mass (kg) with weight (N), and failing to convert to base units before calculations. Mastering SI units is essential for clear communication and accurate calculation in physics.",
