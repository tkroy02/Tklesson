  "summary": "Measurement is the foundation of physics, allowing us to quantify and analyze the physical world. The International System of Units (SI) provides a universal standard with seven base units: meter (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (electric current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount of substance), and candela (luminous intensity). These base units are defined by fundamental physical constants, ensuring they are universal and unchanging. Derived units, such as newtons, joules, and watts, are created by combining base units according to physical relationships. SI prefixes like kilo-, milli-, and nano- allow convenient expression of very large or very small quantities. Understanding SI units and their proper use is essential for all scientific work, from classroom experiments to cutting-edge research."
