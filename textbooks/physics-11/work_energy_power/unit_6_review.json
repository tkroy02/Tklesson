  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review of all topics covered in Unit 6: Work, Energy, and Power. It synthesizes the key concepts of work, kinetic energy, the work‑energy theorem, gravitational and elastic potential energy, conservation of mechanical energy, power, and efficiency. Mastering these interconnected ideas is essential for understanding energy transformations and the fundamental principle that energy is conserved in all processes, even when mechanical energy alone is not conserved.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Work, energy, and power are interconnected concepts that describe how forces affect motion and how energy is transferred and transformed. Work is the transfer of energy by a force acting over a distance ($W = Fd\\cos\\theta$). Kinetic energy ($KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) is the energy of motion. The work‑energy theorem ($W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta KE$) links work to changes in kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored energy due to position or configuration: gravitational ($PE_g = mgh$) and elastic ($PE_{el} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$). When only conservative forces act, mechanical energy ($KE + PE$) is conserved. Power ($P = W/t = Fv$) is the rate of energy transfer, and efficiency ($e = E_{\\text{useful}}/E_{\\text{input}}$) measures how effectively energy is converted to useful forms.",
    "explanation": "Unit 6 builds a complete framework for understanding energy, one of the most fundamental concepts in physics. We learned to calculate work done by constant forces, including positive, negative, and zero work cases. Kinetic energy quantifies motion, and the work‑energy theorem provides a powerful alternative to Newton's laws. Potential energy introduces the idea of stored energy, with gravitational and elastic forms. Conservation of mechanical energy simplifies problems where only conservative forces act, allowing us to relate speeds and positions without knowing forces or time. Power tells us how quickly energy transfers, and efficiency helps us evaluate real‑world devices. Together, these concepts apply to everything from roller coasters to rocket launches to household appliances.",

  "summary": "Unit 6: Work, Energy, and Power established the fundamental concepts of energy and its transfer. Work is energy transfer by a force: $W = Fd\\cos\\theta$, with positive, negative, or zero work depending on the angle. Kinetic energy $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is the energy of motion. The work‑energy theorem $W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta KE$ links work to changes in kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored energy: gravitational $PE_g = mgh$ (near Earth) and elastic $PE_{el} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ (for springs). When only conservative forces (gravity, springs) act, mechanical energy is conserved: $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$. If non‑conservative forces (friction) do work, $W_{nc} = \\Delta KE + \\Delta PE$. Power is the rate of energy transfer: $P = W/t = Fv$ (for constant force in direction of motion), measured in watts (W). Efficiency measures useful output relative to input: $e = E_{\\text{useful}} / E_{\\text{input}} = P_{\\text{useful}} / P_{\\text{input}}$, always ≤ 1 (≤ 100%). Common mistakes include forgetting the $\\frac{1}{2}$ in KE and PE formulas, using wrong angle in work, confusing power with energy, applying conservation when friction acts, and miscalculating efficiency. Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding thermodynamics, circuits, and advanced mechanics."
