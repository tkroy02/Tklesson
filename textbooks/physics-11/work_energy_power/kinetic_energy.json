  "expanded_description": "This section introduces kinetic energy, the energy an object possesses due to its motion. Kinetic energy depends on the object's mass and the square of its speed. It is a scalar quantity, always positive or zero, and is measured in joules (J). Understanding kinetic energy is essential for applying the work‑energy theorem and analyzing energy transformations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. For an object of mass $m$ moving with speed $v$, its translational kinetic energy is $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. It is a scalar and is always non‑negative.",
    "explanation": "The formula $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ shows that kinetic energy increases with mass, but more dramatically with speed (doubling speed quadruples KE). Because it depends on $v^2$, kinetic energy is independent of direction; an object moving at 10 m/s north has the same KE as one moving at 10 m/s south. Kinetic energy is a measure of the work needed to accelerate an object from rest to its current speed, or the work it can do while coming to rest.",
