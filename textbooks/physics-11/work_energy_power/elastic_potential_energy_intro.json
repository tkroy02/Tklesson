  "expanded_description": "This section introduces elastic potential energy, the energy stored in deformed elastic objects such as springs, rubber bands, and other flexible materials. When a spring is stretched or compressed, work is done against the spring force, and that work is stored as elastic potential energy. For an ideal spring obeying Hooke's law ($F_s = -kx$), the elastic potential energy is $PE_{el} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium.",

    "principle": "Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in a deformed elastic object. For an ideal spring that obeys Hooke's law, the elastic potential energy is $PE_{el} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant (stiffness) and $x$ is the displacement from the spring's equilibrium (unstretched) position.",
    "explanation": "The spring force is conservative and varies with displacement. The work done to stretch or compress a spring from its equilibrium position is stored as potential energy. When the spring returns to its equilibrium, this stored energy can be converted to kinetic energy. The $\\frac{1}{2}$ factor arises because the force increases linearly from 0 at equilibrium to $kx$ at full displacement, so the average force is $\\frac{1}{2}kx$, and work = average force × displacement.",

        "context": "The spring constant $k$ tells us how stiff the spring is: a larger $k$ means a stiffer spring that requires more force to stretch or compress a given distance.

For an ideal spring obeying Hooke's law ($F_s = -kx$), the elastic potential energy is $PE_{el} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant (N/m) and $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium. The energy is always positive and is the same for equal stretch or compression. Hooke's law describes the restoring force, which is proportional to displacement and opposite in direction. The spring force is conservative, allowing mechanical energy conservation when only conservative forces act. Work done on a spring equals the change in its elastic potential energy. Common mistakes include forgetting the $\\frac{1}{2}$ factor, sign errors (thinking energy can be negative), confusing force with energy, and using total length instead of displacement from equilibrium. Elastic potential energy is fundamental for understanding oscillatory motion and energy transformations in systems involving springs."
