  "expanded_description": "This section introduces modern physics, the branch of physics that emerged around 1900 to explain phenomena that classical physics could not. Modern physics encompasses two revolutionary theories: quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales, and relativity, which describes the behavior of objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light or in strong gravitational fields. These theories have fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, matter, and energy.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Modern physics is the physics of the 20th and 21st centuries, developed to explain phenomena that classical physics (Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's electromagnetism) could not account for. It rests on two pillars: quantum mechanics and relativity. Quantum mechanics deals with the discrete nature of energy and matter at microscopic scales, while relativity deals with the behavior of objects at high speeds and in strong gravitational fields.",
    "explanation": "Classical physics successfully described the macroscopic world but failed to explain experiments such as the photoelectric effect, blackbody radiation, and the constancy of the speed of light. Modern physics resolves these puzzles by introducing concepts like wave-particle duality, quantization of energy, spacetime, and mass-energy equivalence. It has led to technologies such as lasers, transistors, nuclear power, GPS, and medical imaging.",

However, a series of experimental results soon revealed that the classical theories of Newton and Maxwell were inadequate to explain phenomena at the atomic level or at very high speeds. This led to the development of modern physics.",
