  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the photoelectric effect, a phenomenon that played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics. Discovered by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and explained by Albert Einstein in 1905 (for which he received the Nobel Prize), the photoelectric effect occurs when light incident on a metal surface ejects electrons. Classical wave theory could not explain the experimental observations, but Einstein's photon model succeeded by treating light as particles (photons) with energy proportional to frequency. This work provided strong evidence for the particle nature of light and the concept of energy quantization.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a metal surface when light of sufficient frequency shines on it. The key experimental observations are: (1) No electrons are emitted if the light frequency is below a threshold frequency $f_0$, regardless of intensity. (2) The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons increases linearly with frequency above the threshold. (3) Electrons are emitted immediately, with no time lag, even at very low light intensities. Einstein explained these by proposing that light consists of photons, each with energy $E = hf$, and that an electron absorbs one photon's energy. Part of this energy ($\\phi$, the work function) is used to overcome the binding to the metal, and the remainder becomes the electron's kinetic energy: $K_{\\text{max}} = hf - \\phi$.",
    "explanation": "The photoelectric effect demonstrates the particle nature of light and the quantization of energy. It directly contradicts the classical wave theory, which predicted that increasing light intensity would increase electron energy and that there would be a time delay at low intensities. Einstein's explanation introduced the concept of photons and provided a direct measurement of Planck's constant $h$. This work was foundational to quantum mechanics and has practical applications in devices such as photomultiplier tubes, solar cells, and light sensors.",

Key experimental facts: (1) a threshold frequency exists below which no electrons are emitted, regardless of intensity; (2) the maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons increases linearly with frequency above threshold; (3) emission is instantaneous. Classical wave theory could not explain these observations. Einstein explained the effect by proposing that light consists of photons, each with energy $E = hf$. An electron absorbs one photon; part of this energy ($\\phi$, the work function) is used to escape the metal, and the remainder becomes kinetic energy: $K_{\\text{max}} = hf - \\phi$. The stopping potential $V_s$ is related by $eV_s = K_{\\text{max}}$. The photoelectric effect provided crucial evidence for the particle nature of light and the quantization of energy, and it allows experimental determination of Planck's constant. Common mistakes include confusing intensity with frequency, misunderstanding the threshold, and forgetting to account for the work function."
