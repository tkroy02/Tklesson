  "expanded_description": "This section introduces nuclear physics, the branch of physics that studies the atomic nucleus and its constituents. We focus on radioactivity, the spontaneous emission of particles or radiation from unstable nuclei, and the concept of half-life, which quantifies the rate at which radioactive substances decay. Understanding these phenomena is essential for applications ranging from medical imaging and cancer treatment to nuclear power and radiometric dating.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Radioactivity is the process by which unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation. There are three main types of radioactive decay: alpha ($\\alpha$) decay (emission of a helium-4 nucleus), beta ($\\beta$) decay (emission of an electron or positron), and gamma ($\\gamma$) decay (emission of high-energy photons). The rate of decay is characterized by the half-life $t_{1/2}$, the time required for half of the nuclei in a sample to decay. The number of remaining nuclei follows an exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 (1/2)^{t/t_{1/2}} = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$, where $\\lambda = \\ln 2 / t_{1/2}$ is the decay constant.",
    "explanation": "Radioactivity arises from the instability of certain isotopes (radioisotopes). The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together, but if a nucleus has too many or too few neutrons, or is too large, it becomes unstable and decays toward a more stable configuration. Alpha decay occurs primarily in heavy nuclei; beta decay involves the weak interaction and changes a neutron to a proton (or vice versa); gamma decay follows other decays when the nucleus is left in an excited state. Half-life is a statistical property: we cannot predict when a single nucleus will decay, but for a large sample, the decay rate is predictable. Applications include carbon-14 dating, medical tracers, smoke detectors, and nuclear reactors.",

Understanding radioactivity is crucial for nuclear energy, medical diagnostics and therapy, and understanding the age of archaeological and geological samples."

The three main types of radioactive decay are alpha (emission of $^4_2\\text{He}$ nucleus), beta (emission of electron/positron and neutrino/antineutrino), and gamma (emission of high‑energy photons). The decay follows an exponential law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t} = N_0 (1/2)^{t/t_{1/2}}$, where $\\lambda$ is the decay constant and $t_{1/2}$ is the half‑life ($\\lambda = \\ln 2 / t_{1/2}$). Activity $A = \\lambda N$ is the decay rate, measured in becquerels (Bq). Half‑life is the time for half the nuclei to decay; it is constant for a given isotope. Applications include radiometric dating (carbon‑14, uranium‑lead), medical imaging and therapy, and nuclear power. Common mistakes include confusing half‑life with full decay, mixing up decay types, forgetting the $\\ln 2$ factor, and applying linear reasoning to exponential decay."
