  "expanded_description": "This section introduces one of the most profound and counterintuitive concepts in modern physics: wave-particle duality. This principle states that every quantum entity, such as light or electrons, exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how it is observed. The idea that a single entity can behave as both a wave and a particle challenged the classical separation of waves and particles and led to the development of quantum mechanics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Wave-particle duality is the concept that every quantum object (such as photons, electrons, atoms) exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties. Which aspect is observed depends on the experimental setup. Light, for example, shows interference patterns (wave behavior) in double-slit experiments, but also behaves as a stream of particles (photons) in the photoelectric effect.",
    "explanation": "Classical physics treated waves and particles as distinct entities: particles are localized and carry momentum and energy; waves are delocalized and exhibit interference and diffraction. Experiments in the early 20th century, however, showed that light (traditionally considered a wave) could behave as a particle, and electrons (traditionally considered particles) could behave as waves. This duality is not a paradox but a fundamental feature of nature at the quantum level. The wave-particle duality is mathematically captured by the de Broglie relation $\\lambda = h/p$, which connects a particle's momentum to its wavelength.",

      "introduction": "Is light a wave or a stream of particles? Are electrons tiny spheres or waves? These questions puzzled physicists for centuries. The answer, revealed by quantum mechanics, is that they are both – and neither, in the classical sense.",

        "definition": "Wave-particle duality is the principle that all quantum objects have both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. The wave aspect is described by a wave function, while the particle aspect manifests in quantized interactions. The two aspects are complementary: observing one property necessarily obscures the other.",

          "application": "Wave optics explains phenomena like rainbows, thin-film interference, and the resolving power of microscopes and telescopes.",

          "statement": "Light also behaves as a stream of particles called photons. Each photon carries energy $E = hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency. This explains the photoelectric effect (covered in 10.3) and Compton scattering.",
          "application": "Photon behavior is essential for understanding solar cells, CCD sensors in cameras, and the operation of lasers.",
          "example": "In the photoelectric effect, light striking a metal surface ejects electrons only if its frequency exceeds a threshold, regardless of intensity – a behavior that cannot be explained by wave theory but is natural if light consists of photons."

          "statement": "In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that if light (considered a wave) can behave as a particle, then particles (such as electrons) should also exhibit wave-like behavior. He postulated that a particle of momentum $p$ has an associated wavelength $\\lambda = h/p$, now called the de Broglie wavelength.",
          "application": "This hypothesis was confirmed by electron diffraction experiments, where electrons fired at a crystal produced interference patterns characteristic of waves. Electron microscopes exploit this wave nature to achieve much higher resolution than optical microscopes.",
          "example": "An electron accelerated through 100 V has a de Broglie wavelength of about 0.12 nm, comparable to atomic spacings, allowing electron microscopes to resolve individual atoms."
