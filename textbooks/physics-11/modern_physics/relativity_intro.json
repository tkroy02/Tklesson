  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Einstein's theory of special relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and energy. Special relativity is based on two fundamental postulates: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, and the speed of light in vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion. These seemingly simple postulates lead to profound consequences, including time dilation (moving clocks run slow), length contraction (moving objects shorten), and mass-energy equivalence ($E = mc^2$).",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905. It is based on two postulates: (1) The laws of physics are invariant (identical) in all inertial frames of reference (non-accelerating frames). (2) The speed of light in vacuum, $c$, is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.",
    "explanation": "These postulates replace the classical Newtonian notions of absolute space and time. They imply that measurements of time and distance are not absolute but depend on the relative motion between the observer and what is being observed. As speeds approach $c$, effects like time dilation and length contraction become significant. The theory also leads to the equivalence of mass and energy, encapsulated in the famous equation $E = mc^2$. Special relativity applies to objects moving at constant velocity; general relativity extends these ideas to accelerated motion and gravity.",
