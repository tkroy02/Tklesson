  "expanded_description": "This section traces the evolution of atomic models, from ancient Greek speculation to the modern quantum mechanical view. Understanding how our conception of the atom has changed over time reveals the process of scientific discovery and the interplay between theory and experiment. Each new model addressed shortcomings of its predecessor, leading to our current understanding of the atom as a nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons whose behavior is governed by quantum mechanics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Atomic models have evolved over centuries, from Dalton's indivisible spheres to Thomson's 'plum pudding', Rutherford's nuclear model, Bohr's quantized orbits, and finally the modern quantum mechanical model based on probability clouds. Each model incorporated new experimental evidence and refined our understanding of atomic structure.",
    "explanation": "The development of atomic theory demonstrates how scientific understanding progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, experiment, and refinement. Early Greek philosophers proposed the idea of atoms as fundamental particles. Dalton's model (1808) was based on chemical laws. Thomson's discovery of the electron (1897) led to the 'plum pudding' model. Rutherford's gold foil experiment (1911) revealed the tiny, massive nucleus. Bohr's model (1913) introduced quantized energy levels to explain atomic spectra. Modern quantum mechanics (1920s–present) describes electrons in terms of probability distributions rather than definite orbits.",
