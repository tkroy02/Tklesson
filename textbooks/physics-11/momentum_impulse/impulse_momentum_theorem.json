  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the impulse‑momentum theorem, a fundamental principle that directly links the impulse applied to an object to its resulting change in momentum. Derived from Newton's second law, the theorem states that the impulse imparted to an object equals its change in momentum. This powerful relationship allows us to analyze situations involving forces that act over short time intervals, such as collisions and impacts, without needing to know the detailed time variation of the force.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The impulse‑momentum theorem states that the impulse $\\vec{J}$ delivered to an object by the net force acting on it equals the object's change in momentum: $\\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p} = \\vec{p}_f - \\vec{p}_i$. For constant net force, this becomes $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} \\Delta t = m\\vec{v}_f - m\\vec{v}_i$. The theorem is a direct consequence of Newton's second law written in momentum form.",
    "explanation": "The impulse‑momentum theorem provides a powerful alternative to kinematic equations when dealing with forces that vary with time. Instead of needing to know the acceleration at every instant, we only need the total impulse (or average force and time) to determine the change in velocity. This is particularly useful in collision problems where forces are large and act over very short times, making detailed acceleration measurements impractical. The theorem also explains why extending the time of an impact (e.g., with airbags or bending knees) reduces the average force experienced.",

For constant net force, this is $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} \\Delta t = m\\vec{v}_f - m\\vec{v}_i$; for varying forces, impulse is the time integral of force. The theorem is derived directly from Newton's second law and is especially useful for analyzing collisions, impacts, and situations where forces act over short times. It allows calculation of average force from momentum change and contact time, and explains why increasing contact time (e.g., with airbags or bending knees) reduces average force. The theorem must be applied vectorially: in 1D, careful attention to signs is crucial, especially in rebound problems; in 2D, components are used. Common mistakes include sign errors in momentum change, confusing impulse with work, using individual forces instead of net force, and mishandling vector addition in 2D. Mastering the impulse‑momentum theorem is essential for understanding collisions and for solving problems involving time‑varying forces."
