  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the physics of collisions, where two or more objects interact over a very short time through forces that are large compared to any external forces. Collisions are categorized based on whether kinetic energy is conserved during the interaction. Understanding the types of collisions – elastic, inelastic, and perfectly inelastic – is essential for applying conservation laws correctly. Regardless of the type, momentum is always conserved in an isolated collision.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In any collision involving an isolated system (no net external force), the total momentum of the system is conserved. However, kinetic energy may or may not be conserved depending on the nature of the collision. Collisions are classified as: elastic (kinetic energy conserved), inelastic (kinetic energy not conserved), and perfectly inelastic (objects stick together, maximum loss of kinetic energy).",
    "explanation": "The classification of collisions helps us determine which physical laws apply. In all collisions, momentum conservation provides a powerful equation. Elastic collisions, where objects bounce off without deformation or heat generation, conserve both momentum and kinetic energy. Inelastic collisions conserve momentum but not kinetic energy; some energy is converted to heat, sound, or deformation. Perfectly inelastic collisions are a special case where the objects stick together, resulting in the maximum possible loss of kinetic energy consistent with momentum conservation.",

      "introduction": "A collision occurs when two or more objects exert forces on each other over a short time interval. In physics, this includes not only obvious impacts like cars crashing or balls hitting each other, but also interactions like a bat hitting a ball or a proton striking a nucleus. The key is that the forces are internal to the system of colliding objects, so total momentum is conserved if no external forces act.",
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "A collision is an interaction between two or more objects that occurs over a short time, during which the objects exert relatively large forces on each other. In an isolated system (no net external force), the total momentum of the system is conserved during any collision. Collisions are classified by what happens to the kinetic energy of the system.",
        "context": "Understanding collisions is crucial in fields from car safety design to particle physics. The conservation laws (momentum always, kinetic energy sometimes) provide powerful tools to analyze these interactions without knowing the detailed forces."

          "application": "This gives one vector equation (or two component equations in 2D) that always applies, regardless of the type of collision.",
          "example": "Two ice skaters pushing off each other: total momentum before and after is zero."

          "principle": "Kinetic Energy May or May Not Be Conserved",
          "statement": "Unlike momentum, kinetic energy is not always conserved in collisions. When objects deform, generate heat, or make sound, some kinetic energy is transformed into other forms. The degree to which kinetic energy is conserved determines the type of collision.",
          "application": "If a problem states or implies that the collision is 'elastic,' both momentum and kinetic energy equations can be used. If 'inelastic' or 'perfectly inelastic,' only momentum conservation applies (along with any given information about the final state).",
          "example": "A ball of clay dropped on the floor squashes and stops – kinetic energy is not conserved (it becomes heat and sound)."
        },
        {
          "principle": "External Forces Can Sometimes Be Neglected",
          "statement": "During the brief time of a collision, even if external forces like friction or gravity are present, their impulses are often negligible compared to the large internal collision forces. In such cases, we can approximate the system as isolated and apply momentum conservation.",
          "application": "This is a common approximation in collision problems, allowing us to use conservation of momentum even when the system is not perfectly isolated.",
          "example": "Two cars colliding on a road: friction with the road is small during the fraction of a second of impact, so momentum is approximately conserved."
