  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on elastic collisions, a special type of collision where both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. In an elastic collision, objects bounce off each other without any loss of kinetic energy to heat, sound, or permanent deformation. While perfectly elastic collisions are idealized, they provide a good approximation for many real‑world situations involving hard objects like billiard balls, steel bearings, or atomic particles. The dual conservation laws allow us to solve for the final velocities of colliding objects, leading to specific formulas for 1D elastic collisions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. For a 1D elastic collision between two objects of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ with initial velocities $v_{1i}$ and $v_{2i}$, the final velocities are given by:\n$v_{1f} = \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_{1i} + \\frac{2m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_{2i}$\n$v_{2f} = \\frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_{1i} + \\frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_{2i}$.\nFor the special case of one object initially at rest ($v_{2i}=0$), these simplify to:\n$v_{1f} = \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_{1i}$ and $v_{2f} = \\frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_{1i}$.",
    "explanation": "Elastic collisions are characterized by the conservation of kinetic energy, which imposes an additional constraint beyond momentum conservation. This extra constraint uniquely determines the outcome of the collision. The formulas reveal interesting behaviors: if the masses are equal, the objects exchange velocities. If one object is much more massive than the other, the lighter object bounces off with nearly the same speed (like a ball hitting a wall), and the heavy object continues with little change. Understanding elastic collisions is essential in physics, from explaining how a Newton's cradle works to analyzing particle scattering in nuclear physics.",

      "introduction": "An elastic collision is one in which the total kinetic energy of the system is the same before and after the collision. This means that no kinetic energy is converted into other forms like heat or sound. While no collision is perfectly elastic in the macroscopic world, many collisions closely approximate this ideal.",
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "An elastic collision is a collision in which both the total momentum and the total kinetic energy of the system are conserved. For a system of two colliding objects, this gives two equations:\n(1) $m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f}$\n(2) $\\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2 v_{2i}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2 v_{2f}^2$",
        "context": "The simultaneous solution of these two equations yields unique final velocities. In one dimension, these solutions can be expressed in closed form as given above. Elastic collisions are important in many areas of physics, from the macroscopic (billiards, sports) to the microscopic (atomic and nuclear scattering)."

          "application": "This relationship can sometimes simplify calculations, especially when the detailed formulas are not needed. It is a direct consequence of combining momentum and energy conservation.",
          "example": "If a ball approaches a stationary target at 10 m/s, after an elastic collision they separate with a relative speed of 10 m/s (e.g., the ball might bounce back at 2 m/s and the target move forward at 8 m/s, giving a separation speed of 10 m/s)."

          "application": "This is a well‑known result seen in Newton's cradle: when one ball swings and hits the others, the last ball swings out with the same speed.",
          "example": "A 2 kg ball moving at 3 m/s collides elastically with a 2 kg ball at rest. After collision, the first ball stops and the second moves at 3 m/s."

An alternative approach uses the fact that the relative speed of separation equals the relative speed of approach. Elastic collisions are idealizations that approximate many real‑world interactions, from billiard balls to subatomic particles. Common mistakes include applying elastic equations to inelastic collisions, sign errors in the relative speed relation, misusing the equal‑mass result, and applying 1D formulas to 2D situations. Understanding elastic collisions is essential for analyzing a wide range of physical phenomena."
