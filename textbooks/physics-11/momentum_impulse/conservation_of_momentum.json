  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the principle of conservation of momentum, one of the most fundamental and powerful laws in physics. It states that the total momentum of an isolated system (a system with no net external force) remains constant over time. This law is a direct consequence of Newton's third law and holds true regardless of the complexity of internal forces, making it invaluable for analyzing collisions, explosions, and any interactions between objects.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Conservation of momentum: For an isolated system (where the net external force is zero), the total momentum of the system remains constant. That is, $\\vec{p}_{\\text{total, initial}} = \\vec{p}_{\\text{total, final}}$, or $\\sum \\vec{p}_i = \\sum \\vec{p}_f$. This vector equation holds for each component independently.",
    "explanation": "Momentum conservation arises because internal forces between objects within the system come in action‑reaction pairs that are equal and opposite, so their impulses cancel, leaving the total momentum unchanged. This principle applies whether the objects bounce off each other, stick together, or even explode apart. It is a powerful tool for predicting outcomes of interactions without needing to know the detailed forces involved.",

        "context": "This law is a direct consequence of Newton's third law. When two objects interact, the forces they exert on each other are equal and opposite, so the impulses they impart cancel in the system as a whole. Thus, internal forces cannot change the total momentum of a system. Only external forces can do so."

          "application": "In collision problems, we often consider the colliding objects as the system and ignore external forces like friction because they are small compared to the large collision forces. This allows us to apply momentum conservation.",

Over the same time interval, the impulses are equal and opposite: $\\vec{J}_{AB} = -\\vec{J}_{BA}$. Therefore, the changes in momentum satisfy $\\Delta \\vec{p}_A = -\\Delta \\vec{p}_B$, so the total change $\\Delta \\vec{p}_A + \\Delta \\vec{p}_B = 0$, i.e., total momentum is constant.",

  "summary": "The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of an isolated system (no net external force) remains constant. This principle is a direct consequence of Newton's third law: internal forces occur in equal and opposite pairs, so they cannot change the total momentum. The law is vectorial, so it applies to each component separately. It is used to analyze collisions, explosions, recoil, and any interaction where external forces are negligible or zero. For conservation to hold, the system must be chosen appropriately; external forces must be zero or their impulses negligible. Common mistakes include treating momentum as a scalar, applying conservation when external forces act, incorrect system choice, and unit errors. Conservation of momentum is one of the most powerful tools in physics, enabling predictions about motion without detailed knowledge of the forces involved."
