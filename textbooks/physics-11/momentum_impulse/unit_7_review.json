  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review of all topics covered in Unit 7: Momentum and Impulse. It synthesizes the key concepts of momentum, impulse, the impulse‑momentum theorem, conservation of momentum, and the various types of collisions (elastic, inelastic, perfectly inelastic) and explosions. Mastering these interconnected ideas is essential for understanding how forces affect motion over time and how interactions between objects conserve one of the most fundamental quantities in physics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Momentum ($\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$) is a vector quantity that describes the 'quantity of motion' of an object. Impulse ($\\vec{J} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{avg}} \\Delta t$) is the effect of a force acting over time, and the impulse‑momentum theorem ($\\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p}$) links them. In the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system is conserved. This principle applies to all collisions and explosions, regardless of whether kinetic energy is conserved. Collisions are classified as elastic (KE conserved), inelastic (KE not conserved), or perfectly inelastic (objects stick together, maximum KE loss). Explosions are the reverse of perfectly inelastic collisions, with internal energy converted to KE.",
    "explanation": "Unit 7 builds a complete framework for understanding interactions through momentum. We learned that momentum is a vector, so direction matters. Impulse quantifies how forces change momentum over time, explaining why airbags save lives (increasing time reduces force). Conservation of momentum is a powerful tool for analyzing collisions and explosions without needing to know the detailed forces. The classification of collisions helps us apply the right equations: always momentum, plus energy only for elastic, plus sticking condition for perfectly inelastic. These concepts apply from subatomic particles to galactic collisions.",

  "summary": "Unit 7: Momentum and Impulse established the fundamental concepts for analyzing interactions through momentum. Momentum $\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$ is a vector quantity; impulse $\\vec{J} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{avg}} \\Delta t$ is the effect of a force over time; and the impulse‑momentum theorem $\\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p}$ links them. In the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system is conserved, a principle that holds for all collisions and explosions. Collisions are classified as elastic (both momentum and kinetic energy conserved), inelastic (momentum conserved, KE not), and perfectly inelastic (objects stick together, maximum KE loss). Explosions are the reverse of perfectly inelastic collisions, with internal energy converted to kinetic energy while momentum is conserved. Key formulas include the elastic collision equations, coefficient of restitution $e = (v_{2f}-v_{1f})/(v_{1i}-v_{2i})$, and perfectly inelastic final velocity $v_f = (m_1v_{1i}+m_2v_{2i})/(m_1+m_2)$. Common mistakes include treating momentum as a scalar, confusing impulse with work, sign errors in rebound problems, applying conservation when external forces act, misclassifying collisions, and assuming energy conservation in explosions. Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding interactions in mechanics, from everyday collisions to particle physics."
