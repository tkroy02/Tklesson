  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on perfectly inelastic collisions, a special category of inelastic collisions where the colliding objects stick together after impact and move as one combined mass. This type of collision represents the maximum possible loss of kinetic energy consistent with momentum conservation. Common examples include two railroad cars coupling upon impact, a bullet embedding in a wooden block, or two lumps of clay that merge when they collide.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a perfectly inelastic collision, the objects stick together and move with a common final velocity after the collision. Momentum is conserved (in the absence of external forces), but kinetic energy is not conserved; the maximum possible amount of kinetic energy (consistent with momentum conservation) is lost, typically converted to heat, sound, and deformation energy. For a one‑dimensional perfectly inelastic collision between two objects, the common final velocity is given by $v_f = \\frac{m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2}$.",
    "explanation": "Perfectly inelastic collisions are a subset of inelastic collisions where the objects become attached. The condition that they stick together provides an additional relationship ($v_{1f} = v_{2f} = v_f$) that, together with momentum conservation, uniquely determines the final velocity. This represents the greatest possible energy loss because, for given initial momenta, the final kinetic energy is minimized when the objects move together. Understanding perfectly inelastic collisions is essential for analyzing coupling mechanisms, ballistic pendulums, and many safety‑related impacts.",

This is a special case of inelastic collisions where the coefficient of restitution $e = 0$. Momentum is conserved (for an isolated system), giving $v_f = (m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i})/(m_1 + m_2)$. Kinetic energy is not conserved; the loss is the maximum possible consistent with momentum conservation. Applications include ballistic pendulums (used to measure projectile speeds), coupling railroad cars, and many impact scenarios. In two dimensions, the same principle applies component‑wise: total momentum components give the final velocity components of the combined mass. Common mistakes include applying the sticking condition when it's not stated, assuming energy conservation, vector addition errors in 2D, and sign mistakes in the 1D formula. Understanding perfectly inelastic collisions is essential for analyzing situations where objects become attached upon impact."
