  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to detect Earth's motion through the hypothetical luminiferous ether by measuring differences in the speed of light in perpendicular directions, but found no such difference, contradicting ether theory.",
    "explanation": "This null result challenged the classical understanding of light propagation and provided key experimental evidence that eventually led to the development of special relativity, which abandoned the concept of a stationary ether medium."
