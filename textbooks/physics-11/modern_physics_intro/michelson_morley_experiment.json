  "summary": "The Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to detect Earth's motion through the hypothetical luminiferous ether by measuring differences in light travel times along perpendicular paths using a sensitive interferometer. The persistent null result, showing no significant fringe shifts despite predictions of 0.4 fringe shifts, contradicted stationary ether theories. While various explanations were proposed, including the ad hoc Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction, it was Einstein's special relativity with its postulates of relativity and constant light speed that provided a fundamental explanation. The experiment represents a crucial milestone where precise experimental measurement forced revision of fundamental physical concepts, demonstrating the essential role of empirical testing in scientific progress. Modern repetitions have confirmed the null result with ever-increasing precision, establishing the constancy of light speed as one of physics' most well-verified principles."
