  "expanded_description": "This section explores Einstein's famous equation E=mc², which reveals the fundamental equivalence between mass and energy and has profound implications for nuclear physics, cosmology, and our understanding of the universe.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into one another. The total energy of an object is related to its mass by E=mc², where c is the speed of light.",
    "explanation": "This principle shows that mass is a form of energy, and even small amounts of mass contain enormous amounts of energy due to the c² factor. It explains energy release in nuclear reactions and the source of stellar energy."

  "summary": "Einstein's E=mc² establishes the equivalence between mass and energy. Rest energy E₀=mc² represents the energy content of mass itself. In nuclear reactions, small mass differences (mass defect) release enormous energy. The equation explains stellar energy production, nuclear power, and particle-antiparticle transformations. The c² factor (9×10¹⁶ m²/s²) shows why tiny mass changes yield huge energy releases."
