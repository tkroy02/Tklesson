  "summary": "Mass-energy equivalence $E = mc^2$ states that mass and energy are different manifestations of the same physical quantity. The rest energy $E_0 = m_0 c^2$ represents the energy content of stationary matter. In nuclear reactions, small mass changes $\\Delta m$ correspond to enormous energy releases $\\Delta E = \\Delta m c^2$ due to the large $c^2$ factor. Experimental verification comes from nuclear reactions, particle-antiparticle annihilation, and precise mass spectrometry. While the concept of relativistic mass $m_{rel} = \\gamma m_0$ was historically useful, modern physics prefers using invariant rest mass, with the velocity-dependent term representing kinetic energy. Mass-energy equivalence unified previously separate conservation laws and revealed that mass and energy can convert into each other, with profound implications for nuclear physics, cosmology, and our fundamental understanding of reality."
