  "summary": "Special relativity rests on two postulates: (1) The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames, extending Galileo's principle to all phenomena, and (2) Light speed in vacuum is constant for all inertial observers, independent of source or observer motion. These postulates resolve the conflict between mechanics and electromagnetism but require abandoning absolute space and time. Immediate consequences include relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, length contraction, and new velocity addition laws. The Lorentz transformation mathematically embodies these postulates, reducing to Galilean transformation at low speeds. Experimental evidence strongly supports both postulates, with light speed constancy verified to extremely high precision. These foundations lead to profound revisions in our understanding of space, time, and causality while maintaining complete internal consistency and making testable predictions that have been repeatedly verified."
