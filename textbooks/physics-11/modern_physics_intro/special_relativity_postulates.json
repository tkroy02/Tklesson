According to both observers, the light forms an expanding sphere. Show how this demonstrates the postulates.\n\n**Answer:** **Relativity Analysis:**\n\n**Stationary frame (S):**\n- Light sphere equation: x² + y² + z² = c²t²\n- Center at origin, radius = ct\n\n**Moving frame (S'):**\n- Light sphere equation: x'² + y'² + z'² = c²t'²\n- Center at origin, radius = ct'\n\n**Key Points:**\n1. **First Postulate:** Both observers see spherical wavefronts (same physical law)\n2. **Second Postulate:** Both measure light speed = c\n3. **Galilean transformation would predict different shapes**\n4. **Requires Lorentz transformation for consistency**\n\n**Interpretation:** This thought experiment shows why classical velocity addition fails for light and why relativity requires new transformation equations."

Explain why they are not simultaneous in the train frame.\n\n**Answer:** **Simultaneity Analysis:**\n\n**Station frame:**\n- Lightning strikes front and back simultaneously\n- Light from both events reaches station observer at same time\n\n**Train frame:**\n- Train moves toward light from front strike\n- Train moves away from light from back strike  \n- Light from front reaches train observer first\n- Therefore, front strike occurred before back strike\n\n**Key Insight:** The constancy of light speed for all observers means that whether events are simultaneous depends on the observer's state of motion. This demonstrates the relativity of simultaneity, a direct consequence of the postulates."
