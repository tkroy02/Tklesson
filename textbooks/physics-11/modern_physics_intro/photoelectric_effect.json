  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The photoelectric effect occurs when light shining on a metal surface causes the emission of electrons. Einstein explained this using light quanta (photons), where each photon's energy E = hf must exceed the metal's work function to eject electrons.",
    "explanation": "Classical wave theory couldn't explain key features of the photoelectric effect, but Einstein's photon model successfully predicted all observed behaviors, establishing light's particle nature and providing strong evidence for quantum theory."
