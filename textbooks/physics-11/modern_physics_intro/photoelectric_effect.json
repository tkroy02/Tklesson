  "summary": "The photoelectric effect involves electron emission from materials when light shines on them. Key observations - threshold frequency, kinetic energy dependence on frequency but not intensity, and instantaneous emission - contradicted classical wave theory. Einstein explained these in 1905 by proposing that light consists of discrete photons with energy $E = h\\nu$. His photoelectric equation $K_{max} = h\\nu - \\phi$ predicts all experimental results, with stopping potential $V_0$ related to maximum kinetic energy by $eV_0 = K_{max}$. Millikan's precise experiments verified Einstein's theory and measured Planck's constant. The photoelectric effect provided crucial evidence for light's particle nature and founded quantum mechanics. Modern applications include solar cells, digital cameras, photomultiplier tubes, and various light-sensing technologies, all operating on photoelectric principles that demonstrate the quantum nature of light-matter interaction."
