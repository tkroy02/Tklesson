  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the birth of quantum mechanics through the study of blackbody radiation, where classical physics failed and Planck's quantum hypothesis provided the breakthrough.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Blackbody radiation revealed that energy is quantized rather than continuous. Planck's revolutionary idea that electromagnetic energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets (quanta) resolved the ultraviolet catastrophe and launched quantum theory.",
    "explanation": "A blackbody is an ideal object that absorbs all radiation and emits radiation with a spectrum that depends only on its temperature, not its composition. Classical physics could not explain the observed spectrum, leading to Planck's quantum hypothesis."
