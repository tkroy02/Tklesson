  "summary": "Blackbody radiation studies revealed the ultraviolet catastrophe - the failure of classical physics to explain thermal radiation spectra. Max Planck resolved this in 1900 by introducing the radical concept that electromagnetic energy is quantized in discrete packets $E = h\\nu$. His radiation law $B_\\lambda = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\frac{1}{e^{hc/\\lambda kT} - 1}$ successfully describes the entire spectrum and recovers both Wien's law (high frequency) and Rayleigh-Jeans law (low frequency) as limits. This quantization hypothesis, initially considered a mathematical trick, founded quantum mechanics. The theory is verified by precise measurements of stellar spectra and the nearly perfect blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. Derived relationships like Wien's displacement law ($\\lambda_{max} T = constant$) and Stefan-Boltzmann law ($P \\propto T^4$) provide practical tools for temperature measurement across physics, astronomy, and engineering."
