  "summary": "The Bohr model (1913) proposed that electrons orbit nuclei in specific stable orbits without radiating, with angular momentum quantized as $L = n\\hbar$. This led to quantized radii $r_n = n^2 a_0$ and energies $E_n = -13.6/n^2$ eV for hydrogen. The model successfully explained the hydrogen spectrum, derived the Rydberg constant from fundamental constants, and resolved atomic stability. Key successes included predicting spectral lines and hydrogen-like ions. However, limitations included failure with multi-electron atoms, no explanation for fine structure or chemical bonding, arbitrary mixing of classical and quantum concepts, and incorrect angular momentum predictions. The model was superseded by quantum mechanics but remains valuable pedagogically as a bridge between classical physics and quantum theory and for approximate calculations in hydrogen-like systems."
