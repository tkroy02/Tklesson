  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Bohr model proposes that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, quantized energy levels without radiating energy. Electrons can only transition between these discrete levels by absorbing or emitting photons with energy equal to the level difference.",
    "explanation": "Bohr's model combined classical physics with radical new quantum ideas: stable electron orbits, quantized angular momentum, and quantum jumps between energy levels. It successfully explained hydrogen's line spectrum but was later superseded by quantum mechanics."

  "summary": "The Bohr model introduced quantized electron orbits with angular momentum L = nħ and energy levels E_n = -13.6/n² eV for hydrogen. It successfully explained hydrogen's discrete spectra through transitions between energy levels (ΔE = hf) and predicted spectral series (Lyman, Balmer, Paschen). While limited to hydrogen-like atoms and replaced by quantum mechanics, Bohr's model was historically crucial for establishing quantum principles in atomic physics and explaining phenomena that classical physics could not."
