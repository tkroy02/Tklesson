  "summary": "Light exhibits wave-particle duality, displaying wave-like properties (interference, diffraction) in some experiments and particle-like properties (photoelectric effect, Compton scattering) in others. This duality is mathematically described by de Broglie's relations $E = h\\nu$ and $p = h/\\lambda$. Bohr's complementarity principle states that wave and particle descriptions are complementary aspects of the same reality, with the experimental arrangement determining which behavior manifests. Modern single-photon experiments demonstrate that even individual photons exhibit wave interference while being detected as localized particles. Various interpretations (Copenhagen, pilot-wave, many-worlds) attempt to explain this duality, but all agree on experimental predictions. Wave-particle duality is not merely a peculiarity of light but a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics that applies to all matter and radiation, challenging our classical intuition about the nature of reality."
