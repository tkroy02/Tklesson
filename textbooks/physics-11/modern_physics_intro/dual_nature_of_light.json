  "expanded_description": "This section explores the wave-particle duality of light, a fundamental quantum concept where light exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on the experimental context.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Light exhibits dual behavior: it shows wave-like properties (interference, diffraction) in some experiments and particle-like properties (photoelectric effect, Compton scattering) in others. This duality is resolved through quantum mechanics, where light is described as photons with both wave and particle characteristics.",
    "explanation": "The dual nature means light cannot be fully described as either purely waves or purely particles. Instead, it possesses characteristics of both, with the observed behavior depending on how we measure it. This represents a fundamental departure from classical physics."

  "summary": "Light exhibits wave-particle duality: it shows interference and diffraction (wave properties) while also behaving as discrete photons in interactions like the photoelectric effect (particle properties). The de Broglie relations λ = h/p and E = hf connect these aspects. Bohr's complementarity principle states that wave and particle descriptions are complementary—both are necessary for a complete description, but cannot be observed simultaneously in the same experiment. This duality represents a fundamental quantum mechanical principle that applies to all quantum objects."
