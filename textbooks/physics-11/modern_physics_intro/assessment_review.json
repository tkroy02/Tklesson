These theories provide complementary frameworks for understanding the universe at extreme conditions.",

Special relativity redefines space, time, and energy relationships through the universal speed limit c, leading to time dilation, length contraction, and mass-energy equivalence. Quantum mechanics reveals the discrete, probabilistic nature of microscopic systems through Planck's constant h, explaining blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, atomic spectra, and wave-particle duality. These theories resolved critical failures of classical physics while maintaining correspondence in everyday domains."
