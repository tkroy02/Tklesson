Relativity reveals that space and time are relative (time dilation, length contraction) and mass-energy are equivalent (E=mc²). Quantum mechanics shows energy quantization (blackbody radiation), light's particle nature (photoelectric effect), wave-particle duality, and discrete atomic energy levels (Bohr model). These theories resolved classical physics contradictions and enabled understanding of phenomena from particle physics to atomic spectra."
