  "summary": "This comprehensive review integrates all major modern physics concepts: special relativity (time dilation, length contraction, mass-energy equivalence), quantum theory (blackbody radiation, photoelectric effect, wave-particle duality), and atomic physics (Bohr model, atomic spectra). Mastery involves solving complex multi-step problems, designing experiments, and understanding the interconnected nature of these revolutionary theories. Systematic approaches, deliberate practice, and multiple assessment methods ensure solid preparation for advanced topics including quantum mechanics, particle physics, and cosmology. The unified understanding developed here - that classical physics emerges as an approximation from more fundamental theories - forms the foundation for contemporary physics research and technological applications across numerous fields."
