  "summary": "Time dilation is the phenomenon where moving clocks are observed to run slower than stationary clocks, described by $\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta t_0$ where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. The effect has been experimentally verified through muon decay experiments, atomic clock measurements, and GPS system corrections. The twin paradox - where one twin travels at high speed and returns younger - is resolved by recognizing that only inertial frames can apply the simple time dilation formula, and the traveling twin's acceleration breaks the symmetry. Time dilation affects all physical processes equally, including biological aging. While negligible at everyday speeds, time dilation becomes crucial for systems involving high velocities or requiring extreme precision, making it an essential consideration in modern technology and fundamental physics."
