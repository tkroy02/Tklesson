  "topic": "10.3 Time Dilation Concept",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores time dilation, one of the most famous consequences of special relativity, where time passes at different rates for observers in relative motion.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Moving clocks run slow relative to stationary clocks. The time interval between two events is measured to be longer in a reference frame where the events occur at different positions (moving frame) compared to a frame where they occur at the same position (rest frame).",
    "explanation": "Time dilation occurs because the speed of light is constant for all observers. A moving clock must travel longer paths for light signals to synchronize its ticks, making time appear to pass more slowly from the perspective of a stationary observer."

  "summary": "Time dilation states that moving clocks run slow: Δt = γΔt₀, where Δt₀ is proper time (rest frame) and γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²). This effect is real and has been verified by muon decay experiments, atomic clock measurements, and GPS systems. The twin paradox is resolved by recognizing that acceleration breaks the symmetry between observers. Time dilation becomes significant only at speeds approaching light speed."
