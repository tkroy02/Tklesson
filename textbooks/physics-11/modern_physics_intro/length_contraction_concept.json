  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Moving objects contract in length along their direction of motion relative to a stationary observer. The measured length is shortest in the reference frame where the object is moving and longest in its rest frame.",
    "explanation": "Length contraction occurs because measurements of length require simultaneous determination of both ends, and simultaneity is relative. Different observers disagree about whether measurements of the ends occur simultaneously, leading to different length measurements."

But in the pole frame, the barn is contracted to 5 m. How can the pole fit inside?\n\n**Answer:** **Paradox Resolution:**\n\n**Key Insight:** Different observers disagree on simultaneity of events.\n\n**Barn frame analysis:**\n- Pole length: 10 m (contracted)\n- Back door closes when pole entirely inside\n- Front door opens immediately after\n- Events simultaneous in barn frame\n\n**Pole frame analysis:**\n- Barn length: 5 m (contracted)  \n- Back door closes first\n- Front door opens later\n- Pole is never completely inside with both doors closed simultaneously\n\n**Resolution:** The concept of \"fitting inside\" requires simultaneous door closure, which is frame-dependent.

  "summary": "Length contraction states that moving objects appear shorter: L = L₀/γ, where L₀ is proper length (rest frame) and γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²). The effect occurs only in the direction of motion and is intimately connected to the relativity of simultaneity. Apparent paradoxes like the barn-pole paradox are resolved by recognizing that different observers disagree on simultaneity of events. Length contraction is a real physical effect verified in high-energy physics experiments."
