  "summary": "Length contraction is the phenomenon where objects moving relative to an observer are measured to be shorter in their direction of motion, described by $L = L_0/\\gamma = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ where $L_0$ is the proper length. This effect complements time dilation and ensures the constancy of light speed in all inertial frames. Length contraction follows from the relativity of simultaneity - different observers disagree about which measurements constitute a simultaneous length measurement. Apparent paradoxes like the ladder paradox are resolved by careful analysis of spacetime events and recognition that simultaneity is frame-dependent. While direct experimental measurement of length contraction is challenging, its necessity for the internal consistency of special relativity and its indirect verification through other relativistic effects provide strong evidence for its reality. Length contraction represents a fundamental revision of our classical concepts of space and measurement."
