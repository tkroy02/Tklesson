    "principle": "Apparent weight is the force exerted by a supporting surface on an object, which can differ from actual weight due to acceleration. It represents what a scale would read and how heavy an object feels in different motion scenarios.",
    "explanation": "Apparent weight changes occur because scales measure the normal force, not mass directly. When acceleration is present, Newton's second law requires the normal force to adjust, making objects feel heavier or lighter than their actual weight."
