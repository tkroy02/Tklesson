  "summary": "Apparent weight is the normal force measured by scales, differing from true weight (mg) in accelerating frames. Key formulas: Vertical acceleration $W_{app} = m(g ± a)$, Circular motion top $W_{app} = m(\\frac{v^2}{r} - g)$, bottom $W_{app} = m(g + \\frac{v^2}{r})$. Weightlessness occurs when $W_{app} = 0$ in free fall or when $v = \\sqrt{rg}$ at top of vertical circle. Artificial gravity created by rotation: $W_{app} = m\\omega^2 r$. The equivalence principle states acceleration effects are locally indistinguishable from gravity. Apparent weight explains elevator sensations, roller coaster experiences, and orbital weightlessness."
