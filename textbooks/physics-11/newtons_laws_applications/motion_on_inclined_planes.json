  "summary": "Motion on inclined planes follows 1D kinematic equations parallel to the incline with acceleration $a = g\\sin\\theta$ (frictionless) or $a = g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu_k\\cos\\theta)$ (down with friction) or $a = -g(\\sin\\theta + \\mu_k\\cos\\theta)$ (up with friction). Key equations: $v_f = v_i + at$, $d = v_it + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$, $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$ with distances measured along the incline. For complex multi-segment motion, analyze each segment separately ensuring velocity continuity between segments. Energy methods provide alternative solutions, particularly useful for finding speeds at different positions. Real-world applications include transitions between horizontal and inclined surfaces and combined incline-projectile motion scenarios."
