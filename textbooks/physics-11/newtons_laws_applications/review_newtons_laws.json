  "summary": "Newton's Three Laws of Motion: (1) Law of Inertia - Objects maintain constant velocity unless acted upon by net force; (2) F=ma - Acceleration equals net force divided by mass; (3) Action-Reaction - Forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs between interacting objects. The First Law defines inertia and equilibrium, the Second Law provides the quantitative relationship for dynamics, and the Third Law explains force interactions. Free-body diagrams are essential tools for applying these laws correctly. Common applications include analyzing motion, solving equilibrium problems, and understanding force interactions in multi-object systems."
