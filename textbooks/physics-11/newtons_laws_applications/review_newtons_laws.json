    "principle": "Newton's Laws provide the complete foundation for classical mechanics: (1) Objects maintain constant velocity unless acted upon by net force; (2) Acceleration is proportional to net force and inversely proportional to mass; (3) Forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs between interacting objects.",
