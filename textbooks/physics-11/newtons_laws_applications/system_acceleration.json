  "summary": "System acceleration analysis determines how connected objects accelerate together due to physical constraints. Key concepts: motion constraints relate object accelerations (pulley: equal magnitudes, contact: equal vectors), degrees of freedom analysis determines independent variables, net external force determines center of mass acceleration. Systematic approach: identify objects and constraints, draw free-body diagrams, apply F=ma to each object, solve resulting equations. For pulley systems: a = g(m₂ - m₁)/(m₁ + m₂). Advanced systems may involve rolling constraints (a = rα) or complex pulley arrangements. Energy methods provide alternative solutions for acceleration determination in complex systems."
