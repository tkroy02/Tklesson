  "summary": "Inclined plane analysis involves resolving weight into components: parallel to incline $mg\\sin\\theta$ causing acceleration, and perpendicular $mg\\cos\\theta$ balanced by normal force. On frictionless inclines, acceleration $a = g\\sin\\theta$. With friction: static friction prevents motion up to critical angle $\\theta_c = \\tan^{-1}(\\mu_s)$, kinetic friction $f_k = \\mu_k mg\\cos\\theta$ reduces acceleration to $a = g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu_k\\cos\\theta)$ downhill. Advanced problems involve connected systems where constraint relationships and simultaneous equations are needed. The key is using a coordinate system aligned with the incline and properly resolving all forces into parallel and perpendicular components."
