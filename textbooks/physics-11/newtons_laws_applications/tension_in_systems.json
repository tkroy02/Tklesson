Students will learn to calculate tension in static and dynamic situations, and understand how tension transmits forces through connected systems.",

    "principle": "Tension is a pulling force transmitted through flexible connectors like ropes or strings, which acts equally in both directions along the connector and adjusts to satisfy Newton's laws for all connected objects.",
