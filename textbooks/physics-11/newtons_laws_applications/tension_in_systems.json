  "summary": "Tension is a pulling force transmitted through strings, ropes, or cables. Key properties: constant throughout massless strings, always pulls away from objects, appears in action-reaction pairs at connections. In pulley systems: tension constant throughout string, connected objects have accelerations of equal magnitude. Problem-solving approach: draw free-body diagrams for each object, apply F=ma to each, identify motion constraints, solve resulting system of equations. For Atwood's machine: acceleration $a = g\\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$, tension $T = \\frac{2m_1m_2g}{m_1 + m_2}$. Complex systems require systematic analysis of all objects and constraints simultaneously."
