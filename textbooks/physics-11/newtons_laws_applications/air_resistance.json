  "summary": "Air resistance (drag) opposes motion through fluids with force models: Linear drag F_d = -bv for low speeds/viscous fluids, Quadratic drag F_d = -½CρAv² for high speeds/air. Terminal velocity occurs when drag balances driving force: v_t = √(2mg/CρA) for quadratic drag, v_t = mg/b for linear drag. Motion with drag involves velocity-dependent acceleration solved via differential equations: v(t) = v_t(1 - e^(-t/τ)) for linear drag. Key concepts: Reynolds number determines flow regime, characteristic time τ = m/b for linear drag, terminal velocity depends on mass/area ratio. Real-world effects include reduced projectile range, asymmetric trajectories, and different falling speeds for different objects."
