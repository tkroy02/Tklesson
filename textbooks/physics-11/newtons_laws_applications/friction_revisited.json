  "summary": "Advanced friction analysis involves: Static friction (0 ≤ f_s ≤ μ_s F_N) preventing motion until threshold, Kinetic friction (f_k = μ_k F_N) during sliding. Multi-surface systems require analyzing each interface separately to determine which surfaces slip first (weakest link principle). Critical applications include rotating systems where friction provides centripetal force, banked curves with friction allowing speed ranges, and situations where friction enables necessary motion. Problem-solving strategy: Identify all friction surfaces, calculate maximum static friction for each, compare with required forces, determine motion pattern, apply appropriate friction type (static or kinetic) to each surface."
