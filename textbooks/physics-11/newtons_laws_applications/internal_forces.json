  "summary": "Internal forces act between components within a system, while external forces act on the system from outside. Key properties: internal forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs (Newton's Third Law), sum to zero for the entire system, and don't affect center of mass motion. To determine internal forces: (1) Find system acceleration, (2) Divide system at point of interest, (3) Apply F=ma to subsystem. Internal forces include contact forces, tension in connectors, and friction between components. Complex systems may involve statically indeterminate situations or deformable body mechanics requiring advanced analysis methods. Understanding internal forces is crucial for structural design and mechanical system analysis."
