  "summary": "Fluid pressure increases linearly with depth according to P = P₀ + ρgh, where the pressure increase is directly proportional to fluid density and depth. This hydrostatic pressure principle explains why underwater structures experience enormous forces and why dam walls are thicker at the bottom. Pressure measurement instruments like manometers and barometers utilize fluid columns to quantify pressure differences and absolute pressure. The communicating vessels principle demonstrates that connected fluid systems equalize to the same level due to pressure dependence on depth alone. Engineering applications must account for pressure-depth relationships through appropriate material selection, structural design, and safety factors. Understanding fluid pressure at depth is essential for designing underwater vehicles, water systems, and any structure interacting with fluids, while also explaining natural phenomena from ocean currents to atmospheric circulation patterns."
