  "summary": "Fluid mechanics integrates principles of statics (pressure distributions, buoyancy), dynamics (flow regimes, conservation laws), and real-fluid effects (viscosity, turbulence). Key concepts include: hydrostatic pressure P = ρgh, Archimedes' principle (buoyant force = weight of displaced fluid), continuity equation (ρAv = constant), Bernoulli's equation (P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant), and Reynolds number (Re = ρvL/μ) for flow regime prediction. Advanced applications span aerospace, biomedical, environmental, and chemical engineering. Understanding both the power and limitations of fluid principles enables accurate analysis of natural and engineered systems while providing foundation for advanced fluid dynamics studies."
