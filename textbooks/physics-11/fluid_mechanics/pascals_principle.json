  "summary": "Pascal's Principle states that pressure applied to a confined fluid transmits equally throughout the fluid. This enables hydraulic systems where F₂/F₁ = A₂/A₁, providing force multiplication through piston area differences. While forces multiply, work is conserved: F₁d₁ = F₂d₂, creating a trade-off between force and distance. Hydraulic systems consist of reservoirs, pumps, valves, actuators, and fluid lines working together to implement Pascal's Principle. Advanced applications include aircraft controls, industrial machinery, and precision equipment with multiple actuators and electronic controls. Practical systems experience efficiency losses through friction, leakage, and heat generation. Understanding Pascal's Principle provides foundation for fluid power systems that transmit forces efficiently, enable precise control, and multiply human capability across countless technological applications."
