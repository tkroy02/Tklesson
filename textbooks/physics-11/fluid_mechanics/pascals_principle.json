  "topic": "6.4 Pascal's Principle",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores Pascal's Principle, which describes how pressure is transmitted through confined fluids. It forms the theoretical foundation for hydraulic systems that multiply forces and enable heavy lifting with relatively small applied forces.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Pascal's Principle states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel. This means that any change in pressure at one point in an enclosed fluid appears equally at all other points in the fluid.",
    "explanation": "When you apply pressure to a confined fluid, that pressure doesn't decrease as it spreads through the fluid. This allows small forces applied over small areas to create large forces when acting over large areas. Pascal's Principle explains how hydraulic lifts, brakes, and presses can multiply forces, making it possible to lift heavy objects with minimal effort."

  "summary": "Section 6.4 establishes Pascal's Principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid. This principle enables hydraulic systems to multiply forces according to $F_2 = F_1 × (A_2/A_1)$, where the force ratio equals the area ratio. However, this force multiplication comes at the cost of reduced displacement, maintaining work conservation ($F_1 d_1 = F_2 d_2$ in ideal systems). Pascal's Principle explains the operation of hydraulic lifts, brakes, presses, and many other machines that transform small input forces into large output forces through confined fluid pressure transmission."
