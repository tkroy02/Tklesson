  "summary": "The continuity equation expresses mass conservation in fluid flow: ρAv = constant for steady flow. For incompressible fluids, this simplifies to Av = constant, creating an inverse relationship between velocity and cross-sectional area. The equation applies to complex systems including branching networks where total inflow equals total outflow. Advanced applications extend to compressible flows with density variations and unsteady flows with accumulation. Control volume analysis provides a systematic framework for applying continuity principles to real-world engineering systems. Understanding both the power and limitations of continuity analysis enables accurate prediction of flow behavior in piping systems, aerodynamic design, environmental flows, and biological circulation."
