  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of mass for fluid flow. It describes how the flow rate remains constant in a closed system, leading to relationships between flow velocity and cross-sectional area.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The continuity equation states that for an incompressible fluid flowing through a pipe of varying cross-section, the volume flow rate remains constant. This means that where the cross-sectional area decreases, the flow velocity must increase, and vice versa.",
    "explanation": "The continuity equation is essentially a statement of mass conservation for fluid flow. For steady flow of an incompressible fluid, the mass entering a pipe segment must equal the mass leaving it. Since density is constant, this reduces to conservation of volume flow rate. This principle explains why rivers flow faster in narrow sections and why nozzle design affects fluid velocity."

Understanding this fundamental relationship is crucial for analyzing fluid behavior in plumbing, cardiovascular systems, ventilation, and any application where fluids move through conduits of varying size."
