  "topic": "6.9 Bernoulli's Equation Concept",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Bernoulli's Equation, which describes the relationship between pressure, velocity, and elevation in fluid flow. It represents the conservation of energy principle for flowing fluids and explains many everyday fluid phenomena.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Bernoulli's Equation states that for an ideal fluid flowing in steady, incompressible, frictionless flow, the sum of pressure energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit volume remains constant along a streamline: $P + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\rho g h = \\text{constant}$.",
    "explanation": "Bernoulli's Equation shows that when fluid velocity increases, pressure decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship between speed and pressure explains how airplane wings generate lift, how spray bottles work, and why windows can blow out of houses during hurricanes. The equation essentially states that total mechanical energy is conserved along streamlines for ideal fluid flow."
