  "summary": "Bernoulli's Equation P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant expresses conservation of mechanical energy for ideal fluid flow along streamlines. It describes the trade-off between pressure, velocity, and elevation, with faster flow causing lower pressure. Applications include lift generation, flow measurement, and fluid transport devices. The principle has limitations due to viscosity, compressibility, and unsteady effects, requiring modified forms with head loss terms for real engineering applications. Understanding both the power and limitations of Bernoulli's principle enables accurate analysis of fluid systems while appreciating the fundamental energy conservation that governs fluid behavior across countless natural and engineered systems."
