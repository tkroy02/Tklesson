  "summary": "Fluid flow exists in two primary regimes: laminar flow with smooth, orderly motion and minimal mixing, and turbulent flow with chaotic, three-dimensional motion featuring eddies and enhanced mixing. The Reynolds number Re = ρvL/μ predicts flow transition, balancing inertial and viscous forces. Laminar flow dominates at low Re with parabolic velocity profiles and linear pressure-velocity relationships, while turbulent flow at high Re has flatter profiles and squared pressure-velocity relationships. Flow visualization techniques reveal complex patterns guiding engineering design. Understanding these flow regimes enables optimization of systems for reduced drag, efficient mixing, controlled heat transfer, and prediction of natural phenomena from blood circulation to atmospheric currents."
