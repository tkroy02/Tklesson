  "topic": "6.7 Fluid Flow: Laminar vs Turbulent",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces fluid dynamics by classifying fluid flow into two fundamental types: laminar (smooth, orderly) and turbulent (chaotic, mixed). It explores the factors that determine which type of flow occurs and the practical implications of each.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Fluid flow can be characterized as either laminar or turbulent based on the Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity that compares inertial forces to viscous forces. Laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers with smooth, parallel streamlines, while turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers with chaotic, mixed motion.",
    "explanation": "In laminar flow, fluid moves in parallel layers with minimal mixing between them, like honey pouring slowly from a jar. In turbulent flow, the motion is chaotic with eddies and vortices, like water rushing from a faucet. The transition between these regimes depends on fluid velocity, density, viscosity, and the characteristic length of the flow path."

  "summary": "Section 6.7 classifies fluid flow into laminar (smooth, orderly) and turbulent (chaotic, mixed) regimes based on the Reynolds number $Re = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}$. Laminar flow ($Re < 2000$) features parallel streamlines with minimal mixing, while turbulent flow ($Re > 4000$) exhibits chaotic motion with excellent mixing properties. The transition between regimes depends on the balance between inertial and viscous forces. Understanding flow classification is essential for optimizing engineering systems: laminar flow minimizes drag in transportation, while turbulent flow enhances mixing in chemical processes. The Reynolds number provides a universal criterion for predicting flow behavior across different fluids, velocities, and scales."
