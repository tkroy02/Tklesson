  "summary": "Archimedes' Principle states that the buoyant force on an object equals the weight of the fluid displaced. This upward force explains flotation, sinking, and neutral buoyancy based on density relationships. Objects float when their average density is less than the fluid density, with the submerged fraction equal to the density ratio. For completely submerged objects, buoyancy reduces apparent weight. Advanced applications include submarines using ballast tanks for depth control, hot air balloons manipulating density through temperature, and hydrometers measuring density through flotation depth. Buoyancy principles enable ship design, underwater exploration, and explain biological adaptations in aquatic organisms. Understanding these concepts provides foundation for naval architecture, underwater engineering, and numerous technologies that utilize fluid buoyancy."
