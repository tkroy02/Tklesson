  "expanded_description": "This section introduces buoyancy - the upward force that fluids exert on immersed objects - and Archimedes' Principle, which quantifies this force. It explains why objects float, sink, or remain suspended in fluids.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Archimedes' Principle states that any object partially or completely submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This buoyant force acts through the center of buoyancy (the center of mass of the displaced fluid).",
    "explanation": "Buoyancy occurs because pressure in a fluid increases with depth. The higher pressure at the bottom of an object creates a net upward force. Whether an object floats or sinks depends on the relationship between the buoyant force and the object's weight. If the buoyant force equals the weight, the object floats; if less, it sinks; if more, it rises."

  "summary": "Section 6.5 establishes that any object immersed in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces ($F_b = \\rho_{fluid} V_{displaced} g$). Whether an object floats, sinks, or remains suspended depends on the relationship between its weight and the buoyant force, which can be quickly determined by comparing densities: objects less dense than the fluid float, objects more dense sink, and objects of equal density experience neutral buoyancy. For floating objects, the submerged fraction equals the density ratio ($V_{sub}/V_{total} = \\rho_{object}/\\rho_{fluid}$). These principles explain floating ships, rising balloons, hydrometer operation, and why objects feel lighter in water."
