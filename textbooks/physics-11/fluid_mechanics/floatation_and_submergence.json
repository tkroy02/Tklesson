  "summary": "Flotation and submergence involve complex equilibrium conditions where buoyant force equals weight and proper stability is maintained. The submerged fraction equals the density ratio ρ_object/ρ_fluid. Stability is determined by metacentric height - the distance between metacenter and center of gravity - with positive values indicating stability. Advanced applications include multi-hull vessels for enhanced stability, floating in stratified fluids, and sophisticated offshore structures. Understanding these principles enables design of safe, efficient floating systems for transportation, energy production, and marine infrastructure. Proper stability analysis prevents capsizing and ensures operational safety in various marine environments."
