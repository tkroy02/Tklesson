  "expanded_description": "This section extends Archimedes' Principle to analyze the specific conditions for flotation, including how much of an object remains above the fluid surface and the stability of floating objects. It covers practical applications from ship design to submarine operation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An object floats when the weight of the fluid it displaces equals its own weight. The fraction of the object that remains above the surface depends on the density ratio between the object and the fluid. Stable flotation requires that the center of buoyancy remains vertically above the center of mass when the object is tilted.",
    "explanation": "Flotation is a balance between gravitational and buoyant forces. For homogeneous objects, the submerged fraction is determined solely by density ratios. For complex objects like ships, the shape and weight distribution determine both how much is submerged and whether the vessel remains stable when disturbed. Submarines actively control their buoyancy to achieve precise submergence."

For homogeneous objects, the submerged fraction is determined solely by the density ratio ($V_{sub}/V_{total} = \\rho_{object}/\\rho_{fluid}$). Stable flotation requires the center of buoyancy to be above the center of mass. Active buoyancy control systems like submarines use ballast tanks to adjust density, while hot air balloons control buoyancy through temperature-induced density changes. Understanding these principles is essential for designing stable floating structures, operating underwater vessels, and predicting the floating behavior of objects in various fluids."
