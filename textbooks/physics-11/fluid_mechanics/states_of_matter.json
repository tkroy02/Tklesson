  "summary": "States of matter - solid, liquid, and gas - represent different balances between particle kinetic energy and intermolecular forces. Solids maintain fixed shape and volume with particles in fixed positions. Liquids maintain volume but flow to match container shape, with particles that move but remain close. Gases expand to fill containers completely with widely spaced, rapidly moving particles. Phase transitions occur when energy changes disrupt the equilibrium between particle motion and intermolecular attractions. Key principles include elasticity in solids, Pascal's principle in liquids, and gas laws governing pressure-volume-temperature relationships. Understanding states of matter provides foundation for materials science, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and numerous technological applications across engineering, chemistry, and environmental science."
