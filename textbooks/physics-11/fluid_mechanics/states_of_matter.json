  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the three primary states of matter—solids, liquids, and gases—with a focus on the properties that distinguish them, particularly in the context of fluid mechanics. It establishes why liquids and gases are classified as fluids and how they behave differently from solids.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Matter exists in three primary states: solids, liquids, and gases. Liquids and gases are classified as fluids because they can flow and conform to the shape of their containers. The key distinction lies in how the particles are arranged and the strength of intermolecular forces, which determine the material's response to applied forces.",
    "explanation": "Solids maintain a fixed shape and volume due to strong intermolecular forces and fixed particle positions. Liquids maintain a fixed volume but conform to container shape due to weaker forces that allow molecules to slide past each other. Gases have neither fixed shape nor volume, expanding to fill their containers, as intermolecular forces are negligible compared to their kinetic energy."

This foundation explains why different mathematical models are needed for liquids (often treated as incompressible) versus gases (compressible)."

Liquids and gases are classified as fluids because they flow and cannot sustain shear stress at rest. Key fluid properties include compressibility (liquids are nearly incompressible, gases are highly compressible), viscosity (resistance to flow), and surface tension (liquid surface behavior). Understanding these basic distinctions and properties provides the essential foundation for all subsequent fluid mechanics concepts, from pressure and buoyancy to fluid dynamics."
