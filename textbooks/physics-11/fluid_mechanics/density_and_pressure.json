  "summary": "Density (ρ = m/V) is a fundamental intensive property characterizing mass concentration, while pressure (P = F/A) describes force distribution over area. In fluids, pressure increases with depth according to P = P₀ + ρgh due to the weight of overlying fluid. Pascal's Principle states that pressure applied to confined fluids transmits equally in all directions, enabling hydraulic systems that multiply forces through area differences (F₂/F₁ = A₂/A₁). These systems conserve energy, trading force multiplication for distance moved. Understanding density and pressure relationships explains buoyancy, fluid behavior, and enables numerous technological applications from hydraulic machinery to underwater exploration. These fundamental concepts provide foundation for fluid dynamics, engineering design, and understanding natural phenomena."
