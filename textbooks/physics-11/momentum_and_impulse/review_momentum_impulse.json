  "summary": "Momentum ($\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$) is a vector quantity measuring motion. Impulse ($\\vec{J} = \\vec{F}_{avg}\\Delta t$) causes momentum change through the impulse-momentum theorem: $\\vec{J} = \\Delta\\vec{p}$. In isolated systems (no net external force), total momentum is conserved: $\\sum\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\sum\\vec{p}_{final}$. Collisions are classified as elastic (momentum and KE conserved), inelastic (only momentum conserved), or perfectly inelastic (objects stick together). Explosions and recoil are applications where objects separate due to internal forces while conserving total momentum. These principles provide powerful problem-solving tools for brief, intense interactions where direct force measurement is difficult."
