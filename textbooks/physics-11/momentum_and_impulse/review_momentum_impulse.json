  "topic": "4.1 Review of Momentum and Impulse",
  "expanded_description": "This section re-introduces the foundational concepts of linear momentum and impulse, establishing the deep connection between them as expressed by the Impulse-Momentum Theorem. It serves as the essential starting point for analyzing collisions and interactions in this unit.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Momentum is a measure of an object's 'quantity of motion,' and impulse is the change in that quantity. The Impulse-Momentum Theorem states that the impulse delivered to an object equals its change in momentum. This theorem is a direct consequence of Newton's Second Law and is particularly powerful for analyzing forces during short-duration events like collisions.",
    "explanation": "This section re-establishes momentum as a vector quantity that is conserved in isolated systems. It focuses on the practical application of the impulse-momentum theorem, which allows us to determine the effect of a force over time without knowing the precise details of the force itself."
