  "summary": "In 2D perfectly inelastic collisions, objects stick together after impact. Momentum is conserved in both x and y directions separately: $m_1v_{1ix} + m_2v_{2ix} = (m_1 + m_2)v_{fx}$ and $m_1v_{1iy} + m_2v_{2iy} = (m_1 + m_2)v_{fy}$. The final velocity is $\\vec{v}_f = \\frac{m_1\\vec{v}_{1i} + m_2\\vec{v}_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2}$. Kinetic energy is not conserved, with maximum energy loss occurring. The lost energy transforms into heat, sound, and deformation. Special cases include: equal masses colliding perpendicularly move at 45° with $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ of the speed magnitude, and collisions with stationary objects maintain direction but reduce speed by factor $\\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}$. The center of mass velocity remains constant throughout the collision."
