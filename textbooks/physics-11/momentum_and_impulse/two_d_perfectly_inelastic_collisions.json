  "expanded_description": "This section applies the concept of perfectly inelastic collisions to two dimensions. The defining condition remains the same—objects stick together after collision—but now we must apply momentum conservation to both the x and y components separately to find the final velocity vector of the combined object.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a 2D perfectly inelastic collision, the colliding objects stick together and move with a single, common final velocity vector. Momentum is conserved in both the x and y directions independently, providing two equations that can be solved for the two components of the final velocity.",
    "explanation": "The 'sticking together' condition simplifies the problem significantly because there is only one final velocity vector to solve for, instead of two. This reduces the number of unknowns to two (v_fx and v_fy), which matches the two equations provided by component-wise momentum conservation. This makes 2D perfectly inelastic collisions more constrained and often easier to solve than general 2D collisions."

The solution involves applying momentum conservation separately in the x and y directions: m₁v₁ix + m₂v₂ix = (m₁ + m₂)v_fx and m₁v₁iy + m₂v₂iy = (m₁ + m₂)v_fy. A key constraint is that if one object is initially stationary, the final motion must occur along the line of impact (the initial velocity direction of the moving object). The final velocity vector always points in the direction of the total initial momentum of the system. These collisions always involve significant kinetic energy loss, converting mechanical energy into heat, sound, and deformation energy."
