  "expanded_description": "This section covers elastic collisions, where both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. These are idealized collisions that provide a foundation for understanding interactions where no energy is dissipated, such as those between atomic particles or on frictionless air tracks.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An elastic collision is defined by the conservation of kinetic energy in addition to the conservation of momentum. This double constraint leads to unique, predictable outcomes where objects bounce apart, and their final velocities can be solved for using a system of two equations.",
    "explanation": "Elastic collisions represent the other extreme from perfectly inelastic collisions, with zero loss of kinetic energy. The conservation of both momentum and kinetic energy provides two independent equations, allowing for the solution of two unknown final velocities. This leads to specific, well-defined relationships between the initial and final states."

The Two Conservation Laws:**\n- **Conservation of Momentum: m₁v₁i + m₂v₂i = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f**\n- **Conservation of Kinetic Energy: ½m₁v₁i² + ½m₂v₂i² = ½m₁v₁f² + ½m₂v₂f²**\n\n**2. Derived Equations (Convenient Forms):**\n- **From the two laws above, one can derive the following equivalent, often more useful, relationship:**\n- **Relative Velocity Reversal: v₁i - v₂i = -(v₁f - v₂f)**\n- **\"The relative velocity of approach equals the negative of the relative velocity of separation.\"**\n\n**3. Problem-Solving Approaches:**\n- **Method 1: System of Equations.** Use the momentum and energy equations directly. This is robust but can be algebraically intensive.\n- **Method 2: Relative Velocity.** Use momentum conservation and the relative velocity equation. This is often simpler.\n\n**4. Special Case: Stationary Target (v₂i = 0):**\n- **The solutions simplify to:**\n  - **v₁f = ((m₁ - m₂) / (m₁ + m₂)) v₁i**\n  - **v₂f = ((2m₁) / (m₁ + m₂)) v₁i**",
        "context": "Elastic collisions are a powerful model in physics. While no macroscopic collision is perfectly elastic, many are nearly so (e.g., billiard balls, superballs). At the microscopic level, collisions between molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles are often elastic."

  "summary": "Section 4.5 covers elastic collisions, where both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. The two governing equations are: 1) m₁v₁i + m₂v₂i = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f (momentum), and 2) ½m₁v₁i² + ½m₂v₂i² = ½m₁v₁f² + ½m₂v₂f² (kinetic energy). A more efficient approach combines momentum conservation with the derived relative velocity condition: v₁i - v₂i = -(v₁f - v₂f). Key conceptual results include: for equal masses with one stationary, velocities are exchanged; a very light object hitting a massive one rebounds with nearly the same speed; and a massive object hitting a light one is barely slowed, ejecting the light object at nearly twice its own speed. Mastery of elastic collisions requires solving a system of two equations and understanding these fundamental relationships."
