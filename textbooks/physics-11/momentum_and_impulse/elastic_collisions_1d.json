  "summary": "Elastic collisions conserve both momentum ($m_1v_{1i} + m_2v_{2i} = m_1v_{1f} + m_2v_{2f}$) and kinetic energy ($\\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1i}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2i}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2f}^2$). The relative velocity reverses: $v_{1i} - v_{2i} = -(v_{1f} - v_{2f})$. General formulas: $v_{1f} = \\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}v_{1i} + \\frac{2m_2}{m_1+m_2}v_{2i}$ and $v_{2f} = \\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}v_{1i} + \\frac{m_2-m_1}{m_1+m_2}v_{2i}$. Special cases: equal masses exchange velocities; light object incident on heavy stationary rebounds with nearly same speed; heavy object incident on light stationary continues almost unchanged while light object gains high speed. Maximum energy transfer occurs with equal masses. Applications include particle physics, Newton's cradle, and multi-collision systems."
