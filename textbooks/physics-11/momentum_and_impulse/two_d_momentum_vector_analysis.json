  "summary": "2D momentum conservation requires applying momentum conservation separately to x and y components: $\\sum p_{x-initial} = \\sum p_{x-final}$ and $\\sum p_{y-initial} = \\sum p_{y-final}$. Momentum vectors are resolved using $p_x = p\\cos\\theta$ and $p_y = p\\sin\\theta$. Perfectly inelastic 2D collisions (objects stick together) have two unknowns and are always solvable. Elastic 2D collisions have four unknowns but three equations (two momentum + energy), making them solvable with given information. Inelastic 2D collisions without additional information are underdetermined. The center of mass frame simplifies analysis by making total momentum zero. Real-world applications include sports impacts, particle physics, and vehicle collision analysis. Systematic approach: establish coordinate system, resolve vectors into components, write conservation equations, solve system, reconstruct final vectors."
