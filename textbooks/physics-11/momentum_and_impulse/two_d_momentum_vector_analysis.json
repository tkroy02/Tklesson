  "expanded_description": "This section extends the principle of conservation of momentum to two dimensions, where velocities and momenta are vectors with both x and y components. This requires analyzing momentum conservation separately in each perpendicular direction.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Momentum is a vector quantity. In two dimensions, conservation of momentum means that the total momentum is conserved in both the x-direction and the y-direction independently. For an isolated system, Σp_x,initial = Σp_x,final and Σp_y,initial = Σp_y,final.",
    "explanation": "Two-dimensional collisions and explosions cannot be described by a single scalar equation. Instead, we break the vector momentum equation into its component parts. This typically provides two equations, which allows us to solve for up to two unknown quantities, such as the magnitude and direction of a final velocity or the two components of a single unknown velocity vector."

  "summary": "Section 4.6 extends momentum conservation to two dimensions by treating momentum as a vector. The key technique is to resolve all momenta into x and y components and apply conservation separately in each direction: Σp_ix = Σp_fx and Σp_iy = Σp_fy. This typically provides two equations that can be solved for two unknowns. The problem-solving process involves: defining a coordinate system, decomposing known velocities using trigonometry, writing the component equations, solving the resulting system, and reconstructing any final vector quantities. Mastering this component approach is essential for analyzing the vast majority of real-world collisions and explosions that are not confined to a single line."
