Key concepts include: impulse-momentum theorem ($\\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p}$), classification of collisions (elastic: both momentum and KE conserved; inelastic: momentum conserved, KE not conserved; perfectly inelastic: objects stick together), center of mass motion ($\\vec{v}_{CM} = \\frac{\\sum m_i\\vec{v}_i}{M_{total}}$), and 2D analysis using vector components. Problem-solving framework: identify system, classify collision, apply appropriate conservation laws, use component methods for 2D problems. Special results: equal mass elastic collisions in 1D exchange velocities; equal mass 2D elastic collisions yield perpendicular final velocities; CM motion unaffected by internal forces. Mastery requires both quantitative problem-solving skills and conceptual understanding of momentum principles and their applications."
