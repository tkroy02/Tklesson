  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review and assessment of the entire Unit 4: Momentum and Impulse. It synthesizes concepts from impulse-momentum theorem, conservation of momentum in one and two dimensions, analysis of different collision types (inelastic and elastic), and center of mass motion to solve complex, multi-step problems involving interactions between objects.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Momentum-Impulse framework provides a powerful tool for analyzing interactions, especially collisions and explosions, where forces are complex and time-dependent. The central theme is that impulse changes momentum, and the total momentum of a system is conserved in the absence of net external force. This approach is often more direct than using Newton's Laws directly for short-duration events.",
    "explanation": "This review synthesizes all momentum concepts: calculating momentum and impulse, applying the impulse-momentum theorem, using conservation of momentum as a fundamental law for isolated systems, analyzing different collision types based on kinetic energy conservation, extending these principles to two dimensions through vector components, and understanding the predictable motion of the center of mass."

Key takeaways include: impulse changes momentum (J=Δp); momentum is conserved in isolated systems; collisions are categorized by energy behavior (perfectly inelastic-max energy loss, elastic-no energy loss); 2D problems require vector component analysis; and the center of mass moves predictably regardless of internal interactions. Mastery is demonstrated by the ability to: correctly identify isolated systems, select appropriate collision models, apply vector conservation in multiple dimensions, and understand how the center of mass simplifies complex motion analysis. This unit fundamentally changes how we analyze interactions, often providing simpler solutions than direct force analysis."
