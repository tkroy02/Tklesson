  "topic": "4.4 Perfectly Inelastic Collisions in 1D",
  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on a specific and common type of collision where the colliding objects stick together after impact, moving with a common final velocity. This is called a perfectly inelastic collision, and it is characterized by the maximum possible loss of kinetic energy.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a perfectly inelastic collision, the colliding objects stick together and move as a single combined object after the collision. While kinetic energy is not conserved (and is in fact minimized), momentum is conserved. This condition provides a direct relationship to find the common final velocity.",
    "explanation": "The 'sticking together' condition simplifies the conservation of momentum equation because there is only one final velocity instead of two. This makes perfectly inelastic collisions mathematically straightforward, while introducing the important concept that momentum can be conserved even when a large portion of the kinetic energy is transformed into other forms like heat, sound, and deformation."

  "summary": "Section 4.4 focuses on perfectly inelastic collisions, defined by the condition that the colliding objects stick together and move with a common final velocity (v_f). The governing equation is derived from conservation of momentum: m₁v₁i + m₂v₂i = (m₁ + m₂)v_f. While momentum is conserved, kinetic energy is not; a significant portion is always transformed into other forms like heat and sound. This makes perfectly inelastic collisions characterized by the maximum possible loss of kinetic energy for a given initial momentum. The ballistic pendulum is a classic application that combines a perfectly inelastic collision with energy conservation."
