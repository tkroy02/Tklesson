  "summary": "Perfectly inelastic collisions occur when objects stick together after collision. Momentum is conserved: $m_1v_{1i} + m_2v_{2i} = (m_1 + m_2)v_f$. Kinetic energy is not conserved, with maximum possible energy loss: $\\Delta KE = KE_i - KE_f$. The final velocity equals the initial center of mass velocity. For multi-object collisions: $\\sum m_iv_i = (\\sum m_i)v_f$. The coefficient of restitution e = 0. Energy is converted to thermal energy, sound, and deformation. Applications include ballistic pendulums, vehicle safety design, and various engineering systems. Perfectly inelastic collisions represent the maximum energy dissipation possible while still conserving momentum."
