  "summary": "The center of mass is the weighted average position of mass in a system: $\\vec{r}_{CM} = \\frac{\\sum m_i\\vec{r}_i}{M_{total}}$ for discrete particles. It moves according to $\\sum \\vec{F}_{ext} = M_{total}\\vec{a}_{CM}$, meaning only external forces affect CM motion. Internal forces (like explosions or people moving within a system) cannot change CM velocity. For stability, an object remains balanced if the vertical line through its CM falls within its base of support. Composite objects have CM determined by treating each part as a point mass at its own CM. Special cases include: symmetric uniform objects (CM at geometric center), objects in uniform gravitational field (CM coincides with center of gravity), and systems with no external forces (CM moves with constant velocity). The CM concept simplifies complex system analysis by reducing them to single-point motion problems."
