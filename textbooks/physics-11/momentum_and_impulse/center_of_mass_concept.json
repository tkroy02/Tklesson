  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the center of mass as a key concept for analyzing the motion of systems of particles. The center of mass is the point that moves as if all the mass of the system were concentrated there and all external forces were applied there.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The center of mass (COM) of a system is the average position of all the mass in the system, weighted by their masses. For a system of particles, the COM moves according to Newton's Second Law as if it were a single particle with the total mass of the system, experiencing the net external force on the system.",
    "explanation": "The center of mass provides a powerful simplification for analyzing complex systems. Regardless of the internal forces and motions within a system (collisions, explosions, rotations), the center of mass moves in a predictable way determined solely by the net external force. This concept connects directly to momentum conservation, as the velocity of the center of mass remains constant when no net external force acts on the system."

  "summary": "Section 4.9 introduces the center of mass as the point that represents the average position of a system's mass. The COM position is calculated as a mass-weighted average of particle positions. Most importantly, the center of mass moves according to Newton's Second Law as if all external forces acted there and all mass were concentrated there. Internal forces do not affect COM motion. When no net external force acts, the COM moves with constant velocity, which is equivalent to conservation of total momentum. This concept powerfully simplifies the analysis of complex systems, allowing separation of the overall motion (COM) from internal motions like rotations and vibrations."
