  "summary": "Impulse equals the area under a force-time graph, calculated geometrically for simple shapes (rectangles, triangles, trapezoids) or numerically for complex or discrete data. Numerical methods include rectangle rule, trapezoidal rule, and counting squares. The average force equals total impulse divided by total time: $F_{avg} = J/\\Delta t$. The impulse-momentum theorem relates impulse to velocity change: $J = m\\Delta v$. Real-world applications include sports impact analysis, collision safety design, and process optimization. The force-time trade-off principle shows that the same impulse can be delivered with high force briefly or lower force over longer time, which is exploited in safety designs to reduce injury risks."
