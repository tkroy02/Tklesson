  "topic": "4.2 Impulse from Graphs",
  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on calculating impulse graphically by finding the area under a Force-Time (F-t) curve. This method is essential for situations where the force is not constant, allowing us to determine the change in momentum even when the precise mathematical function for the force is unknown.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The impulse delivered by a force is equal to the area under the curve of a Force vs. Time graph. Since impulse equals change in momentum (J = Δp), the area under the F-t graph directly gives an object's change in momentum.",
    "explanation": "Graphical analysis extends the impulse-momentum theorem beyond constant forces. By approximating or calculating the area under complex F-t curves, we can find the total impulse, which is often impossible with a simple F_avg * Δt calculation. This is a powerful tool for analyzing real-world collisions and impacts where forces vary dramatically."

  "summary": "Section 4.2 establishes that the impulse delivered to an object is numerically equal to the area under its Force-Time (F-t) graph. This holds true for constant, variable, and complex forces. Calculating this area—through geometry for simple graphs or estimation/integration for complex ones—provides a direct method to find the change in momentum (Δp) of the object, bypassing the need to know the exact average force. Mastering this graphical technique is fundamental for analyzing real-world impulsive forces."
