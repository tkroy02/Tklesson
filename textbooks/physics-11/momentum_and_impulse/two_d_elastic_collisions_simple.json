  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the analysis of perfectly elastic collisions in two dimensions, focusing on simplified cases that provide solvable scenarios. These problems combine momentum conservation in both dimensions with the conservation of kinetic energy.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In a 2D elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This gives us three equations (momentum in x, momentum in y, and kinetic energy) to work with. For simple cases, we can solve for unknown quantities by leveraging symmetry, right-angle collisions, or cases where one mass is much larger than the other.",
    "explanation": "A general 2D elastic collision between two objects has four unknowns (the x and y components of both final velocities). With only three equations, the system is underdetermined. However, by considering simplified scenarios—such as equal masses colliding at right angles, or collisions where one object is stationary and much lighter/heavier—we can find unique solutions that provide deep physical insight."

The key insight is that while general 2D elastic collisions have 4 unknowns but only 3 conservation equations (making them underdetermined), specific scenarios provide the needed constraints. The most important special case is equal masses with one stationary, where the final velocities are always perpendicular. Other solvable cases involve extreme mass ratios or geometric constraints like right-angle collisions. Success with these problems requires recognizing the special conditions, methodically applying all three conservation equations, and carefully solving the resulting system, often involving substantial algebra."
