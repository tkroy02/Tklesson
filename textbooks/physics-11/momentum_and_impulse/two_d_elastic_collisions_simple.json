  "summary": "In 2D perfectly elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved: $\\sum m_i\\vec{v}_{i} = constant$ and $\\sum \\frac{1}{2}m_iv_i^2 = constant$. For equal masses, the final velocities are always perpendicular. When one equal mass is initially stationary, they separate at exactly 90° in the lab frame. The center of mass frame provides powerful simplifications: in this frame, speeds remain constant and velocities simply rotate during collision. Special cases include: equal mass collisions (always perpendicular separation), stationary target collisions (predictable angle relationships), and head-on collisions (simple velocity exchanges). Solving general 2D elastic collisions requires three conservation equations plus geometric information about the collision. The CM frame approach involves: (1) finding CM velocity, (2) transforming to CM frame, (3) applying the collision (velocity rotation), (4) transforming back to lab frame."
