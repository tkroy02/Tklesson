  "summary": "In 1D systems with no net external force, momentum is conserved: $\\sum p_{initial} = \\sum p_{final}$. Perfectly inelastic collisions: objects stick together with $m_1v_{1i} + m_2v_{2i} = (m_1 + m_2)v_f$. Elastic collisions conserve both momentum and kinetic energy, with relative velocity reversing: $v_{1i} - v_{2i} = -(v_{1f} - v_{2f})$. Equal masses exchange velocities in elastic collisions. The coefficient of restitution $e = \\frac{v_{2f} - v_{1f}}{v_{1i} - v_{2i}}$ measures collision elasticity (0 = perfectly inelastic, 1 = perfectly elastic). Complex problems are solved by decomposition into stages with appropriate conservation principles applied to each stage. Consistent sign conventions are essential throughout all 1D momentum calculations."
