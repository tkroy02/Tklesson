  "expanded_description": "This section combines Newton's law of universal gravitation with circular motion principles to analyze the motion of satellites and other objects in circular orbit. By setting the gravitational force equal to the required centripetal force, we can derive relationships for orbital speed, period, and the dependence on orbital radius. These relationships explain why satellites in higher orbits move slower and have longer periods.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For an object in circular orbit around a much larger mass (e.g., a satellite around Earth), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force. Equating $F_g = G\\frac{Mm}{r^2}$ to $F_c = m\\frac{v^2}{r}$ gives relationships between orbital speed, radius, and period: $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$, $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}$.",
    "explanation": "This unification shows that the motion of planets, moons, and artificial satellites follows the same physical laws. The mass of the orbiting object cancels out, meaning that any object at a given orbital radius has the same orbital speed and period, regardless of its mass. This explains why astronauts and their spacecraft orbit together, appearing weightless.",

  "summary": "For an object in circular orbit, gravity provides the centripetal force: $G\\frac{Mm}{r^2} = m\\frac{v^2}{r}$. This leads to orbital speed $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$, which decreases with increasing radius and is independent of the satellite's mass. The orbital period is $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}$, giving Kepler's third law $T^2 \\propto r^3$. Geostationary satellites have $T = 24$ hours and orbit at about 36,000 km altitude. The total mechanical energy of a satellite is $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r}$, negative for bound orbits. Common mistakes include thinking gravity disappears in orbit, using surface $g$ for high altitudes, confusing orbital and escape speeds, and using altitude instead of center‑to‑center distance. Understanding these relationships is essential for analyzing satellite motion and planetary orbits."
