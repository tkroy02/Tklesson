  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review of all topics covered in Unit 5: Circular Motion and Gravity. It synthesizes the key concepts of circular motion descriptors, centripetal acceleration and force, horizontal and vertical circular motion applications, Newton's law of universal gravitation, satellite orbits, Kepler's laws, and apparent weightlessness. Mastering these interconnected ideas is essential for understanding the motion of objects along curved paths and the gravitational interactions that govern the cosmos.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Circular motion and gravity are unified through the concept of centripetal force. Whether it's a car on a curve, a satellite in orbit, or a planet around the Sun, the inward force required for circular motion is provided by real forces such as friction, tension, normal force, or gravity. Newton's law of universal gravitation ($F = G\\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$) combines with circular motion principles ($F_c = m\\frac{v^2}{r}$) to explain orbital motion, leading to relationships for orbital speed ($v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$) and period ($T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{GM}}$). Kepler's laws describe planetary motion empirically, while apparent weightlessness arises from free fall conditions.",
    "explanation": "Unit 5 builds a complete framework for understanding motion along curved paths. We learned to describe circular motion using period, frequency, tangential speed, and angular displacement. Centripetal acceleration ($a_c = v^2/r$) always points toward the center, and centripetal force ($F_c = mv^2/r$) is the net force causing this acceleration. Applications include horizontal curves (flat and banked) and vertical loops where speed varies and energy conservation is needed. Newton's law of gravitation explains why objects orbit and leads to Kepler's laws, which describe planetary motion. Apparent weightlessness is understood as free fall, not absence of gravity.",

  "summary": "Unit 5: Circular Motion and Gravity integrated the concepts of curved‑path motion with the universal force of gravity. Circular motion descriptors (period $T$, frequency $f$, tangential speed $v$, angular displacement $\\theta$) provide the language for analyzing rotation. Centripetal acceleration $a_c = v^2/r$ and centripetal force $F_c = mv^2/r$ are the core relationships, with the force supplied by tension, friction, normal forces, or gravity. Applications include horizontal curves (flat: $v_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\mu_s g r}$; banked: $v = \\sqrt{rg\\tan\\theta}$) and vertical circles where speed varies and energy conservation gives $v_b^2 = v_t^2 + 4gr$, with minimum top speed $\\sqrt{gr}$. Newton's law of universal gravitation $F = G m_1 m_2/r^2$ unifies terrestrial and celestial motion. For circular orbits, $v = \\sqrt{GM/r}$ and $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{r^3/GM}$. Kepler's laws describe planetary motion: elliptical orbits with Sun at one focus, equal areas in equal times, and $T^2 \\propto a^3$. Apparent weightlessness occurs in free fall (including orbit) where support force vanishes. Common mistakes include forgetting that circular motion involves acceleration even at constant speed, misidentifying force directions, using wrong formulas for banked curves, confusing $g$ and $G$, and thinking gravity is absent in orbit. Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding satellite motion, planetary systems, and engineered curved paths."
