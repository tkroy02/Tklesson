  "expanded_description": "This section introduces centripetal acceleration, the acceleration experienced by an object moving in a circular path. Even when the speed is constant, an object in circular motion is accelerating because its direction is continuously changing. This acceleration is directed toward the center of the circle, hence the name 'centripetal' (center-seeking).",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An object moving in a circle at constant speed is accelerating because its velocity vector is constantly changing direction. This acceleration, called centripetal acceleration, always points toward the center of the circle. Its magnitude is given by $a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r}$, where $v$ is the tangential speed and $r$ is the radius of the circle.",
    "explanation": "Centripetal acceleration is not a new kind of force; it is the acceleration that results from any force (tension, gravity, friction, etc.) that pulls an object toward the center of a circular path. The formula $a_c = v^2/r$ shows that for a given radius, higher speeds require larger centripetal acceleration, and for a given speed, smaller radii require larger centripetal acceleration.",

Even at constant speed, there is acceleration because the direction of the velocity vector is continuously changing. Centripetal acceleration always points toward the center of the circle and is perpendicular to the instantaneous velocity. Its magnitude is given by $a_c = v^2/r$, where $v$ is the tangential speed and $r$ is the radius. Alternative forms using period $T$ or frequency $f$ are $a_c = 4\\pi^2 r/T^2$ and using angular speed $\\omega$, $a_c = \\omega^2 r$. In uniform circular motion, centripetal acceleration is the only acceleration; in non-uniform circular motion, there is also tangential acceleration. Common mistakes include forgetting that circular motion involves acceleration even at constant speed, using the wrong speed in the formula, confusing the direction (outward vs. inward), and unit errors. Understanding centripetal acceleration is essential for analyzing the forces that cause circular motion, which is covered in the next section."
