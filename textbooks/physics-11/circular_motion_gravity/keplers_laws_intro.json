  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Kepler's three laws of planetary motion, which describe how planets orbit the Sun. These empirical laws were derived by Johannes Kepler from meticulous astronomical observations made by Tycho Brahe. They marked a major shift from the ancient belief in perfect circular orbits to the reality of elliptical paths. Later, Newton showed that these laws are consequences of his law of universal gravitation and laws of motion, providing a unified explanation of celestial and terrestrial mechanics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Kepler's three laws describe the motion of planets around the Sun: (1) Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. (2) A line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. (3) The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi‑major axis of its orbit ($T^2 \\propto a^3$).",
    "explanation": "These laws replaced the ancient geocentric models and provided a precise description of planetary motion. The first law broke with the dogma of circular orbits. The second law describes the varying speed of a planet along its orbit. The third law relates the size of the orbit to the time it takes to complete one revolution. Together, they allowed the prediction of planetary positions with unprecedented accuracy.",

      "introduction": "Before Kepler, the prevailing model of the solar system was the geocentric Ptolemaic system or the heliocentric Copernican system, which still used circular orbits and epicycles to account for observed planetary motions. Tycho Brahe's precise observations, especially of Mars, provided the data needed for Kepler to discover the true shapes of planetary orbits.",
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) was a German mathematician and astronomer who worked with Tycho Brahe's data. He initially tried to fit Mars' orbit with a circle but found discrepancies. After many trials, he discovered that Mars' orbit is an ellipse, leading to his first two laws in 1609. The third law was published in 1619.",
        "context": "Kepler's laws were purely descriptive; he did not know why planets moved that way. Newton later provided the physical explanation using gravity and his laws of motion."

        "definition": "An ellipse is an oval shape defined by two foci. For any point on the ellipse, the sum of the distances to the two foci is constant. In planetary orbits, the Sun is at one focus; the other focus is empty. The eccentricity $e$ measures how elongated the ellipse is ($0 \\le e < 1$; $e=0$ is a circle).",
        "context": "This law contradicted the long‑held belief that celestial motion must be circular. It explained why planets appear to move faster when closer to the Sun (perihelion) and slower when farther (aphelion)."

          "application": "Most planetary orbits have low eccentricity (e.g., Earth's $e \\approx 0.0167$, nearly circular). Comets and some asteroids can have highly eccentric orbits.",

        "context": "This law is a consequence of conservation of angular momentum. The gravitational force is central (always directed toward the Sun), so no torque acts on the planet, and angular momentum is conserved.
