  "expanded_description": "This section introduces centripetal force, the net force required to keep an object moving in a circular path. Centripetal force is not a new type of force; rather, it is the name given to any force (tension, gravity, friction, normal force) that acts perpendicular to the velocity and points toward the center of the circle, causing centripetal acceleration.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Centripetal force is the net force that causes an object to follow a circular path. It always points toward the center of the circle and is perpendicular to the instantaneous velocity. According to Newton's second law, $F_{\\text{net}} = ma_c$, so the centripetal force is given by $F_c = m\\frac{v^2}{r}$ (or $F_c = m\\omega^2 r$).",
    "explanation": "Centripetal force is not a separate force of nature; it is the vector sum of all real forces (tension, friction, gravity, normal force) that together produce the inward acceleration. In a free body diagram, the net force in the radial direction must equal $mv^2/r$ toward the center. Understanding this allows us to analyze situations like cars on curves, objects on strings, and satellites in orbit.",

It is always directed toward the center of the circle and is perpendicular to the velocity. Its magnitude is given by $F_c = m a_c = m\\frac{v^2}{r}$ (or $F_c = m\\omega^2 r$).",
        "context": "The term 'centripetal' means 'center-seeking'. It describes the direction of the net force, not a new kind of force. In each situation, the centripetal force is provided by familiar forces such as tension, friction, gravity, or the normal force."

This force is not a new type of force; it is provided by familiar forces such as tension (object on a string), friction (car on a curve), gravity (satellite in orbit), or the normal force (roller coaster). In an inertial frame, no 'centrifugal force' exists; that is a fictitious force appearing only in rotating frames. When solving problems, draw a free body diagram, identify all real forces, set the sum of their radial components (positive inward) equal to $mv^2/r$, and solve for unknowns. Common mistakes include including centrifugal force in FBDs, treating centripetal force as an extra force, and sign errors in radial equations. Understanding centripetal force is essential for analyzing circular motion in all its forms."
