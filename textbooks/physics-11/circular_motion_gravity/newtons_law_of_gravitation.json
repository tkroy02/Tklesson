  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which describes the gravitational attraction between any two objects with mass. It is a fundamental force that governs the motion of planets, the orbits of satellites, the tides, and the familiar weight we experience on Earth. The law states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force acts along the line joining the two particles. Mathematically, $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant.",
    "explanation": "This law unifies terrestrial and celestial motion: the same force that causes an apple to fall also keeps the Moon in orbit around Earth. It is an inverse‑square law, meaning the force weakens rapidly with distance. The constant $G$ is extremely small, making gravity noticeable only when at least one of the masses is huge (like a planet or star).",

        "context": "This law applies to any two masses, whether they are atoms, apples, planets, or galaxies. For extended spherical objects, the distance $r$ is measured between their centers, as Newton proved that a uniform sphere attracts as if all its mass were concentrated at its center."

The force is always attractive, acts along the line joining the masses, and obeys an inverse‑square law with distance. For spherical objects, $r$ is the distance between centers. This law explains weight as the gravitational force exerted by Earth: $mg = G M_E m / R_E^2$, so $g = G M_E / R_E^2$. $g$ varies with altitude and differs on other planets. When multiple masses are present, the net gravitational force on any mass is the vector sum of the forces from each other mass (superposition). Common mistakes include forgetting $G$, using radius instead of center‑to‑center distance, treating forces as scalars, and confusing $g$ with $G$. Understanding universal gravitation is essential for analyzing planetary motion, satellite orbits, and tidal forces."
