  "summary": "Vertical circular motion involves objects moving in vertical circles where gravity affects both speed and required centripetal force. Key concepts: speeds vary (minimum at top, maximum at bottom), forces vary (minimum constraining force at top, maximum at bottom), and energy is conserved in conservative systems. Critical conditions: minimum speed at top $v_{top} = \\sqrt{rg}$ (where constraining force becomes zero), requiring minimum speed at bottom $v_{bottom} = \\sqrt{5rg}$ from energy conservation. Apparent weight varies from $N = mg + \\frac{mv^2}{r}$ at bottom to $N = \\frac{mv^2}{r} - mg$ at top. Analysis combines energy methods (for speeds) with force analysis (for constraining forces). Real applications include roller coasters, balls on strings, and buckets of water swung vertically."
