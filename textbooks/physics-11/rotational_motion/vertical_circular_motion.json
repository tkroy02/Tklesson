  "expanded_description": "This section analyzes circular motion in vertical planes, where gravity continuously affects the motion and forces vary with position. It covers minimum speed requirements, force variations, and energy considerations in vertical circles.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "In vertical circular motion, gravity acts tangentially to the path, causing the speed to vary with position. The net centripetal force is the vector sum of other forces (tension, normal force) and the radial component of gravity. Critical conditions occur at the top of the path where minimum speeds are required to maintain circular motion.",
    "explanation": "Unlike horizontal circular motion where speed can be constant, vertical circular motion inherently involves energy transformations between kinetic and potential energy. The forces providing centripetal acceleration vary dramatically with position, and there exist critical minimum speeds below which the object will leave its circular path."
