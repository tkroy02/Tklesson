  "expanded_description": "This section introduces rotational kinetic energy as the energy associated with rotational motion, establishing the relationship between moment of inertia, angular velocity, and kinetic energy. It connects rotational energy to work-energy principles and conservation of energy in rotational systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Rotational kinetic energy is the kinetic energy due to rotational motion, given by $K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$. This is the rotational analog of translational kinetic energy $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, with moment of inertia $I$ replacing mass $m$ and angular velocity $\\omega$ replacing linear velocity $v$.",
    "explanation": "Just as objects in linear motion possess kinetic energy, rotating objects possess rotational kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy of a rolling or rotating object is the sum of its translational and rotational components. This concept is crucial for analyzing energy conservation in systems involving rotation, from rolling objects to rotating machinery."

For objects undergoing both translation and rotation (like rolling objects), the total kinetic energy is $K_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$. The work-energy theorem extends to rotational motion as $W = \\tau\\Delta\\theta = \\Delta K_{rot}$. Energy conservation becomes a powerful tool for analyzing rotational systems, particularly rolling motion down inclines, where gravitational potential energy converts to both translational and rotational kinetic energy. The distribution between these forms depends on the object's moment of inertia, explaining why different shapes accelerate differently when rolling."
