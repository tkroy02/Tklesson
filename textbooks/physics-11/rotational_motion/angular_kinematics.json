  "summary": "Angular kinematics describes rotational motion using angular displacement ($\\theta$ in radians), angular velocity ($\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$ in rad/s), and angular acceleration ($\\alpha = \\frac{d\\omega}{dt}$ in rad/s²). The rotational kinematics equations for constant angular acceleration mirror linear kinematics: $\\omega_f = \\omega_i + \\alpha t$, $\\theta = \\omega_i t + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2$, $\\omega_f^2 = \\omega_i^2 + 2\\alpha\\theta$, and $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}(\\omega_i + \\omega_f)t$. For points on rotating objects: tangential velocity $v_t = r\\omega$, tangential acceleration $a_t = r\\alpha$, and centripetal acceleration $a_c = r\\omega^2 = \\frac{v_t^2}{r}$. The right-hand rule determines angular vector directions. In rigid body rotation, all points share the same angular motion but have different linear motions depending on their distance from the axis."
