  "summary": "Static equilibrium requires both $\\sum\\vec{F} = 0$ (no net force) and $\\sum\\vec{\\tau} = 0$ (no net torque) about any point. Problem-solving strategy: (1) draw complete free-body diagram, (2) choose coordinate system, (3) select pivot point strategically (often at unknown forces), (4) apply ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0, Στ=0, (5) solve system of equations. Stability depends on center of mass position relative to base of support - objects tip when the vertical through center of mass falls outside the base. Lower center of mass and wider base increase stability. Applications include structures, machines, furniture, and natural systems where balance is essential."
