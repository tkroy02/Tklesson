  "topic": "5.7 Static Equilibrium",
  "expanded_description": "This section applies the concepts of torque and force balance to analyze objects in static equilibrium - situations where objects are at rest with no net force and no net torque acting on them.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An object is in static equilibrium when it satisfies two conditions: (1) the net force on the object is zero ($\\sum \\vec{F} = 0$), and (2) the net torque about any point is zero ($\\sum \\tau = 0$). Both conditions must be satisfied for true static equilibrium.",
    "explanation": "Static equilibrium requires that an object has neither translational acceleration (net force = 0) nor rotational acceleration (net torque = 0). This dual condition allows us to solve for unknown forces and torques in complex systems like bridges, cranes, and human bodies maintaining balance."

  "summary": "Section 5.7 covers static equilibrium, which requires both net force equals zero ($\\sum \\vec{F} = 0$) and net torque equals zero ($\\sum \\tau = 0$) about any point. The problem-solving strategy involves: drawing a complete free-body diagram, applying force balance in both x and y directions, choosing a strategic pivot point for torque calculations, and solving the resulting system of equations. For uniform objects, the weight acts at the geometric center. Successful equilibrium analysis requires careful attention to force components, lever arms, and sign conventions, with the understanding that both translational and rotational equilibrium must be satisfied simultaneously."
