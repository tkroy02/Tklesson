  "summary": "The four rotational kinematic equations for constant angular acceleration are: (1) $\\omega_f = \\omega_i + \\alpha t$, (2) $\\Delta\\theta = \\omega_i t + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2$, (3) $\\omega_f^2 = \\omega_i^2 + 2\\alpha\\Delta\\theta$, (4) $\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}(\\omega_i + \\omega_f)t$. These exactly parallel linear kinematics equations with $\\theta \\leftrightarrow x$, $\\omega \\leftrightarrow v$, $\\alpha \\leftrightarrow a$. Problem-solving strategy involves identifying known variables and selecting the equation containing the single unknown. The time-independent equation ($\\omega_f^2 = \\omega_i^2 + 2\\alpha\\Delta\\theta$) is particularly useful when time is unknown. For rolling without slipping, $v_{CM} = r\\omega$ and $a_{CM} = r\\alpha$ connect rotational and translational motion. These equations provide complete description of rotational motion under constant angular acceleration and find applications in diverse mechanical systems."
