  "summary": "Rotational kinetic energy $K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$ represents energy stored in rotational motion, depending on both mass distribution (I) and rotation speed (ω). Energy conservation extends to rotational systems as $K_{trans} + K_{rot} + U = constant$. In rolling without slipping, potential energy partitions between translation and rotation based on moment of inertia. Work in rotation is $W = \\tau\\Delta\\theta$ and rotational power is $P = \\tau\\omega$. The rotational work-energy theorem states $W_{net} = \\Delta K_{rot}$. These concepts explain energy storage in flywheels, motion of rolling objects, and operation of rotating machinery, providing essential tools for analyzing energy transformations in rotational systems."
