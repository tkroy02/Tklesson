  "summary": "Linear and rotational motion are connected through the radius: arc length $s = r\\theta$, tangential velocity $v_t = r\\omega$, tangential acceleration $a_t = r\\alpha$, and centripetal acceleration $a_c = r\\omega^2 = \\frac{v_t^2}{r}$. Total acceleration is the vector sum of tangential and centripetal components. For rolling without slipping, $v_{CM} = r\\omega$ and $a_{CM} = r\\alpha$, with the contact point instantaneously at rest. These relationships only hold when angular quantities are in radians. Points farther from the rotation axis have greater linear speeds and accelerations for the same angular motion. Rolling motion combines translation of the center of mass with rotation about it, with the no-slip condition providing the crucial connection between linear and angular quantities."
