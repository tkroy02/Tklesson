  "expanded_description": "This section establishes the crucial relationships between linear motion quantities and rotational motion quantities. It connects the angular kinematics of a rotating object to the linear motion of points on that object.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, every point on the object has the same angular motion (angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration), but different linear motion depending on their distance from the axis of rotation. The linear quantities are related to angular quantities through the radius.",
    "explanation": "While angular quantities describe the rotation of the object as a whole, linear quantities describe the motion of specific points on the object. The further a point is from the axis of rotation, the greater its linear speed and acceleration for the same angular motion. This relationship is fundamental for understanding everything from wheels to planetary motion."

Linear quantities are proportional to the radius, with tangential speed and acceleration being directly proportional ($\\propto r$) and centripetal acceleration being proportional to radius for constant angular velocity."
