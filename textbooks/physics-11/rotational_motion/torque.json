  "expanded_description": "This section introduces torque as the rotational analog of force - the quantity that causes angular acceleration. It covers the calculation of torque, the moment arm concept, and the conditions for rotational equilibrium.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Torque ($\\tau$) is the rotational equivalent of force that causes objects to rotate about an axis. The magnitude of torque depends on both the applied force and its lever arm (perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of force). Torque is what causes changes in rotational motion, just as force causes changes in linear motion.",
    "explanation": "While force causes linear acceleration, torque causes angular acceleration. The effectiveness of a force at producing rotation depends not only on the magnitude of the force but also on where it's applied and at what angle. This is why doorknobs are placed far from hinges and wrenches have long handles - they increase the torque for the same applied force."

  "summary": "Section 5.6 introduces torque as the rotational analog of force that causes angular acceleration. Torque depends on three factors: the magnitude of the applied force, the distance from the pivot point where the force is applied, and the angle between the force vector and the radius vector. The three equivalent calculation methods are: $\\tau = rF\\sin\\theta$, $\\tau = Fd$ (lever arm method), and $\\tau = rF_{\\perp}$ (force components method). Torque follows a sign convention (counterclockwise positive, clockwise negative) and is measured in Newton-meters (N·m). Understanding torque is essential for analyzing rotational motion and will be fundamental for the upcoming sections on rotational dynamics and equilibrium."
