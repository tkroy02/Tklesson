  "summary": "Torque (τ) is the rotational analog of force, calculated as τ = rFsinθ = r⊥F = Fr⊥. It depends on force magnitude, application point, and direction relative to pivot. The right-hand rule determines torque direction. For rotational equilibrium, Στ = 0. For rotational dynamics, Στ = Iα (Newton's second law for rotation). Key principles: forces through pivot produce zero torque, strategic pivot selection simplifies equilibrium problems, and torque causes angular acceleration proportional to net torque and inversely proportional to moment of inertia. Torque units are Newton-meters (N·m), distinct from Joules despite same units, as torque is a vector (pseudovector) while energy is a scalar."
