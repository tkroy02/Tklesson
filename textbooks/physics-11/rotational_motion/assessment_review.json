  "summary": "Rotational motion mastery requires understanding systematic analogies with translation: F=ma ↔ τ=Iα, with moment of inertia I representing rotational mass. Key principles include: torque as rotational force (τ = rFsinθ), rotational kinetic energy (K_rot = ½Iω²), and conditions for equilibrium (ΣF=0, Στ=0). Problem-solving strategies involve: systematic approach selection, strategic pivot choice, dimensional analysis for error checking, and using multiple methods for verification. Common errors include lever arm miscalculation and incorrect moment of inertia application. Advanced applications synthesize these concepts in complex systems involving multiple rotating components, constraints, and coupled rotational-translational motion. This foundation prepares for advanced topics including angular momentum, rotational oscillations, and three-dimensional rotation."
