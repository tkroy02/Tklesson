  "summary": "Rotational dynamics extends Newton's laws to rotational motion: net torque causes angular acceleration according to τ_net = Iα. Moment of inertia I measures resistance to rotational acceleration and depends on mass distribution. Rotating objects possess kinetic energy K_rot = ½Iω², and work is done when torque acts through angular displacement. Many systems involve combined rotational and translational motion, which can be analyzed as center of mass translation plus rotation about the center. Rolling without slipping requires v_cm = rω and represents a special case where these motions are coupled. These principles explain diverse phenomena from rolling objects to spinning tops and form the basis for analyzing rotational systems in engineering and physics."
