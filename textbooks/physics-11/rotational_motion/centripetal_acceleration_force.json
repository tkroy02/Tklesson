  "topic": "5.4 Centripetal Acceleration and Force",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores the dynamics of uniform circular motion, focusing on centripetal acceleration and the centripetal force required to maintain circular motion. It connects kinematics to Newton's Second Law in rotational contexts.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An object moving in a circular path at constant speed experiences centripetal acceleration directed toward the center of the circle. This acceleration requires a net force—the centripetal force—that is also directed toward the center. Centripetal force is not a new type of force but rather the net inward force required for circular motion.",
    "explanation": "Centripetal acceleration arises from the continuous change in direction of velocity, even when speed is constant. According to Newton's Second Law, this acceleration requires a net force: $F_{net} = ma_c = m\\frac{v^2}{r} = mr\\omega^2$. This centripetal force can be provided by tension, gravity, friction, normal forces, or any combination thereof."

  "summary": "Section 5.4 establishes that uniform circular motion requires centripetal acceleration ($a_c = v^2/r = r\\omega^2$) directed toward the center of the circle. This acceleration necessitates a net centripetal force ($F_c = mv^2/r = mr\\omega^2$) provided by real forces such as tension, friction, normal force, or gravity. The key insights are: centripetal force is not a new force but the net inward force; centrifugal force is fictitious and appears only in rotating reference frames; and successful problem-solving requires identifying which real forces provide the necessary centripetal force and resolving them into radial components."
