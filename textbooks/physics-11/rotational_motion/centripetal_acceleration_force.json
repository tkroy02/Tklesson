  "summary": "Centripetal acceleration $a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} = r\\omega^2$ is always directed toward the center of circular motion and results from continuous direction change of velocity. Centripetal force $F_c = ma_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r} = mr\\omega^2$ is the net inward force required for circular motion, provided by real forces like tension, normal force, friction, or gravity. Key applications include: horizontal circles (ball on string, car turning), banked curves (optimal speed without friction), and vertical circles (varying forces and critical speeds). The minimum speed for complete vertical circles is $v_{top} = \\sqrt{rg}$. Energy conservation often complements force analysis in vertical circular motion. Centripetal force analysis follows: draw free-body diagram, identify inward force components, apply $\\sum F_{inward} = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$, and solve for unknowns."
