  "summary": "Speed and velocity are related but distinct concepts in kinematics. Speed is a scalar quantity that measures how fast an object is moving - the rate at which distance is covered. Average speed is total distance divided by total time. Instantaneous speed is what a speedometer shows at a given moment. Velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction - the rate of change of position. Average velocity is displacement divided by time interval; instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific instant. Key differences: velocity can be positive or negative based on direction; speed is always positive. Velocity changes when direction changes, even if speed is constant. Average velocity can be zero while average speed is positive (round trip). Speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity when direction isn't changing. Understanding these distinctions is essential for correctly applying kinematics equations and solving motion problems, as many formulas require velocity (vector) while others use speed (scalar). Common mistakes include confusing the terms, using distance instead of displacement for velocity calculations, and incorrectly averaging speeds without considering time spent at each speed."
