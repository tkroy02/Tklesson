  "summary": "The four kinematic equations describe motion with constant acceleration, relating initial velocity ($v_i$), final velocity ($v_f$), acceleration ($a$), time ($t$), and displacement ($\\Delta x$). Equation 1: $v_f = v_i + at$ (no $\\Delta x$). Equation 2: $\\Delta x = v_i t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$ (no $v_f$). Equation 3: $\\Delta x = \\left(\\frac{v_i + v_f}{2}\\right)t$ (no $a$). Equation 4: $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\\Delta x$ (no $t$). To choose the correct equation, list known and unknown variables, identify which variable is neither given nor needed, and select the equation that omits that variable. Proper sign convention must be established and consistently applied to all vector quantities. Common mistakes include selecting the wrong equation, sign errors, unit inconsistencies, and missing implied conditions like 'starts from rest' ($v_i = 0$) or 'comes to a stop' ($v_f = 0$). These equations are fundamental for solving motion problems and are derived from the definitions of acceleration and velocity combined with the constant acceleration assumption."
