  "summary": "Introduction to motion establishes the foundational concepts for kinematics. Motion is the change in position over time relative to a reference point. All motion is relative - there is no absolute frame of reference. A frame of reference includes a coordinate system (with an origin and sign convention) and a clock. In one-dimensional motion, we use a single axis (usually x) and assign positive and negative signs to indicate direction. The key quantities for describing motion are: position (x, where an object is located), time (t, when an observation is made), displacement ($\\Delta x = x_f - x_i$, change in position), velocity ($v_{avg} = \\Delta x/\\Delta t$, rate of change of position), and acceleration ($a_{avg} = \\Delta v/\\Delta t$, rate of change of velocity). Each quantity builds on the previous to give a complete description. Sign conventions must be established at the beginning of a problem and applied consistently to all vector quantities. Understanding these foundations is essential for analyzing motion quantitatively using graphs and equations in the following sections."
