  "summary": "Velocity-time graphs are essential tools for analyzing motion. They plot velocity on the y-axis against time on the x-axis. The slope of a v-t graph equals acceleration: $a = \\Delta v / \\Delta t$. A horizontal line means zero acceleration (constant velocity); a straight line with slope means constant acceleration; a curved line means changing acceleration. The area under a v-t graph (taking sign into account) equals displacement: $\\Delta x = \\text{area}$. Areas above the axis are positive displacement, below are negative. Common shapes: rectangle (constant v), triangle (constant a from rest), trapezoid (constant a with initial v). Relating v-t to x-t graphs: slope of x-t gives v, so v-t is the slope graph of x-t; conversely, the area under v-t gives change in x. Common mistakes include confusing slope (acceleration) with area (displacement), neglecting sign in area calculations, and misinterpreting a sloping line as constant velocity. Mastering v-t graphs is crucial for solving kinematics problems, especially when combined with the kinematic equations."
