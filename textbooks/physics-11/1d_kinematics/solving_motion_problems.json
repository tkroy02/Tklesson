  "summary": "Solving kinematics problems requires a systematic approach: read carefully, draw a diagram, list knowns and unknowns, establish a sign convention, select the appropriate kinematic equation (using the list‑and‑omit method), substitute with consistent units, and check the answer for reasonableness. Common problem types include free fall (constant acceleration $g$), braking/stopping distance ($v_f=0$), multi‑stage motion (different accelerations in different segments), and two‑object problems (equating positions to find meeting time). Worked examples illustrate each type. Frequent mistakes involve sign errors, unit inconsistencies, misidentifying implied values (like $v_i=0$ for 'dropped'), choosing the wrong equation, and algebraic slips. Mastering this problem‑solving strategy builds confidence and accuracy in applying kinematics to real‑world situations."
