The slope of an a-t graph represents jerk (rate of change of acceleration), which is rarely used in introductory physics. The most important feature is the area under the a-t graph, which equals the change in velocity ($\\Delta v$) over that time interval. For constant acceleration, the a-t graph is a horizontal line: above axis for positive a, on axis for zero a (constant velocity), below axis for negative a. Changing acceleration appears as sloping or curved lines. The area under a-t can be calculated using simple shapes (rectangles, triangles, trapezoids) and must be treated with sign: above axis positive, below negative. The a-t graph relates to v-t and x-t graphs: the slope of v-t gives a-t, and the area under a-t gives the change in v, which is used to construct v-t from initial velocity. Common mistakes include confusing slope (jerk) with area ($\\Delta v$), ignoring sign when calculating area, and misinterpreting a horizontal line as constant velocity instead of constant acceleration. Mastering a-t graphs completes the set of kinematics graphs and deepens understanding of motion."
