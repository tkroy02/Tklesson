A straight line indicates constant velocity (zero acceleration), with positive slope meaning motion in the positive direction, negative slope meaning motion in the negative direction, and zero slope (horizontal line) meaning the object is at rest. A curved line indicates changing velocity (acceleration). The steepness of the graph indicates speed: steeper means faster. Displacement between two times is found by subtracting the initial position from the final position read from the graph. Common mistakes include confusing the graph with the actual path of motion, misinterpreting negative slopes as slow motion, and calculating slope incorrectly. Mastering position-time graph interpretation is fundamental to understanding kinematics and prepares students for velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs."
