  "summary": "Unit 2: 1D Kinematics established the fundamental concepts and tools for analyzing motion along a straight line. We learned that motion is described relative to a reference frame with a consistent sign convention. Key quantities include position ($x$), displacement ($\\Delta x = x_f - x_i$), distance, speed (scalar), velocity ($\\vec{v} = \\Delta x/\\Delta t$, vector), and acceleration ($\\vec{a} = \\Delta v/\\Delta t$, vector). Graphs provide visual insight: position-time graphs give velocity as slope; velocity-time graphs give acceleration as slope and displacement as area; acceleration-time graphs give change in velocity as area. For constant acceleration, four kinematic equations relate the variables: $v_f = v_i + at$, $\\Delta x = v_i t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$, $\\Delta x = \\frac{v_i + v_f}{2}t$, and $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\\Delta x$. A systematic problem-solving strategy is essential: draw a diagram, establish sign convention, list knowns and unknowns, select the appropriate equation (omitting the unnecessary variable), substitute with consistent units, solve, and check for reasonableness. Special cases include free fall ($a = g = 9.8$ m/s² downward), braking to stop ($v_f = 0$), multi-stage motion (treat each segment separately), and two-object problems (equate position equations). Common mistakes include sign errors, confusing distance and displacement, misinterpreting graphs, choosing wrong equations, unit inconsistencies, and overlooking implied conditions. Mastering these foundations is essential for success in two-dimensional kinematics and dynamics."
