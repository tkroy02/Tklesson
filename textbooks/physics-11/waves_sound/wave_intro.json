  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the fundamental concept of waves, which are disturbances that transfer energy from one location to another without transferring matter. Waves are ubiquitous in nature and technology, from ripples on a pond to sound waves carrying voice, light waves enabling vision, and seismic waves traveling through Earth. Understanding waves is essential for comprehending sound, light, and many other physical phenomena.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A wave is a disturbance that propagates through space and time, typically transferring energy from one point to another without the permanent displacement of the medium itself. Waves are characterized by their ability to carry energy and information over distances, and they exhibit fundamental behaviors such as reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction.",
    "explanation": "Waves can be classified by the direction of particle motion relative to wave propagation (transverse vs. longitudinal) and by whether they require a medium (mechanical waves) or can travel through vacuum (electromagnetic waves). Regardless of type, all waves share common properties: they have a source of disturbance, they propagate through a medium (or field), and they transfer energy. The study of waves provides a unified framework for understanding diverse phenomena from music to optics to earthquakes.",

      "introduction": "When you drop a stone into a calm pond, ripples spread outward in concentric circles. If you speak, sound travels through the air to a listener's ear. These are both examples of waves – disturbances that carry energy from one place to another.",
      "key_concept": {
        "definition": "A wave is a disturbance that travels through space and time, transferring energy from its source to surrounding locations without the net transport of matter. The material through which a wave travels is called the medium (for mechanical waves).",
        "context": "Waves are all around us: light waves allow us to see, sound waves let us hear, radio waves carry communications, and seismic waves reveal Earth's interior. Understanding waves is fundamental to physics, engineering, and many other sciences."

          "statement": "Waves transport energy from one location to another, but the particles of the medium (for mechanical waves) do not undergo net displacement; they oscillate around their equilibrium positions.",
          "application": "This explains why a floating cork bobs up and down when waves pass, but does not move outward with the waves. The energy travels outward, but the water molecules themselves mostly move in circles or up and down.",

          "application": "Sound waves need air, water, or solids to travel – there is no sound in the vacuum of space. Light, however, can travel through the empty space between stars.",
          "example": "A speaker vibrating creates compressions and rarefactions in air, producing sound waves. A vibrating charged particle creates electromagnetic waves that can travel through space."

          "application": "These behaviors allow us to control and use waves in countless technologies, from mirrors and lenses to musical instruments and antennas.",

Waves are classified as mechanical (requiring a medium) or electromagnetic (not requiring a medium). They can be pulses (single disturbances) or periodic (continuous repeating patterns). The particles of the medium oscillate around equilibrium positions but do not travel with the wave. Waves exhibit common behaviors such as reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction. Understanding the basic nature of waves – energy transfer without matter transport – is essential for studying specific wave types and their properties in the following sections."
