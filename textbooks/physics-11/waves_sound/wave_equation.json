  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the wave equation, a fundamental relationship that connects the speed, frequency, and wavelength of any wave. The equation $v = f\\lambda$ (and its equivalent form $v = \\lambda/T$) applies to all types of waves, from sound and water waves to light and other electromagnetic waves. Understanding this relationship is essential for analyzing wave behavior and solving problems involving wave properties.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The wave equation states that the speed of a wave ($v$) equals the product of its frequency ($f$) and wavelength ($\\lambda$): $v = f\\lambda$. Since frequency and period are related by $f = 1/T$, an equivalent form is $v = \\frac{\\lambda}{T}$. This equation is universal and applies to all waves, regardless of type.",
    "explanation": "The wave equation arises from the fundamental definition of wave speed: the distance a wave travels per unit time. In one period $T$, a wave moves forward by one wavelength $\\lambda$. Since speed = distance/time, $v = \\lambda/T = f\\lambda$. This simple relationship allows us to calculate any one of the three quantities if the other two are known. It also reveals that for waves traveling at a constant speed, frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional: higher frequency means shorter wavelength, and vice versa.",

It is derived from the fact that in one period, a wave travels one wavelength. The equation can be rearranged to solve for any of the three variables: $f = v/\\lambda$ or $\\lambda = v/f$. For waves traveling at constant speed, frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional. When a wave moves from one medium to another, its frequency remains constant (determined by the source), but its speed and wavelength change according to the new medium's properties. Wave speed itself depends on the medium and wave type: for strings, $v = \\sqrt{F_T/\\mu}$; for sound in air, $v \\approx 331 + 0.6T$ m/s; for light, $v = c/n$ where $n$ is the refractive index. Common mistakes include using the wrong speed for the wave type, unit conversion errors, forgetting that frequency stays constant across media, and misremembering the equation. Mastering the wave equation is essential for understanding wave behavior in all areas of physics."
