  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the two primary types of mechanical waves: transverse and longitudinal. These classifications are based on the direction of particle oscillation relative to the direction of wave propagation. Understanding this distinction is fundamental to describing how different waves behave in various media and is essential for analyzing sound, light, and other wave phenomena.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Mechanical waves are classified by the direction of particle motion relative to the wave's direction of travel. In transverse waves, particles oscillate perpendicular to the wave velocity. In longitudinal waves, particles oscillate parallel to the wave velocity. Some waves, such as water waves, exhibit a combination of both motions.",
    "explanation": "The distinction between transverse and longitudinal waves arises from how the medium responds to the disturbance. In transverse waves, the medium is sheared, creating crests and troughs. In longitudinal waves, the medium is compressed and rarefied, creating compressions and rarefactions. This classification helps predict how waves will interact with boundaries and how they transfer energy through different materials.",

Transverse waves involve shear forces and typically occur in solids (and on liquid surfaces), while longitudinal waves involve compression and expansion and can occur in solids, liquids, and gases.

Some waves, like deep water waves and seismic surface waves, exhibit mixed motion with both transverse and longitudinal components. Understanding this classification is essential for analyzing wave behavior, medium requirements, and energy transfer mechanisms.
