  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review of all topics covered in Unit 8: Waves and Sound. It synthesizes the key concepts of wave types, wave properties, the wave equation, wave interference, reflection and refraction, sound waves, the Doppler effect, and resonance. Mastering these interconnected ideas is essential for understanding how waves transfer energy and information, and how they behave in various media and situations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Waves are disturbances that transfer energy without transferring matter. They are characterized by amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and speed, related by the wave equation $v = f\\lambda$. Waves can be transverse (particle motion perpendicular to wave direction) or longitudinal (particle motion parallel). All waves exhibit reflection, refraction, interference, and the Doppler effect. Sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave whose pitch is determined by frequency and loudness by amplitude. Resonance occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency, leading to large amplitude oscillations.",
    "explanation": "Unit 8 builds a complete framework for understanding waves, from the basic classification of wave types to the complex behaviors of interference and resonance. We learned that wave speed depends on the medium, while frequency is determined by the source. The wave equation connects these properties. Sound waves share all wave behaviors and have the additional perceptual dimensions of pitch and loudness. The Doppler effect explains frequency shifts due to relative motion, and resonance explains why certain frequencies produce dramatic effects. These concepts apply across physics, from acoustics to optics to quantum mechanics.",

  "summary": "Unit 8: Waves and Sound established the fundamental concepts for understanding wave phenomena. Waves transfer energy without transferring matter and are characterized by amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and speed, related by $v = f\\lambda$. Waves are classified as transverse (particle motion perpendicular) or longitudinal (parallel). All waves exhibit reflection, refraction, interference, and the Doppler effect. Sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave whose speed depends on the medium and temperature; pitch is determined by frequency, loudness by amplitude. The Doppler effect describes frequency changes due to relative motion, with formulas $f' = f v/(v \\mp v_s)$ for moving source and $f' = f (v \\pm v_o)/v$ for moving observer. Resonance occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency, leading to large amplitude oscillations; natural frequencies depend on system parameters (pendulum: $f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{g/L}$, mass-spring: $f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{k/m}$). Common mistakes include confusing wave properties, misapplying interference conditions, sign errors in Doppler formulas, and misunderstanding resonance. Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding optics, acoustics, and advanced wave phenomena."
