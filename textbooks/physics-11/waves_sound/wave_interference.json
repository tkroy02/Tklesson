  "expanded_description": "This section introduces wave interference, a phenomenon that occurs when two or more waves overlap in the same region of space. When waves combine, they superpose according to the principle of superposition, resulting in a new wave whose displacement is the sum of the individual displacements. Interference can be constructive (waves reinforce each other) or destructive (waves cancel each other). This fundamental behavior is observed in all types of waves, from water ripples and sound to light and quantum particles.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement at any point is the sum of the displacements of the individual waves. This leads to interference: constructive interference occurs when waves are in phase (crests align with crests), increasing amplitude; destructive interference occurs when waves are out of phase (crests align with troughs), decreasing or canceling amplitude.",
    "explanation": "Wave interference is a consequence of the linear nature of wave equations. When waves meet, they pass through each other unaffected, and their effects add algebraically. This explains phenomena such as the patterns formed by ripples in a pond, the beats produced by two close musical notes, the colorful patterns in soap bubbles (thin‑film interference), and the alternating bright and dark fringes in double‑slit experiments with light. Understanding interference is essential for fields ranging from acoustics to optics to quantum mechanics.",

Constructive interference happens when waves are in phase (crest aligns with crest), resulting in increased amplitude. Destructive interference happens when waves are out of phase (crest aligns with trough), resulting in decreased or canceled amplitude. For complete cancellation, waves must have equal amplitudes and opposite phase. Stable interference patterns require coherent sources (same frequency, constant phase difference). Interference is observed in all types of waves – water waves, sound waves, light waves – and has numerous applications, from noise‑canceling headphones to interferometers and anti‑reflection coatings. Common mistakes include assuming all overlap produces cancellation, confusing path difference with phase difference, forgetting the need for coherence, and misinterpreting energy conservation in interference."
