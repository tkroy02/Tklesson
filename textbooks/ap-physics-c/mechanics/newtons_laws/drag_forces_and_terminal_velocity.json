  "summary": "Drag forces and terminal velocity analysis provide crucial understanding of motion in resistive media across scales from microscopic particles to spacecraft. Different drag regimes (linear vs. quadratic) apply based on Reynolds number, with distinct mathematical treatments and physical behaviors. Terminal velocity represents dynamic equilibrium between driving and resistive forces, approached with characteristic time scales. Advanced applications involve energy dissipation, thermal effects, optimal trajectories, and complex systems with variable parameters. These concepts find application across engineering, environmental science, sports, and medicine, demonstrating the fundamental importance of velocity-dependent forces in understanding and designing systems that move through fluids. Mastery of drag analysis enables prediction and optimization of diverse phenomena from raindrop formation to spacecraft re-entry."
