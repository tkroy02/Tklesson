Contact Force Analysis: Normal force: perpendicular to surface; Friction: parallel to surface, opposes motion; Multiple contacts require separate analysis.

Spring Forces: Hooke's Law: F = -kΔx; Always along spring axis; Compression or extension. Fluid Forces: Drag: opposes motion; Lift: perpendicular to motion; Buoyancy: upward in fluids. Constraint Forces: Prevent certain motions; Directions determined by constraint geometry; Examples: hinge forces, roller supports. Fictitious Forces: Centrifugal: outward in rotating frames; Coriolis: velocity-dependent; Euler: angular acceleration. Systematic Approach: 1. Isolate each body; 2. Identify all interactions; 3.

Identify all internal (interaction) forces; 4. Apply Newton's Third Law to interaction pairs; 5. Write equations for each body; 6. Add constraint equations; 7. Solve complete system. Constraint Types: Rope constraints: constant length → acceleration relationships; Contact constraints: no interpenetration → normal forces; Pivot constraints: fixed point → support forces; Rolling constraints: no slip → v = ωR. Newton's Third Law Applications: Action-reaction pairs equal and opposite; Internal forces cancel in system analysis; Must be consistent across interfaces. Pulley Systems: Massless pulleys: tension constant; Massive pulleys: tension difference, rotational dynamics; Multiple pulleys: multiple constraints. Stacked Objects: Normal forces between surfaces; Friction forces at interfaces; Possible relative motion; Maximum friction limits. Mechanical Linkages: Rigid links: fixed distances; Pivots: moment constraints; Sliders: guided motion; Complex geometry relationships. Solution Strategy: 1. Count degrees of freedom; 2. Choose generalized coordinates; 3. Write constraint equations; 4. Draw FBD for each body; 5. Write motion equations; 6. Solve system; 7. Check physical reasonableness.

  "summary": "Advanced free body diagram techniques provide systematic approaches for analyzing complex force systems. Methodical force identification ensures all interactions are properly accounted for, including contact forces, field forces, constraints, and fictitious forces. Strategic coordinate system selection dramatically simplifies analysis by aligning with natural motion directions and system geometry. Multi-body systems require careful isolation of each component while maintaining consistency through constraint equations and Newton's Third Law pairs. These advanced techniques enable accurate modeling of real-world systems from mechanical linkages to structural frameworks, providing the foundation for solving complex dynamics problems across engineering, physics, and technology applications. Mastery of these methods is essential for progressing to more advanced topics in mechanics and applied physics."
