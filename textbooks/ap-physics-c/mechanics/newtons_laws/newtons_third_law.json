The reaction force is the force that the first object exerts back on that second object. Common Pair Types: Contact forces: hand pushes wall/wall pushes hand; Tension: rope pulls object/object pulls rope; Normal force: surface pushes object/object pushes surface; Friction: surface drags object/object drags surface; Gravitational: Earth pulls object/object pulls Earth. Complex System Challenges: Multiple interaction points; Internal forces within systems; Distributed forces over areas; Field forces acting at distance; Constraint forces in mechanisms. Verification Methods: Check that pairs act on different objects; Verify equal magnitude and opposite direction; Confirm same force type; Ensure consistency across system boundaries. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1. Define clear system boundaries; 2. Identify all interaction points; 3. List all action-reaction pairs; 4. Apply to free-body diagrams; 5.
