Compare with maximum static friction; 4. If f_required ≤ μ_sN, assumption valid; 5. If f_required > μ_sN, recalculate with slip.

  "summary": "Basic applications of F=ma provide the foundation for solving fundamental dynamics problems. Inclined plane analysis demonstrates the importance of proper force resolution and coordinate system selection. Pulley systems introduce constraint equations that relate the motions of connected objects. Friction applications require careful analysis of static and kinetic regimes, with special attention to transition conditions. Connected object problems develop skills in solving systems of equations and analyzing interaction forces. These basic applications establish essential problem-solving frameworks that will be extended to more complex scenarios in subsequent units. Mastery of these fundamental techniques is crucial for success in advanced mechanics and engineering applications."
