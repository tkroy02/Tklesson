Multiple critical point analysis enables prediction of failure modes in complex systems with several potential slipping surfaces. Velocity-dependent models like Stribeck friction capture the transition from static to kinetic friction and the effects of lubrication. Rotational friction analysis combines torque equations with energy methods to predict performance and thermal effects in bearings, brakes, and other rotating systems. Energy methods provide powerful tools for analyzing work, power dissipation, and thermal consequences of friction. These advanced techniques are essential for accurate modeling of real engineering systems, from automotive brakes to industrial machinery, where friction plays a critical role in performance, efficiency, and safety."
