Uniformly Accelerating Frames: a_rel = a_inertial - a_frame; Simple shift in effective gravity; Useful for elevator problems, accelerating vehicles. Rotating Frames: Centrifugal force: mω²r outward; Coriolis force: -2mω × v_rel; Zero for stationary objects; Causes rightward deflection in NH. Effective Gravity: g_eff = g - a_frame - ω × (ω × r); Combines real gravity, frame acceleration, centrifugal; Vertical redefined along g_eff. Earth's Rotation Effects: Centrifugal: reduces g, bulges Earth; Coriolis: deflects projectiles, winds, currents; Significant for long-range artillery, weather. Applications: Weather systems on rotating Earth; Foucault pendulum; Artificial gravity in rotating spacecraft; Centrifuges; Accelerometer interpretation. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1. Choose most convenient frame; 2. Include all fictitious forces; 3. Solve as in inertial frame; 4. Transform back if needed; 5. Verify with inertial frame calculation.",

  "summary": "Complex applications of F=ma extend Newton's Second Law to sophisticated scenarios involving multiple interconnected bodies, variable mass systems, and non-inertial reference frames. Multi-body systems require careful constraint analysis and solution of coupled equations. Variable mass problems demand momentum-based approaches rather than direct application of F=ma. Non-inertial frames introduce fictitious forces that simplify analysis of complex motion patterns when chosen strategically. These advanced techniques enable accurate modeling of real-world systems from rocket propulsion to weather patterns, demonstrating the power and versatility of Newtonian mechanics when combined with appropriate mathematical frameworks. Mastery of these concepts provides the foundation for advanced studies in dynamics, aerospace engineering, and mechanical system design."
