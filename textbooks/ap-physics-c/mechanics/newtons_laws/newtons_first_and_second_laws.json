Dynamic Equilibrium: Constant velocity: a = 0 but v ≠ 0; Net force zero but motion exists; Terminal velocity situations. Force Types in Equilibrium: Gravitational forces (weight); Normal forces; Tension forces; Frictional forces (static friction); Spring forces; Applied forces. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1.

  "summary": "The calculus formulation of Newton's laws provides a powerful framework for analyzing dynamics. Newton's First Law establishes the conditions for equilibrium, both static and dynamic, through the requirement of zero net force. Newton's Second Law, expressed as F=ma=m(d²x/dt²), becomes a differential equation that can be solved through integration to determine velocity and position functions. Constant forces yield simple polynomial solutions, while time-dependent, position-dependent, and velocity-dependent forces require more sophisticated techniques including separation of variables. Successful application requires systematic problem-solving approaches, proper handling of initial conditions, and verification through methods like dimensional analysis and limiting cases. These techniques enable analysis of diverse physical systems from spring-mass oscillators to objects with air resistance, demonstrating the universal applicability of Newton's laws when combined with calculus methods."
