  "summary": "Advanced circular dynamics extends centripetal force concepts to complex scenarios including non-uniform motion with tangential acceleration, analysis in rotating reference frames with fictitious forces, and applications to orbital mechanics. Non-uniform circular motion requires considering both radial and tangential force components. Rotating frames introduce centrifugal and Coriolis forces that simplify analysis of complex motion patterns. Orbital mechanics applies circular motion principles to gravitational systems, enabling calculation of satellite orbits, orbital transfers, and celestial motion. These advanced concepts find application across aerospace engineering, mechanical design, geophysics, and technology development, demonstrating the power and versatility of circular motion analysis when extended beyond basic uniform rotation."
