The fundamental relationship $W_{nc} = \\Delta E_{mech}$ extends energy methods to systems with friction, drag, and other dissipative effects. Velocity-dependent forces require integration and power analysis, with terminal velocity representing balanced force conditions. Efficiency calculations $\\eta = useful output/input$ quantify system performance and identify optimization opportunities. These advanced energy methods enable engineers and physicists to design more efficient systems, reduce energy consumption, and understand complex energy transformations in practical applications across transportation, manufacturing, energy systems, and technology development."
