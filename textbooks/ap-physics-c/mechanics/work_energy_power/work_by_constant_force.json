  "summary": "Work by constant forces provides the foundation for understanding energy transfer in mechanical systems. The fundamental definition $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{d} = Fd\\cos\\theta$ quantifies energy transfer when forces cause displacement. Different force orientations produce different amounts of work, with parallel forces doing maximum work and perpendicular forces doing zero work. Conservative forces like gravity exhibit path-independent work, while non-conservative forces like friction show path dependence. This conceptual framework enables analysis of energy transformations in diverse physical systems from simple lifts to complex machinery."
