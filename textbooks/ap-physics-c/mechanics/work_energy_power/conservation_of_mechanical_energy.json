  "summary": "Advanced mechanical energy conservation provides powerful analytical tools for complex systems involving multiple energy forms, constraints, and non-conservative forces. The extension to rotational kinetic energy $K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$ enables analysis of rolling and rotating systems. Constrained motion problems are efficiently solved using generalized coordinates that automatically satisfy geometric constraints. For real systems with non-conservative forces, the work-energy theorem $W_{nc} = \\Delta E_{mechanical}$ provides the fundamental energy balance equation. These advanced energy methods offer efficient alternatives to Newtonian approaches, particularly for systems with complex constraints or where detailed force analysis is difficult, making them essential tools across engineering, physics, and technology applications."
