  "summary": "Work by variable forces extends the fundamental work concept to realistic situations where forces change with position. The integral formulation $W = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x)  dx$ provides both a mathematical tool for calculation and a geometric interpretation as area under the force-position curve. Spring forces exemplify linear variable forces, leading to elastic potential energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Inverse-square and other force laws demonstrate the generality of the approach. The work-energy theorem remains valid for variable forces, connecting work calculations to kinetic energy changes. This mathematical framework enables analysis of diverse physical systems from microscopic molecular interactions to macroscopic astronomical motions."
