General gravitational potential $U = -\\frac{GMm}{r}$ enables analysis of celestial mechanics, orbital transfers, and escape conditions. Complex elastic systems involving series, parallel, and non-linear spring arrangements require sophisticated equivalent spring analysis and energy distribution calculations. Multi-domain energy transformations demonstrate the power of energy conservation methods for solving complex real-world problems across engineering, aerospace, and physics applications. These advanced techniques provide essential tools for analyzing everything from satellite missions to earthquake-resistant structures, demonstrating the universal applicability of energy principles."
