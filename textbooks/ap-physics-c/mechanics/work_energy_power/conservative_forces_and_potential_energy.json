Derivation: From work-energy theorem: $W = \\Delta K$; For conservative forces: $W = -\\Delta U$; Combining: $\\Delta K = -\\Delta U$ or $\\Delta K + \\Delta U = 0$. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1. Identify all forces as conservative or non-conservative; 2. Write initial total energy: $E_i = K_i + U_i$; 3. Write final total energy: $E_f = K_f + U_f$; 4. Set $E_i = E_f$ and solve for unknown; 5. For non-conservative forces: $W_{nc} = \\Delta E_{mechanical}$. Applications: Spring systems: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = constant$; Gravitational systems: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh = constant$; Orbital motion: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} = constant$; Pendulums: $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgl(1-\\cos\\theta) = constant$. Advantages: Often simpler than Newton's laws; Provides direct velocity-position relationships; Handles complex paths easily; Reveals turning points and bounds. Potential Energy Diagrams: U(x) vs x plots; Force: $F = -dU/dx$; Turning points where K=0; Stable equilibria at minima; Unstable equilibria at maxima.",

  "summary": "Conservative forces and potential energy provide a powerful framework for analyzing mechanical systems through energy methods. The defining property of path independence allows the definition of potential energy functions, with the fundamental relationship $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$ connecting forces to potential energy landscapes. Energy conservation $K + U = constant$ for conservative systems offers efficient problem-solving approaches, often simpler than direct application of Newton's laws. This conceptual framework extends from simple spring-mass systems to complex orbital mechanics, revealing deep connections between force, energy, and motion while providing practical tools for analyzing diverse physical phenomena across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines."
