  "summary": "The work-kinetic energy theorem $W_{net} = \\Delta K$ provides a fundamental and powerful relationship between forces and motion. Derived rigorously from Newton's second law using calculus, this theorem applies universally to all force types—constant or variable, conservative or non-conservative. Its scalar nature often simplifies problem-solving compared to vector-based Newtonian approaches. The theorem extends to curved paths through line integrals and connects deeply to energy conservation principles. While primarily applied to translational motion of particles, its conceptual framework underpins more advanced treatments including rotational dynamics and relativistic mechanics. This theorem remains one of the most versatile and frequently used tools in mechanical analysis across physics and engineering disciplines."
