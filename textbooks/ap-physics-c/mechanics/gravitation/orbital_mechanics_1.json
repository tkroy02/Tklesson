  "summary": "Circular orbital mechanics provides the foundation for understanding satellite motion, planetary systems, and celestial dynamics. Through force-balance analysis, energy relationships, and Kepler's laws, we establish precise mathematical descriptions of circular orbits that enable practical calculations for satellite operations, orbital transfers, and multi-body systems. The energy perspective reveals fundamental relationships through the virial theorem and enables efficient analysis of orbital changes, while applications to satellite constellations and binary systems demonstrate the scalability of these principles. Circular orbits serve as essential reference cases for understanding more complex elliptical orbits and provide the working framework for most artificial satellite systems, making this foundation critical for both theoretical understanding and practical space operations."
