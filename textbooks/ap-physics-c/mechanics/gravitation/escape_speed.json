Relationship with Circular Orbit: $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{2} \\, v_{circ}$; Escape speed is √2 times circular orbital speed; From circular orbit: additional $\\Delta v = (\\sqrt{2}-1)v_{circ}$ needed.

Multi-stage Escape: Staged approach from surface to orbit to escape; More efficient than direct ascent; Uses existing orbital energy; Practical for space missions. Direction Considerations: Horizontal launch most efficient; Uses planetary rotation if eastward; Vertical escape possible but less efficient; Same minimum speed required.
