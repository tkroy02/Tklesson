Potential-Potential Energy Relationship: U = mV for test mass m; For system of masses: U = ½Σ m_i V_i (factor ½ avoids double-counting). Potential from Extended Masses: V = -G∫(dm/r) for continuous distribution; Must integrate over all mass elements. Potential-Field Relationship: $\\vec{g} = -\\nabla V$; Field is negative gradient of potential; Equipotential surfaces: V = constant, $\\vec{g}$ perpendicular to these surfaces. Superposition Principle: V_total = Σ V_i for multiple sources; Scalar addition (simpler than vector field addition). Special Cases: Spherical shell: Outside: V = -GM/r; Inside: V = -GM/R constant; Solid sphere: Outside: V = -GM/r; Inside: V = -GM(3R² - r²)/2R³. Equipotential Surfaces: Surfaces where V = constant; No work done moving along equipotential; Field lines perpendicular to equipotentials; Spacing indicates field strength.

  "summary": "Gravitational potential energy provides a powerful framework for analyzing energy relationships in gravitational systems, from simple two-body problems to complex orbital mechanics. Through the general form U = -GMm/r, energy conservation principles, escape velocity calculations, and the connection between potential energy and gravitational potential, we develop comprehensive tools for solving diverse gravitational problems. This energy-based approach reveals fundamental relationships in orbital motion, enables efficient calculation of work requirements for space missions, and provides deep physical insight into gravitational binding and system stability. The scalar nature of potential energy simplifies complex multi-body calculations, while the connection between potential and field through gradient operations unifies force-based and energy-based descriptions of gravitation, completing our fundamental toolkit for gravitational analysis."
