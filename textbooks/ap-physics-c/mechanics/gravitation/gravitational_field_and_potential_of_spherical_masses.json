Mathematical Foundations: Geometric proof using similar triangles; Calculus proof via integration; Symmetry arguments: spherical symmetry → radial field only. Proof Methods: Geometric: cone method showing cancellation; Calculus: integrate over spherical coordinates; Vector: symmetry → field must be radial. Consequences for Solid Spheres: Uniform density sphere: Outside: g = GM/r²; Inside: g = (GM/R³)r linear with r; General sphere: g = GM_enc(r)/r². Gravitational Potential: Shell: Outside: V = -GM/r; Inside: V = -GM/R constant; Solid sphere: Outside: V = -GM/r; Inside: V = -GM(3R²-r²)/2R³. Gauss's Law for Gravity: ∮g·dA = -4πGM_enc; Analogous to Gauss's law in electrostatics; Powerful for symmetric distributions.

  "summary": "The study of gravitational fields and potentials for spherical masses represents a cornerstone of classical gravitation, providing powerful analytical tools through the shell theorem, integration methods, and Gauss's Law. These techniques enable calculation of gravitational effects for everything from uniform spheres to complex layered structures with non-uniform densities, revealing fundamental insights into planetary interiors, geophysical phenomena, and celestial mechanics. The shell theorem's elegant simplifications, combined with rigorous integration methods and the power of Gauss's Law, create a comprehensive framework for understanding and calculating gravitational behavior in spherically symmetric systems. These principles continue to find vital applications in modern science and technology, from mapping Earth's interior to planning interplanetary missions, demonstrating the enduring power and utility of classical gravitational theory in our ongoing exploration of the physical world."
