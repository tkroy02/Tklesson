Calculation Methods: Moment arm method: τ = r⊥F where r⊥ is perpendicular distance from axis to force line; Vector method: τ = r × F (cross product); Component method: τ = r_xF_y - r_yF_x in 2D; Magnitude: τ = rFsinθ where θ is angle between r and F. Sign Convention: Positive for counterclockwise rotation; Negative for clockwise rotation; Right-hand rule for 3D: thumb along axis, fingers show rotation direction. Key Relationships: Maximum torque when force perpendicular to r (θ=90°); Zero torque when force parallel to r (θ=0° or 180°); Force through axis produces zero torque. Multiple Forces: Net torque τ_net = Στ_i; Forces can cancel or reinforce; Must use same axis for all calculations. Real-World Considerations: Applied force vs reaction forces; Friction torques; Distributed forces; Variable forces. Problem-Solving Approach: 1. Identify rotation axis; 2. For each force, find r and θ; 3. Calculate individual torques; 4. Sum for net torque; 5. Apply τ_net = Iα if needed.",

Use τ = Iα about CM and F=ma for CM; 2. Use τ = Iα about instantaneous center of rotation. Rotational Oscillations: Systems with restoring torque: τ = -κθ (torsional pendulum); Equation: Iα = -κθ → d²θ/dt² + (κ/I)θ = 0; Solution: θ(t) = θ_maxcos(ωt + φ) with ω = √(κ/I); Period: T = 2π√(I/κ). Three-Dimensional Torque: Vector nature crucial: τ = r × F; Direction perpendicular to both r and F; Components: τ_x, τ_y, τ_z; Multiple axes may rotate simultaneously. Energy Methods: Rotational kinetic energy: KE_rot = ½Iω²; Work: W = ∫τdθ; Power: P = τ·ω; Conservation of energy when only conservative forces. Problem-Solving Strategy: Systematic approach: 1. Identify all rotating components; 2. Choose appropriate reference frame; 3. Apply τ = Iα for each component; 4. Include constraint equations; 5. Solve system of equations; 6. Verify with energy or alternative method. Complex Constraints: Multiple connected objects; Rolling with slipping/without slipping; Gear systems; Belt and pulley systems; Requires careful kinematic relationships. Verification Techniques: Check units consistently; Examine limiting cases; Use multiple solution methods; Verify energy conservation when appropriate; Check physical reasonableness.",

  "summary": "Torque and rotational dynamics provide the fundamental framework for understanding and analyzing rotational motion, with τ = Iα serving as the rotational equivalent of Newton's Second Law. This comprehensive approach enables solving problems ranging from simple torque calculations to complex systems involving rolling motion, rotational oscillations, and combined translational-rotational dynamics. Through systematic problem-solving strategies, energy methods, and careful application of constraint equations, we can analyze real-world rotational systems across engineering, physics, and technology applications. The deep analogy between linear and rotational dynamics, with torque corresponding to force, moment of inertia to mass, and angular acceleration to linear acceleration, provides a powerful unified framework for mechanical analysis that forms the foundation for advanced topics in rotational motion."
