Central Forces: Forces directed along r (F ∥ r); Then τ = r × F = 0; Angular momentum conserved; Examples: gravity, electrostatic forces. Implications: Constant direction of L means motion confined to plane perpendicular to L; Areal velocity constant (Kepler's second law). Problem-Solving Applications: Use conservation when τ = 0; Use τ = dL/dt when torques present; Can integrate to find ΔL = ∫τ dt.

Orbital Mechanics: Planets, satellites, charged particles; Motion confined to plane perpendicular to L; Kepler's second law: equal areas in equal times; Orbital parameters related to L.

Multi-Particle Systems: Total angular momentum L_total = ΣL_i; Conserved if net external torque = 0; Internal forces between particles cancel in pairs. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1. Identify reference point; 2. Check if τ_net = 0; 3. Write L_initial = L_final; 4. Include other conservation laws; 5. Solve system of equations; 6. Verify physical reasonableness.

  "summary": "Angular momentum of a particle, defined as L = r × p, provides a fundamental quantity that describes rotational motion about a point, serving as the rotational analog of linear momentum. Through the relationship τ = dL/dt, angular momentum connects to torque in the same way linear momentum connects to force, establishing powerful conservation principles when net torque is zero. These conservation laws enable elegant solutions to complex problems in orbital mechanics, particle collisions, and symmetric systems, often providing simpler approaches than force-based analysis. The vector nature of angular momentum, with direction given by the right-hand rule and dependence on the choice of reference point, requires careful application but yields deep insights into rotational dynamics across scales from atomic systems to astrophysical phenomena."
