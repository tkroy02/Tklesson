          "statement": "Moment of inertia represents rotational inertia with specific mathematical and physical properties: Physical Meaning: Rotational analog of mass; Quantifies resistance to angular acceleration; Determines how much torque is needed for given α; Depends on mass distribution, not just total mass. Mathematical Definition: Discrete systems: I = Σmᵢrᵢ² where rᵢ is perpendicular distance to axis; Continuous systems: I = ∫r²dm = ∫r²ρdV; For 1D: dm = λdx; For 2D: dm = σdA; For 3D: dm = ρdV. Dependence on Axis: Same object has different I about different axes; Mass farther from axis contributes more to I; Minimum I about axis through CM. Comparison with Mass: Mass measures resistance to linear acceleration (F = ma); Moment of inertia measures resistance to angular acceleration (τ = Iα); Both are inertial properties. Physical Significance: Objects with mass concentrated near axis rotate easily; Objects with mass far from axis resist rotational acceleration; Explains why figure skaters spin faster when pulling arms in. Common Examples: Hoop: all mass at maximum distance → high I; Solid disk: mass distributed → moderate I; Solid sphere: mass concentrated → lower I; Rod about center vs end. Dimensional Analysis: I has units kg·m²; Consistent with τ = Iα (N·m = kg·m²·rad/s²).",

Perpendicular Axis Theorem (for planar objects): Statement: I_z = I_x + I_y for thin objects in xy-plane; Valid only for infinitesimally thin objects; Applications: Relating moments about perpendicular axes in plane. Composite Objects: Additive Method: For objects made of multiple parts: I_total = ΣI_i; Each I_i about same axis; Must use parallel axis theorem if parts' CM not on axis. Subtractive Method: For objects with holes or cutouts: I = I_solid - I_hole; Hole treated as negative mass; Use parallel axis if hole axis different. Procedure for Composite Objects: 1. Identify all component parts; 2. Calculate I for each part about desired axis; 3. Use parallel axis theorem as needed; 4. Sum contributions (add or subtract); 5. Verify with physical reasoning. Common Composite Examples: L-shaped objects; Objects with holes; Gear systems; Structural elements; Machine components.

  "summary": "Moment of inertia serves as the fundamental quantity describing rotational inertia, quantifying an object's resistance to angular acceleration based on both total mass and mass distribution relative to the rotation axis. Through integration techniques, we can calculate moments of inertia for various shapes, from simple discrete systems to complex continuous distributions. The parallel axis theorem provides powerful tools for finding moments of inertia about different axes, while composite object methods enable analysis of complex shapes by combining simpler components. This comprehensive understanding of rotational inertia forms the essential foundation for studying rotational dynamics, energy, and momentum in subsequent units, with wide applications across engineering, physics, and technology for designing and analyzing rotating systems."
