  "summary": "The physical pendulum extends simple pendulum theory to arbitrary rigid bodies, revealing rich dynamics governed by mass distribution through the moment of inertia. The fundamental period formula $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I}{mgd}}$ demonstrates that period depends on how mass is distributed relative to the pivot, not just on total mass or simple geometry. The concepts of reduced length ($L_{red} = \\frac{I}{md}$) and center of oscillation provide powerful tools for analysis, with the reciprocal property enabling precision measurements without detailed knowledge of mass distribution. From uniform rods and rectangular plates to compound systems and precision timekeeping devices, physical pendulum theory finds diverse applications in time measurement, experimental physics, and engineering design, demonstrating the elegant connection between rotational dynamics and oscillatory motion while providing practical tools for solving complex real-world problems."
