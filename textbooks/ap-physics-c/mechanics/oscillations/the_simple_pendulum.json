Through rigorous derivation of the exact pendulum equation d²θ/dt² + (g/L)sinθ = 0, application of the small-angle approximation, energy conservation analysis, and exploration of advanced topics including physical pendulums and damping effects, we develop a comprehensive understanding of pendulum behavior. The pendulum serves as a fundamental physical system that demonstrates the power of calculus in physics, the transition from linear to nonlinear dynamics, and the practical considerations involved in real-world oscillatory systems, while maintaining its historical importance in timekeeping and scientific measurement."
