Energy Relationships: Total energy E = ½kC² (constant); Potential energy U = ½kx² = ½kC² cos²(ωt - φ); Kinetic energy K = ½mv² = ½kC² sin²(ωt - φ); Energy oscillates between U and K; Average values: <U> = <K> = ½E. Velocity and Acceleration: Velocity amplitude v_max = ωC; Acceleration amplitude a_max = ω²C; Phase relationships: x max when v = 0; v max when x = 0; a always opposite to x. Physical Limits: Small angle approximation for pendulums (θ < 10-15°); Linear spring force (Hooke's law valid range); No damping or driving forces; Small amplitudes generally. Model Extensions: Large amplitudes: anharmonic oscillations; Damping: exponential decay of amplitude; Driving: forced oscillations and resonance; Nonlinear systems: chaotic behavior.

  "summary": "The differential equation approach to simple harmonic motion provides a powerful mathematical foundation for understanding oscillatory phenomena across physics and engineering. By deriving d²x/dt² + ω²x = 0 from Newton's second law and Hooke's law, solving it through characteristic equation methods, and interpreting the solutions physically, we establish a universal framework for analyzing diverse oscillating systems. This mathematical formalism connects directly to measurable quantities - frequency determined by system properties, amplitude by initial energy, and phase by initial conditions - while energy conservation provides crucial verification of the model's physical consistency. The SHM differential equation thus serves as the cornerstone for understanding more complex oscillatory phenomena while providing accurate predictions for real-world systems operating within its validity limits."
