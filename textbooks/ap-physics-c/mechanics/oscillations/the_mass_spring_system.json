Combined Spring Systems: Springs in parallel: k_eq = k₁ + k₂ + ...; Same displacement, forces add; Springs in series: 1/k_eq = 1/k₁ + 1/k₂ + ...; Same force, displacements add; General combinations: analyze step by step. Damped Spring Systems: Equation: m d²x/dt² + b dx/dt + kx = 0; Damping ratio: ζ = b/(2√(mk)); Underdamped (ζ<1): x(t) = Ae^(-ζωt)cos(ωt + φ) with ω = ω₀√(1-ζ²); Critical damping (ζ=1): fastest return without oscillation; Overdamped (ζ>1): slow exponential decay. Real Spring Effects: Nonlinearity at large extensions; Mass of spring itself; Internal friction and hysteresis; Temperature dependence; Fatigue and permanent set; Effective mass correction: m_eff = m + m_spring/3. Driven Oscillators: Equation: m d²x/dt² + b dx/dt + kx = F₀cos(ωt); Steady-state solution: x(t) = A cos(ωt - φ); Amplitude: A = F₀/√[(k-mω²)² + (bω)²]; Resonance at ω = √(k/m).

  "summary": "The mass-spring system represents the quintessential example of simple harmonic motion, with comprehensive calculus-based analysis revealing elegant mathematical structure and precise physical predictions. Through derivation of the fundamental differential equation m d²x/dt² + kx = 0, solution via characteristic equation methods, application to both horizontal and vertical configurations, and exploration of energy conservation principles, we establish a complete framework for understanding spring oscillations. The system's behavior - characterized by sinusoidal motion with period T = 2π√(m/k) independent of amplitude, perfect energy transformation between kinetic and potential forms, and elegant mathematical solutions - demonstrates the power of calculus in physics while providing the foundation for analyzing more complex oscillatory systems and real-world applications across engineering and technology."
