  "summary": "Two-dimensional collision analysis extends fundamental collision principles to complex vector scenarios, requiring careful application of momentum conservation in component form and consideration of impact geometry. Glancing collisions involve angular relationships and scattering angles, while oblique impacts require line of impact analysis with separate treatment of normal and tangential components. The coefficient of restitution applies specifically to the normal direction, with tangential components potentially involving friction effects. Complex multi-body scenarios include simultaneous impacts requiring coupled equations and sequential chains allowing step-by-step analysis. These advanced techniques find crucial applications across physics, engineering, and technology, from automotive safety design to sports equipment optimization to particle physics experiments, demonstrating the essential role of comprehensive 2D collision analysis in understanding and predicting complex physical interactions."
