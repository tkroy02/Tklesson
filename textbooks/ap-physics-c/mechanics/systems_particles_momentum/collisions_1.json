  "summary": "Collision analysis encompasses a continuum from perfectly elastic to completely inelastic impacts, with the coefficient of restitution providing a quantitative measure of collision elasticity. Perfectly elastic collisions conserve both momentum and kinetic energy, while perfectly inelastic collisions maximize energy dissipation with objects sticking together. Real-world collisions typically fall between these extremes, with partial energy conservation described by the restitution coefficient. The center of mass frame provides powerful analytical simplifications, revealing fundamental collision symmetries and enabling derivation of general formulas. These principles find extensive application across physics, engineering, and technology, from vehicle safety design to sports equipment optimization to particle physics experiments, demonstrating the universal importance of collision dynamics in understanding and predicting physical behavior."
