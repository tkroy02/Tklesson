  "summary": "Center of mass analysis for particle systems provides a powerful framework for reducing complex multi-particle systems to single-point representations. Through mass-weighted averaging of position vectors, the center of mass serves as the effective location where total mass concentrates for translational motion analysis, follows simplified Newtonian dynamics unaffected by internal forces, and provides crucial insights into system stability and behavior. From simple discrete particle arrangements to complex three-dimensional distributions, center of mass concepts enable prediction of system motion, analysis of stability conditions, and optimization of designs across physics, engineering, and technology applications. This fundamental concept establishes the foundation for more advanced topics in systems of particles and momentum conservation."
