  "summary": "The motion of center of mass provides a powerful simplification for analyzing complex systems, obeying Newton's second law as if all mass were concentrated at that point and all external forces acted directly upon it. This principle allows separation of overall translational motion from complex internal dynamics, with internal forces canceling in pairs and having no effect on CM trajectory. Conservation of momentum directly relates to constant CM velocity in isolated systems, while energy separates into CM kinetic energy and internal energy components. Advanced applications include coupled rotational-translational motion, constrained systems, variable mass systems like rockets, and analysis in the center of mass reference frame. These concepts find widespread application across physics, engineering, and technology, from vehicle dynamics to spacecraft navigation to sports biomechanics, demonstrating the universal utility of center of mass dynamics in understanding and predicting system behavior."
