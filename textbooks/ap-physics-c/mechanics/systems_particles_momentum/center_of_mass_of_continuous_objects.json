  "summary": "Center of mass calculations for continuous objects extend discrete particle concepts through systematic integration methods. By treating objects as composed of infinitesimal mass elements and applying appropriate density functions, we can determine centers of mass for one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional objects of various geometries. The choice of coordinate system and integration strategy depends on object symmetry and geometry, with Cartesian coordinates suitable for rectangular shapes, polar/cylindrical coordinates optimal for circular geometries, and spherical coordinates most efficient for spherical objects. Both uniform and variable density distributions can be handled through proper integral setup, with symmetry principles often simplifying calculations. These techniques provide essential tools for analyzing real-world objects across engineering, physics, and technology applications, from structural design to vehicle stability to astronomical body analysis."
