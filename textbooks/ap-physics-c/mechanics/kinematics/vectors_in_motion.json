Component Independence: In Cartesian coordinates, motion in x, y, z directions are independent; Can analyze separately then combine; Critical for problem-solving. Differentiation Rules: Sum/difference rule: d(u ± v)/dt = du/dt ± dv/dt; Scalar multiplication: d(cu)/dt = (dc/dt)u + c(du/dt); Dot product: d(u·v)/dt = (du/dt)·v + u·(dv/dt); Cross product: d(u×v)/dt = (du/dt)×v + u×(dv/dt). Integration as Inverse: ∫v(t)dt = r(t) + C; ∫a(t)dt = v(t) + C; Initial conditions determine constants of integration. Physical Interpretation: Direction of v: tangent to path, shows where particle is heading; Direction of a: shows how velocity is changing, not necessarily where particle is going; Can have a ≠ 0 even when speed is constant (direction changing).

Tangential Acceleration: a_t = dv/dt; Component parallel to velocity; Changes speed (magnitude of velocity); a_t > 0: speeding up, a_t < 0: slowing down; a_t = d|v|/dt. Normal Acceleration: a_n = v²/ρ; Component perpendicular to velocity; Changes direction of motion; Always points toward center of curvature; a_n = |v|²/ρ. Radius of Curvature: ρ = [1 + (dy/dx)²]^(3/2) / |d²y/dx²|; For parametric: ρ = |v|³/|v×a|; Measure of how sharply path curves; Small ρ = tight curve, large ρ = gentle curve. Total Acceleration: a = a_tT + a_nN; Magnitude: |a| = √(a_t² + a_n²); Direction reveals net force direction. Special Cases: Straight line motion: ρ → ∞, a_n = 0; Uniform circular motion: a_t = 0, a_n = v²/R constant; Non-uniform circular motion: a_t = dv/dt, a_n = v²/R. Physical Interpretation: a_t requires force component along direction of motion (friction, thrust); a_n requires force toward center of curvature (gravity, tension, normal force); a_n is centripetal acceleration. Applications: Banked curves design; Roller coaster loops; Planetary orbits; Car turning corners; Aircraft maneuvers.

  "summary": "Vector calculus provides the fundamental mathematical framework for analyzing motion in multiple dimensions. The position vector r(t) completely describes a particle's location, while its derivatives yield the velocity v(t) = dr/dt and acceleration a(t) = d²r/dt². This approach elegantly handles complex motion including projectile motion with and without air resistance, where numerical methods become essential for realistic modeling. For curved paths, resolving acceleration into tangential and normal components (a_t and a_n) provides physical insight: tangential acceleration changes speed while normal acceleration changes direction. The radius of curvature quantifies how sharply a path bends. These vector techniques form the foundation for all subsequent topics in mechanics, from Newton's laws to orbital dynamics, providing a unified, powerful approach to understanding and predicting motion in our three-dimensional world."
