  "summary": "General 2D motion is completely described using vector calculus, with position $\\vec{r}(t) = x(t)\\hat{i} + y(t)\\hat{j}$, velocity $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt}$, and acceleration $\\vec{a} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}$. The independence of perpendicular motion components allows complex 2D problems to be solved as separate 1D problems. Projectile motion exemplifies this approach, with ideal projectiles following parabolic trajectories while real projectiles with air resistance exhibit reduced range and asymmetric paths. Relative motion analysis relates observations between different reference frames through vector addition $\\vec{v}_{A/B} = \\vec{v}_{A/C} - \\vec{v}_{B/C}$, crucial for navigation problems. Different coordinate systems—Cartesian, polar, and tangential-normal—offer advantages for specific types of motion, with polar coordinates naturally describing circular motion and tangential-normal components separating speed changes from direction changes. This comprehensive vector approach provides the foundation for analyzing all types of 2D motion, from simple projectile paths to complex curvilinear trajectories observed from moving reference frames."
