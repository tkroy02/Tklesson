Free-Fall with Air Resistance: Acceleration: $a = -g - \\frac{b}{m}v$ (linear drag); Differential equation: $\\frac{dv}{dt} = -g - \\frac{b}{m}v$; Solution: $v(t) = -v_t + (v_0 + v_t)e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t}$ where $v_t = \\frac{mg}{b}$ (terminal velocity); Position requires integration of v(t). Rocket Motion: Upward launch with constant thrust; Two phases: powered ascent and free-fall; Acceleration changes at engine cutoff; Maximum height found when v=0. Spring-Motion: Simple harmonic motion: $a = -\\omega^2x$; Solution: $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$; Velocity: $v(t) = -A\\omega\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$. Optimization Problems: Maximum height: set v=0, solve for t, substitute into y(t); Maximum range: differentiate range function with respect to launch angle; Minimum time: optimize path or speed. Graphical Analysis: Slope of x-t curve = velocity; Slope of v-t curve = acceleration; Area under a-t curve = Δv; Area under v-t curve = Δx. Physical Interpretation: Sign conventions important; Reference frames must be consistent; Units must be checked; Limits and asymptotes have physical meaning (terminal velocity, equilibrium positions). Problem-Solving Strategy: 1. Identify known quantities and target; 2. Choose appropriate coordinate system; 3. Write relevant equations; 4. Apply calculus operations; 5. Use initial/boundary conditions; 6. Solve mathematically; 7. Interpret physically.",

  "summary": "Calculus provides the precise mathematical framework for analyzing one-dimensional motion. Derivatives give instantaneous velocity $(v = \\frac{dx}{dt})$ and acceleration $(a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2})$, revealing how motion changes moment by moment. Integration reverses this process, allowing reconstruction of velocity from acceleration $(v(t) = v_0 + \\int_0^t a(\\tau)d\\tau)$ and position from velocity $(x(t) = x_0 + \\int_0^t v(\\tau)d\\tau)$. For constant acceleration, these operations yield the standard kinematic equations. Calculus methods excel with variable acceleration, free-fall motion, and optimization problems, providing tools to solve real-world motion scenarios that algebraic methods cannot handle. The connection between graphical features (slopes and areas) and physical quantities makes calculus an indispensable tool for complete motion analysis."
