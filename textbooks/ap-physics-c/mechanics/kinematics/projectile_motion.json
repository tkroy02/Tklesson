  "summary": "Projectile motion represents the quintessential application of calculus to two-dimensional kinematics. The ideal case with constant gravitational acceleration yields parabolic trajectories described by $y = x\\tan\\theta - \\frac{gx^2}{2v_0^2\\cos^2\\theta}$, with maximum range at 45° launch angle. Real-world projectiles experience air resistance, modeled as linear drag ($F_d = -bv$) at low speeds or quadratic drag ($F_d = -cv^2$) at higher speeds, requiring differential equations for analysis. Linear drag admits analytical solutions showing exponential velocity decay, while quadratic drag typically necessitates numerical methods like Euler or Runge-Kutta integration. Advanced scenarios include projectiles on inclined planes, requiring coordinate rotation; multi-stage motion with piecewise acceleration; and Coriolis effects for long-range projectiles on rotating Earth. Optimization problems find minimum launch speeds or maximum ranges under constraints, while applications span sports physics, military ballistics, rocket science, and engineering design. The calculus-based approach provides the mathematical foundation for predicting and optimizing projectile behavior across this vast range of practical applications."
