Relative Velocity: $\\vec{v}_{A/C} = \\vec{v}_{A/B} + \\vec{v}_{B/C}$; Velocity of A relative to C = velocity of A relative to B + velocity of B relative to C; Vector addition - order matters. Relative Acceleration: $\\vec{a}_{A/C} = \\vec{a}_{A/B} + \\vec{a}_{B/C}$; For inertial frames with constant relative velocity: $\\vec{a}_{B/C} = 0$, so $\\vec{a}_{A/C} = \\vec{a}_{A/B}$; Acceleration same in all inertial frames. Galilean Transformation: For frames with relative velocity $\\vec{V}$: $\\vec{r}' = \\vec{r} - \\vec{V}t$; $\\vec{v}' = \\vec{v} - \\vec{V}$; $\\vec{a}' = \\vec{a}$; Prime denotes moving frame coordinates. Invariance of Acceleration: Newton's second law $\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}$ holds in all inertial frames; Forces are frame-independent; Dynamics identical in all inertial frames. Vector Triangle Solutions: For 2D problems, use vector triangles; Law of cosines: $v_{AC}^2 = v_{AB}^2 + v_{BC}^2 - 2v_{AB}v_{BC}\\cos\\theta$; Law of sines: $\\frac{v_{AB}}{\\sin\\alpha} = \\frac{v_{BC}}{\\sin\\beta} = \\frac{v_{AC}}{\\sin\\gamma}$. Applications: Navigation in moving media; Aircraft with wind; Boats in currents; Interception problems; Astronomy (relative motion of celestial bodies). Problem Solving Strategy: 1. Identify all frames and their relative motion; 2. Use double subscript notation carefully; 3. Apply vector addition; 4. Solve using components or geometry; 5. Interpret physically.",

  "summary": "Relative motion analysis provides the mathematical framework for describing motion from different perspectives. In inertial frames, Galilean relativity governs simple vector addition of velocities. Rotating frames introduce fictitious forces - centrifugal force pushing outward and Coriolis force deflecting moving objects perpendicular to their velocity. Advanced applications involve multi-frame systems with hierarchical transformations, astronomical coordinate systems, and relativistic corrections at high speeds. The vector nature of these relationships means careful attention to coordinate systems and transformation order is essential. Applications span navigation, astronomy, robotics, and fundamental physics, demonstrating that the description of motion is inherently frame-dependent while the underlying physical laws remain invariant. Mastery of relative motion concepts enables accurate prediction and analysis of complex real-world motion scenarios across diverse domains from everyday navigation to space exploration."
