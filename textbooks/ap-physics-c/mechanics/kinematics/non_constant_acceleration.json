  "summary": "Non-constant acceleration requires advanced calculus techniques for motion analysis. When acceleration depends explicitly on time $a(t)$, direct integration yields velocity and position functions. For velocity-dependent acceleration $a(v)$, separation of variables solves the resulting differential equation, revealing phenomena like terminal velocity in resistive motion. Position-dependent acceleration $a(x)$ often involves conservative forces where energy conservation provides powerful solution methods, applicable to spring systems, gravitational fields, and orbital mechanics. Numerical methods like Euler and Runge-Kutta extend these techniques to complex functional forms without analytical solutions. The phase space representation offers geometric insight into motion patterns, while applications span rocket science, vehicle dynamics, orbital mechanics, and molecular physics. This comprehensive approach to non-constant acceleration demonstrates the power of calculus in describing realistic motion beyond the limitations of constant acceleration models."
