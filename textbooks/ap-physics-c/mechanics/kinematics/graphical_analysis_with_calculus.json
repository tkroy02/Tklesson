Motion Reconstruction: From partial information; Example: given v-t and x(0), find x(t); Use integration with initial conditions; Common in experimental physics. Experimental Data Analysis: Plot experimental points; Draw best-fit curve; Differentiate graphically for rates; Integrate for accumulated quantities; Account for measurement uncertainty. Curve Sketching Principles: x-t to v-t: zero slope → v=0; maximum/minimum → v=0; inflection → a=0; v-t to a-t: zero slope → a=0; maximum/minimum → a=0. Numerical Methods from Data: From data tables: $v_{avg} ≈ \\frac{x_{i+1} - x_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i}$; $a_{avg} ≈ \\frac{v_{i+1} - v_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i}$; More accurate: central difference method. Uncertainty in Graphical Methods: Tangent line: depends on drawing accuracy; Area: depends on shape approximation; Best practice: use large triangles, multiple methods; Estimate error bounds. Real-World Applications: Automotive testing: analyze velocity data for acceleration; Sports science: motion analysis from video; Physics labs: experimental verification of kinematics; Engineering: motion profile design. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1. Identify given information; 2. Determine target quantity; 3. Choose appropriate graphical method; 4. Apply carefully with attention to units; 5. Check physical reasonableness; 6. Estimate uncertainty.",

  "summary": "Graphical analysis with calculus provides powerful tools for interpreting motion graphs and solving kinematics problems. Graphical differentiation extracts instantaneous rates: velocity from the slope of position-time graphs and acceleration from the slope of velocity-time graphs. Graphical integration calculates accumulated changes: displacement from the area under velocity-time graphs and velocity change from the area under acceleration-time graphs. Advanced techniques combine these methods to reconstruct complete motion information from partial data, analyze experimental results, and solve complex real-world problems. The geometric interpretation of derivatives as slopes and integrals as areas makes abstract calculus concepts visually intuitive and practically applicable. These graphical methods bridge theoretical physics with experimental data analysis, providing essential skills for interpreting motion in scientific, engineering, and everyday contexts. Mastery of graphical calculus enables comprehensive motion analysis without requiring explicit mathematical functions, making it invaluable for working with experimental data and understanding physical relationships visually."
