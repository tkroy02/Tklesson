Numerical Integration: When a(t) or v(t) cannot be integrated analytically; Methods: Riemann sums, trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule; Useful for experimental data.

Energy Methods: Work-energy theorem: $\\int F dx = \\Delta(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2)$; Alternative to direct integration; Particularly useful for conservative forces. Problem-Solving Strategy: 1. Identify forces and write acceleration; 2. Choose appropriate integration method; 3. Apply initial/boundary conditions; 4. Solve mathematically; 5. Interpret physically; 6.

  "summary": "Integration is the fundamental mathematical operation for reconstructing complete motion from acceleration information. Definite integrals $\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} a(t)dt$ calculate net changes in velocity, while $\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t)dt$ give displacements over specific intervals. Indefinite integration combined with initial conditions provides complete velocity $v(t) = v_0 + \\int a(t)dt$ and position $x(t) = x_0 + \\int v(t)dt$ functions. These techniques handle complex real-world scenarios including free-fall with air resistance, where terminal velocity emerges as a limiting case, and spring-mass systems exhibiting simple harmonic motion. The area interpretation of definite integrals connects graphical analysis with physical quantities, while numerical methods extend these techniques to problems without analytical solutions. Integration transforms our understanding of acceleration patterns into complete predictions of motion behavior, making it an indispensable tool for analyzing and designing mechanical systems across physics and engineering applications."
