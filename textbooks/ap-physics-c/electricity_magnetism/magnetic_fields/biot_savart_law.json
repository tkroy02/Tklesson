Magnitude: |dB| = (μ₀/4π) (I dl sinθ)/r² where θ is angle between dl and r. Right-Hand Rule: For straight wire, grasp wire with right hand, thumb in current direction, fingers curl in B field direction. Infinite Straight Wire: B = μ₀I/(2πR) where R is perpendicular distance from wire. Finite Straight Wire: B = (μ₀I/4πR)(sinθ₂ - sinθ₁) where θ₁, θ₂ are angles from endpoints to field point. Special Cases: For infinite wire: θ₁ = -90°, θ₂ = +90° → B = μ₀I/(2πR). For semi-infinite wire: θ₁ = 0°, θ₂ = 90° → B = μ₀I/(4πR).

Students have mastered the application of this law to straight wires, circular loops, arc segments, and more complex configurations like solenoids and Helmholtz coils. The techniques of vector integration, symmetry analysis, and superposition provide powerful tools for predicting magnetic fields in diverse practical situations, forming an essential foundation for understanding electromagnetic devices and natural magnetic phenomena."
