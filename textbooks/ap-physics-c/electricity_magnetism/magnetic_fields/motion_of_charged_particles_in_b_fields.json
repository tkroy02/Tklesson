  "summary": "This unit has provided comprehensive analysis of charged particle motion in magnetic fields, from basic circular motion to complex helical trajectories in non-uniform fields. Students have mastered the calculation of gyroradius, cyclotron frequency, helical pitch, and drift velocities, and applied these concepts to practical devices like mass spectrometers and magnetic mirrors. The principles of adiabatic invariance and magnetic moment conservation provide the foundation for understanding particle confinement in both laboratory and natural settings, completing a essential component of classical electromagnetism theory."
