Students have mastered the application of F = IL × B for force calculations and τ = μ × B for torque analysis, developing the theoretical foundation for understanding electric motors, measuring instruments, and numerous electromagnetic devices. The concepts of magnetic moment and its alignment with external fields provide crucial insight into both technological applications and fundamental electromagnetic behavior."
