Field Integration Method: U = ∫∫∫ ½D·E dV over all space. Accounts for energy in fringing fields. Works for any field configuration. Particularly useful for non-uniform fields. Work Calculation: During charging: dW = V dQ. For linear dielectric: U = ∫V dQ gives same result as vacuum case. Includes work to polarize dielectric. Thermodynamic Interpretation: At constant charge: system does work on dielectric. At constant voltage: battery does extra work. Free energy vs total energy considerations.
