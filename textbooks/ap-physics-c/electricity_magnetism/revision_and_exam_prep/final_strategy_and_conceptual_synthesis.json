  "summary": "This final strategy and conceptual synthesis unit represents the culmination of the entire AP Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism course, integrating deep conceptual understanding with sophisticated strategic execution. Students have developed not only comprehensive knowledge of electromagnetism but also the ability to demonstrate that knowledge efficiently, accurately, and confidently under exam conditions. This powerful combination of conceptual mastery and strategic excellence prepares students not just for exam success but for continued learning and application of physics principles in academic and professional contexts. The journey through electromagnetism concludes with both specific preparation for the AP exam and general development of problem-solving skills and strategic thinking that will serve students well beyond the examination room."
