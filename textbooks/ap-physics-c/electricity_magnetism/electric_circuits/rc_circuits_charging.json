The 'resistor' is the 'narrow pipe' that limits 'flow rate' (current). The 'time constant' is how long it takes to get 'significantly filled'. Initially, the 'empty tank' has lots of 'room', so 'water flows fast'. As the 'tank fills', the 'flow slows down' because there's less 'pressure difference'. The 'exponential behavior' means it never quite 'completely fills'—each 'time constant' gets you 'closer but not quite there'.
