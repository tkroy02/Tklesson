The 'resistor' is the 'narrow pipe' that limits 'flow rate' (current). The 'time constant' is how long it takes to get 'significantly drained'. Initially, the 'full tank' has high 'pressure', so 'water flows fast'. As the 'tank empties', the 'flow slows down' because there's less 'pressure'. The 'exponential decay' means it never quite 'completely empties'—each 'time constant' leaves you with about 37% of the 'water' remaining. The 'energy dissipation' is like the 'splashing and friction' in the 'pipe' that converts the 'water's potential energy' to 'heat'.",
