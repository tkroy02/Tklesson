  "summary": "This unit has comprehensively explored resistance and resistivity, establishing the fundamental relationships described by Ohm's law and extending to complex geometries and non-ohmic materials. Through the analysis of temperature effects, series-parallel combinations, non-standard geometries, sheet resistance, contact resistance, and non-ohmic devices, students have developed the ability to analyze and design resistive elements for diverse applications. The distinction between material properties (resistivity) and device properties (resistance), along with practical considerations for real-world applications, provides a solid foundation for circuit analysis and design across electrical engineering domains."
