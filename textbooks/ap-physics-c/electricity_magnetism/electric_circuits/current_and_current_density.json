Through the analysis of drift velocity, continuity equation, vector current density, and various conduction mechanisms, students have developed the ability to analyze current flow in diverse materials and geometries. The distinction between scalar current and vector current density, along with applications to anisotropic materials and surface currents, provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding current flow in real-world electrical systems and devices."
