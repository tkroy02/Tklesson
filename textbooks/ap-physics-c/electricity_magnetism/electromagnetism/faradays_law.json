Lenz's Law is like 'inertia for magnetic fields'—the induced current always 'pushes back' against whatever change you're trying to make, just like how it's hard to suddenly start or stop moving a heavy object.

  "summary": "This unit has established the fundamental principles of electromagnetic induction through Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law. Students have learned to calculate induced EMF from changing magnetic flux through various mechanisms, determine induced current directions using Lenz's Law, and analyze the non-conservative electric fields created by time-varying magnetic fields. These concepts form the foundation for understanding electromagnetic energy conversion and the operation of countless electrical devices that power modern technology."
