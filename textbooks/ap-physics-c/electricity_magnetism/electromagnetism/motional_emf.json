Another analogy: moving a conductor through a magnetic field is like 'scooping water with a bucket'—the motion through the field 'scoops up' electrical energy, and the size of the bucket (conductor length) and how fast you scoop (velocity) determine how much energy you collect. The magnetic force opposition is like the 'water resistance' you feel when scooping—it takes work to overcome it, and that work becomes your electrical energy.",
