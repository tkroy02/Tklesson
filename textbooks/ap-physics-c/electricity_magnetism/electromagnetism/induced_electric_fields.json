  "summary": "This unit has explored the profound concept of electric fields induced by changing magnetic fields, completing the unification of electricity and magnetism. Students have learned to distinguish conservative electrostatic fields from non-conservative induced fields, apply the Maxwell-Faraday equation to various configurations, and understand advanced applications like betatron accelerators and electromagnetic waves. This knowledge provides the foundation for understanding how electromagnetic energy propagates through space and enables technologies from particle accelerators to wireless communication."
