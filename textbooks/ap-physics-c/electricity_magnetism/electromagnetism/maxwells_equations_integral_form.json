Students have mastered the four integral equations that describe how electric charges and currents produce fields, how changing fields create each other, and how these relationships predict electromagnetic waves propagating at the speed of light. This understanding represents one of the greatest achievements in physics - the unification of electricity, magnetism, and optics that enabled the technological revolution of the 20th century and continues to drive innovation in communications, computing, and energy technologies."
