Students have learned to calculate stored energy using both circuit (U=½LI²) and field (u_B=B²/(2μ₀)) approaches, analyze energy transfer during inductive transients, and apply these concepts to practical systems ranging from simple circuits to advanced energy storage applications. Understanding magnetic energy storage is essential for designing efficient power systems, energy storage devices, and any application where inductors play a key role in energy management and conversion."
