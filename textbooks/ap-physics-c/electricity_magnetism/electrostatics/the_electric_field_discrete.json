  "summary": "This unit has thoroughly developed the electric field concept through extensive worked examples that demonstrate both computational techniques and physical reasoning. The electric field E = F/q provides a powerful framework for understanding electrostatic interactions. For single point charges, the field follows an inverse-square relationship. For multiple charges, the superposition principle allows calculation of net fields through vector addition. Key applications include dipole fields, symmetric charge arrangements, and locating points of zero field. These concepts form the essential foundation for analyzing more complex continuous charge distributions and for understanding how electric fields influence charged particles in practical applications."
