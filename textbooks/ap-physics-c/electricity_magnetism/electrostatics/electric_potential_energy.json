The electric force can be recovered from potential energy through F = -∇U, and total mechanical energy is conserved for charged particles moving under electric forces alone.",

  "summary": "This unit has established electric potential energy as a fundamental concept connecting work, force, and energy in electrostatic systems. The conservative nature of electric forces enables path-independent work calculations and the definition of potential energy functions. For systems of charges, the total potential energy represents the work required to assemble the configuration and determines stability through energy minima. Energy conservation provides powerful tools for analyzing charged particle motion, while the gradient relationship F = -∇U allows recovery of forces from energy considerations. These concepts find application in diverse areas from capacitor energy storage to atomic binding energies, demonstrating the unifying power of energy methods throughout physics."
