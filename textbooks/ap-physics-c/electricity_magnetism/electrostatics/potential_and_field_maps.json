  "summary": "This unit has developed comprehensive skills in visualizing and interpreting electric fields through field mapping techniques. By mastering the relationship between field lines and equipotential surfaces, students can extract complete field information from graphical representations and create accurate maps for both simple and complex charge configurations. The ability to analyze field patterns around conductors, identify regions of field enhancement, and interpret computational visualizations provides powerful tools for understanding electrostatic phenomena in both theoretical and practical contexts. These visualization skills bridge the gap between mathematical analysis and physical intuition, enabling effective design and analysis of real-world electrode systems and electrostatic devices."
