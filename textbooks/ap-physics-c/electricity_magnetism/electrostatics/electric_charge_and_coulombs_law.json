The electrostatic force between two point charges is governed by Coulomb's Law, an inverse-square central force. For systems of multiple charges, the net force is determined by the vector sum of all pairwise interactions.

The magnitude follows the inverse square law: $|\\vec{F}_{12}| = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$. Superposition Principle for Discrete Systems: For a system of N charges, the net force on a test charge $q_0$ at position $\\vec{r}$ is: $\\vec{F}_{net} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\vec{F}_{0i} = \\frac{q_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{q_i}{ |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i|^3 } (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_i)$. Vector Calculus Foundation: This discrete sum anticipates the continuous case: $\\vec{F}_{net} = \\frac{q_0}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{dq}{ |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|^3 } (\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}')$ where the sum becomes an integral over the charge distribution. Coordinate System Strategy: Choose coordinates that match the system symmetry; Resolve forces into appropriate components; Use position vectors rather than distances for systematic computation. Problem-Solving Methodology: 1. Identify all charges and their positions; 2. Choose an appropriate coordinate system; 3. Compute each force using the vector form; 4. Apply superposition by summing vector components; 5. Verify with symmetry arguments and limiting cases; 6. Interpret the physical significance. Verification Techniques: Dimensional analysis of all terms; Limiting behavior as distances approach zero or infinity; Symmetry checks for component cancellation; Conservation law verification where applicable.",

  "summary": "This unit has established the rigorous, calculus-based foundation for electrostatics through comprehensive development of Coulomb's Law in its complete vector form and systematic application of the superposition principle. By emphasizing position vectors, coordinate system strategies, and symmetry analysis, we've created a robust framework for solving complex multi-charge problems. The deliberate transition from discrete summation to continuous integration prepares the mathematical groundwork for analyzing distributed charge configurations, while stability analysis and limiting case verification develop crucial physical intuition. This comprehensive approach demonstrates that even the most fundamental electrostatic principles, when properly developed with full mathematical rigor, provide powerful tools for analyzing everything from atomic-scale interactions to macroscopic technological applications, establishing the essential foundation for all subsequent development in electricity and magnetism."
