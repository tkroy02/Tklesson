The long-run equilibrium in monopolistic competition has some surprising features: firms earn zero economic profit, but they don't produce at minimum average cost.

    "principle": "In the long run, monopolistically competitive firms earn zero economic profit, but they do not achieve productive efficiency. (1) Zero profit condition: Free entry and exit drive economic profit to zero, just like perfect competition. However, the mechanism differs: entry reduces demand for each existing firm, shifting their demand curves left until $P = ATC$ at the profit-maximizing quantity. (2) Excess capacity: In long-run equilibrium, firms produce at an output level where $ATC$ is still falling—they are not at the minimum of $ATC$. This means they could lower average cost by producing more, but they don't because demand is insufficient. The difference between the profit-maximizing output and the efficient scale (minimum $ATC$) is excess capacity. (3) Markup: Price exceeds marginal cost ($P > MC$), indicating allocative inefficiency. The markup reflects market power from product differentiation. (4) Product variety trade-off: Society gets product variety (differentiated goods) at the cost of higher average costs and prices than would prevail under perfect competition with homogeneous goods.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a neighborhood with several Italian restaurants. Each has its own atmosphere and specialty dishes. In the long run, they earn just enough to stay in business—no big profits. But none is operating at full efficiency; each has empty tables some nights. They could seat more customers and lower average costs, but they'd have to cut prices or advertising to attract them, which might not be profitable. That's excess capacity—the price of having choices.",

        "definition": "Long-run equilibrium in monopolistic competition occurs when entry and exit have eliminated economic profits, leading to zero economic profit for all firms. (1) Adjustment process: If firms earn short-run profits, new firms enter with differentiated products. Entry increases the number of competitors, reducing demand for each existing firm (their demand curves shift left). Entry continues until demand is just tangent to the $ATC$ curve at the profit-maximizing quantity, where $P = ATC$ and profit = 0. If firms incur losses, exit occurs, shifting remaining firms' demand right until losses are eliminated. (2) Long-run equilibrium conditions: (a) $MR = MC$ (profit maximization). (b) $P = ATC$ (zero economic profit). (c) The demand curve is tangent to the $ATC$ curve at the profit-maximizing quantity. (d) $P > MC$ (allocative inefficiency). (e) Firms produce at less than efficient scale (excess capacity). (3) Excess capacity: The difference between the profit-maximizing output and the output that minimizes $ATC$. Because demand is tangent to $ATC$ on the downward-sloping portion (where $ATC$ is still falling), firms could lower average cost by producing more. They don't because they would need to lower price to sell more, and the additional revenue wouldn't cover the cost. (4) Markup: $P > MC$ indicates market power. The size of the markup depends on the elasticity of demand. (5) Welfare implications: Monopolistic competition involves a trade-off. Consumers benefit from product variety (more choices). The cost is productive inefficiency (excess capacity) and allocative inefficiency ($P > MC$). Whether this trade-off is worthwhile is a normative question.",
        
        "context": "The long-run equilibrium of monopolistic competition was first analyzed by Edward Chamberlin, who highlighted the excess capacity theorem. This result has important implications: it suggests that monopolistically competitive markets may have \"too many\" firms, each producing too little output. However, this inefficiency must be weighed against consumer preference for variety. In AP Microeconomics, understanding long-run equilibrium is essential for comparing market structures and analyzing real-world industries like retail and restaurants.",

If demand were higher, firms would earn profits, attracting entry. If demand were lower, firms would incur losses, causing exit. The tangency condition is the hallmark of long-run equilibrium in monopolistic competition.

In long-run equilibrium, the demand curve is tangent to $ATC$ on its downward-sloping portion, meaning $ATC$ is still decreasing at the profit-maximizing quantity. If the firm produced more, $ATC$ would fall, but it cannot profitably sell the additional output without lowering price on all units. The result is that firms operate with excess capacity—they could produce more at lower average cost, but choose not to. This is a fundamental inefficiency of monopolistic competition. However, it's the price we pay for product variety. In perfect competition, firms produce at minimum $ATC$ (no excess capacity) but products are homogeneous.",

The size of the markup depends on the elasticity of demand: more differentiation leads to less elastic demand and larger markup.

This tangency ensures two conditions simultaneously: (a) profit maximization ($MR = MC$) and (b) zero economic profit ($P = ATC$). Because the demand curve is downward-sloping, the tangency occurs on the downward-sloping portion of $ATC$, not at its minimum. This is different from perfect competition, where the firm's horizontal demand curve is tangent at the minimum of $ATC$. The tangency condition is the result of entry and exit adjusting until profits are zero.",

The amount of excess capacity is the difference between the profit-maximizing output and the output that minimizes $ATC$. This result has important implications: (a) Markets with monopolistic competition may have \"too many\" firms, each producing too little.

On the other hand, the market structure leads to excess capacity and prices above marginal cost. There is no clear benchmark for what the \"right\" amount of variety should be. Some economists argue that monopolistic competition may lead to too much variety because entrants don't consider the business they steal from existing firms (business-stealing externality).

  "summary": "In the long run, monopolistically competitive firms earn zero economic profit due to free entry and exit. Long-run equilibrium occurs where each firm's demand curve is tangent to its average total cost curve at the profit-maximizing quantity. At this point, two conditions hold: $MR = MC$ (profit maximization) and $P = ATC$ (zero profit). Because demand is downward-sloping, the tangency occurs on the downward-sloping portion of $ATC$, meaning firms produce at less than efficient scale. This results in excess capacity—the gap between actual output and the output that minimizes $ATC$. Firms could lower average cost by producing more, but doing so would require lowering price and would not be profitable. Additionally, $P > MC$ at the equilibrium, indicating allocative inefficiency. Compared to perfect competition, monopolistic competition involves a trade-off: consumers benefit from product variety but pay the cost of excess capacity and higher prices. Compared to monopoly, it shares the $P > MC$ feature but lacks long-run profits. Understanding long-run equilibrium in monopolistic competition is essential for analyzing real-world markets where product differentiation is important and for evaluating the trade-off between variety and efficiency."
