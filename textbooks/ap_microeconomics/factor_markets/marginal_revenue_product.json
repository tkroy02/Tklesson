  "expanded_description": "How does a firm decide how many workers to hire? The answer lies in marginal analysis, just like with output decisions. A firm hires additional workers as long as the revenue generated by that worker exceeds the cost of hiring them.

(2) For a perfectly competitive firm in the product market, $MR = P$, so $MRP = MP \\times P$. This is also called the value of the marginal product (VMP). (3) For a firm with market power, $MR < P$, so $MRP < VMP$. (4) Profit-maximizing hiring rule: A firm hires additional units of a factor as long as $MRP$ exceeds the factor price (wage $W$ for labor). The optimal quantity is where $MRP = W$.

(6) Shifts in $MRP$ occur when productivity changes (shifting $MP$) or when output price changes (shifting $MR$).",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a pizza shop. The owner considers hiring another worker. That worker can make 10 pizzas per hour (marginal product). Each pizza sells for $\\$15$ (price). So the worker generates $\\$150$ per hour in revenue—that's the marginal revenue product. If the wage is $\\$120$ per hour, hiring is profitable. If the wage is $\\$160$, it's not. The owner hires until the revenue from the last worker just equals the wage.",

        "definition": "Marginal revenue product (MRP) is the additional revenue a firm earns from employing one more unit of a factor of production (typically labor). (1) Formula: $MRP = MP \\times MR$, where $MP$ is the marginal product of the factor (additional output from one more unit) and $MR$ is the marginal revenue from selling that additional output. (2) For a perfectly competitive firm in the product market: The firm is a price taker, so $MR = P$. Thus $MRP = MP \\times P$. This special case is often called the value of the marginal product (VMP). (3) For a firm with market power: The firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve, so $MR < P$. Thus $MRP = MP \\times MR < MP \\times P = VMP$. The firm values workers less than a competitive firm would because selling additional output requires lowering price. (4) Profit-maximizing hiring rule: The firm hires additional units of the factor as long as $MRP$ exceeds the factor price ($W$ for labor). The optimal quantity is where $MRP = W$. (5) The $MRP$ curve: Because of diminishing marginal product, $MP$ declines as more workers are hired. Therefore, $MRP$ also declines. The $MRP$ curve is downward-sloping and is the firm's demand curve for the factor. (6) Shifts in $MRP$: The $MRP$ curve shifts when: (a) Productivity changes (technology, training, etc.)—shifts $MP$. (b) Output price changes—shifts $MR$ or $P$. (c) Changes in the price of other inputs may affect $MP$ (if inputs are complementary or substitutable).",

It remains central to labor economics and to understanding firm behavior.

The logic is the same: if $MRP > W$, hiring another worker adds more to revenue than to cost, increasing profit. If $MRP < W$, the last worker cost more than they generated, reducing profit. The optimal is where they are equal. This rule applies to all firms, regardless of market structure—only the calculation of $MRP$ differs. This marginal analysis is the foundation of labor demand. It shows that wages and employment are determined by productivity and output prices, not by employer goodwill or worker needs.",

This means the $MRP$ curve is exactly the firm's demand curve for labor. It slopes downward because of diminishing marginal product—as more workers are hired, each additional worker adds less to output, so the revenue from the last worker falls. This downward-sloping demand curve is the microeconomic foundation for the market demand for labor.

For a perfectly competitive firm, $MR = P$, so $MRP = MP \\times P$, also called the value of the marginal product (VMP). For a firm with market power, $MR < P$, so $MRP < VMP$. Firms maximize profit by hiring additional units of a factor as long as $MRP$ exceeds the factor price (wage $W$ for labor). The optimal quantity is where $MRP = W$. Because of diminishing marginal product, $MRP$ declines as more workers are hired, making the $MRP$ curve downward-sloping. This curve is the firm's demand curve for labor. The $MRP$ curve shifts when productivity changes (shifting $MP$) or when output price changes (shifting $MR$). Understanding MRP is essential for analyzing labor demand, wage determination, and the effects of market power on employment."
