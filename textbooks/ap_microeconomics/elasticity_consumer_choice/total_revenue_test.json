  "expanded_description": "How does a business know whether raising prices will increase or decrease its revenue? The answer lies in the relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue. This relationship—called the total revenue test—provides a simple way to determine elasticity from real-world data. For businesses, understanding this relationship is crucial for pricing decisions. For economists, it connects theoretical elasticity concepts to observable outcomes. In this section, we'll explore how price changes affect total revenue depending on elasticity, how to use the total revenue test to estimate elasticity, and why this matters for business strategy and public policy.",

    "principle": "Total revenue (TR) is the amount a firm receives from selling its goods: $TR = P \\times Q$. The relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue is predictable: (1) When demand is elastic $(|PED| > 1)$, price and total revenue move in opposite directions. A price increase decreases total revenue; a price decrease increases total revenue. (2) When demand is inelastic $(|PED| < 1)$, price and total revenue move in the same direction. A price increase increases total revenue; a price decrease decreases total revenue. (3) When demand is unit elastic $(|PED| = 1)$, total revenue remains constant when price changes. The total revenue test uses observed changes in total revenue following a price change to infer whether demand is elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic. This is a practical tool for businesses and policymakers who may not have precise elasticity estimates but can observe revenue changes.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of total revenue like the size of a pizza. When you change the price (slice size) and quantity (number of slices), the total pizza size can grow, shrink, or stay the same. If demand is elastic, cutting the price (smaller slices) attracts so many more customers (more slices) that the total pizza gets bigger. If demand is inelastic, raising the price (bigger slices) loses so few customers (slightly fewer slices) that the total pizza gets bigger. The total revenue test tells you which effect dominates.",

        "definition": "Total revenue (TR) is the total amount a firm receives from selling its output: $TR = P \\times Q$. The relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue is systematic: (1) Elastic demand $(|PED| > 1)$: Price and total revenue move in opposite directions. When price increases, quantity demanded falls by a larger percentage, so total revenue decreases. When price decreases, quantity demanded rises by a larger percentage, so total revenue increases. (2) Inelastic demand $(|PED| < 1)$: Price and total revenue move in the same direction. When price increases, quantity demanded falls by a smaller percentage, so total revenue increases. When price decreases, quantity demanded rises by a smaller percentage, so total revenue decreases. (3) Unit elastic demand $(|PED| = 1)$: Total revenue remains constant when price changes. The percentage change in quantity exactly offsets the percentage change in price. (4) Total revenue test: By observing what happens to total revenue when price changes, we can infer the elasticity of demand. If price increase leads to higher TR → demand is inelastic. If price increase leads to lower TR → demand is elastic. If TR unchanged → unit elastic. (5) Graphical relationship: On a linear demand curve, total revenue is maximized at the point of unit elasticity. Moving down the curve from higher prices, total revenue increases until reaching the midpoint (unit elastic), then decreases. (6) Importance: This relationship helps businesses optimize pricing, governments predict tax revenue, and economists understand market behavior without complex calculations.",
        
        "context": "The relationship between elasticity and total revenue was first clearly articulated by Alfred Marshall. It remains a cornerstone of managerial economics. Firms routinely use this principle—even if they don't calculate elasticity explicitly, they observe how revenue responds to price changes and adjust accordingly. The total revenue test is also used in antitrust cases to assess market power and in public finance to predict the revenue effects of taxes.",

Customers are not very responsive to price changes, so the firm can charge more without losing many sales. This is common for necessities, goods with few substitutes, or in the short run when consumers can't easily adjust.

At the midpoint, demand is unit elastic and TR reaches its maximum. In the inelastic region (lower half of the curve), further price decreases lead to quantity increases that are proportionally smaller, so TR falls.

If a firm's goal is to maximize revenue (ignoring costs), it should price at the unit elastic point. If the goal is to maximize profit, costs must also be considered, but elasticity still matters. For firms with elastic demand, raising prices will reduce revenue and likely reduce profit unless costs fall dramatically. For firms with inelastic demand, raising prices will increase revenue and may increase profit if costs don't rise too much. This is why firms in competitive markets (elastic demand) focus on cost control and efficiency, while firms with market power (inelastic demand) can charge higher markups.",

The unit elastic point represents the revenue-maximizing price. This has important implications: (1) Firms seeking to maximize revenue should price at this point. (2) Any price away from this point means revenue could be increased by adjusting price. (3) The revenue-maximizing price is not necessarily the profit-maximizing price because costs matter.

  "summary": "Total revenue $(TR = P \\times Q)$ has a predictable relationship with price elasticity of demand. When demand is elastic $(|PED| > 1)$, price and total revenue move in opposite directions: a price increase reduces TR, a price decrease increases TR. When demand is inelastic $(|PED| < 1)$, price and total revenue move in the same direction: a price increase increases TR, a price decrease reduces TR. When demand is unit elastic $(|PED| = 1)$, total revenue remains constant as price changes. The total revenue test uses these relationships to infer elasticity from observed revenue changes: if price and TR move together, demand is inelastic; if they move opposite, demand is elastic; if TR unchanged, unit elastic. Along a linear demand curve, total revenue rises in the elastic region (upper half), reaches a maximum at the unit elastic point (midpoint), and falls in the inelastic region (lower half). The revenue-maximizing price is where $|PED| = 1$. Understanding these relationships is essential for business pricing decisions, tax policy analysis, and interpreting market behavior."
