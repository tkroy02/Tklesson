  "expanded_description": "How do we know whether a market outcome is good for society? The concept of economic efficiency provides a benchmark. When markets work well, they maximize total surplus—the sum of consumer and producer surplus. But when markets fail, or when government intervenes, total surplus can change. Understanding how to measure welfare, evaluate efficiency, and analyze the effects of taxes, price controls, and other policies is essential for assessing real-world economic outcomes. In this unit, we'll bring together concepts from throughout the course to evaluate market performance and government interventions.",

    "principle": "Market efficiency is achieved when total surplus (consumer surplus + producer surplus) is maximized. (1) Consumer surplus: The difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. Measured as the area below the demand curve and above the price. (2) Producer surplus: The difference between what producers receive and their costs (the minimum they would accept). Measured as the area above the supply curve and below the price. (3) Total surplus: The sum of consumer and producer surplus, representing the net benefits to society from a market. (4) Efficiency: A market outcome is efficient if it maximizes total surplus. This occurs at the competitive equilibrium where $P = MC$. (5) Deadweight loss: The reduction in total surplus caused by a market distortion (tax, price control, monopoly, externality). It represents mutually beneficial transactions that do not occur. (6) Government interventions (taxes, price controls) generally create deadweight loss, though they may be justified by equity concerns or to correct market failures.",
    
    "explanation": "Think of a market as creating a pie of value for consumers and producers. Consumer surplus is the slice consumers get—the value they receive beyond what they pay. Producer surplus is the slice producers get—their profit beyond costs. Total surplus is the whole pie. An efficient market makes the pie as large as possible. Taxes and price controls shrink the pie—that's deadweight loss. Sometimes we accept a smaller pie if it's divided more fairly, but the loss is still a cost.",

  "summary": "Consumer surplus measures the benefit buyers receive from participating in a market—the area below the demand curve and above the price. Producer surplus measures the benefit sellers receive—the area above the supply curve and below the price. Total surplus (consumer + producer surplus) measures the total net benefit to society. A market is efficient when total surplus is maximized, which occurs at the competitive equilibrium where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. At this point, allocative efficiency is achieved ($P = MC$), meaning resources are allocated to their most valued uses. In perfect competition, long-run equilibrium also achieves productive efficiency (production at minimum $ATC$). Any deviation from competitive equilibrium—whether from monopoly, taxes, price controls, or externalities—creates deadweight loss, a reduction in total surplus. However, efficiency is not the only goal; equity concerns the fairness of the distribution of surplus. Policies that improve equity may reduce efficiency, creating a trade-off that involves value judgments. Understanding surplus and efficiency is essential for evaluating market outcomes and government interventions."
