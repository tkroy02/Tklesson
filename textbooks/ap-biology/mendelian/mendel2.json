  "topic": "6.3 Mendel's Laws: Law of Independent Assortment",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering Mendel's Second Law - the Law of Independent Assortment. Students will apply their understanding of how different gene pairs segregate independently during gamete formation through targeted questions involving dihybrid crosses, gamete diversity, and complex phenotypic ratios.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Law of Independent Assortment states that during gamete formation, the segregation of alleles for one gene occurs independently of the segregation of alleles for another gene. This applies to genes located on different chromosomes or sufficiently far apart on the same chromosome.",
    "explanation": "Mendel's Second Law explains how traits can be inherited in new combinations not present in either parent. The molecular basis lies in the random orientation of homologous chromosome pairs during metaphase I of meiosis, where each pair aligns independently of other pairs, creating diverse gamete combinations."

Calculate the theoretical maximum number of genetically different gametes one person can produce through independent assortment alone, ignoring crossing over. If crossing over creates an average of 2 new combinations per chromosome pair, recalculate the total diversity. Explain why actual diversity is even higher.\n\n**Answer:** **Diversity calculations:**\n\n**Independent assortment only:**\nNumber of chromosome pairs = 23\nDifferent gamete combinations = 2²³ = 8,388,608\n\n**With crossing over:**\nEach crossover creates new combinations of maternal/paternal segments\nAverage 2 crossovers per pair → ~4 different segment combinations per pair\nTotal diversity ≈ 4²³ ≈ 7.0 × 10¹³\n\n**Additional diversity factors:**\n- Multiple crossovers per chromosome\n- Mutation during meiosis\n- Random fertilization combines two diverse gametes\n- Final zygote diversity ≈ (7 × 10¹³)² ≈ 5 × 10²⁷\n\nThis explains why (except identical twins) each human is genetically unique."
