  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the interpretation of family pedigrees to determine inheritance patterns of genetic traits. Students will apply their understanding of autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and sex-linked inheritance through targeted questions involving pedigree construction, pattern recognition, and genotype deduction.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Pedigree analysis uses family trees to trace the inheritance of traits across generations, allowing determination of inheritance patterns and prediction of genetic risk. Different modes of inheritance produce characteristic patterns of affected individuals that can be identified through systematic pedigree analysis.",
    "explanation": "Pedigrees provide a powerful tool for human genetics where controlled crosses are impossible. By analyzing the distribution of traits in families, geneticists can infer whether traits are autosomal or sex-linked, dominant or recessive, and calculate recurrence risks for genetic counseling. This approach bridges Mendelian principles with human inheritance patterns."

Problems include pedigree construction from family histories, pattern recognition and justification, risk probability calculations, and application to genetic counseling scenarios. Common errors include oversimplifying pattern recognition, misunderstanding carrier probabilities, and misapplying risk calculations. Mastering pedigree analysis is essential for human genetics, medical diagnosis, and genetic counseling applications."
