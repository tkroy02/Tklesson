  "topic": "6.10 Gene Interaction and Epistasis",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering how multiple genes can interact to influence single traits, including epistasis where one gene masks the expression of another. Students will apply their understanding of modified Mendelian ratios, complementary gene action, and biochemical pathways through targeted questions involving complex inheritance patterns.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Most traits are influenced by multiple genes that interact in complex ways. Epistasis occurs when the expression of one gene is affected by one or more other genes, modifying expected Mendelian ratios and creating novel phenotypic classes that reflect underlying biochemical pathways and genetic networks.",
    "explanation": "Gene interactions reveal that inheritance is not simply the sum of independent gene effects but involves complex networks where genes influence each other's expression. Epistatic interactions modify classical Mendelian ratios by creating situations where certain genotypic combinations produce unexpected phenotypes, demonstrating how genetic pathways integrate multiple gene products to produce final traits."

Problems include ratio interpretation, pathway reconstruction, genotype-phenotype mapping, and understanding how multiple genes integrate to produce complex traits. Common errors include confusing epistasis with dominance, misinterpreting modified ratios as violations of Mendelian principles, and oversimplifying gene interaction networks. Mastering gene interactions is essential for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and evolutionary genetics."
