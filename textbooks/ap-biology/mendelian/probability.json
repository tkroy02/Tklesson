  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the application of probability rules and statistical tests to genetic analysis. Students will apply their understanding of binomial probability, chi-square tests, and statistical inference through targeted questions involving genetic prediction, hypothesis testing, and data analysis.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Genetic inheritance follows probabilistic rules rather than deterministic outcomes. Statistical methods allow geneticists to test whether observed data fit expected Mendelian ratios, account for sampling variation, and make predictions about genetic outcomes in populations and families.",
    "explanation": "The mathematical foundation of genetics rests on probability theory and statistical inference. Understanding how to calculate probabilities of genetic outcomes and test genetic hypotheses using statistical methods is essential for distinguishing real genetic patterns from random variation, making accurate genetic predictions, and interpreting experimental genetic data."

  "summary": "This section covers probability and statistics in genetics: application of probability rules to genetic prediction, binomial probability for multiple offspring outcomes, chi-square tests for goodness of fit to Mendelian ratios, and proper interpretation of statistical results. Problems include risk calculation in genetic counseling, binomial probability applications, chi-square test performance and interpretation, and understanding sampling variation. Common errors include misinterpreting probabilities as guarantees, confusing statistical failure to reject with proof of hypothesis, and overinterpreting small deviations from expected ratios. Mastering probability and statistics is essential for rigorous genetic analysis, experimental design, and genetic counseling."
