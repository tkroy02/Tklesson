  "topic": "6.9 Sex-Linked Inheritance",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering inheritance patterns for genes located on sex chromosomes. Students will apply their understanding of X-linked and Y-linked inheritance, crisscross inheritance patterns, and dosage compensation through targeted questions involving sex-linked disorders and trait transmission.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Sex-linked inheritance involves genes located on sex chromosomes (X or Y) that demonstrate distinctive inheritance patterns due to the unequal distribution of these chromosomes between males and females. X-linked traits show characteristic crisscross inheritance, while Y-linked traits exhibit strict paternal transmission.",
    "explanation": "The discovery of sex-linked inheritance provided crucial evidence for the chromosomal theory of inheritance. The unique patterns arise because males (XY) have only one X chromosome, making them hemizygous for X-linked genes and thus expressing all X-linked alleles regardless of dominance. This explains why X-linked recessive disorders predominantly affect males and are transmitted through carrier females."

  "summary": "This section covers sex-linked inheritance: X-linked recessive and dominant patterns with characteristic crisscross inheritance, Y-linked paternal transmission, and the distinction between sex-linked, sex-limited, and sex-influenced traits. Problems include pedigree analysis for sex-linked disorders, probability calculations for carrier status and affected offspring, and understanding the biological basis of hemizygosity and dosage compensation. Common errors include confusing sex-linkage with sex determination, misunderstanding carrier female expression, and misapplying inheritance probabilities. Mastering sex-linked inheritance is essential for understanding human genetic disorders and evolutionary biology of sex chromosomes."
