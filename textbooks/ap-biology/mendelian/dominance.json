  "topic": "6.6 Incomplete Dominance and Codominance",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering non-Mendelian inheritance patterns where dominance relationships are not complete. Students will apply their understanding of incomplete dominance, codominance, and their distinction from classical Mendelian dominance through targeted questions involving intermediate phenotypes and multiple allele expression.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Not all gene pairs exhibit complete dominance relationships. Incomplete dominance produces intermediate phenotypes in heterozygotes, while codominance allows both alleles to be fully expressed simultaneously. These patterns demonstrate that dominance is a property of gene expression, not an inherent quality of alleles.",
    "explanation": "The discovery of incomplete dominance and codominance revealed that Mendel's complete dominance represents just one possible allelic relationship. These patterns expanded our understanding of gene action, showing that heterozygotes can display unique phenotypes rather than simply mimicking one homozygous parent, and providing insights into molecular mechanisms of gene expression and protein function."

  "summary": "This section covers non-Mendelian dominance relationships: incomplete dominance producing intermediate phenotypes in heterozygotes, and codominance allowing simultaneous expression of both alleles. Problems include prediction of unique 1:2:1 phenotypic ratios, analysis of breeding strategies, molecular mechanism explanations, and distinction between different dominance patterns. Common errors include confusing these patterns with blending inheritance, failing to distinguish codominance from incomplete dominance, and misunderstanding their relationship to Mendelian principles. Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding the full spectrum of gene expression patterns in real biological systems."
