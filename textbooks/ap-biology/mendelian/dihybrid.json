  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations focusing on dihybrid crosses - genetic crosses involving two traits simultaneously. Students will apply their understanding of independent assortment, complex Punnett squares, and the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio through targeted questions involving two-gene inheritance patterns.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Dihybrid crosses examine the inheritance of two different genes simultaneously, demonstrating how the Law of Independent Assortment creates new combinations of traits not present in either parent. These crosses reveal how genes on different chromosomes segregate independently during gamete formation.",
    "explanation": "Dihybrid crosses extend Mendelian principles by showing how multiple traits are inherited together. The classic 9:3:3:1 ratio emerges from the random combination of gametes when two heterozygous gene pairs assort independently, providing fundamental evidence for particulate inheritance and chromosomal theory."
