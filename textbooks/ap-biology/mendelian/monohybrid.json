  "topic": "6.4 Monohybrid Crosses",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations focusing on monohybrid crosses - genetic crosses involving a single trait. Students will apply their understanding of Punnett squares, genotypic and phenotypic ratios, and probability calculations through targeted questions involving simple Mendelian inheritance patterns.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Monohybrid crosses examine the inheritance pattern of a single gene with two alleles, demonstrating the Law of Segregation. These crosses reveal fundamental genetic relationships including dominance, recessiveness, and the 3:1 phenotypic ratio in heterozygous crosses.",
    "explanation": "Monohybrid crosses provide the simplest model for understanding how traits are transmitted from parents to offspring. By isolating single gene inheritance, they establish the basic rules of genetics: that organisms carry two copies of each gene, these copies segregate during gamete formation, and fertilization randomly combines gametes from each parent."

Problems include basic cross analysis, multiple offspring probability, breeding strategy development, and pedigree interpretation. Common errors include misinterpreting statistical ratios, confusing probability with certainty, and misunderstanding population genetics principles. Mastering monohybrid crosses provides the essential foundation for understanding all Mendelian genetics and serves as the building block for more complex inheritance patterns."
