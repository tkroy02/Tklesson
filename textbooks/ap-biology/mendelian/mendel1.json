  "topic": "6.2 Mendel's Laws: Law of Segregation",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering Mendel's First Law - the Law of Segregation. Students will apply their understanding of allele separation during gamete formation, Punnett square construction, and monohybrid cross analysis through targeted questions involving genetic ratios and inheritance patterns.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Law of Segregation states that during gamete formation, the two alleles for each trait separate (segregate) so that each gamete carries only one allele for each trait. This separation occurs during meiosis when homologous chromosomes are distributed to different gametes.",
    "explanation": "Mendel's First Law explains how traits can disappear in one generation and reappear unchanged in the next. The molecular basis lies in the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis I, where homologous chromosomes—and thus the alleles they carry—separate and enter different gametes, maintaining genetic integrity across generations."

Problems include gamete type prediction, Punnett square construction, expected ratio calculations, and experimental design for genotype determination. Common errors include misinterpreting statistical ratios, confusing cellular contexts for segregation, and misunderstanding dominance relationships. Mastering the Law of Segregation is fundamental for understanding all Mendelian genetics and provides the basis for more complex inheritance patterns."
