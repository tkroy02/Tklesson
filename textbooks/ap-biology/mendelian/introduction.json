  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the historical foundations of genetics, Gregor Mendel's experimental approach, and the basic principles of heredity. Students will apply their understanding of pre-Mendelian concepts, Mendel's methodology, and the fundamental rules of inheritance through targeted questions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Genetic inheritance follows specific, predictable patterns. Gregor Mendel's work established that traits are passed from parents to offspring via discrete units (now called genes) that maintain their integrity across generations, rather than through blending of parental characteristics.",
    "explanation": "Mendel's rigorous experimental design and quantitative approach revealed the fundamental principles of heredity, overthrowing the blending theory of inheritance. His work demonstrated that traits are controlled by paired factors (alleles) that segregate during gamete formation, providing the foundation for all modern genetics."

For each feature, describe how it addressed a specific limitation of pre-Mendelian theories of heredity.\n\n**Answer:** **Mendel's key design features:**\n\n1. **Use of True-Breeding Lines:**\n   - **Method:** Mendel started with pea plants that consistently produced identical offspring when self-fertilized for many generations.\n   - **Advantage:** Ensured pure parental types with known genetic constitution\n   - **Addressed:** The blending inheritance problem by showing traits reappear unchanged in later generations\n\n2. **Study of Discrete, Contrasting Traits:**\n   - **Method:** Focused on seven characteristics that showed clear either/or differences (round vs wrinkled, yellow vs green, etc.)\n   - **Advantage:** Eliminated ambiguity in classifying offspring\n   - **Addressed:** The subjective nature of continuous traits that made pattern recognition difficult\n\n3. **Quantitative Analysis with Large Sample Sizes:**\n   - **Method:** Counted and statistically analyzed thousands of offspring over multiple generations\n   - **Advantage:** Revealed consistent mathematical ratios (3:1, 9:3:3:1)\n   - **Addressed:** The anecdotal evidence and small sample sizes that plagued previous studies\n\nThese methodological innovations allowed Mendel to detect patterns invisible to earlier researchers."

              "process": "**Problem 2: Testing the Blending Inheritance Hypothesis**",
              "explanation": "**Question:** In Mendel's F₁ generation from crossing true-breeding purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants, all offspring had purple flowers. If blending inheritance were correct, what flower color would you expect in the F₂ generation? Calculate what percentage of F₂ plants should show the blended trait versus the original parental traits according to blending theory, and compare this to Mendel's actual results.\n\n**Answer:** **Blending inheritance prediction:**\n- **F₁ generation:** All plants would show intermediate lavender flowers (blend of purple and white)\n- **F₂ generation:** All plants would show the same lavender flowers (blending is irreversible)\n- **Percentage prediction:** 100% blended trait, 0% parental traits\n\n**Mendel's actual results:**\n- **F₁ generation:** 100% purple flowers (no blending)\n- **F₂ generation:** 705 purple : 224 white ≈ 3:1 ratio\n- **Actual percentages:** 75% purple, 25% white, 0% intermediate\n\n**Conclusion:** Mendel's results completely contradicted blending inheritance by showing:\n1. Traits don't blend but remain discrete\n2. 'Lost' traits can reappear unchanged in later generations\n3. Inheritance follows predictable mathematical ratios\nThis evidence supported the particulate theory of inheritance."

  "summary": "This introductory section covers the foundations of genetics: historical context including pre-Mendelian theories and Mendel's experimental breakthroughs, basic genetic terminology (gene, allele, genotype, phenotype), and fundamental concepts of inheritance. Problems include analysis of experimental design, application of genetic vocabulary, and identification of inheritance patterns. Common errors include confusing dominance with frequency, misunderstanding the particulate nature of inheritance, and overgeneralizing Mendel's laws. Mastering these basic concepts is essential for understanding more complex genetic principles in subsequent sections."
