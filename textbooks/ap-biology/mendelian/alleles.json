  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering inheritance patterns involving genes with multiple alleles in populations. Students will apply their understanding of the ABO blood group system, allele interactions, and complex dominance relationships through targeted questions involving blood typing, transfusion compatibility, and paternity analysis.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Many genes exist in more than two allelic forms within a population, though each individual still carries only two alleles. The ABO blood group system demonstrates complex dominance relationships where some alleles are codominant while others show complete dominance, creating multiple phenotypic classes.",
    "explanation": "Multiple allele systems expand genetic diversity beyond simple dominant-recessive relationships. The ABO blood types illustrate how different combinations of three alleles (Iᴬ, Iᴮ, i) can produce four distinct phenotypes through varied dominance relationships, while maintaining Mendelian segregation principles at the individual level."

  "summary": "This section covers multiple allele systems with emphasis on the ABO blood groups: complex inheritance patterns involving three alleles with mixed dominance relationships, transfusion compatibility based on antigen-antibody interactions, and practical applications in medicine and forensics. Problems include parent-offspring blood type prediction, transfusion scenario analysis, population genetics calculations, and paternity determination. Common errors include confusing individual genotype limitations with population allele diversity, misapplying dominance relationships, and misunderstanding the non-reciprocal nature of transfusion compatibility. Mastering multiple allele systems is essential for understanding human genetics, medical applications, and population diversity."
