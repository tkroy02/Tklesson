  "summary": "ATP serves as the universal energy currency of cells, with hydrolysis of its phosphoanhydride bonds driving endergonic processes through energy coupling. ATP's energy storage arises from molecular context rather than special bonds. The ATP-ADP cycle turns over rapidly, with cells maintaining high ATP:ADP ratios and using energy charge to regulate metabolism. Other high-energy compounds like creatine phosphate provide rapid energy buffering. Understanding ATP's role as an energy currency rather than storage molecule is crucial for comprehending cellular energy dynamics."
