  "summary": "ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the universal energy currency of cells, consisting of adenine, ribose, and three phosphate groups with high-energy bonds. ATP is regenerated from ADP using energy from food breakdown through cellular respiration. It directly powers active transport (moving molecules against gradients), muscle contraction, and biosynthesis. ATP is not for long-term storage—cells maintain rapid ATP turnover through continuous cycling. Without ATP, essential cellular processes stop immediately, leading to cell death. The energy from digested food molecules, particularly glucose from carbohydrate digestion, provides the energy needed to regenerate ATP, creating a continuous energy transfer system that powers all cellular work."
