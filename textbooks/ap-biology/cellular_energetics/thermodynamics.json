  "summary": "Thermodynamics governs all biological energy transformations through three key principles: energy conservation (First Law), universal entropy increase (Second Law), and free energy determining reaction spontaneity. Cells master these laws by coupling exergonic reactions (like ATP hydrolysis, $\\Delta G < 0$) with endergonic processes (like biosynthesis, $\\Delta G > 0$) to drive metabolism forward. While creating local order, cells release heat that increases universal disorder, maintaining compliance with thermodynamic principles. The Gibbs free energy equation ($\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$) quantitatively predicts reaction spontaneity and connects to equilibrium through $\\Delta G = -RT\\ln K_{eq}$, providing the fundamental framework for understanding biological energy transformations."
