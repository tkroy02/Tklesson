Students will learn the ten enzymatic steps, energy investment and payoff phases, regulatory mechanisms, and how glycolysis serves as a central hub connecting various metabolic pathways.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Glycolysis is a ten-step enzymatic pathway occurring in the cytosol that converts one glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules, producing a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH. The pathway consists of an energy investment phase (consuming ATP) followed by an energy payoff phase (generating ATP and NADH), and it operates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.",
    "explanation": "As the most ancient and conserved metabolic pathway, glycolysis serves as the entry point for glucose metabolism in virtually all organisms. Its dual-phase structure allows controlled breakdown while maintaining energy balance. Glycolysis also provides metabolic intermediates for biosynthesis and connects to other pathways through its end product, pyruvate, making it a central crossroads in cellular metabolism."

The malate-aspartate shuttle (heart, liver) yields ~2.5 ATP/NADH, while the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (muscle, brain) yields ~1.5 ATP/NADH.

  "summary": "Glycolysis is a ten-step cytosolic pathway converting glucose to pyruvate with net production of 2 ATP and 2 NADH. The energy investment phase (steps 1-5) consumes 2 ATP to phosphorylate and cleave glucose into two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules. The energy payoff phase (steps 6-10) produces 4 ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation and 2 NADH through oxidation. Key regulatory enzymes include hexokinase/glucokinase (step 1), phosphofructokinase-1 (step 3, main control point), and pyruvate kinase (step 10). Pyruvate fate depends on conditions: aerobic oxidation to acetyl-CoA, anaerobic reduction to lactate (regenerating NAD⁺), or various biosynthetic routes. Common misconceptions include thinking glycolysis produces 4 ATP (net is 2 ATP), that NADH goes directly to mitochondria (requires shuttles), and that glycolysis is only for energy (it provides biosynthetic intermediates). This ancient pathway serves as a metabolic hub connecting carbohydrate metabolism to energy production, redox balance, and biosynthesis."
