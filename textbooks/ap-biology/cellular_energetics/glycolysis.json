Students will learn how glucose is systematically broken down to produce ATP, the roles of key electron carriers like NADH and FADH2, and how acetyl CoA connects glycolysis to subsequent energy-producing stages.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Cellular respiration systematically extracts energy from glucose through three main stages: glycolysis in the cytoplasm, the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix, and oxidative phosphorylation in the inner mitochondrial membrane, producing approximately 30-32 ATP per glucose molecule.",
    "explanation": "Glycolysis partially breaks down glucose to pyruvate, producing 2 ATP and 2 NADH. In aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters mitochondria, forms acetyl CoA, and proceeds through the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain to maximize ATP yield through oxidative phosphorylation."

  "summary": "Glycolysis breaks down glucose in the cytoplasm to pyruvate, producing net 2 ATP and 2 NADH. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters mitochondria, is converted to acetyl CoA (producing 2 NADH and 2 CO2), then proceeds through the Krebs cycle (producing 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, 2 ATP, and 4 CO2). The electron transport chain uses these reduced carriers (10 NADH and 2 FADH2 total) to create a proton gradient that drives oxidative phosphorylation, producing most of the 30-32 ATP per glucose. Anaerobic pathways like fermentation only yield 2 ATP from glycolysis while regenerating NAD+. Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are complementary processes in the global carbon cycle, with respiration releasing CO2 that photosynthesis uses to make new glucose."
