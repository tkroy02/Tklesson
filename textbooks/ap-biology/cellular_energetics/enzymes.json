    "principle": "Enzymes are protein catalysts that accelerate biochemical reactions by lowering activation energy through specific binding interactions and catalytic mechanisms, without being consumed or altering reaction equilibrium. Their exquisite specificity arises from precise three-dimensional active site structures complementary to their substrates.",

Enzymes are catalysts, not energy sources—they make reactions go faster but cannot change whether a reaction is energetically favorable or not."

  "summary": "Enzymes are protein catalysts that dramatically accelerate biochemical reactions (10⁶-10¹² fold) by lowering activation energy through multiple mechanisms including transition state stabilization, acid-base catalysis, covalent catalysis, and metal ion catalysis. The active site provides a specialized microenvironment with precise arrangement of catalytic groups that employ proximity/orientation effects and induced fit conformational changes to optimize catalysis. Enzymes exhibit varying specificity levels (absolute, group, stereochemical) through geometric and chemical complementarity. Enzyme kinetics follows Michaelis-Menten behavior characterized by Km (substrate affinity), Vmax (maximum rate), and kcat (turnover number). Cofactors (metal ions) and coenzymes (organic molecules) extend catalytic capabilities. Common misconceptions include thinking enzymes change equilibrium (they only affect rates), that enzymes provide energy (they only lower activation barriers), and that lock-and-key is the primary mechanism (induced fit is more accurate). This sophisticated catalytic machinery enables the precise control and remarkable efficiency of cellular metabolism."
