They exhibit remarkable specificity, typically catalyzing only one type of reaction. The induced fit model explains how both enzyme and substrate adjust their shapes for optimal interaction. Enzyme activity is influenced by temperature, pH, and substrate concentration, with optimal ranges for maximum efficiency. Regulation occurs through various inhibition mechanisms including competitive, noncompetitive, and allosteric regulation. Many enzymes require cofactors or coenzymes for proper function. Understanding enzyme kinetics and the consequences of enzyme dysfunction is crucial for comprehending metabolic regulation and developing treatments for enzyme-related disorders."
