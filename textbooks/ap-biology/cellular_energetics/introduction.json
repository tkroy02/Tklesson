  "summary": "Cellular energetics revolves around ATP as the universal energy currency that powers all biological work. Photosynthesis converts solar energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, while cellular respiration releases this energy to regenerate ATP. These complementary processes, along with fermentation for anaerobic conditions, maintain energy flow through ecosystems. Energy transforms from sunlight to chemical bonds to mechanical work, with continuous cycling of matter and unidirectional flow of energy. Understanding these interconnected processes reveals the fundamental unity of biological systems and their complete dependence on solar energy input."
