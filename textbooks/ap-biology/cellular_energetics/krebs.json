  "summary": "The Citric Acid Cycle completely oxidizes acetyl CoA to CO₂ in the mitochondrial matrix, producing 3 NADH, 1 FADH₂, and 1 GTP per turn while regenerating oxaloacetate. For each glucose molecule, the cycle yields 6 NADH, 2 FADH₂, 2 ATP (from GTP), and 4 CO₂. Key regulatory enzymes include citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which are inhibited by high ATP/NADH levels. The cycle serves as a metabolic hub, connecting carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism while providing intermediates for biosynthesis. Its aerobic nature requires oxygen to regenerate NAD⁺ and FAD from the reduced carriers produced. Understanding the Citric Acid Cycle is essential for comprehending cellular energy production and metabolic integration."
