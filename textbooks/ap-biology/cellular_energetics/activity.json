  "summary": "Enzyme activity is optimized within specific ranges of temperature (typically 35-40°C for human enzymes), pH (usually 6-8 for most enzymes), and substrate concentration. Temperature increases activity up to an optimum then causes denaturation. pH affects ionization states of catalytic groups. Substrate concentration follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with activity increasing until saturation (Vmax). Enzyme regulation occurs through competitive inhibition (active site competition), noncompetitive inhibition (other site binding), and allosteric regulation (conformational changes). Many enzymes require cofactors (metal ions) or coenzymes (organic molecules) for full activity. Understanding these factors is crucial for comprehending metabolic control, enzyme applications in industry and medicine, and the biochemical adaptations of organisms to different environments."
