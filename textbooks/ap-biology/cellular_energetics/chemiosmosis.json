  "summary": "Oxidative phosphorylation generates most ATP during aerobic respiration through two coupled processes: electron transport creates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and chemiosmosis uses this gradient to drive ATP synthesis via ATP synthase. NADH produces ~2.5 ATP while FADH₂ produces ~1.5 ATP due to different entry points in the chain. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor, forming water. The system is regulated by ADP availability (respiratory control) and can be uncoupled to produce heat. This highly efficient energy conversion process is essential for complex life and its dysfunction underlies various diseases."
