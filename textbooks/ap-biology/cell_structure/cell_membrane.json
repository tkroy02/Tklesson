Students will learn about the fluid mosaic model, membrane components, and how structure enables selective permeability and signaling.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The cell membrane is a dynamic, semi-permeable barrier composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins, following the fluid mosaic model. It controls substance passage, provides structural integrity, and enables cell signaling and recognition.",
    "explanation": "Membranes are not static barriers but fluid structures where components can move laterally. This fluidity allows membranes to maintain selective permeability while enabling dynamic processes like endocytosis, exocytosis, and signal transduction. The mosaic arrangement of proteins within the lipid bilayer creates specialized functional regions."

  "summary": "The cell membrane is a dynamic, selectively permeable barrier following the fluid mosaic model, composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules that spontaneously form bilayers in aqueous environments. Membrane fluidity is regulated by cholesterol content, lipid saturation, and temperature. Integral proteins span the membrane, while peripheral proteins associate with surfaces. The membrane functions as a selective barrier, transport regulator, communication interface, and structural support. Specialized domains like lipid rafts and epithelial polarized regions optimize specific functions. Common misconceptions include viewing membranes as static (they're dynamic), thinking all small molecules cross easily (charge matters), and assuming unlimited protein mobility (movement is often restricted). This fundamental understanding underpins all membrane transport and signaling processes."
