  "summary": "Unit 2 establishes cells as the fundamental units of life, with universal features including membranes, genetic systems, and metabolic machinery shared across all organisms. The prokaryotic-eukaryotic distinction represents the major organizational divide, with prokaryotes favoring simplicity and rapid adaptation, while eukaryotes enable complexity through compartmentalization. Key concepts include: the endomembrane system's coordinated function in synthesis, processing, and transport; energy organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts) with endosymbiotic origins; the cytoskeleton as an integrative structural framework; sophisticated communication systems using receptors and signal transduction; and cellular differentiation creating specialized cell types from stem cells. Common challenges include understanding scale relationships, appreciating dynamic interactions rather than static structures, and recognizing that cellular organization reflects evolutionary history with functional compromises. This cellular foundation underpins all higher levels of biological organization from tissues to ecosystems."
