  "summary": "The nucleus serves as the genetic control center of eukaryotic cells, bounded by a double-membrane nuclear envelope penetrated by nuclear pore complexes that regulate molecular traffic. Chromatin organization ranges from loosely packed euchromatin (transcriptionally active) to tightly packed heterochromatin (silent), with nucleosomes as the fundamental packaging units. The nucleolus is a membrane-less organelle dedicated to ribosomal RNA synthesis and ribosome assembly. The nuclear lamina, composed of intermediate filaments, provides structural support and organizes chromatin. Common misconceptions include viewing nuclear pores as simple holes (they're complex selective gates), considering heterochromatin as junk DNA (it has essential functions), and thinking the nucleolus is membrane-bound (it forms through phase separation). Nuclear organization dynamically responds to cellular needs while maintaining genetic integrity across cell divisions."
