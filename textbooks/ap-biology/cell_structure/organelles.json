Additional structures include proteasomes (protein degradation machines) and lipid droplets (dynamic lipid storage organelles). Common misconceptions include thinking ribosomes are membrane-bound (they're ribonucleoprotein complexes), that vacuoles are only for storage (they have diverse functions), and that all eukaryotes have centrosomes (plants and some animal cells lack them). These components work together to enable protein synthesis, structural support, cellular organization, and motility."
