Students will learn how mitochondria generate ATP through cellular respiration and how chloroplasts capture light energy for photosynthesis.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Mitochondria and chloroplasts are semi-autonomous organelles that convert energy from one form to another—mitochondria through aerobic respiration (chemical energy to ATP) and chloroplasts through photosynthesis (light energy to chemical energy)—both exhibiting evidence of their prokaryotic origins through endosymbiosis.",
    "explanation": "These organelles contain their own DNA, ribosomes, and double membranes, reflecting their evolutionary history as free-living prokaryotes. Mitochondria power eukaryotic cells through oxidative phosphorylation, while chloroplasts enable autotrophic nutrition in plants and algae. Both maintain limited genetic independence while being integrated into cellular regulation."

  "summary": "Mitochondria and chloroplasts are energy-converting organelles with prokaryotic origins through endosymbiosis. Mitochondria generate ATP through aerobic respiration via the citric acid cycle (matrix) and oxidative phosphorylation (inner membrane cristae), using an electron transport chain to create proton gradients that drive ATP synthase. Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis with light-dependent reactions (thylakoid membranes) producing ATP and NADPH, and light-independent Calvin cycle (stroma) fixing CO₂ into sugars. Both organelles contain circular DNA, 70S ribosomes, and reproduce by binary fission, supporting endosymbiotic theory. Common misconceptions include thinking mitochondria produce energy (they transform it), that chloroplasts are only in plants (they're in various photosynthetic eukaryotes), and that these organelles are completely independent (they're semi-autonomous but nuclear-dependent). Their dynamic regulation and metabolic integration are essential for cellular energy balance."
