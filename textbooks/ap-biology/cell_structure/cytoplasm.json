  "summary": "The cytoplasm includes the cytosol (fluid component with dissolved substances and metabolic pathways) and the cytoskeletal framework. Microfilaments (actin, 7 nm diameter) provide mechanical support, enable cell movement through structures like lamellipodia and filopodia, drive muscle contraction, and form the contractile ring during cytokinesis. Microtubules (tubulin, 25 nm diameter) serve as structural supports, form the mitotic spindle during cell division, and act as tracks for motor proteins (kinesins and dyneins) that transport vesicles and organelles. Intermediate filaments (tissue-specific proteins, 10 nm diameter) provide permanent mechanical strength, form the nuclear lamina, and connect cells through desmosomes. Common misconceptions include viewing the cytosol as simple salt water (it's a crowded, organized gel), thinking all cytoskeletal elements are permanent (microtubules and microfilaments are highly dynamic), and assuming motor proteins work on all filaments (they're specific to either actin or microtubules). This integrated system maintains cell shape, enables movement, and organizes intracellular components."
