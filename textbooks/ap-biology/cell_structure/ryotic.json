  "expanded_description": "This section explores the fundamental distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the two major cell types that comprise all living organisms. Students will learn the structural and functional differences that define these cell categories and their evolutionary relationships.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles and a defined nucleus, while eukaryotic cells contain extensive internal membranes that compartmentalize functions into specialized organelles, including a membrane-bound nucleus housing genetic material.",
    "explanation": "The prokaryotic-eukaryotic distinction represents the most fundamental division in cellular organization. Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) are generally smaller and simpler, while eukaryotes (protists, fungi, plants, animals) are larger and more complex, with membrane-bound organelles enabling specialized functions and greater regulatory control."

  "summary": "Prokaryotic cells (bacteria and archaea) lack membrane-bound organelles and a defined nucleus, with DNA in a nucleoid region, and are generally smaller (1-5 μm) with rapid reproduction. Eukaryotic cells (protists, fungi, plants, animals) contain membrane-bound organelles including a nucleus, mitochondria, and extensive internal membrane systems, are larger (10-100 μm), and enable cellular specialization. Key differences include genetic organization (circular vs linear chromosomes), ribosome size (70S vs 80S), and compartmentalization. The endosymbiotic theory explains mitochondrial and chloroplast origins through ancient symbiotic events. Common misconceptions include viewing prokaryotes as primitive (they're highly evolved in their niches), thinking all bacteria are harmful (most are beneficial), and misunderstanding evolutionary timing (eukaryotes and modern bacteria share ancient ancestors). This fundamental cellular distinction underlies all biological diversity and organization."
