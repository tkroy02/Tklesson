  "summary": "Cell theory establishes that all living organisms are composed of cells, cells are the basic units of structure and function, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells. All cells share fundamental properties including a cell membrane, genetic material, metabolic machinery, and the ability to maintain homeostasis. Cells remain microscopic due to surface area to volume ratio constraints and diffusion limitations that restrict efficient material exchange. Microscopy techniques from light to electron microscopy enable cell observation at different scales. Common misconceptions include thinking larger organisms have larger cells (cell size is relatively constant), that viruses are cells (they lack cellular properties), and that cell theory has no exceptions (some biological structures challenge strict interpretation). Understanding cells as the fundamental unit of life provides the foundation for all subsequent biological study."
