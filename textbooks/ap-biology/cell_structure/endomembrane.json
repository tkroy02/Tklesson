  "summary": "The endomembrane system is an interconnected network including the endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER for protein synthesis, smooth ER for lipid synthesis and detoxification), Golgi apparatus (protein modification and sorting), lysosomes (macromolecule degradation and recycling), peroxisomes (oxidative metabolism), and transport vesicles. Materials move sequentially through these compartments via vesicular transport, undergoing specific modifications that determine final destination. The Golgi processes proteins through cisternal maturation or vesicular transport models, adding carbohydrate sorting signals. Lysosomes maintain acidic environments for hydrolytic enzymes and perform autophagy for cellular renewal. Common misconceptions include thinking the system is physically continuous (it uses vesicular transport between separate compartments), that lysosomes only digest foreign materials (they primarily recycle cellular components), and that Golgi transport is passive (it's actively regulated and directional). This coordinated system enables synthesis, processing, and distribution of cellular components while maintaining compartment identity."
