  "expanded_description": "This section explores how substances move across cell membranes, examining both passive mechanisms that require no energy and active processes that consume cellular energy. Students will learn the principles governing diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, and active transport systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Membrane transport occurs through passive mechanisms (diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion) that move substances down their concentration gradients without energy input, and active mechanisms (primary and secondary active transport) that move substances against gradients using ATP or coupling to other transport processes.",
    "explanation": "The selective permeability of cell membranes regulates the movement of substances to maintain cellular homeostasis. Passive transport exploits natural concentration differences, while active transport creates and maintains gradients essential for cellular function. The specific transport mechanism employed depends on the substance's size, charge, and concentration gradient."

  "summary": "Membrane transport includes passive mechanisms (simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis) that move substances down concentration gradients without energy, and active mechanisms that move substances against gradients using ATP. Simple diffusion occurs through the lipid bilayer for small nonpolar molecules, while facilitated diffusion uses channel and carrier proteins for ions and polar molecules. Osmosis specifically describes water movement across membranes in response to solute concentration differences. Active transport includes primary active transport that directly uses ATP (Na⁺/K⁺ pump, proton pumps) and secondary active transport that couples to existing ion gradients. Bulk transport moves large substances via endocytosis (phagocytosis, pinocytosis, receptor-mediated) and exocytosis. Common misconceptions include thinking diffusion requires energy (it doesn't), misunderstanding osmosis direction (water moves toward higher solute concentration), and assuming active transport only imports substances (it moves in both directions based on cellular needs)."
