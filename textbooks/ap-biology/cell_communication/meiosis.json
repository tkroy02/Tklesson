Students will learn the stages of meiosis, mechanisms of genetic recombination, and how meiosis generates genetic diversity while ensuring proper chromosome segregation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that reduces chromosome number by half and generates genetic diversity through crossing over and independent assortment. It consists of one round of DNA replication followed by two successive divisions (meiosis I and II), producing four haploid gametes from one diploid cell.",
    "explanation": "Meiosis serves two essential functions: reduction of chromosome number to maintain ploidy across generations, and creation of genetic variation through recombination. The process involves unique features not found in mitosis, including homologous chromosome pairing, crossing over, and two rounds of division without an intervening S phase. These specialized mechanisms ensure each gamete receives a unique combination of genetic material."

  "summary": "Meiosis reduces chromosome number and generates genetic diversity through two divisions: meiosis I (reductional, separates homologs) and meiosis II (equational, separates sisters). Key features include prophase I synapsis and crossing over, protection of centromeric cohesin in meiosis I, and independent assortment creating combinatorial diversity. Genetic variation arises from crossing over (recombines linked genes) and independent assortment (random homolog segregation). Errors like nondisjunction produce aneuploid gametes causing disorders like Down syndrome. Common misconceptions include thinking meiosis II is identical to mitosis (different regulation and genetic content), that crossing over occurs between sisters (occurs between homologs), and that meiosis functions in growth (it's for gamete production). Understanding meiosis explains sexual reproduction and genetic inheritance patterns."
