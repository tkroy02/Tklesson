Students will learn about the phases of the cell cycle, key regulatory points, and how proper cell cycle control ensures accurate transmission of genetic information to daughter cells.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The cell cycle is an ordered series of events that leads to cell growth and division into two daughter cells, consisting of interphase (G1, S, G2) and mitotic phase (M). Proper progression through the cycle ensures accurate DNA replication and chromosome segregation, maintained by checkpoints that monitor completion of key events.",
    "explanation": "Cell division requires precise coordination of growth, DNA replication, and distribution of cellular components. The cycle operates as a biochemical oscillator driven by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) whose activity rises and falls in specific patterns. Checkpoints at critical transitions ensure each phase is completed properly before the next begins, preventing errors that could lead to genomic instability or cell death."

  "summary": "The cell cycle consists of interphase (G1 growth and decision, S phase DNA replication, G2 preparation) and mitotic phase (nuclear and cytoplasmic division). Cells can enter G0 quiescence or undergo terminal differentiation. Cycle duration varies by cell type, with embryonic cells having rapid cycles and specialized cells having extended or permanent arrest. The core regulatory machinery (CDK-cyclin complexes, checkpoints) is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes. Common misconceptions include thinking cells spend most time in mitosis (most time is in interphase), that G0 is just long G1 (it's a distinct state), and that checkpoints cause permanent arrest (they cause temporary pauses for repair)."
