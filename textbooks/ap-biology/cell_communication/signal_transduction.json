  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Signal transduction pathways relay information from activated receptors to target molecules through sequential molecular interactions, often involving second messengers and protein phosphorylation. These pathways amplify weak signals, integrate multiple inputs, and distribute information to appropriate cellular compartments.",
    "explanation": "Transduction pathways serve as the cell's internal wiring system, converting receptor activation into specific cellular responses. They employ modular components including kinases, phosphatases, GTP-binding proteins, and second messengers that work in coordinated cascades. The same basic components are reused in different combinations, creating diverse signaling outcomes from a limited set of molecular tools."

  "summary": "Signal transduction pathways convert receptor activation into cellular responses using second messengers (cAMP, Ca²⁺, IP₃) and phosphorylation cascades (MAPK, PKA). Second messengers provide rapid diffusion and amplification, while kinase cascades enable multi-step signal amplification and distribution. G proteins function as molecular switches controlling signal duration. Pathways integrate through cross-talk and feedback regulation to process multiple inputs. Common misconceptions include thinking pathways are linear (they form complex networks), that second messengers carry specific messages (they function as concentration signals), and that more amplification is always better (amplification is carefully regulated). Understanding transduction mechanisms reveals how cells process information and make coordinated decisions in response to environmental signals."
