Students will learn the stages of mitosis, the molecular mechanisms controlling chromosome segregation, and how errors in mitosis can lead to disease.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Mitosis is the process of nuclear division that ensures equal distribution of replicated chromosomes to two daughter nuclei, followed by cytokinesis which divides the cytoplasm. This process maintains chromosome number and genetic stability across cell generations.",
    "explanation": "Mitosis involves dramatic reorganization of cellular architecture, including chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, spindle apparatus formation, and precise chromosome movement. The process is tightly regulated by cyclin-CDK complexes and monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint to prevent aneuploidy. Successful mitosis requires coordination of microtubule dynamics, motor proteins, and chromosome-microtubule attachments."

During anaphase A, chromosomes move toward poles primarily through microtubule depolymerization at kinetochores, not active pulling. The NDC80 complex couples chromosomes to depolymerizing microtubule ends, converting microtubule dynamics into movement."

These are distinct processes that can be uncoupledâsome cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis, producing multinucleated cells."

  "summary": "Mitosis is nuclear division producing two genetically identical daughter nuclei through prophase (condensation), prometaphase (nuclear envelope breakdown), metaphase (alignment), anaphase (separation), and telophase (reformation). Chromosomes condense via condensin and sisters are held together by cohesin until anaphase. The spindle apparatus uses dynamic microtubules and motor proteins to move chromosomes. Regulation involves cyclin-CDK complexes, the spindle assembly checkpoint (prevents anaphase until all chromosomes attached), and APC/C (triggers anaphase). Common misconceptions include thinking chromosomes split at metaphase (separation is at anaphase), that spindle fibers pull chromosomes (movement involves depolymerization), and that mitosis equals cell division (mitosis is nuclear division only). Understanding mitosis reveals how cells maintain genetic stability across generations."
