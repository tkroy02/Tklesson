  "expanded_description": "This section examines the process of cytoplasmic division that follows nuclear division. Students will learn how animal and plant cells divide their cytoplasm through different mechanisms, the molecular machinery involved, and how cytokinesis is coordinated with mitosis.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Cytokinesis is the process of cytoplasmic division that physically separates a cell into two daughter cells after mitosis. Animal cells use an actomyosin contractile ring, while plant cells form a cell plate through vesicle fusion. Both mechanisms ensure proper partitioning of cytoplasm and organelles.",
    "explanation": "Cytokinesis represents the final stage of cell division, requiring precise spatial and temporal coordination with mitosis. The process involves dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization, membrane trafficking, and careful positioning of the division plane. Successful cytokinesis ensures that each daughter cell receives appropriate cytoplasmic components and maintains cell size homeostasis."

In plant cells, phragmoplast formation and cell plate initiation occur during telophase. This sequential timing ensures that chromosome segregation completes before cytoplasmic division, preventing chromosome damage or unequal distribution."

Instead, they build new cell walls through cell plate formation. The phragmoplast guides vesicle delivery to the division plane where fusion creates new membrane and deposits cell wall materials. This fundamental difference reflects the structural constraints imposed by plant cell walls and represents an evolutionary adaptation to multicellularity in the plant lineage."

  "summary": "Cytokinesis is cytoplasmic division following mitosis. Animal cells use a contractile ring of actin and myosin II that constricts via Rho GTPase signaling, forming a cleavage furrow that progresses to abscission. Plant cells form a cell plate through phragmoplast-guided vesicle fusion, depositing new cell wall material. Cytokinesis is coordinated with mitotic exit through CDK inactivation and positioned by spindle signals. Variations include asymmetric division (stem cells) and fungal septation. Common misconceptions include thinking cytokinesis happens simultaneously with mitosis (it follows), that plants use contractile rings (they use cell plates), and that cleavage furrows cut through chromosomes (positioning avoids chromosomes). Understanding cytokinesis reveals how cells achieve complete division while maintaining structural integrity."
