  "summary": "Unit 4 integrates cell communication and division as coordinated systems that enable multicellular life. Signaling networks process environmental information through receptors, transduction pathways, and second messengers to make decisions about proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The cell cycle executes these decisions through cyclin-CDK driven progression monitored by checkpoints that ensure genomic integrity. These systems coordinate in development through morphogen signaling and controlled division patterns, and their dysregulation causes diseases like cancer. Common misconceptions include thinking pathways work in isolation (they form interconnected networks), that cell cycle control is just timing (it integrates multiple information types), and that regulation reduces efficiency (it enables sophistication). Understanding these integrated systems reveals how cells achieve coordinated behavior in tissues and organisms."
