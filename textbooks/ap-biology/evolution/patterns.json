  "expanded_description": "This section explores the major patterns that emerge from evolutionary processes over time, including convergent evolution, divergent evolution, coevolution, and evolutionary rates. Students will learn to recognize these patterns in nature and understand the mechanisms that produce them.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Evolutionary processes produce characteristic patterns at macroevolutionary scales, including convergence of unrelated lineages toward similar forms, divergence of related lineages into different forms, and coordinated evolution between interacting species.",
    "explanation": "While natural selection, drift, and other mechanisms operate at the population level, their cumulative effects over geological time create recognizable patterns across the tree of life. These patterns reveal the predictability of evolutionary change under similar selective pressures and the historical constraints that shape life's diversity."
