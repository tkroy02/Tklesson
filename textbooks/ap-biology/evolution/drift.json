  "expanded_description": "This section examines genetic drift as a random evolutionary force that changes allele frequencies through chance events in small populations. Students will learn about bottleneck effects, founder effects, and how genetic drift influences evolutionary outcomes differently from natural selection.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies in populations due to sampling error in reproduction, becoming increasingly powerful in small populations and leading to loss of genetic variation, fixation of alleles, and evolutionary changes independent of adaptation.",
    "explanation": "Unlike natural selection which produces adaptations, genetic drift is a random process that can cause maladaptive changes or preserve neutral variation. Its effects are magnified in small populations and can significantly influence evolutionary trajectories, particularly during population bottlenecks or founder events."
