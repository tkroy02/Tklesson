Students will learn about molecular clocks, neutral theory, and how molecular data reveal evolutionary histories.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Molecular evolution involves changes in DNA and protein sequences over time, driven by mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection, with most evolutionary change at the molecular level being neutral or nearly neutral rather than adaptive.",
    "explanation": "The neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most evolutionary changes at the molecular level are due to the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift rather than positive selection. Molecular data provide a detailed record of evolutionary history and allow testing of evolutionary hypotheses through comparison of DNA and protein sequences."
