  "expanded_description": "This section explores how evolutionary relationships are reconstructed and represented through phylogenetic trees and classification systems. Students will learn to interpret phylogenetic trees, understand classification principles, and analyze evolutionary relationships using morphological and molecular data.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Phylogenetics reconstructs evolutionary relationships among species based on shared characteristics, revealing patterns of common descent and providing the foundation for modern biological classification that reflects evolutionary history.",
    "explanation": "Phylogenetic analysis uses character data—both morphological and molecular—to infer evolutionary trees that represent the branching pattern of descent. These trees form the basis for classification systems that organize biological diversity according to evolutionary relationships rather than just superficial similarities."
