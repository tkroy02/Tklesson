Students will analyze selection patterns, fitness concepts, and real-world examples of natural selection in action.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype, leading to the accumulation of favorable traits in populations over generations and ultimately driving adaptation to environmental conditions.",

This process explains the remarkable fit between organisms and their environments without requiring intentional design."
