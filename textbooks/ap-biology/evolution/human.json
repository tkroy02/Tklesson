    "principle": "Human evolution represents a branching lineage within the hominin clade, characterized by bipedalism, encephalization, tool use, and cultural development, with multiple hominin species coexisting and interacting throughout much of our evolutionary history.",
    "explanation": "The human evolutionary journey spans millions of years from arboreal primates to modern Homo sapiens, featuring key transitions in locomotion, brain size, technology, and social organization. Multiple lines of evidence from fossils, archaeology, and genetics converge to tell the complex story of human origins and global dispersal."
