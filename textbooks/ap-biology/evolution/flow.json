  "topic": "9.6 Gene Flow and Migration",
  "expanded_description": "This section examines gene flow as the transfer of genetic variation between populations through migration and interbreeding. Students will learn how gene flow affects genetic diversity, counteracts divergence, and influences evolutionary processes across different spatial scales.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Gene flow is the movement of alleles between populations through migration and subsequent interbreeding, acting as a cohesive evolutionary force that reduces genetic differences between populations and introduces new variation.",
    "explanation": "Unlike genetic drift and natural selection which promote population differentiation, gene flow homogenizes populations and can spread beneficial alleles throughout a species range. The balance between gene flow and local adaptation determines patterns of genetic structure across landscapes and influences speciation processes."
