  "expanded_description": "This section examines the multiple lines of evidence that support evolutionary theory, including fossil records, comparative anatomy, molecular biology, biogeography, and direct observation. Students will learn how independent sources of evidence converge to provide overwhelming support for evolution.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Evolution is supported by convergent evidence from multiple independent scientific disciplines, each providing complementary lines of evidence that collectively form an overwhelmingly strong case for descent with modification from common ancestors.",
    "explanation": "The strength of evolutionary theory lies not in any single piece of evidence, but in how diverse lines of inquiry—from paleontology to molecular biology—consistently tell the same story of life's history and relationships. This consilience of evidence makes evolution one of the most robust theories in all of science."
