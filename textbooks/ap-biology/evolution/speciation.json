  "expanded_description": "This section explores the processes by which new species form, examining the mechanisms of reproductive isolation, different modes of speciation, and the genetic changes that lead to species divergence. Students will analyze speciation patterns across various taxa and understand how biodiversity originates through evolutionary processes.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species, primarily through the development of reproductive isolation that prevents gene flow and allows independent evolutionary trajectories.",
    "explanation": "Speciation represents the bridge between microevolution within populations and macroevolution that generates biological diversity. The process involves the accumulation of genetic differences, development of reproductive barriers, and ecological differentiation, with different geographic contexts producing distinct speciation patterns."
