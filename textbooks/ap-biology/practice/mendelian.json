  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Mendelian genetics describes how traits are inherited through discrete units (genes) that segregate and assort independently during gamete formation, following predictable mathematical patterns.",
    "explanation": "Gregor Mendel's principles of segregation and independent assortment form the foundation of classical genetics. These patterns explain how genetic variation is maintained and transmitted across generations, providing the basis for understanding more complex inheritance patterns."
