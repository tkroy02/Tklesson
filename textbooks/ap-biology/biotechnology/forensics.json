  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "DNA fingerprinting exploits natural variations in non-coding regions of the genome to create unique genetic profiles that can identify individuals with extremely high probability, revolutionizing forensic science and personal identification.",
    "explanation": "Based on the fact that every individual (except identical twins) has unique DNA sequences in variable regions, DNA fingerprinting provides powerful tools for criminal investigations, missing persons identification, paternity disputes, and historical ancestry tracing through analysis of STRs, SNPs, and other genetic markers."
