    "principle": "DNA cloning involves creating identical copies of a specific DNA sequence by inserting it into a vector that can replicate within a host organism. Recombinant DNA technology enables the combination of DNA from different sources to create novel genetic constructs for research, medicine, and biotechnology applications.",
