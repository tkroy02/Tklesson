Problems include historical classification, definition application, sector analysis, and comprehensive impact assessment. Common errors include oversimplifying biotechnology as only genetic engineering, neglecting historical context, misclassifying applications by sector, and assuming automatic benefits without proper evaluation. Mastering these foundational concepts provides the framework for understanding specific biotechnological methods and applications covered in subsequent sections."
