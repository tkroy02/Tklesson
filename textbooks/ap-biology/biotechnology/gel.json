  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Gel electrophoresis separates molecules based on their size, charge, and shape by migrating them through a porous gel matrix under an electric field. The rate of migration depends on the molecule's physical properties and the gel's pore size, enabling analysis of nucleic acids and proteins.",
    "explanation": "Gel electrophoresis is a fundamental technique in molecular biology that provides a simple yet powerful method for separating and analyzing biomolecules. The technique relies on the fact that charged molecules will migrate through a gel matrix when subjected to an electric field, with smaller molecules moving faster than larger ones through the pores of the gel."
