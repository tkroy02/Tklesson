  "topic": "7.8 Gene Regulation in Eukaryotes",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the complex mechanisms of gene regulation in eukaryotic cells, including transcriptional control, chromatin modifications, and epigenetic inheritance. Students will apply their understanding of transcription factors, enhancers, DNA methylation, and histone modifications through targeted questions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Eukaryotic gene regulation occurs at multiple levels—transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational—and involves complex interactions between transcription factors, chromatin structure, and epigenetic marks. This multi-layered regulation allows for the precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression required for cellular differentiation and development.",
    "explanation": "The evolution of complex multicellular organisms required sophisticated gene regulatory mechanisms that could generate diverse cell types from identical genomes. Eukaryotes achieve this through combinatorial control using multiple transcription factors, chromatin remodeling that controls DNA accessibility, and epigenetic marks that can maintain gene expression states through cell divisions, enabling cellular memory and lineage commitment."

Problems include transcription factor analysis, enhancer-promoter interaction prediction, histone code interpretation, and DNA methylation consequence analysis. Common errors include underestimating regulatory complexity, confusing epigenetic mechanisms, and overlooking the dynamic nature of chromatin. Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding development, cellular identity, and diseases like cancer that involve regulatory dysfunction."
