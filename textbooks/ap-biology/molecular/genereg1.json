  "topic": "7.7 Gene Regulation in Prokaryotes",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the mechanisms by which prokaryotes control gene expression, primarily through operons and regulatory proteins. Students will apply their understanding of inducible and repressible systems, positive and negative control, and feedback mechanisms through targeted questions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Prokaryotes efficiently regulate gene expression primarily at the transcriptional level using operons—clusters of genes controlled by a single promoter—and regulatory proteins that respond to environmental conditions. This allows rapid adaptation to changing nutrient availability and other environmental factors.",
    "explanation": "The operon model, discovered through studies of lactose and tryptophan metabolism in E. coli, represents a fundamental paradigm of gene regulation. Prokaryotes use both negative control (repressors blocking transcription) and positive control (activators enhancing transcription) to coordinate the expression of functionally related genes, optimizing metabolic efficiency and cellular responses."

  "summary": "This section covers prokaryotic gene regulation: operon organization with promoters, operators, and structural genes; negative and positive control mechanisms; inducible (lac) and repressible (trp) systems; and complex regulatory networks integrating multiple signals. Problems include operon expression prediction under different conditions, regulatory circuit analysis, mutant phenotype determination, and coordination of metabolic pathways. Common errors include oversimplifying regulatory logic, confusing inducible and repressible systems, and underestimating the complexity of prokaryotic regulatory networks. Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding bacterial physiology, metabolic engineering, and antibiotic development."
