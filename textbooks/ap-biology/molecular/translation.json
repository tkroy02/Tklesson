  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the process of translation, where the genetic code in mRNA is decoded to synthesize proteins. Students will apply their understanding of ribosome structure, tRNA function, codon-anticodon interactions, and the stages of protein synthesis through targeted questions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Translation is the process by which the nucleotide sequence of mRNA is decoded by ribosomes to synthesize specific polypeptide chains according to the genetic code. This process involves precise interactions between mRNA, tRNA, ribosomes, and various protein factors that ensure accurate and efficient protein production.",
    "explanation": "Translation represents the final step in the central dogma of molecular biology, converting genetic information into functional proteins. The ribosome serves as a molecular machine that coordinates mRNA decoding, tRNA binding, and peptide bond formation, while the genetic code—with its redundancy and universality—ensures faithful information transfer from nucleic acids to proteins across all life forms."

  "summary": "This section covers translation: the genetic code with its triplet, degenerate, and universal properties; tRNA structure and aminoacylation; ribosome architecture with A, P, and E sites; and the three stages of protein synthesis (initiation, elongation, termination). Problems include genetic code application, tRNA-codon matching, translation energy calculations, and comparative analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Common errors include overgeneralizing genetic code universality, misunderstanding peptide bond formation mechanics, and underestimating differences between domains of life. Mastering translation concepts is essential for understanding gene expression, protein synthesis regulation, and antibiotic mechanisms."
