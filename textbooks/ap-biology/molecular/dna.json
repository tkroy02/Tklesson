  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the molecular mechanism of DNA replication, including the semiconservative model, replication machinery, and coordination of leading and lagging strand synthesis. Students will apply their understanding through targeted questions involving replication enzymes, replication fork dynamics, and fidelity mechanisms.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "DNA replication is a semiconservative process where each parental strand serves as a template for synthesis of a new complementary strand, resulting in two identical DNA molecules each containing one original and one new strand. This process requires coordinated action of multiple enzymes and proteins at replication forks.",
    "explanation": "The semiconservative nature of DNA replication ensures genetic continuity while allowing for evolutionary change. The replication machinery—including DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and ligases—works with remarkable speed and accuracy to copy billions of nucleotides with minimal errors, using the complementary base pairing rules and template-directed synthesis to maintain genetic information across generations."

Problems include experimental analysis, replication rate calculations, enzyme function comparisons, and error rate analysis. Common errors include misunderstanding primer requirements, confusing strand synthesis coordination, and overestimating replication accuracy without multiple correction systems. Mastering DNA replication concepts is essential for understanding genetic inheritance, mutation, and molecular biology techniques."
