  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the post-transcriptional modifications that convert primary RNA transcripts into mature, functional RNA molecules. Students will apply their understanding of 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, splicing, and RNA editing through targeted questions involving eukaryotic mRNA maturation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Primary RNA transcripts undergo extensive processing in eukaryotes to become functional molecules. This includes 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, intron removal by splicing, and sometimes RNA editing—modifications that enhance RNA stability, facilitate nuclear export, enable efficient translation, and increase proteomic diversity.",
    "explanation": "RNA processing represents a crucial layer of gene regulation in eukaryotes, allowing for increased complexity from a limited genome size. The processing of pre-mRNA into mature mRNA through capping, polyadenylation, and splicing not only protects the RNA and facilitates its transport and translation but also enables alternative splicing that dramatically expands proteomic diversity from a single gene."
