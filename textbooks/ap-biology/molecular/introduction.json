Students will apply their understanding of key experimental evidence through targeted questions involving transformation, bacteriophage infection, and the progression from protein to DNA as the recognized genetic molecule.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "DNA is the universal genetic material that carries hereditary information in all living organisms. This was established through a series of critical experiments that systematically eliminated proteins and other molecules as candidates for the genetic material.",
    "explanation": "The identification of DNA as genetic material represents one of the most important discoveries in biology. Through Griffith's transformation experiments, Avery's biochemical purification, and Hershey-Chase's viral labeling, scientists conclusively demonstrated that DNA—not protein—carries and transmits genetic information, founding the field of molecular genetics."

  "summary": "This introductory section covers the foundation of molecular genetics: historical experiments establishing DNA as genetic material (Griffith's transformation, Avery's purification, Hershey-Chase phage labeling), the chemical properties that make DNA suitable for genetic information storage and transmission, and Chargaff's rules that revealed base pairing relationships. Problems include experimental analysis, molecular comparisons, and base composition calculations. Common errors include misattributing knowledge to early researchers, overgeneralizing experimental conclusions, and misunderstanding the complementary roles of DNA and proteins. Mastering these foundational concepts is essential for understanding all subsequent molecular genetics topics."
