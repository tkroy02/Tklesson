  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the process of transcription, where DNA is used as a template to synthesize RNA molecules. Students will apply their understanding of transcription initiation, elongation, termination, and the key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription through targeted questions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Transcription is the process by which genetic information in DNA is copied into RNA molecules by RNA polymerase. This process involves initiation at promoter regions, elongation of the RNA chain, and termination at specific signals, with the resulting RNA serving as the intermediary between DNA and protein synthesis.",
    "explanation": "Transcription represents the first step in gene expression, converting the permanent genetic information stored in DNA into temporary RNA copies that can be translated into proteins or perform regulatory functions. The process is highly regulated and differs significantly between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, reflecting their different genomic organizations and regulatory needs."

Problems include promoter analysis, strand determination, transcription rate calculations, and comparison of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Common errors include confusing template and coding strands, misunderstanding polymerase properties, and overlooking differences between transcription in different organisms. Mastering transcription concepts is essential for understanding gene expression regulation and the central dogma of molecular biology."
