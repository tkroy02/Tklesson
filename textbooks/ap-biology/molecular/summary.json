  "topic": "7.12 Unit 7 Summary and Key Concepts",
  "expanded_description": "This section provides a comprehensive review and synthesis of key concepts from Unit 7: Molecular Genetics. Students will apply their integrated understanding of DNA structure, replication, transcription, translation, gene regulation, mutations, and molecular techniques through targeted review problems that span multiple concepts and require synthesis of different genetic principles.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Molecular genetics provides the fundamental framework for understanding how genetic information is stored, expressed, regulated, and manipulated. The central dogma—DNA to RNA to protein—represents the core flow of genetic information, while modern technologies enable precise analysis and modification of this information for research, medicine, and biotechnology.",
    "explanation": "The principles of molecular genetics connect the chemical nature of DNA with biological function, demonstrating how nucleotide sequences encode information that directs cellular processes. From the double helix structure that enables faithful replication to the regulatory networks that control gene expression, molecular genetics reveals the mechanisms underlying inheritance, evolution, and the molecular basis of life itself."
