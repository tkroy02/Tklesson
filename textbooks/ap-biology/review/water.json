Include the molecular basis for this property in your answer.\n\n**Answer:** Water's high specific heat capacity (4.184 J/g°C) allows mammals to absorb substantial heat with minimal temperature change. Molecularly, this occurs because heat energy first breaks hydrogen bonds between water molecules rather than increasing molecular motion. In biological systems, blood (mostly water) circulates heat throughout the body, while sweating utilizes water's high heat of vaporization (2260 J/g) to remove excess heat through evaporative cooling."

These specific oxygen atoms come from water, not CO₂.\n\n**Carbon-water interaction:** In the Calvin cycle, water provides hydrogen atoms (originally from water splitting) that reduce 3-phosphoglycerate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, while carbon from CO₂ is incorporated into organic molecules.\n\n**Calculation:** The balanced equation for glucose production:\n6CO₂ + 12H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ + 6H₂O\nNet: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\nHowever, 12 water molecules are actually split to provide electrons for NADP⁺ reduction, releasing 6 O₂ molecules."
