A drug company wants to develop a β-agonist that doesn't cause desensitization—what molecular strategy might they use?\n\n**Answer:** **Active receptor fraction calculation:**\nAssuming first-order kinetics for receptor inactivation:\n\n**Without desensitization:**\nk_inactivation = ln(2) / t₁/₂ = 0.693 / 30 s = 0.0231 s⁻¹\nAt steady state: Fraction_active ≈ k_activation / (k_activation + k_inactivation)\nIf k_activation >> k_inactivation, Fraction_active ≈ 1\n\n**With desensitization:**\nk_inactivation = 0.693 / 3 s = 0.231 s⁻¹\nIf k_activation remains the same, Fraction_active decreases ~10-fold\n\n**Drug development strategy:**\nDesign β-agonists that:\n1.

Propose a molecular mechanism for this AND logic gate behavior. Calculate the activation threshold if signal 1 contributes 0-100 units and signal 2 contributes 0-100 units, with activation requiring the product to exceed 2500.\n\n**Answer:** **Molecular mechanism for AND gate:**\n1. **TCR signaling** activates NFAT transcription factor\n2. **CD28 signaling** activates AP-1 transcription factor\n3. **Full activation** requires NFAT:AP-1 complex formation\n4. Without both signals, incomplete transcription factor activation occurs\n5. This ensures immune responses only to genuine threats with both antigen and costimulation\n\n**Activation threshold calculation:**\nActivation when: (Signal 1) × (Signal 2) > 2500\n\nExamples:\n- Signal 1 = 10, Signal 2 = 10: Product = 100 → No activation\n- Signal 1 = 50, Signal 2 = 50: Product = 2500 → Threshold\n- Signal 1 = 80, Signal 2 = 40: Product = 3200 → Activation\n- Signal 1 = 100, Signal 2 = 25: Product = 2500 → Threshold\n\nThis multiplicative requirement ensures specificity and prevents autoimmunity from single signals."
