  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Biological systems obey the laws of thermodynamics, converting energy from one form to another through controlled pathways. Energy flows from high-energy donors to lower-energy acceptors, with some energy being lost as heat in each conversion, driving essential processes like chemical synthesis, active transport, and mechanical work.",

Understanding energy conversion efficiency, the role of electron carriers, and the coupling of exergonic and endergonic reactions reveals how organisms harness energy while maintaining thermodynamic feasibility."
