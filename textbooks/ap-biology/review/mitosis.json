  "expanded_description": "This section provides practice problems and detailed explanations covering the processes of cell division in eukaryotic cells. Students will apply their understanding of mitotic and meiotic cell cycles, chromosome dynamics, spindle mechanics, and cell cycle regulation through targeted questions involving genetic inheritance, cell cycle control, and developmental biology.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Cell division encompasses two distinct but related processes: mitosis, which produces genetically identical daughter cells for growth and repair, and meiosis, which generates genetic diversity through gamete formation. Both processes require precise coordination of chromosome duplication, segregation, and cytokinesis, governed by conserved regulatory mechanisms.",
    "explanation": "The evolution of mitotic and meiotic cell cycles represents fundamental adaptations for multicellularity and sexual reproduction. Understanding these processes reveals how genetic information is faithfully transmitted, how genetic diversity is generated, and how cell division is coordinated with development, tissue homeostasis, and environmental cues."

Explain why the actual biological system is more efficient and how tension sensing improves accuracy.\n\n**Answer:** **Probability calculation:**\nFor each chromosome: P(proper) = 0.5\nFor 46 independent chromosomes: P(all proper) = (0.5)⁴⁶ ≈ 1.4 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\nThis extremely low probability shows random attachment is insufficient.\n\n**Biological efficiency mechanisms:**\n1. **Search and capture:** Dynamic microtubules rapidly probe space\n2. **Tension sensing:** Proper bipolar attachment creates tension across sister kinetochores\n3. **Error correction:** Aurora B kinase detaches improperly attached microtubules\n4. **Spatial organization:** Chromosomes are pre-positioned in prometaphase\n\n**Tension sensing role:**\n- Proper attachment creates mechanical tension across centromeres\n- Tension stabilizes microtubule attachments\n- Lack of tension activates checkpoint proteins (Mad2, BubR1)\n- This ensures only properly aligned chromosomes satisfy the checkpoint\n- Reduces aneuploidy risk to <10⁻⁵ per division"
