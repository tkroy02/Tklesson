  "expanded_description": "This section explores proteins, the most diverse and functionally versatile macromolecules in living systems. Students will learn how amino acid sequences determine protein structure and how structure dictates biological function.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Proteins are polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, with their specific three-dimensional structures determining their diverse biological functions. The sequence of amino acids dictates how the protein folds into its functional conformation.",
    "explanation": "Proteins exhibit four levels of structural organization: primary (sequence), secondary (local folding), tertiary (overall 3D shape), and quaternary (multiple chain assembly). This hierarchical organization enables proteins to perform catalytic, structural, transport, signaling, and defensive roles."

  "summary": "Proteins are polymers of amino acids joined by peptide bonds through dehydration synthesis. The primary structure (amino acid sequence) determines all higher levels of organization. Secondary structures include alpha helices and beta sheets stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional shape stabilized by various interactions, while quaternary structure involves multiple polypeptide chains. Proteins perform diverse functions including catalysis (enzymes), structure (collagen), transport (hemoglobin), defense (antibodies), and signaling (hormones). Common misconceptions include thinking proteins are rigid (they're dynamic), that all proteins have quaternary structure (many don't), and that denaturation breaks peptide bonds (it disrupts weak interactions only). The sequence-structure-function relationship is fundamental to understanding protein biology."
