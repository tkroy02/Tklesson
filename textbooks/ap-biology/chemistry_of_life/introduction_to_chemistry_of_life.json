  "summary": "Chemistry provides the fundamental foundation for understanding biology, as all life processes result from the properties and interactions of atoms and molecules. The principle that 'molecular structure determines function' operates at all biological levels, from enzyme active sites to DNA double helix formation. Living organisms are composed primarily of SPONCH elements (Sulfur, Phosphorus, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon, Hydrogen), each serving specific roles based on their chemical properties. While biological systems exhibit emergent properties not predictable from chemistry alone, these properties arise from and operate according to chemical principles. Common misconceptions include thinking living organisms violate chemical laws (they operate within them), that chemistry alone explains all biology (emergent properties require study at higher levels), and that biological molecules are fundamentally different (they follow standard chemical principles). Understanding this chemical foundation is essential for studying subsequent biological topics."
