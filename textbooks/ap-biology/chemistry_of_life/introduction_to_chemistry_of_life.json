  "summary": "Chemistry provides the fundamental foundation for understanding biology. All living organisms are composed of matter, primarily the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, which form the molecules of life. Every biological process, from energy production to information transfer, is a chemical reaction, often facilitated by enzymes. The unique properties of water and the specific nature of chemical bonds (covalent, ionic, hydrogen) create the precise conditions and structures necessary for life. Understanding these chemical principles allows us to explain how organisms maintain internal balance (homeostasis) and enables applications in medicine and biotechnology. In essence, to study biology is to study the chemistry of living systems."
