  "summary": "Unit 1 establishes that biological systems operate through fundamental chemical principles where molecular structure determines function. The SPONCH elements form the atomic basis of life, with carbon's bonding versatility enabling molecular diversity. Water's unique properties create the aqueous environment for biochemistry. Macromolecules—carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids—assemble through dehydration synthesis and disassemble through hydrolysis, with ATP coupling these processes to energy flow. Proteins exhibit hierarchical structure (primary→secondary→tertiary→quaternary) that determines their diverse functions. Nucleic acids store and transfer genetic information through complementary base pairing. Common misconceptions include thinking chemistry alone explains biology (emergent properties require higher-level study), that biological molecules violate chemical laws (they operate within them), and that macromolecules function independently (they work in integrated networks). Understanding these chemical foundations is essential for studying subsequent biological topics, as molecular interactions drive all life processes from metabolism to inheritance."
