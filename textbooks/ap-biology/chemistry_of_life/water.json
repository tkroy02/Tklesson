  "summary": "Water's polar molecular structure and extensive hydrogen bonding create properties essential for life. Cohesion (water-water attraction) enables surface tension and water transport in plants, while adhesion (water-other attraction) supports capillary action. High specific heat stabilizes temperatures in organisms and ecosystems, and high heat of vaporization enables efficient evaporative cooling. As a universal solvent, water dissolves polar and ionic compounds while excluding nonpolar substances, driving hydrophobic interactions that organize biological structures. Common misconceptions include thinking ice floats because it's lighter (it's less dense due to hydrogen bonding), that water dissolves everything (only polar/ionic substances), and that hydrogen bonds are permanent (they're dynamic). These properties make water the medium in which life evolved and upon which all organisms depend."
