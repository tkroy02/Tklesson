  "summary": "Acids donate H⁺ ions while bases accept them, with pH measuring hydrogen ion concentration on a logarithmic scale (pH = -log[H⁺]). Biological systems maintain specific pH ranges optimized for different compartments and enzymes. Buffers, typically weak acid-base conjugate pairs, resist pH changes by absorbing or releasing H⁺ ions. The bicarbonate system buffers blood pH, while proteins and phosphate systems buffer intracellular pH. Common misconceptions include underestimating pH scale magnitude (each unit represents 10-fold concentration change), overestimating buffer capacity (they minimize but don't prevent pH changes), and confusing acid strength with pH (strength indicates dissociation, pH indicates H⁺ concentration). Precise pH control is essential for protein structure, enzyme function, and cellular processes."
