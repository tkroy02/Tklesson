  "summary": "Carbon's ability to form four covalent bonds and link to other carbon atoms creates diverse molecular skeletons that form the basis of organic molecules. Functional groups—specific clusters of atoms including hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl groups—attach to carbon skeletons and determine molecular properties and biological functions. Isomers (structural, stereoisomers, enantiomers) are compounds with the same formula but different arrangements, leading to distinct properties. Common misconceptions include thinking all organic molecules are biological (organic chemistry includes both natural and synthetic compounds), that functional groups don't affect shape (they determine molecular geometry), and that isomers have identical properties (they can have dramatically different biological activities). Understanding carbon chemistry and functional groups provides the foundation for studying biological macromolecules."
