  "summary": "Carbohydrates range from simple sugars (monosaccharides like glucose and fructose) to disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, maltose) and complex polysaccharides. Monosaccharides polymerize through dehydration synthesis forming glycosidic linkages. Storage polysaccharides include starch (plants) and glycogen (animals), both composed of glucose with α-linkages. Structural polysaccharides include cellulose (plant cell walls, β-linkages) and chitin (arthropod exoskeletons). Carbohydrates serve as energy sources, structural materials, and cellular recognition markers. Common misconceptions include thinking all sugars are unhealthy (complex carbohydrates are essential), that starch and cellulose are similar (different linkages create different properties), and that carbohydrates only provide energy (they have structural and signaling roles). Understanding carbohydrate structure and function is essential for studying metabolism, nutrition, and cellular biology."
