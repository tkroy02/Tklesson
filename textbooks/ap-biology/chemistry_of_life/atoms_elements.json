  "summary": "Atoms consist of protons (positive charge, define element identity), neutrons (neutral, affect mass and stability), and electrons (negative charge, determine chemical properties). Elements are pure substances with unique atomic numbers, organized in the periodic table based on electron configurations and chemical properties. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that differ in neutron number, having identical chemical behavior but different masses and nuclear properties. Atomic mass is a weighted average of naturally occurring isotopes, explaining why most elements have decimal atomic masses. Common misconceptions include thinking electrons orbit like planets (they exist in probability clouds), that isotopes are different elements (they're the same element with different masses), and that atomic mass should equal mass number (it's an average of isotopic mixtures). Understanding atomic structure is fundamental to explaining chemical bonding and biological molecules."
