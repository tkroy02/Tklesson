  "summary": "Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides consisting of nitrogenous bases, pentose sugars, and phosphate groups. DNA has deoxyribose and thymine, forming a stable double helix with complementary base pairing (A-T, G-C) for genetic storage. RNA has ribose and uracil, existing as single strands with diverse functions including mRNA (information transfer), tRNA (amino acid delivery), rRNA (ribosomal catalysis), and regulatory RNAs. Genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein through transcription and translation using the universal genetic code. Common misconceptions include thinking RNA is just a DNA copy (it has distinct structures and functions), that DNA makes proteins directly (RNA intermediates are required), and that all genes code for proteins (many produce functional RNAs). Nucleic acids enable inheritance, gene expression, and cellular regulation through their specific molecular structures and interactions."
