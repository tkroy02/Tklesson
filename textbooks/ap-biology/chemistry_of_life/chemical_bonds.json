  "summary": "Chemical bonds range from strong covalent and ionic bonds that create molecular skeletons to weak hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces that stabilize larger structures. Covalent bonds involve electron sharing and form the backbone of organic molecules. Ionic bonds result from electron transfer and create ions essential for electrical signaling. Hydrogen bonds provide specificity in DNA base pairing and protein folding. Van der Waals forces contribute to molecular recognition and hydrophobic interactions. Common misconceptions include overestimating hydrogen bond strength (they're weak but specific), underestimating van der Waals forces (collectively important), and misunderstanding covalent bond stability (they're strong and rarely break in biology). The hierarchy of bond strengths and specificities enables the complex molecular interactions that drive biological processes."
