  "topic": "1.8 Lipids (Fats, phospholipids, steroids, and energy storage)",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores lipids, a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules that serve as energy stores, structural components of membranes, and signaling molecules. Students will learn how lipid structure relates to function in biological systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Lipids are hydrophobic molecules composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen, serving as concentrated energy stores, forming cellular membranes, and functioning as signaling molecules. Their insolubility in water defines their biological roles.",
    "explanation": "The hydrophobic nature of lipids arises from their nonpolar hydrocarbon chains, which exclude water and drive the self-assembly of membranes. Different lipid classes—fats, phospholipids, steroids—have distinct structures tailored to their specific biological functions."

  "summary": "Lipids are hydrophobic molecules that include fats (energy storage), phospholipids (membrane formation), and steroids (signaling and structure). Fats store energy efficiently (9 kcal/gram) as triglycerides with saturated (solid) or unsaturated (liquid) fatty acids. Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules that spontaneously form bilayers, creating cellular membranes with selective permeability. Steroids have a four-ring structure and include cholesterol (membrane component) and steroid hormones (signaling molecules). Common misconceptions include thinking all fats are unhealthy (essential fatty acids are required), that cholesterol is always harmful (it's essential for membranes and hormones), and that membranes are static (they're dynamic and fluid). Lipid diversity enables their multiple essential roles in energy storage, structural organization, and cellular communication."
