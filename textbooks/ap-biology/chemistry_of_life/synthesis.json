  "expanded_description": "This section explores the fundamental chemical processes that build and break down biological macromolecules. Students will learn how dehydration synthesis creates polymers from monomers and how hydrolysis reverses this process for digestion and recycling.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Macromolecules are assembled through dehydration synthesis (condensation) reactions that remove water to form covalent bonds between monomers, and disassembled through hydrolysis reactions that add water to break these bonds.",
    "explanation": "These complementary processes govern the dynamic balance of synthesis and degradation in living systems. Dehydration synthesis requires energy input to build complex molecules, while hydrolysis releases energy and monomers for reuse. The same fundamental chemistry applies to carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids."

  "summary": "Dehydration synthesis builds macromolecules by removing water to form covalent bonds between monomers, requiring energy input (ATP) and specific enzymes. Hydrolysis breaks down macromolecules by adding water to cleave these bonds, often releasing energy. Proteins form through peptide bond synthesis and break via proteolysis. Carbohydrates join through glycosidic linkages and separate via carbohydrate digestion. Nucleic acids polymerize via phosphodiester bonds and depolymerize through nuclease action. Common misconceptions include thinking hydrolysis requires energy (it typically releases energy), that the same enzymes work both directions (separate enzymes control synthesis and breakdown), and that these are simple reversible reactions (they're distinct metabolic pathways). These complementary processes maintain the dynamic turnover of biological molecules essential for growth, maintenance, and energy metabolism."
