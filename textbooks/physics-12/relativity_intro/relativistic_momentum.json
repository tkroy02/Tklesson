          "principle": "Foundations of Relativistic Momentum",
          "statement": "Relativistic momentum is derived from the requirement that momentum conservation holds in all inertial frames, leading to a modified definition: Why Classical Momentum Fails: p = mv is not conserved in all frames under Lorentz transformations; Would allow speeds exceeding c if force applied indefinitely; Inconsistent with time dilation and length contraction. Derivation from Conservation Requirement: Consider elastic collision in different frames; Require momentum conservation in all inertial frames; This forces the definition p = γmv; Alternatively, from four-vector formalism. Mathematical Definition: p = γmv where γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²); Vector form: p⃗ = γmv⃗; Magnitude: p = γmv; For v << c, γ ≈ 1, so p ≈ mv (classical limit). Properties and Behavior: As v → 0: p → mv (classical behavior); As v → c: γ → ∞, so p → ∞ (unbounded increase); Always p > mv for v > 0; Never allows v ≥ c for massive particles. Transformation Between Frames: Momentum transforms via Lorentz transformations; Not simply additive like classical velocity; Components parallel and perpendicular to relative motion transform differently; Consistent with velocity addition formula. Force and Momentum: Relativistic force: F⃗ = dp⃗/dt; Not simply F⃗ = ma⃗; Acceleration not generally parallel to force; Complicated dynamics but consistent. Proper Time Formulation: Using proper time τ: p⃗ = m dr⃗/dτ; This is Lorentz invariant; Connects to four-vector formalism. Experimental Verification: Particle accelerators: momentum measurements agree with p = γmv; Cosmic rays: high-energy particles have enormous momentum; Conservation in particle collisions; Fundamental for modern physics. Physical Interpretation: Represents 'quantity of motion' modified for relativity; Related to wavelength in quantum mechanics (p = h/λ); Connects to energy through E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Why This Definition Works: Preserves conservation laws in all frames; Consistent with Lorentz transformations; Reduces to classical form at low speeds; Prevents superluminal speeds; Verified by all experiments.",

  "summary": "Relativistic momentum is defined as p = γmv where γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²), preserving conservation laws in all inertial frames and preventing speeds from reaching or exceeding light speed. This formulation reduces to classical momentum p = mv at low speeds but increases without bound as v approaches c. The energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)² unifies energy, momentum, and mass, with the invariant mass m providing a frame-independent quantity. Relativistic momentum is essential for particle accelerator design, detector operation, and understanding high-energy phenomena, with extensive experimental verification from particle physics. The concept demonstrates how classical mechanics emerges as a low-speed approximation to the more fundamental relativistic framework."
