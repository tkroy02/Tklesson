Inertial Reference Frames: Frames where Newton's first law holds: objects at rest stay at rest, moving objects continue with constant velocity; No acceleration of the frame itself; All inertial frames move with constant velocity relative to each other; Newton's laws have the same form in all inertial frames. Non-Inertial Reference Frames: Accelerating or rotating frames; Newton's first law appears violated; Fictitious forces appear (centrifugal, Coriolis, Euler); Useful for practical problems but require careful treatment. Galilean Transformations: Mathematical relations between coordinates in different inertial frames: Position: $x' = x - vt$, $y' = y$, $z' = z$; Time: $t' = t$ (absolute time); Velocity: $u' = u - v$ (Galilean velocity addition); Acceleration: $a' = a$ (invariant acceleration). Galilean Principle of Relativity: The laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial frames; No mechanical experiment can detect absolute motion; Only relative motion between frames matters; This works perfectly for mechanical phenomena but fails for electromagnetism. Relative Motion Analysis: Objects have different velocities in different frames; Trajectories appear different from different perspectives; Physical outcomes (collisions, forces) remain the same; Choice of frame is matter of convenience. Fictitious Forces in Non-Inertial Frames: Centrifugal force: outward force in rotating frames; Coriolis force: depends on velocity in rotating frames; Euler force: from angular acceleration; These are consequences of frame acceleration, not real forces. Practical Frame Choices: Laboratory frame: fixed to Earth (approximately inertial); Center-of-mass frame: simplifies collision problems; Rotating frame: useful for Earth-based problems; Each choice has advantages for specific problems.",

Second Postulate (Constancy of Light Speed): The speed of light in vacuum c is constant and independent of the motion of the source or observer; c = 299,792,458 m/s in all inertial frames; This contradicts Galilean velocity addition. Historical Context and Motivation: Maxwell's equations predicted constant light speed; Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect ether drift; Einstein resolved conflict by modifying concepts of space and time rather than electromagnetism. Relativity of Simultaneity: Two events simultaneous in one frame may not be simultaneous in another; Depends on the spatial separation and relative motion; Fundamental to understanding Lorentz transformations; Example: lightning strikes on moving train. Time Dilation: Moving clocks run slower than stationary ones: $\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta t_0$ where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$; Proper time Δt₀ is time measured in clock's rest frame; Verified by particle decays, atomic clocks on airplanes. Length Contraction: Objects contract in their direction of motion: $L = L_0/\\gamma$; Proper length L₀ is length measured in object's rest frame; Affects only dimension parallel to motion; Reciprocal effect between frames. Lorentz Transformations: Replace Galilean transformations: $x' = \\gamma(x - vt)$, $t' = \\gamma(t - vx/c^2)$; Mix space and time coordinates; Reduce to Galilean form when v << c; Preserve spacetime interval. Spacetime Concept: Space and time unified into four-dimensional spacetime; Different observers 'slice' spacetime differently; Events have invariant spacetime interval: $s^2 = (c\\Delta t)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2$.

  "summary": "Frames of reference provide the coordinate systems for describing motion, with inertial frames (constant velocity) being equivalent for physical laws according to the principle of relativity. Galilean relativity works for everyday speeds but fails for light. Einstein's special relativity, based on the constancy of light speed and equivalence of inertial frames, reveals that time dilates (moving clocks run slow), lengths contract in motion, simultaneity is relative, and mass and energy are equivalent (E=mc²). These effects, verified experimentally and crucial for technologies like GPS and particle accelerators, become significant at speeds approaching light speed and fundamentally change our understanding of space and time as a unified spacetime continuum."
