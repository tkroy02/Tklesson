Mathematical Core - Lorentz Transformations: x' = γ(x - vt), t' = γ(t - vx/c²); Mix space and time coordinates; Preserve spacetime interval s² = (cΔt)² - (Δx)²; All relativistic effects derive from these transformations. Derived Effects: Time Dilation: Δt = γΔt₀ from comparing time intervals in different frames; Length Contraction: L = L₀/γ from simultaneous measurement requirement; Relativity of Simultaneity: events simultaneous in one frame not in another. Dynamics Framework: Relativistic Momentum: p = γmv preserves conservation laws; Energy-Momentum Relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)² unifies concepts; Mass-Energy Equivalence: E = mc² for rest energy. Kinematic Relationships: Velocity Addition: u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²) ensures c is limit; Rapidity: φ = artanh(v/c) for simpler composition of boosts. Spacetime Geometry: Unified four-dimensional spacetime; Different observers slice spacetime differently; Light cones define causal structure; Proper time as invariant along worldlines. Experimental Verification: Michelson-Morley: no ether drift; Particle accelerators: time dilation, momentum; Atomic clocks: Hafele-Keating experiment; GPS: daily relativity corrections; Muon decay: atmospheric penetration. Internal Consistency: All effects are mutually consistent; No contradictions when properly applied; Resolves apparent paradoxes (twin paradox); Reduces to classical physics for v << c. Philosophical Implications: No privileged reference frame; Space and time are relative but spacetime is absolute; Mass and energy equivalent; Ultimate speed limit protects causality. Why the Framework Works: Based on simple, testable postulates; Mathematical consistency guarantees no contradictions; Experimental verification confirms predictions; Explains previously mysterious phenomena.",
