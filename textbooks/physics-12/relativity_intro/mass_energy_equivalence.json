          "statement": "E=mc² represents one of the most profound insights in physics, with multiple derivations and deep implications: Einstein's Original Derivation (1905): Consider object emitting two equal light pulses in opposite directions; From conservation of momentum, object remains at rest; But energy is lost from system; From relativity, this energy loss corresponds to mass decrease Δm = ΔE/c²; Thus E=mc². Work-Energy Theorem Derivation: Work done on relativistic particle: dE = F·dx = (dp/dt)·dx = v·dp; From p=γmv, integrate to find total energy; Result: E=γmc²; For v=0, E₀=mc² (rest energy). Four-Vector Formalism: Four-momentum P = (E/c, pₓ, p_y, p_z); Lorentz invariant: P·P = m²c²; Thus E² - p²c² = m²c⁴; For p=0, E=mc². Physical Interpretation: Mass and energy are equivalent; Mass is concentrated form of energy; Energy has gravitational mass; Conversion possible in certain processes. Rest Energy Concept: E₀=mc² is energy of object at rest; Even stationary objects contain enormous energy; 1 kg matter has energy 9×10¹⁶ J (equivalent to 21 megatons TNT). Mass-Energy Conservation: In isolated systems, total mass-energy conserved; Mass can convert to other forms of energy; Total relativistic energy always conserved. Historical Significance: Resolved mystery of radioactive energy source; Explained stellar energy production; Revolutionized understanding of energy and matter. Why c² Appears: c² is conversion factor between mass and energy units; In SI: 1 kg = 9×10¹⁶ J; Large factor explains why nuclear energy is so potent; In natural units (c=1), E=m directly. Experimental Verification: Nuclear reactions show mass defect; Particle-antiparticle annihilation; All consistent with E=mc².",

  "summary": "Einstein's mass-energy equivalence E=mc² establishes that mass and energy are interchangeable, with mass representing a highly concentrated form of energy. The equation reveals that ordinary matter contains enormous energy, with 1 kilogram equivalent to 9×10¹⁶ joules. This principle explains the energy source in nuclear reactions, where small mass defects (0.1-0.7% of mass) convert to large energy releases, making nuclear energy millions of times more potent than chemical energy. Applications span nuclear power, medical imaging (PET scans), radiation therapy, particle physics research, and understanding stellar processes. E=mc² continues to underpin modern technologies while demonstrating the profound unity of physical concepts and inspiring ongoing research into matter-energy transformations."
