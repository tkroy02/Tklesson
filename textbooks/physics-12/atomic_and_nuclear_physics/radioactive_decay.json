Characteristics: Discrete energy spectrum (monoenergetic); Occurs primarily in heavy nuclei (A > 150); Q-value: $Q_\\alpha = [m(X) - m(Y) - m(\\alpha)]c^2$; Explained by quantum tunneling through Coulomb barrier; Geiger-Nuttall law relates decay constant to alpha energy. Beta Decay: Three types that transform neutrons and protons: Beta-minus (β⁻): $n \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e$, $^A_ZX \\rightarrow ^A_{Z+1}Y + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e$; Beta-plus (β⁺): $p \\rightarrow n + e^+ + \\nu_e$, $^A_ZX \\rightarrow ^A_{Z-1}Y + e^+ + \\nu_e$; Electron Capture (EC): $p + e^- \\rightarrow n + \\nu_e$, $^A_ZX + e^- \\rightarrow ^A_{Z-1}Y + \\nu_e$. Characteristics: Continuous energy spectrum (shared between electron and neutrino); Requires neutrino hypothesis to conserve energy and angular momentum; Governed by weak interaction; Q-value determines maximum electron energy. Gamma Decay: Emission of high-energy photons from excited nuclear states: $^A_ZX^* \\rightarrow ^A_ZX + \\gamma$. Characteristics: Discrete energy lines; Follows electromagnetic selection rules ($\\Delta I = 0, \\pm 1$, no 0→0); Competing process: internal conversion (direct electron ejection). Internal Conversion: Alternative to gamma decay where excitation energy is transferred directly to an atomic electron: $^A_ZX^* \\rightarrow ^A_ZX + e^-$. Creates characteristic electron lines and X-rays. Decay Energy and Q-values: The Q-value is the energy released in decay: $Q = [m(\\text{parent}) - m(\\text{daughters})]c^2$; Must be positive for spontaneous decay; Determines decay rates and particle energies. Conservation Laws: All decays conserve: Energy (including rest mass energy); Linear and angular momentum; Electric charge; Nucleon number; Lepton number (in beta decay). The different decay modes allow nuclei to move toward stability by adjusting their proton-neutron ratio, mass, and excitation energy.",

Integration gives the exponential decay law: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$. This describes the number of atoms remaining at time t. Activity: The activity A is the decay rate: $A(t) = -\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\lambda N(t) = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}$, where A₀ = λN₀. The SI unit is becquerel (Bq) = 1 decay per second. The traditional unit is curie (Ci) = 3.7 × 10¹⁰ Bq. Half-Life: The half-life t₁/₂ is the time for half the atoms to decay: $N(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{N_0}{2} = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t_{1/2}}$. Solving gives: $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\lambda} = \\frac{0.693}{\\lambda}$. After n half-lives, the fraction remaining is (1/2)ⁿ. Mean Lifetime: The mean lifetime τ is the average time until decay: $\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. The relationship is: $t_{1/2} = \\tau \\ln 2$. Statistical Nature: Decay is random and statistical for individual atoms; The exponential law emerges from large numbers; The probability that a specific atom decays in time dt is λdt; This quantum randomness is fundamental, not due to measurement limitations. Decay Calculations: Common problems include: Finding remaining activity after given time: $A = A_0 (1/2)^{t/t_{1/2}}$; Time for activity to reach certain level: $t = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(A_0/A)}{\\ln 2}$; Determining original activity from current measurement; Mixed source activities. Applications of Kinetics: Radiometric dating (¹⁴C, K-Ar, U-Pb); Medical dosimetry and treatment planning; Nuclear power fuel management; Environmental monitoring; Scientific research using tracers.

          "statement": "Radioactive decay occurs in series where unstable parent nuclides decay through chains of daughters to stable endpoints, with numerous practical applications: Natural Decay Series: Four natural series exist from primordial nuclides: Uranium Series: ²³⁸U → ²⁰⁶Pb (8 alpha, 6 beta decays); Thorium Series: ²³²Th → ²⁰⁸Pb (6 alpha, 4 beta decays); Actinium Series: ²³⁵U → ²⁰⁷Pb (7 alpha, 4 beta decays); Neptunium Series: ²³⁷Np → ²⁰⁹Bi (extinct naturally). Each series has characteristic mass numbers: A=4n (Thorium), A=4n+2 (Uranium), A=4n+3 (Actinium). Secular Equilibrium: When a very long-lived parent (t₁/₂ >> daughter's t₁/₂) decays through short-lived daughters, secular equilibrium is established: $A_{daughter} = A_{parent}$ (activities equal). The Bateman equations describe the complete time evolution of all species in a decay chain. This equilibrium is used to extract daughter activities from natural sources. Medical Applications: Diagnostics: Gamma emitters (⁹⁹ᵐTc, ¹²³I) for imaging; Positron emitters (¹⁸F, ¹¹C) for PET scanning; Therapy: Beta emitters (⁹⁰Y, ¹³¹I) for cancer treatment; Brachytherapy: implanted sources (¹²⁵I, ¹⁰³Pd). Industrial and Research Applications: Radiography: ¹⁹²Ir, ⁶⁰Co for weld inspection; Tracers: ³H, ¹⁴C for biological and chemical studies; Thickness gauging: beta sources for manufacturing control; Sterilization: ⁶⁰Co for medical equipment. Dating Methods: Radiocarbon: ¹⁴C (t₁/₂=5730 yr) for archaeology; Potassium-argon: ⁴⁰K→⁴⁰Ar (t₁/₂=1.25×10⁹ yr) for geology; Uranium-lead: ²³⁸U→²⁰⁶Pb for oldest rocks; Fission track: uranium fission damage in minerals. Nuclear Power and Weapons: Fission reactors use ²³⁵U, ²³⁹Pu chain reactions; Breeder reactors convert ²³⁸U to ²³⁹Pu; Nuclear weapons use rapid chain reactions. Safety and Environmental Applications: Smoke detectors: ²⁴¹Am alpha sources; Luminescent signs: ³H, ¹⁴⁷Pm; Environmental tracers: studying ocean currents, groundwater flow. The understanding and application of radioactive decay has revolutionized medicine, transformed archaeology and geology, provided clean energy, and enabled numerous industrial processes, making it one of the most important phenomena in modern science and technology.",

  "summary": "Radioactive decay involves the spontaneous transformation of unstable nuclei through alpha (helium nucleus emission), beta (electron/positron emission or electron capture), or gamma (photon emission) processes. Decay follows exponential kinetics N(t)=N₀e^(-λt) with characteristic half-life t₁/₂=ln2/λ. Activity A=λN measures decay rate in becquerels. Natural decay series (uranium, thorium, actinium) proceed through chains to stable endpoints, often reaching secular equilibrium. Applications include medical imaging and therapy (⁹⁹ᵐTc, ¹³¹I), radiometric dating (¹⁴C, K-Ar), nuclear power, industrial radiography, and scientific research using radioactive tracers. Understanding radioactive decay enables both beneficial applications and safe management of radiation hazards."
