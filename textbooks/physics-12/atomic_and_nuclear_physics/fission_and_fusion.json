          "statement": "Nuclear fission involves the splitting of heavy nuclei through several key processes: Fission Mechanism: A heavy nucleus captures a neutron, forming a compound nucleus in an excited state; The nucleus becomes unstable and deforms into a dumbbell shape; Coulomb repulsion overcomes nuclear forces, causing the nucleus to split; Typically produces two medium-mass fission fragments (asymmetric split) plus 2-3 prompt neutrons; Energy release ~200 MeV per fission. Energy Release and Products: Total energy ~200 MeV per fission distributed as: Kinetic energy of fragments: ~165 MeV (83%); Kinetic energy of neutrons: ~5 MeV (2.5%); Instantaneous gamma rays: ~7 MeV (3.5%); Beta particles from fragments: ~8 MeV (4%); Gamma rays from fragments: ~7 MeV (3.5%); Neutrinos: ~11 MeV (5.5%); Fission fragments are neutron-rich and undergo beta decay chains. Chain Reactions and Criticality: Each fission produces neutrons that can induce further fissions; Neutron multiplication factor k: k = 1 (critical: steady reaction), k > 1 (supercritical: growing reaction), k < 1 (subcritical: dying reaction); Critical mass: minimum mass for sustained chain reaction; Depends on geometry, purity, and neutron reflectors. Neutron Moderation: Fast neutrons (∼2 MeV) from fission need slowing for efficient ²³⁵U fission; Moderators (water, graphite) slow neutrons to thermal energies (0.025 eV); Thermal neutrons have much higher fission cross sections; Delayed neutrons (from fission product decay) are crucial for reactor control. Fissile vs Fertile Materials: Fissile: can fission with thermal neutrons (²³⁵U, ²³⁹Pu, ²³³U); Fertile: can be converted to fissile materials (²³⁸U → ²³⁹Pu, ²³²Th → ²³³U); Breeding: converting fertile to fissile materials in reactors. Applications: Nuclear reactors: controlled chain reactions for power; Nuclear weapons: uncontrolled supercritical chain reactions; Radioisotope production: fission products for medical/industrial use; Research: neutron sources for scientific studies.",

Comparative Analysis: Energy density: Fusion ~4× fission per reaction, but fission fuel heavier; Fuel abundance: Fission uranium limited, fusion deuterium virtually unlimited; Waste products: Fission produces long-lived transuranics, fusion produces mainly short-lived activation products; Safety: Fission has criticality and meltdown risks, fusion has no chain reaction risk; Proliferation: Fission materials weapons-usable, fusion materials less proliferative; Technological maturity: Fission commercial, fusion experimental. Fission Challenges: Radioactive waste management requiring geological disposal; Safety concerns (Chernobyl, Fukushima-type accidents); Proliferation risks of plutonium production; Limited uranium resources; Decommissioning costs and complexity. Fusion Challenges: Achieving and sustaining plasma confinement; Materials surviving neutron radiation; Achieving net energy gain (Q>1); Tritium fuel breeding and handling; Economic competitiveness; Scale and complexity of reactors. Environmental Impacts: Fission: CO₂-free but mining impacts, thermal pollution, waste issues; Fusion: minimal long-lived waste, no CO₂, but tritium handling; Both: land use, construction impacts. Future Prospects: Advanced fission: Generation IV reactors, thorium cycles, small modular reactors; Fusion development: ITER (2025), DEMO, commercial plants possibly 2050+; Hybrid systems: fusion-fission combinations; Both technologies potentially important for decarbonized energy future.",

  "summary": "Nuclear fission splits heavy nuclei (uranium, plutonium) releasing ~200 MeV per fission through neutron-induced chain reactions, used in power plants and weapons. Nuclear fusion combines light nuclei (deuterium, tritium) releasing ~17 MeV per fusion, requiring extreme temperatures to overcome Coulomb repulsion, powering stars and pursued for clean energy. Fission is technologically mature but produces long-lived radioactive waste; fusion offers abundant fuel and less waste but remains experimentally challenging. Both processes convert mass to energy via E=Δmc², with fusion having higher energy density per mass. Applications include electricity generation, medical isotopes, scientific research, and national security, with ongoing development of advanced fission reactors and experimental fusion devices like ITER."
