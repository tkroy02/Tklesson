  "expanded_description": "This section explores Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, which provided crucial experimental evidence for the particle nature of light and earned him the Nobel Prize, establishing photons as discrete energy packets and revealing the quantum mechanical nature of light-matter interactions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The photoelectric effect occurs when light incident on a metal surface ejects electrons, but only if the photon energy hν exceeds the material's work function φ, with the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons given by K_max = hν - φ, demonstrating that light energy is quantized in discrete packets (photons) rather than distributed continuously as classical wave theory predicted.",
    "explanation": "Einstein's 1905 explanation revolutionized physics by showing that light behaves as particles (photons) when interacting with matter. Key features include: the existence of a cutoff frequency below which no electrons are emitted regardless of intensity; instantaneous emission with no time lag; electron kinetic energy proportional to frequency but independent of intensity; and current proportional to light intensity. These observations contradicted classical wave theory but were perfectly explained by photon theory, establishing wave-particle duality and providing the first direct evidence for energy quantization in electromagnetic radiation."

  "summary": "Section 7.2 establishes the photoelectric effect as crucial experimental evidence for the particle nature of light, where Einstein's photon theory successfully explains all observed features: the existence of a cutoff frequency below which no electrons are emitted regardless of intensity; instantaneous emission with no time lag; maximum electron kinetic energy proportional to light frequency but independent of intensity; and photocurrent proportional to light intensity. The fundamental equation K_max = hν - φ relates photon energy to electron kinetic energy and material work function, with the stopping potential V_s = (hν - φ)/e providing direct experimental measurement. Advanced applications include photomultiplier tubes for single-photon detection, photoelectron spectroscopy for material analysis, and multi-photon photoemission for nonlinear optical studies. The photoelectric effect remains foundational for understanding light-matter interactions and continues to enable important technologies in detection, imaging, and surface science."
