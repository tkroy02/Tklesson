          "statement": "Modern physics represents a unified framework that synthesizes classical concepts with quantum and relativistic principles: Historical Synthesis: The development proceeded through key milestones: Blackbody radiation (1900) → Photoelectric effect (1905) → Bohr atom (1913) → de Broglie waves (1924) → Schrödinger equation (1926) → Uncertainty principle (1927). Each discovery addressed limitations of previous theories while maintaining successful predictions. Wave-Particle Unification: Light exhibits both wave (interference, diffraction) and particle (photoelectric effect, Compton scattering) properties described by E=hν and p=h/λ. Matter similarly shows both particle (localized interactions) and wave (diffraction, interference) behaviors with λ=h/p. This duality is resolved through probability amplitude description in quantum mechanics. Quantum Framework Integration: The Schrödinger equation iħ∂ψ/∂t=Ĥψ provides the dynamical law, while the uncertainty principle ΔxΔp≥ħ/2 sets fundamental limits. Wavefunctions ψ describe probability amplitudes, with |ψ|² giving measurement probabilities. Energy quantization emerges from boundary conditions in bound systems. Relativistic Synthesis: Special relativity modifies energy-momentum relations: E²=(pc)²+(mc²)². General relativity describes gravity geometrically. Quantum field theory unifies quantum mechanics with special relativity. The quest for quantum gravity continues. Measurement Theory: The quantum measurement problem connects formalism to experimental outcomes. Wavefunction collapse provides operational description, while interpretations (Copenhagen, many-worlds, etc.) offer different philosophical perspectives. Decoherence explains quantum-classical transition. Technological Integration: Lasers apply stimulated emission between quantized energy levels. Semiconductors use band theory from Schrödinger solutions. NMR/MRI exploit quantum spin states. Nuclear power and medicine apply nuclear physics principles. Scanning probe microscopes use quantum tunneling. Unifying Principles: Conservation laws (energy, momentum, angular momentum) transcend classical/quantum divide. Symmetry principles guide theory development. The correspondence principle ensures quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics in appropriate limits. This integrated framework successfully describes phenomena across ~20 orders of magnitude in scale, from subnuclear to cosmological.",
          "application": "Trace historical development of key concepts. Explain how different phenomena demonstrate wave-particle duality. Apply quantum principles to explain classical limits. Connect theoretical predictions to experimental verification. Analyze technological applications from fundamental principles. Evaluate conceptual relationships across physics domains.",

Atomic spectra: quantized energy levels (Bohr) explained by Schrödinger solutions. Nuclear energy: E=mc² (relativity) + quantum tunneling (alpha decay) + binding energy (nuclear physics).",

Solution Strategy: Start from fundamental equations (Schrödinger, Einstein, etc.). Apply conservation laws (energy, momentum, angular momentum). Use symmetry principles to simplify problems. Implement boundary conditions and normalization. Employ approximation methods when exact solutions unavailable. Verification and Interpretation: Check dimensional consistency of results. Evaluate numerical reasonableness through order-of-magnitude estimates. Consider both quantum and classical limits. Connect mathematical solutions to physical observables. Assess experimental implications and measurement feasibility. Common Integrated Scenarios: Atomic-Nuclear Interface: Electron transitions with nuclear effects, hyperfine structure, isotope shifts.
