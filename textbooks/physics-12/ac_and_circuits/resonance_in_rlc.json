  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Resonance occurs in RLC circuits when the inductive and capacitive reactances cancel (X_L = X_C), resulting in purely resistive impedance at the resonant frequency ω₀ = 1/√(LC), where current is maximized in series circuits, voltage is maximized in parallel circuits, and energy oscillates between magnetic and electric fields with minimal external energy input.",
    "explanation": "At resonance, the circuit exhibits special properties: impedance becomes minimum in series RLC and maximum in parallel RLC, power factor becomes unity, and the circuit stores maximum energy that oscillates between the inductor and capacitor. The quality factor Q = ω₀L/R = 1/(ω₀CR) determines the sharpness of resonance, with high-Q circuits having narrow bandwidth and significant voltage or current magnification. Resonance enables frequency selection, filtering, and efficient energy transfer in various electronic and power systems."

  "summary": "Section 6.8 establishes comprehensive resonance analysis in RLC circuits, occurring when X_L=X_C at ω₀=1/√(LC), where series circuits exhibit minimum impedance and maximum current while parallel circuits show maximum impedance and minimum current. The quality factor Q=ω₀L/R=1/(ω₀CR) determines resonance sharpness and bandwidth BW=ω₀/Q, with high-Q circuits providing excellent frequency selectivity. Resonance enables voltage or current magnification by factor Q, with significant energy storage oscillating between electric and magnetic fields. Practical applications include crystal oscillators with extremely high Q factors (>100,000), coupled resonators for bandwidth control in filters, and tank circuits in RF systems. Advanced concepts cover coupled resonator systems exhibiting frequency splitting, crystal resonator implementations with exceptional stability, and nonlinear resonance phenomena, demonstrating the fundamental importance of resonance across electronic systems from power supplies to communication networks."
