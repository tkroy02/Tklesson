          "statement": "Series resonance occurs when the inductive and capacitive reactances exactly cancel each other: $X_L = X_C$ or $\\omega L = \\frac{1}{\\omega C}$. Solving for frequency gives the resonant frequency $f_r = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}}$, which depends only on L and C values. At resonance, several key conditions exist: (1) Circuit impedance is purely resistive and minimum: $Z = R$. (2) Current reaches maximum value: $I_{max} = \\frac{V}{R}$. (3) Power factor is unity: $\\cos\\phi = 1$. (4) Voltages across inductor and capacitor are equal in magnitude but 180° out of phase: $V_L = -V_C$. (5) The individual reactive voltages can be much larger than the source voltage: $V_L = V_C = QV$, where Q is the quality factor. The quality factor $Q = \\frac{X_L}{R} = \\frac{1}{R}\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}$ quantifies the sharpness of resonance and the voltage magnification. The bandwidth $BW = \\frac{f_r}{Q}$ defines the frequency range between half-power points where the power drops to 50% of maximum and current drops to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ of maximum. The selectivity of the circuit, its ability to distinguish between closely spaced frequencies, is directly proportional to Q. In the frequency domain, the current response follows a bell-shaped curve centered at f_r, with higher Q values producing narrower, sharper peaks. The phase angle varies from -90° (capacitive) below resonance through 0° at resonance to +90° (inductive) above resonance.",

The selectivity is determined by the Q-factor. Band-Stop Filters (Wave Traps): Parallel resonant circuits create band-stop filters when placed in series with a signal path, presenting high impedance at resonance to block specific frequencies. Oscillator Circuits: Parallel resonant tank circuits determine the oscillation frequency in LC oscillators, with higher Q values providing better frequency stability. Tuned Amplifiers: Using a parallel resonant circuit as the load for an amplifier stage creates frequency-selective amplification, where gain is maximum at resonance. Impedance Matching: Resonant circuits can match source and load impedances by canceling reactive components and transforming resistances at the desired frequency. Q-Meters: Specialized instruments using resonance principles to measure the Q-factor of components, based on the relationship between voltage magnification and Q. Metal Detectors: Utilize the change in resonant frequency when metal objects affect the inductance of a search coil. In all applications, practical considerations include: component losses (especially inductor Q), temperature stability of components, parasitic elements at high frequencies, power handling capabilities (considering voltage/current magnification), and the effects of loading on circuit Q. Modern applications often use crystal resonators or ceramic resonators for higher Q and better stability than LC circuits.",

          "analogy": "Like a radio receiver tuning dial - the resonant circuit is the heart that selects your desired station; the quality of the tuner (Q-factor) determines how well it separates nearby stations; different circuit configurations let you either pick one station (band-pass) or block an interfering station (band-stop); practical considerations are like the radio's sensitivity and stability in different conditions",

  "summary": "RLC circuits exhibit resonance when inductive and capacitive reactances cancel at f_r=1/(2π√(LC)). Series resonance features minimum impedance (Z=R), maximum current, voltage magnification (V_L=V_C=QV), and operates with current reference. Parallel resonance features maximum impedance (Z_max=L/RC for practical circuit), minimum current, current magnification (I_L=I_C=QI), and operates with voltage reference. Quality factor Q=X_L/R (series) or Q=R/X_L (parallel) determines resonance sharpness and bandwidth BW=f_r/Q. Applications include band-pass/band-stop filters, oscillators, tuned amplifiers, impedance matching, wave traps, and measurement instruments. Practical considerations include component losses, temperature stability, parasitic elements, and the effects of loading on circuit performance. Crystal resonators provide extremely high Q and frequency stability compared to LC circuits."
