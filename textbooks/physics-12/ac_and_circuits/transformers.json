  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Transformers operate on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, where a changing magnetic flux induced by alternating current in the primary winding creates a proportional voltage in the secondary winding according to the turns ratio (V₂/V₁ = N₂/N₁), enabling voltage step-up/step-down, current transformation (I₂/I₁ = N₁/N₂), impedance matching (Z₂/Z₁ = (N₂/N₁)²), and electrical isolation while conserving power in ideal conditions.",
    "explanation": "Transformers consist of primary and secondary windings wound around a common magnetic core that provides a low-reluctance path for magnetic flux. The core material (typically laminated silicon steel) minimizes eddy current and hysteresis losses. Ideal transformers assume no losses, perfect coupling, and infinite core permeability, while practical transformers consider copper losses, core losses, leakage flux, and magnetizing current. Transformer efficiency is typically 95-99% for power transformers, with applications ranging from power distribution (kilovolts to volts) to electronic circuits (impedance matching and isolation)."

  "summary": "Section 6.9 establishes comprehensive transformer analysis based on electromagnetic induction principles, where voltage transformation follows V₂/V₁ = N₂/N₁, current transformation follows I₂/I₁ = N₁/N₂, and impedance transformation follows Z₂/Z₁ = (N₂/N₁)². Ideal transformers assume perfect coupling and no losses, while practical transformers consider copper losses (I²R), core losses (hysteresis and eddy currents), leakage reactance, and finite magnetizing current. Transformer performance is characterized by voltage regulation (typically 2-10% for power transformers) and efficiency (95-99% for well-designed units). Three-phase transformer configurations (delta-wye, wye-delta, etc.) provide specific phase relationships and harmonic suppression benefits. Instrument transformers (CTs and PTs) enable safe measurement of high currents and voltages with accuracy classes defining measurement precision. Special applications include autotransformers for variable voltage control, isolation transformers for safety, and RF transformers for impedance matching in communication systems."
