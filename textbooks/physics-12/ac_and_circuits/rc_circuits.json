  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "RC circuits exhibit exponential transient responses characterized by the time constant τ=RC, where capacitors charge and discharge through resistors according to v_C(t)=V_final(1-e^(-t/τ)) for charging and v_C(t)=V_initial(e^(-t/τ)) for discharging, with the time constant representing the time to reach 63.2% of the final change.",
    "explanation": "When voltage is applied to an RC circuit, the capacitor doesn't charge instantaneously but follows an exponential curve determined by the product of resistance and capacitance. The capacitor current starts at maximum and decays exponentially to zero, while the capacitor voltage rises from zero to the source voltage. In discharging, both voltage and current decay exponentially from their initial values. This time-dependent behavior enables RC circuits to perform functions like timing, wave shaping, and filtering that pure resistive circuits cannot achieve."

  "summary": "Section 6.2 establishes RC circuit analysis through the fundamental time constant τ=RC, which governs the exponential charging and discharging behavior of capacitors through resistors. The transient response follows v_C(t)=V_final(1-e^(-t/τ)) for charging and v_C(t)=V_initial(e^(-t/τ)) for discharging, with key time points at 1τ (63.2%), 2τ (86.5%), and 5τ (99.3% complete). RC circuits serve as fundamental building blocks for filters—low-pass configurations pass frequencies below f_c=1/(2πRC) while high-pass configurations pass frequencies above this cutoff. Timing applications leverage the predictable RC charging for delays, pulse generation, and oscillator circuits, with practical implementations like the 555 timer providing versatile timing solutions. These principles enable RC circuits to perform essential functions in signal processing, wave shaping, and time-based control across electronic systems."
