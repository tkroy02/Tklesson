  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Alternating current is characterized by sinusoidal variation of voltage and current with time, described by v(t)=V_m sin(ωt+φ) where V_m is the peak amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle, with AC analysis focusing on RMS values for power calculations and phase relationships for circuit behavior.",
    "explanation": "Unlike DC with constant magnitude and direction, AC periodically reverses direction, enabling efficient power transmission and transformer operation. AC analysis uses root-mean-square (RMS) values (V_rms=V_m/√2) for power calculations since they give the equivalent DC value that would produce the same average power. The frequency domain representation and phase relationships become crucial, as capacitors and inductors exhibit frequency-dependent behavior that fundamentally changes circuit operation compared to DC."

AC power analysis distinguishes between real power (P, measured in watts), reactive power (Q, measured in VAR), and apparent power (S, measured in VA), related through the power triangle S²=P²+Q² with power factor cosφ=P/S. Phasor representation simplifies AC circuit analysis by converting differential equations to complex algebra, while three-phase systems provide efficient power transmission with balanced operation. These AC fundamentals form the essential foundation for analyzing the frequency-dependent behavior of circuits containing capacitors and inductors, enabling understanding of filters, transformers, and power systems that dominate electrical engineering applications."
