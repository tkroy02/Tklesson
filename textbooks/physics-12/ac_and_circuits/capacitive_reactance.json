  "expanded_description": "This section develops the concept of capacitive reactance as the opposition that capacitors present to alternating current, establishing the frequency-dependent behavior of capacitors in AC circuits and analyzing their phase relationships and energy storage characteristics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Capacitive reactance (X_C) is the opposition that capacitors offer to alternating current, given by X_C = 1/(ωC) = 1/(2πfC), which decreases with increasing frequency and causes current to lead voltage by 90° in pure capacitive circuits.",
    "explanation": "Unlike resistors that oppose current equally at all frequencies, capacitors exhibit frequency-dependent opposition that follows an inverse relationship with both frequency and capacitance. In AC circuits, capacitors continuously store and release energy, with current proportional to the rate of voltage change (i_C = C dv/dt). This leads to a 90° phase shift where current reaches its maximum when voltage is changing most rapidly (at zero crossing) and current is zero when voltage is at its peak (not changing)."

  "summary": "Section 6.4 establishes capacitive reactance X_C=1/(ωC)=1/(2πfC) as the frequency-dependent opposition that capacitors present to alternating current, exhibiting an inverse relationship with both frequency and capacitance. This reactance causes current to lead voltage by 90° in pure capacitive circuits, with maximum current occurring when voltage is changing most rapidly (zero crossings) and zero current when voltage is at peak. Capacitors serve as fundamental building blocks for high-pass filters, blocking DC while passing AC signals above the cutoff frequency f_c=1/(2πRC). In power systems, capacitors provide crucial power factor correction by supplying reactive power to compensate for inductive loads, reducing line currents and improving system efficiency. The frequency-dependent behavior of capacitive reactance enables diverse applications including signal coupling, bypass filtering, timing circuits, and energy storage across electronic and power systems."
