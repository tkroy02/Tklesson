          "statement": "Capacitive reactance $X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f C} = \\frac{1}{\\omega C}$ represents the opposition a capacitor offers to alternating current. This relationship derives from the fundamental capacitor equation $i_C = C\\frac{dv_C}{dt}$: for sinusoidal voltage $v_C(t) = V_m\\sin(\\omega t)$, the current is $i_C(t) = C\\frac{d}{dt}[V_m\\sin(\\omega t)] = \\omega CV_m\\cos(\\omega t) = I_m\\sin(\\omega t + 90^\\circ)$, where $I_m = \\omega CV_m$. Thus $X_C = V_m/I_m = 1/(\\omega C)$. Key characteristics: (1) Frequency Dependence: $X_C \\propto 1/f$ - reactance decreases as frequency increases, making capacitors appear as short circuits at high frequencies and open circuits at DC. (2) Phase Relationship: Current leads voltage by exactly $90^\\circ$ in ideal capacitors. (3) Impedance Representation: $Z_C = -jX_C$ in complex form, with negative imaginary component indicating the $90^\\circ$ phase lead of current. (4) Power Behavior: Instantaneous power $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$ oscillates at twice the frequency with zero average value - ideal capacitors store and release energy but don't dissipate power. (5) Energy Storage: Maximum stored energy is $W = \\frac{1}{2}CV_m^2$. This frequency-dependent behavior makes capacitors essential for filters, timing circuits, and AC coupling applications.",

Low-pass filter (series R, parallel C) passes frequencies below the same cutoff while attenuating higher frequencies. The rolloff is -20dB/decade for single-pole filters. AC Coupling: Series capacitors block DC components while passing AC signals, essential in amplifier stages where different DC bias levels must be isolated. The capacitor value is chosen so $X_C \\ll R_{load}$ at the lowest frequency of interest. Bypass/Decoupling: Parallel capacitors provide low-impedance paths to ground for high-frequency noise, preventing interference in power supplies and ICs. Multiple values are often used to cover different frequency ranges. Power Factor Correction: Parallel capacitors cancel the lagging VAR of inductive loads, reducing the phase angle and apparent current. The required capacitance is $C = \\frac{P(\\tan\\theta_1 - \\tan\\theta_2)}{2\\pi f V^2}$, where P is real power, and $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$ are initial and desired phase angles. Timing Circuits: RC networks generate predictable time delays $t = -RC\\ln(1 - \\frac{V_C}{V_{max}})$, used in oscillators, pulse generators, and timing controls. Each application requires careful capacitor selection considering value, voltage rating, tolerance, temperature coefficient, and parasitic elements.",

  "summary": "Capacitive reactance X_C = 1/(2πfC) represents the opposition capacitors offer to AC current, decreasing with increasing frequency. In pure capacitive circuits, current leads voltage by 90° and no average power is dissipated. Series RC circuits have impedance Z = R - jX_C with magnitude √(R² + X_C²) and phase angle θ = -tan⁻¹(X_C/R). Parallel RC circuits are analyzed using admittance Y = 1/R + jωC. The cutoff frequency f_c = 1/(2πRC) is crucial for filter applications. Capacitors enable high-pass filters (series C, parallel R), low-pass filters (series R, parallel C), AC coupling (DC blocking), bypassing (noise suppression), power factor correction (canceling inductive VAR), and timing circuits (predictable RC delays). Practical design requires consideration of capacitor value, voltage rating, and parasitic elements. These applications make capacitive reactance fundamental to electronics, communications, and power systems."
