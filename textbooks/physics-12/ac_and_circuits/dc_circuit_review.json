Capacitors charge to the source voltage and block DC current once fully charged, while inductors behave as short circuits to steady DC.

Resistive networks are solved using series/parallel combinations, voltage/current division, and systematic mesh/nodal analysis. Capacitors block DC when charged and exhibit exponential charging/discharging with time constant τ=RC, while inductors short DC in steady state. Advanced analysis employs network theorems including Thevenin/Norton equivalents for circuit simplification and superposition for multiple source problems. Practical considerations include component power ratings, measurement loading effects, and real-world applications like voltage regulation. These DC principles form the essential foundation for understanding the more complex behaviors of AC circuits that follow in subsequent sections."
