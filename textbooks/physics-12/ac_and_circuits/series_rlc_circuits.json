  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Series RLC circuits exhibit a total impedance Z = R + j(ωL - 1/ωC) with a resonant frequency ω₀ = 1/√(LC) where the circuit becomes purely resistive, current is maximized, and voltage and current are in phase, while the quality factor Q = ω₀L/R = 1/(ω₀CR) determines the sharpness of the resonance peak.",
    "explanation": "In series RLC circuits, the capacitor and inductor reactances oppose each other (X_L and X_C have opposite signs), leading to possible cancellation at resonance. Below resonance, capacitive reactance dominates and the circuit appears capacitive; above resonance, inductive reactance dominates. At resonance, the circuit is purely resistive with minimum impedance, maximum current, and unity power factor. The quality factor Q determines the bandwidth and selectivity of the resonant response, with high-Q circuits having narrow bandwidth and sharp resonance peaks."

The quality factor Q=ω₀L/R=1/(ω₀CR) determines resonance sharpness and bandwidth BW=ω₀/Q, with high-Q circuits exhibiting narrow bandwidth and significant voltage magnification across reactive elements. Below resonance, capacitive reactance dominates (current leads voltage); above resonance, inductive reactance dominates (current lags voltage). Series RLC circuits find extensive application in tuned circuits, filters, and oscillators where frequency selectivity is crucial, with practical implementations requiring careful consideration of component tolerances, parasitic elements, and voltage stress limitations at resonance."
