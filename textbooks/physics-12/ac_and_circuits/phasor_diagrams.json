  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Phasor diagrams represent sinusoidal AC quantities as rotating vectors in the complex plane, where vector length corresponds to magnitude (RMS or peak value), angle represents phase shift relative to a reference, and vector relationships graphically display circuit behavior including phase differences, impedance triangles, and power relationships.",
    "explanation": "Phasors transform time-domain differential equations into simpler algebraic operations in the frequency domain. A phasor V = V_m∠θ represents v(t) = V_m cos(ωt + θ), with the understanding that all phasors rotate at angular frequency ω. Phasor diagrams provide intuitive visualization of leading/lagging relationships, Kirchhoff's Laws in AC circuits, and the geometric interpretation of complex impedance and power. The reference phasor is typically chosen along the positive real axis (0° phase), with other quantities plotted relative to this reference."

  "summary": "Section 6.7 establishes phasor diagrams as powerful graphical tools for visualizing AC circuit relationships, representing sinusoidal quantities as rotating vectors where length corresponds to magnitude and angle represents phase shift. The methodology involves selecting a reference phasor (typically current for series circuits, voltage for parallel), constructing element phasors according to their phase relationships (resistors: 0°, inductors: +90°, capacitors: -90°), and performing vector addition to determine resultant quantities. Phasor diagrams provide intuitive understanding of impedance triangles, power triangles, and phase relationships in RLC circuits. Advanced applications include three-phase system analysis with 120° phase separations, power system monitoring using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) with GPS synchronization, and wide-area monitoring for grid stability and control. These graphical methods complement mathematical analysis by providing visual insight into AC circuit behavior and facilitating understanding of complex relationships in power systems."
