A voltage $v(t) = V_m\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$ is represented by phasor $\\mathbf{V} = V_m\\angle\\phi$ or $\\mathbf{V} = V_m e^{j\\phi}$. Construction follows systematic methods: (1) Reference Selection: Choose a reference phasor (usually current in series circuits, voltage in parallel circuits) and draw it along the positive real axis. (2) Component Addition: Add other phasors according to their phase relationships: resistors in phase with current, inductors leading by 90°, capacitors lagging by 90°. (3) Scale Determination: Use consistent scaling (e.g., 1cm = 10V) for all phasors. (4) Resultant Calculation: Find resultant phasors using vector addition (graphical or mathematical). (5) Interpretation: Measure magnitudes and angles from the diagram. Key relationships: In series circuits, current is common, so use current as reference; voltage phasors add vectorially. In parallel circuits, voltage is common, so use voltage as reference; current phasors add vectorially. The phase angle between voltage and current determines power factor. Phasor diagrams provide immediate visual insight into circuit behavior, showing at a glance whether a circuit is capacitive, inductive, or resistive, and the relative magnitudes of different quantities.",

(3) For each inductor, draw voltage phasor leading current by 90°. (4) For each capacitor, draw voltage phasor lagging current by 90°. (5) Vectorially add all voltage phasors to find the source voltage. Key Relationships: The voltage triangle formed by V_R, V_X (net reactive voltage), and V_total geometrically represents the circuit behavior. The phase angle φ between V_total and I satisfies tanφ = V_X/V_R. The impedance triangle is similar to the voltage triangle, with sides R, X, and Z. For series RLC circuits, the net reactive voltage is V_X = V_L - V_C, and the circuit is inductive if V_L > V_C, capacitive if V_C > V_L, and resistive at resonance when V_L = V_C. The power triangle derived from these relationships shows real power P = VIcosφ, reactive power Q = VIsinφ, and apparent power S = VI.

          "statement": "Parallel AC circuit analysis uses voltage as the common reference phasor, with current phasors representing the individual branch currents. Construction Methodology: (1) Establish source voltage as the reference phasor along the 0° axis. (2) For resistive branches, draw current phasor in phase with voltage. (3) For inductive branches, draw current phasor lagging voltage by 90°. (4) For capacitive branches, draw current phasor leading voltage by 90°. (5) Vectorially add all current phasors to find the total current. The current triangle formed by I_R, I_X (net reactive current), and I_total reveals the circuit characteristics. Power Phasor Analysis extends this concept to represent power relationships: The power triangle has real power P along the horizontal axis, reactive power Q along the vertical axis (positive for inductive, negative for capacitive), and apparent power S as the hypotenuse. The phase angle φ between S and P equals the angle between voltage and current. Power Factor Correction uses phasor analysis to determine the compensation needed: For an inductive load drawing current I_L at angle φ, adding a capacitor draws leading current I_C; the compensated current I_comp = I_L + I_C has smaller phase angle φ_comp and higher power factor. The required capacitive current is I_C = I_Lsinφ - I_compsinφ_comp. Phasor diagrams provide immediate visualization of how compensation improves power factor by reducing the phase angle and total current magnitude for the same real power.",

Add capacitor with X_C=160Ω: I_C=0.75A (+90°), net I_X=-1.5+0.75=-0.75A, I_comp=√(2²+0.75²)=2.14A, φ_comp=tan⁻¹(-0.75/2)=-20.6°. Power factor improves from 0.8 to 0.94.",
          "analogy": "Like a river with multiple channels - the main flow (total current) depends on how much goes through each channel (branch currents); power factor correction is like adding a channel that counteracts wasteful sideways flow (reactive current), making the main flow more direct and efficient",

  "summary": "Phasor diagrams provide visual representation of AC quantities as rotating vectors, with length representing magnitude and angle representing phase. Series circuits use current reference with voltage phasors adding vectorially. Parallel circuits use voltage reference with current phasors adding vectorially. The impedance triangle (R, X, Z) relates to the voltage triangle in series circuits. The admittance triangle (G, B, Y) relates to the current triangle in parallel circuits. Power triangles (P, Q, S) show real, reactive, and apparent power relationships. Phasor analysis enables graphical solution of AC circuits, power factor determination, and design of power factor correction. Construction follows systematic methods with appropriate reference selection and accounts for characteristic phase relationships: resistors in phase, inductors leading by 90°, capacitors lagging by 90°. Phasor diagrams complement mathematical analysis and provide intuitive understanding of AC circuit behavior."
