          "statement": "Inductive reactance $X_L = 2\\pi f L = \\omega L$ represents the opposition an inductor offers to alternating current. This relationship derives from the fundamental inductor equation $v_L = L\\frac{di_L}{dt}$: for sinusoidal current $i_L(t) = I_m\\sin(\\omega t)$, the voltage is $v_L(t) = L\\frac{d}{dt}[I_m\\sin(\\omega t)] = \\omega LI_m\\cos(\\omega t) = V_m\\sin(\\omega t + 90^\\circ)$, where $V_m = \\omega LI_m$. Thus $X_L = V_m/I_m = \\omega L$. Key characteristics: (1) Frequency Dependence: $X_L \\propto f$ - reactance increases as frequency increases, making inductors appear as open circuits at high frequencies and short circuits at DC. (2) Phase Relationship: Current lags voltage by exactly $90^\\circ$ in ideal inductors. (3) Impedance Representation: $Z_L = jX_L$ in complex form, with positive imaginary component indicating the $90^\\circ$ phase lag of current. (4) Power Behavior: Instantaneous power $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$ oscillates at twice the frequency with zero average value - ideal inductors store and release energy but don't dissipate power. (5) Energy Storage: Maximum stored energy is $W = \\frac{1}{2}LI_m^2$. This frequency-dependent behavior makes inductors essential for filters, impedance matching, energy storage, and frequency selection applications. Unlike capacitors, inductors oppose changes in current, making them particularly useful for current smoothing and high-frequency suppression.",

High-pass filter (series R, parallel L) passes frequencies above the same cutoff while attenuating lower frequencies. The rolloff is -20dB/decade for single-pole filters. Choke Inductors: Series inductors block AC components while passing DC, essential in power supply filters where they smooth rectified current. The inductor value is chosen so $X_L \\gg R_{load}$ at the ripple frequency. Transformers: Utilize mutual inductance to transfer energy between isolated circuits while transforming voltage and current according to the turns ratio $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{N_1}{N_2}$. Ideal transformers conserve power $V_1I_1 = V_2I_2$. Energy Storage: Inductors store energy in magnetic fields $W = \\frac{1}{2}LI^2$, used in switching power supplies where they transfer energy during switching cycles. Impedance Matching: Transformers can match source and load impedances for maximum power transfer using $\\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = (\\frac{N_1}{N_2})^2$. Motor Starting: Induction motors present high inductive reactance at startup, limiting inrush current. Each application requires careful inductor selection considering value, current rating, saturation current, quality factor, and core material.",

  "summary": "Inductive reactance X_L = 2πfL represents the opposition inductors offer to AC current, increasing with increasing frequency. In pure inductive circuits, current lags voltage by 90° and no average power is dissipated. Series RL circuits have impedance Z = R + jX_L with magnitude √(R² + X_L²) and phase angle θ = tan⁻¹(X_L/R). Parallel RL circuits are analyzed using admittance Y = 1/R - j/X_L. The cutoff frequency f_c = R/(2πL) is crucial for filter applications. Inductors enable low-pass filters (series L, parallel R), high-pass filters (series R, parallel L), choke applications (AC blocking), transformers (voltage transformation and isolation), energy storage (switching power supplies), and impedance matching. Practical design requires consideration of inductor value, current rating, saturation current, and core material. These applications make inductive reactance fundamental to power electronics, communications, and electromagnetic systems."
