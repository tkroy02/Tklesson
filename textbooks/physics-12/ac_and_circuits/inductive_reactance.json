  "expanded_description": "This section develops the concept of inductive reactance as the opposition that inductors present to alternating current, establishing the frequency-dependent behavior of inductors in AC circuits and analyzing their phase relationships and energy storage characteristics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Inductive reactance (X_L) is the opposition that inductors offer to alternating current, given by X_L = ωL = 2πfL, which increases with increasing frequency and causes current to lag voltage by 90° in pure inductive circuits.",
    "explanation": "Inductors exhibit frequency-dependent opposition that follows a direct linear relationship with both frequency and inductance. In AC circuits, inductors continuously store and release magnetic energy, with voltage proportional to the rate of current change (v_L = L di/dt). This leads to a 90° phase shift where voltage reaches its maximum when current is changing most rapidly (at zero crossing) and voltage is zero when current is at its peak (not changing). Unlike capacitors, inductors oppose changes in current, making them particularly effective at blocking high-frequency signals while passing DC and low frequencies."

  "summary": "Section 6.5 establishes inductive reactance X_L=ωL=2πfL as the frequency-dependent opposition that inductors present to alternating current, exhibiting a direct linear relationship with both frequency and inductance. This reactance causes current to lag voltage by 90° in pure inductive circuits, with maximum voltage occurring when current is changing most rapidly (zero crossings) and zero voltage when current is at peak. Inductors serve as fundamental building blocks for low-pass filters, passing DC and low frequencies while blocking high frequencies above the cutoff frequency f_c=R/(2πL). Transformers utilize mutual inductance to provide voltage transformation, current scaling, and impedance matching according to the turns ratio squared. The frequency-dependent behavior of inductive reactance enables diverse applications including filtering, energy storage, motor operation, and power system components across electronic and electrical engineering domains."
