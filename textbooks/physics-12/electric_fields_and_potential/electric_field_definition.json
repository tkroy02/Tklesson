  "summary": "Section 4.2 establishes the electric field as a fundamental concept that describes the electric influence of charges throughout space. Defined as E = F/q, the electric field enables the calculation of forces on charges and provides a local description of electrostatic interactions. The field from point charges follows the inverse-square law with vector superposition, while continuous distributions require integration methods. Advanced concepts include dipole fields, field line visualization, and the transformation of fields in different reference frames. This field perspective forms the foundation for understanding all electromagnetic phenomena and connects to broader physical principles through Gauss's law and potential theory."
