  "summary": "The electric field $\\vec{E} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{q_0}$ is defined as the force per unit test charge and provides a powerful framework for understanding electrostatic interactions. For point charges, $\\vec{E} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r^2} \\hat{r}$ with the unit vector pointing away from positive charges. The superposition principle $\\vec{E}_{net} = \\sum \\vec{E}_i$ enables calculation of fields from multiple charges. Electric field lines visually represent field patterns, beginning on positive charges and ending on negative charges, with density indicating field strength. Dipole fields decrease as 1/r³ and have characteristic directional properties. Continuous charge distributions require integration $\\vec{E} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{dq}{r^2} \\hat{r}$ with specific results for common geometries: infinite line ($E = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}$), infinite sheet ($E = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}$), and charged sphere. Mastery of electric field concepts provides the foundation for understanding more advanced topics in electromagnetism including Gauss's Law and electric potential."
