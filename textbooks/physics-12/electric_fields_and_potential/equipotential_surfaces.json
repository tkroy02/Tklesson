          "statement": "The magnitude of the electric field at any point is inversely proportional to the local spacing between equipotential surfaces: E ≈ |ΔV/Δs|, where ΔV is the potential difference between adjacent surfaces and Δs is the perpendicular distance between them. This relationship provides a powerful graphical method for estimating field strengths from equipotential maps: (1) Closely spaced equipotentials indicate strong fields, (2) Widely spaced equipotentials indicate weak fields, (3) Equally spaced parallel equipotentials indicate uniform fields, (4) The field direction is perpendicular to the equipotentials toward decreasing potential. For accurate determination, the spacing should be measured along the direction perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces. This principle enables qualitative field analysis from potential measurements and is particularly useful in experimental work where direct field measurement may be difficult. It also provides an important check for computational field solutions.",

  "summary": "Equipotential surfaces (V=constant) provide a geometric representation of electric potential fields, with electric field lines always perpendicular to these surfaces. The spacing between equipotentials indicates field strength - closely spaced surfaces correspond to strong fields. Conductors in electrostatic equilibrium form natural equipotential boundaries. Basic configurations include: spherical surfaces for point charges, parallel planes for uniform fields, and complex curved surfaces for dipoles and multiple charges. Practical applications range from capacitor design to geophysical exploration, using experimental mapping techniques or numerical computations. The orthogonality between fields and equipotentials, combined with the spacing-field strength relationship, provides powerful tools for analyzing and designing electrostatic systems without detailed mathematical calculations."
