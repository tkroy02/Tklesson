    "principle": "Equipotential surfaces are three-dimensional surfaces where electric potential has constant value, always perpendicular to electric field lines, with spacing inversely related to field strength, providing a powerful geometric representation of electrostatic fields.",
    "explanation": "These surfaces form a family of nested contours in space where V(x,y,z) = constant. No work is required to move charges along equipotential surfaces since W = qΔV = 0. The surfaces are closest together where the electric field is strongest, and the field direction is always normal to the equipotential surfaces, following E = -∇V. This geometric relationship enables intuitive understanding of field patterns and simplifies complex field analysis."

These surfaces of constant potential are always perpendicular to electric field lines, with spacing inversely proportional to field strength. Conductors naturally form equipotential surfaces, and the geometric relationship enables intuitive understanding of field patterns. Experimental methods like electrolytic tank mapping provide practical field determination, while complex potential methods offer sophisticated analytical tools for 2D problems. The work-free nature of charge motion along equipotentials has important physical consequences, and the surface patterns reveal essential field characteristics including strength, direction, and uniformity. These concepts provide crucial geometric insight into electrostatic field behavior and enable both qualitative understanding and quantitative analysis of complex field configurations."
