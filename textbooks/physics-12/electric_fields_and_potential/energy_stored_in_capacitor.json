  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The energy stored in a capacitor equals the work done to charge it, residing in the electric field between the plates and given by U = ½QV = ½CV² = Q²/(2C), representing reversible electrostatic potential energy that can be recovered when the capacitor discharges.",
    "explanation": "As charge is transferred between capacitor plates against the increasing potential difference, work is done that becomes stored as electrostatic energy. This energy density is distributed throughout the electric field with u = ½ε₀E² in vacuum, demonstrating that the energy physically resides in the field itself rather than the charges. The charging process involves moving incremental charges against a rising voltage, leading to the characteristic ½ factor in all energy expressions."

  "summary": "Section 4.9 establishes that the energy stored in a capacitor equals the work done to charge it, with U=½QV=½CV²=Q²/(2C) providing equivalent calculation methods. This energy physically resides in the electric field between the plates with energy density u=½εE². During charging, only half the energy supplied by the source is stored, with the remainder dissipated. Energy methods enable calculation of electrostatic forces on capacitor components, with F=-dU/dx determining attractive forces between plates. Practical applications range from small electronic components to massive capacitor banks for pulsed power systems storing kilojoules to megajoules. The reversible nature of capacitive energy storage makes it essential for timing circuits, power conditioning, energy recovery systems, and high-power pulse applications across physics and engineering disciplines."
