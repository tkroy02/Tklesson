          "statement": "During capacitor charging and discharging, energy transfer efficiency is affected by several loss mechanisms: (1) Resistive losses (I²R) in wires and capacitor ESR, (2) Dielectric losses due to polarization relaxation, (3) Radiative losses at high frequencies, (4) Switching losses in electronic control circuits. The energy efficiency η = (energy delivered)/(energy stored) is always less than 100% in practical systems. During charging, the total energy supplied by the source is always greater than the energy finally stored in the capacitor due to resistive losses. During discharging, the energy delivered to the load is less than the stored energy due to similar losses. For rapid charging/discharging, efficiency decreases due to higher currents and greater I²R losses. This principle explains why capacitor energy systems must be designed considering not just storage capacity but also transfer efficiency, particularly for high-power applications where losses can be significant.",

  "summary": "Capacitors store energy in electric fields according to U = ½QΔV = ½C(ΔV)² = Q²/2C. The energy density is u = ½εE², with maximum limited by dielectric breakdown. Energy calculation methods include work integration, direct formulas, and field energy integration. Practical applications range from camera flashes to medical defibrillators, where rapid energy delivery is essential. Real capacitors have losses due to ESR, leakage, and dielectric absorption, reducing energy transfer efficiency. Supercapacitors offer extremely high capacitance for energy storage applications. Understanding capacitor energy storage enables design of efficient energy systems while recognizing the fundamental limits imposed by material properties and physical principles."
