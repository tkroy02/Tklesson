Stability analysis determines whether equilibrium is stable (small displacements produce restoring forces), unstable (displacements produce forces away from equilibrium), or neutral. For a charge to be in stable equilibrium in an electrostatic field, there must be additional constraints (e.g., mechanical supports) since Earnshaw's theorem states that a charged particle cannot be held in stable equilibrium by electrostatic forces alone.

  "summary": "Coulomb's Law in vector form $\\vec{F}_{12} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}^2} \\hat{r}_{12}$ completely describes the electrostatic interaction between point charges, providing both magnitude and direction information. The superposition principle enables calculation of net forces in multi-charge systems through vector addition $\\vec{F}_{net} = \\sum \\vec{F}_i$. Three-dimensional applications require careful component analysis using position vectors $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j} + z\\hat{k}$, separation vectors $\\vec{r}_{12} = \\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2$, and unit vectors $\\hat{r}_{12} = \\frac{\\vec{r}_{12}}{r_{12}}$. Symmetry considerations often simplify complex problems through component cancellation. Advanced applications include equilibrium analysis where $\\sum \\vec{F} = 0$, constrained motion problems combining electrostatic with other forces, and stability investigations. Mastery of Coulomb's Law vector formulation provides the foundation for understanding electric fields and more advanced electromagnetic concepts."
