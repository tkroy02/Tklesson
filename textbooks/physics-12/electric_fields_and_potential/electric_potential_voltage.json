This principle enables calculation of particle speeds, trajectories, and behavior in potential fields without detailed force analysis. Key applications include: (1) Particle acceleration through potential differences: $\\Delta K = -q\\Delta V$, (2) Escape velocity calculations for bound systems, (3) Orbital motion in central fields, (4) Potential barrier penetration problems. The electron volt (eV) is defined as the kinetic energy gained by an electron accelerating through 1 volt potential difference: 1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J. This energy unit is particularly useful in atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. Conservation of energy provides a powerful alternative to Newton's second law for analyzing charged particle motion, especially in complex potential landscapes.",

  "summary": "Electric potential V = U/q₀ provides a scalar description of electrostatic systems, measured in volts (J/C). For point charges: V = kq/r, with superposition principle V_total = ΣV_i enabling multi-charge calculations. Potential energy U = qV relates to work W = -ΔU = -qΔV. Equipotential surfaces (V = constant) are perpendicular to electric fields, with E = -∇V connecting the two descriptions. Energy conservation ½mv² + qV = constant governs charged particle motion. Continuous distributions require integration V = ∫(k dq/r). The electron volt (1 eV = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ J) provides a natural energy scale for microscopic systems. Potential concepts simplify field analysis and provide the foundation for circuit theory, capacitor design, and numerous technological applications from particle accelerators to semiconductor devices."
