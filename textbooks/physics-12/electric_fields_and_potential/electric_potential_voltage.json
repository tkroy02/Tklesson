  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the concept of electric potential (voltage) as a scalar field derived from electric potential energy per unit charge. It establishes the mathematical definition, calculation methods for various charge distributions, and the fundamental principle of potential superposition, providing a powerful scalar tool for analyzing electrostatic systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Electric potential (V) is a scalar quantity representing the electric potential energy per unit charge at a point in space, defined as V = U/q, providing a path-independent description of electric field effects that enables energy calculations without vector complexity.",
    "explanation": "The electric potential at a point equals the work required per unit charge to bring a small test charge from a reference point (typically infinity) to that point against the electric field. Unlike the vector electric field, potential is a scalar field where V = kQ/r for point charges, enabling superposition through algebraic addition. This scalar nature makes potential invaluable for analyzing complex charge distributions and understanding energy transformations in electric fields."
