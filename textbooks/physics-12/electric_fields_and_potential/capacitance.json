This energy represents the work done to charge the capacitor, moving charge against the increasing potential difference.

The energy density in the electric field is $u = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2$ (J/m³), which when integrated over the capacitor volume gives the total stored energy.

          "statement": "The maximum energy density in capacitors is limited by dielectric breakdown. For a parallel plate capacitor with dielectric constant κ and breakdown field E_bd, the maximum energy density is $u_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon E_{bd}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa\\epsilon_0 E_{bd}^2$. This represents the fundamental limit on how much energy can be stored per unit volume in a capacitor. Practical capacitors achieve lower energy densities due to: (1) Safety margins below breakdown, (2) Volume occupied by conductors and packaging, (3) Non-uniform field distributions, (4) Dielectric imperfections. Different dielectric materials offer different tradeoffs: air (κ≈1, E_bd≈3 MV/m), paper (κ≈3, E_bd≈15 MV/m), ceramics (κ≈10-10000, E_bd≈1-10 MV/m), polymers (κ≈2-10, E_bd≈20-500 MV/m). Supercapacitors achieve high energy density through electrochemical effects at electrode surfaces rather than conventional dielectric polarization. Understanding these limits is crucial for capacitor selection in energy storage applications.",

  "summary": "Capacitance C = Q/ΔV measures charge storage efficiency per volt. Basic geometries include parallel plates (C = ε₀A/d), spherical, and cylindrical configurations. Dielectrics increase capacitance by factor κ while reducing field strength. Energy storage follows U = ½QΔV = ½C(ΔV)² = Q²/2C, with maximum density limited by dielectric breakdown. Capacitors combine in parallel (C_eq = ΣC_i) and series (1/C_eq = Σ1/C_i). Practical applications range from simple energy storage to complex electronic circuits, with specialized types like supercapacitors offering extremely high capacitance. Real capacitors have non-ideal characteristics including equivalent series resistance, leakage, and voltage limits that must be considered in design."
