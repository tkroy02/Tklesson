    "principle": "Capacitance (C) measures the ratio of stored charge (Q) to potential difference (V) between conductors, representing the system's ability to store electrical energy in the electric field between charged surfaces, with C = Q/V defining this fundamental relationship.",
    "explanation": "A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator or vacuum. When voltage is applied, equal but opposite charges accumulate on the conductors, creating an electric field between them. The capacitance depends only on the geometry of the conductors and the properties of the dielectric material between them, not on the amount of charge or applied voltage. This makes capacitance an intrinsic property of the physical system."

  "summary": "Section 4.8 establishes capacitance as a fundamental electrical property quantifying charge storage capacity per unit voltage. The capacitance C=Q/V depends solely on conductor geometry and dielectric properties, not on charge or voltage magnitude. Standard geometries include parallel plates (C∝A/d), cylindrical (C∝L/ln(b/a)), and spherical configurations. Capacitors combine in series (inverse capacitance adds) and parallel (capacitance adds), enabling complex networks. Dielectric materials increase capacitance through polarization while reducing internal fields. Modern applications span from discrete components to integrated circuits, where parasitic capacitance and high-frequency behavior become critical. Capacitance principles underlie energy storage systems, filtering networks, timing circuits, and fundamental semiconductor device operation, making this concept essential across electrical engineering and physics."
