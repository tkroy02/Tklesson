  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Electric potential energy represents the work done by an external agent to assemble a configuration of charges from infinite separation, stored in the electric field and available to do work when charges are allowed to move.",

  "summary": "Section 4.4 establishes electric potential energy as a fundamental concept describing the work required to assemble charge configurations against electrostatic forces. The energy U = kq₁q₂/r for point charges extends to complex systems through superposition, with negative energies indicating bound systems. Energy conservation principles govern charged particle motion, while continuous distributions require integration methods. Advanced concepts include capacitor energy storage, field energy density, and self-energy calculations that reveal the energy consequences of charge distribution. These principles form the foundation for understanding energy transfer in electrical systems, from microscopic particle interactions to macroscopic energy storage devices."
