Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative charges, with density proportional to field strength and never crossing. This visualization method provides intuitive understanding of complex field patterns, connects directly to Gauss's Law through flux interpretations, and enables both qualitative analysis and quantitative estimation of field properties. Advanced concepts include experimental mapping techniques and the relationship between field line patterns and fundamental electromagnetic principles, making field lines an essential tool for both education and professional analysis of electrostatic systems."
