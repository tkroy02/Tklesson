  "summary": "Simple harmonic motion represents the fundamental model for oscillatory behavior in physical systems, characterized by the differential equation d²x/dt² + ω²x = 0 with sinusoidal solutions. The motion exhibits continuous energy exchange between kinetic and potential forms while maintaining constant total energy in ideal systems. Real oscillators experience damping, described by the damping ratio ζ and quality factor Q, which govern amplitude decay and resonance characteristics. Driven oscillators exhibit resonance when the driving frequency matches the system's natural frequency, producing large amplitude responses. SHM principles apply universally across physics, from macroscopic mechanical systems to molecular vibrations and electrical circuits, providing the foundation for understanding wave phenomena, resonance effects, and oscillatory behavior throughout nature."
