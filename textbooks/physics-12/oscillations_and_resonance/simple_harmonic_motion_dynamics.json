The characteristic restoring force F = -kx leads to sinusoidal motion described by x(t) = A cos(ω₀t + φ), with natural frequency ω₀ = √(k/m). This framework applies to diverse systems including mass-spring oscillators and pendulums (under small angles), demonstrating universal oscillatory behavior governed by linear restoring forces. Energy methods provide complementary insights, while advanced concepts extend to complex exponentials, coupled systems, and nonlinear effects."
