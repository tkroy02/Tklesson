    "principle": "The period and frequency of an oscillatory system are determined by its intrinsic properties (mass, stiffness, length) and are independent of amplitude for small oscillations in linear systems, reflecting the system's natural timescale.",
    "explanation": "Period (T) represents the time for one complete oscillation cycle, while frequency (f) indicates how many cycles occur per unit time. The angular frequency (ω) connects these temporal parameters to the mathematical description of oscillation through ω = 2πf = 2π/T. These parameters are fundamental characteristics that distinguish different oscillatory systems."

The relationships T = 2π√(m/k) for mass-spring systems and T = 2π√(L/g) for pendulums reveal how stiffness and restoring forces govern oscillation timing. Advanced concepts include nonlinear corrections for large amplitudes, environmental effects on precision timekeeping, and the engineering of frequency standards. These timing parameters form the basis for understanding resonance, wave motion, and countless applications in timekeeping, communications, and measurement systems."
