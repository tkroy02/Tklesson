  "summary": "Period and frequency are fundamental characteristics of oscillatory motion that depend on system properties rather than initial conditions. The period $T$ (time for one complete cycle) and frequency $f$ (cycles per unit time) are related by $f = \\frac{1}{T}$, with angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. For spring-mass systems, $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$; for simple pendulums, $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}$. Physical pendulums generalize this to $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I}{mgd}}$. These relationships enable determination of system parameters from timing measurements and design of oscillators with specific periods. The concepts extend to wave phenomena, where period relates to wavelength and wave speed, and to resonance effects characterized by the quality factor $Q = \\frac{\\omega}{\\Delta\\omega}$. Fourier analysis decomposes complex periodic motions into simple harmonic components, connecting period and frequency concepts to the spectral analysis of vibrations and waves throughout physics."
