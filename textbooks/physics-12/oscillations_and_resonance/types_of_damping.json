  "summary": "Different types of damping exhibit distinct mathematical characteristics and physical behaviors. Viscous damping ($F_d = -bv$) produces exponential decay and is mathematically tractable. Coulomb damping ($F_d = -\\mu N\\, \\text{sgn}(v)$) causes linear amplitude decay and eventual sticking. Structural damping (modeled with complex stiffness $k^* = k(1 + i\\eta)$) shows frequency-dependent equivalent viscous behavior with constant loss factor. Velocity-squared damping ($F_d = -cv|v|$) leads to non-linear amplitude decay approximately following $A(t) \\propto 1/(1 + \\alpha t)$. Magnetic damping provides controllable non-contact damping through eddy currents. Active damping uses feedback control to achieve performance beyond passive limits. Each damping type suits specific applications: viscous for fluid systems, Coulomb for dry friction, structural for material internal losses, velocity-squared for aerodynamic drag, magnetic for precision instruments, and active for high-performance vibration control. Understanding these differences enables appropriate model selection and optimal damping design for specific engineering applications."
