  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The behavior of damped oscillators falls into three distinct regimes determined by the damping ratio ζ = γ/ω₀, with underdamped systems oscillating with exponential decay, critically damped systems returning to equilibrium fastest without oscillation, and overdamped systems decaying monotonically but more slowly.",
    "explanation": "The discriminant Δ = γ² - ω₀² of the characteristic equation determines the solution type: negative (underdamped, complex roots), zero (critically damped, repeated real roots), or positive (overdamped, distinct real roots). Each regime exhibits unique temporal behavior with specific advantages for different engineering applications."
