  "summary": "Section 3.5 establishes the comprehensive analysis of damped harmonic motion, where velocity-dependent resistive forces cause exponential amplitude decay while potentially maintaining oscillatory character. The damping regime (underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped) depends on the relationship between damping coefficient γ and natural frequency ω₀. Energy dissipation follows exponential decay with time constant τ = 1/(2γ), while the quality factor Q quantifies energy storage efficiency. Advanced concepts include nonlinear damping models, experimental parameter extraction techniques, and applications across engineering disciplines where controlled energy dissipation is essential for system performance and stability."
