  "summary": "Damped harmonic oscillators extend ideal SHM to real systems with energy dissipation. The governing equation $m\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + kx = 0$ leads to three damping regimes: underdamped ($\\zeta < 1$) with oscillatory decay $x(t) = Ae^{-\\zeta\\omega_0 t}\\cos(\\omega_d t + \\phi)$, critically damped ($\\zeta = 1$) with fastest non-oscillatory return $x(t) = (A+Bt)e^{-\\omega_0 t}$, and overdamped ($\\zeta > 1$) with slow exponential decay. Energy decays exponentially $E(t) = E_0e^{-t/\\tau}$ with time constant $\\tau = m/b$. The quality factor $Q = 1/2\\zeta$ quantifies damping effectiveness, relating to resonance bandwidth $\\Delta\\omega = \\omega_0/Q$. Applications span automotive suspensions ($\\zeta \\approx 0.2-0.4$), seismic protection, electrical filters, and vibration control. Understanding damping is crucial for designing systems that balance response speed, oscillation control, and energy efficiency in real-world applications."
