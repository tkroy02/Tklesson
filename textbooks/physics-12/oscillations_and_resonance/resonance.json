  "summary": "Resonance is a fundamental phenomenon where systems respond most strongly to driving forces matching their natural frequencies. The quality factor Q = ω₀/Δω = 1/2ζ quantifies resonance sharpness, with high Q indicating low damping and narrow bandwidth. Different resonance types occur at slightly different frequencies: amplitude resonance at ω₀√(1-2ζ²), velocity resonance exactly at ω₀. Coupled oscillator systems exhibit multiple resonance frequencies corresponding to normal modes, with energy exchange between components. Nonlinear resonance in systems like the Duffing oscillator shows amplitude-dependent frequency response, jump phenomena, and hysteresis. Parametric resonance occurs when system parameters are modulated at specific frequencies, leading to exponential growth. Resonance principles apply across mechanical, electrical, acoustic, optical, and quantum systems, enabling technologies from radio receivers and musical instruments to MRI machines and atomic clocks. Understanding resonance is crucial for both utilizing its benefits in energy transfer and frequency selection, and avoiding its dangers in structural failure and unwanted oscillations."
