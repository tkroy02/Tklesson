    "principle": "Resonance occurs when a periodic driving force matches a system's natural frequency, causing maximum energy transfer and amplitude response, with the resonance characteristics determined by the system's damping and quality factor.",
    "explanation": "At resonance, the driving force synchronizes with the system's natural oscillation, leading to constructive interference that builds large amplitudes. The resonance peak sharpness, maximum amplitude, and bandwidth are governed by the quality factor Q = ω₀/Δω, where high Q systems exhibit narrow, tall resonance peaks while low Q systems show broad, gentle response curves."
