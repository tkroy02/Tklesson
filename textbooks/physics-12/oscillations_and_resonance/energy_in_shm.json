  "summary": "Energy analysis provides fundamental insights into simple harmonic motion. The total mechanical energy $E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$ remains constant in undamped systems, with continuous exchange between kinetic energy $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and potential energy $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. Energy oscillates at twice the fundamental frequency, and average values satisfy $\\langle K \\rangle = \\langle U \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}E$. Energy methods offer powerful problem-solving approaches, often simpler than direct integration of equations of motion. In damped systems, energy decays exponentially $E(t) = E_0e^{-t/\\tau}$, characterized by the quality factor $Q$. Quantum mechanically, harmonic oscillator energy is quantized in levels $E_n = (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$ with non-zero ground state energy. These energy concepts connect classical oscillations to molecular vibrations, electrical circuits, and quantum systems throughout physics."
