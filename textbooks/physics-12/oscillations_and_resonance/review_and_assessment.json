Wave propagation follows $\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} = v^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}$ with solutions $y(x,t) = f(x \\mp vt)$, exhibiting superposition, interference, and impedance effects at boundaries. Advanced applications include vibration control through isolation and damping, energy harvesting using resonance, precision sensing via frequency response, and signal processing through wave-based techniques. Mastery involves not only solving individual problems but also integrating concepts across domains, designing optimized systems, and applying principles to novel situations in physics and engineering."
