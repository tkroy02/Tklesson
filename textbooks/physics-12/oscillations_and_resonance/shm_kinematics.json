The velocity leads displacement by 90°, while acceleration is 180° out of phase with displacement. Phase space analysis provides geometric insights into oscillatory dynamics, while phasor methods offer powerful tools for analyzing multiple oscillations. These kinematic relationships form the foundation for understanding wave motion, signal processing, and diverse oscillatory phenomena across physics and engineering applications."
