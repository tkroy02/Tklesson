  "summary": "SHM kinematics provides a complete mathematical description of oscillatory motion through the relationships x(t) = Acos(ωt + φ), v(t) = -Aωsin(ωt + φ), and a(t) = -Aω²cos(ωt + φ). The consistent phase relationships—velocity leading displacement by 90° and acceleration leading by 180°—characterize the energy exchange in oscillating systems. Graphical analysis reveals these relationships clearly and enables parameter extraction from experimental data. The connection to circular motion provides geometric intuition, while the superposition principle extends SHM analysis to complex systems including wave phenomena, beats, and coupled oscillations. These kinematic principles form the foundation for understanding diverse physical systems from mechanical vibrations to wave propagation and quantum mechanical oscillations."
