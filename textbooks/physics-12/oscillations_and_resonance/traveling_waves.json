  "summary": "Traveling waves represent disturbances that propagate through space while transferring energy without net material transport. The wave equation $\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} = v^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}$ governs wave motion, with solutions $y(x,t) = f(x \\mp vt)$ representing waves traveling at speed $v$. Harmonic waves follow $y(x,t) = A\\cos(kx \\mp \\omega t + \\phi)$ with fundamental relationships $v = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\lambda f$. Wave energy density is proportional to $A^2\\omega^2$, and power transport is $P = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\omega^2 A^2 v$ for strings. The superposition principle enables wave interference, creating standing waves from counter-propagating waves. Wave impedance $Z$ determines reflection and transmission at boundaries, with complete transmission when impedances match. Dispersion relations $\\omega(k)$ determine both phase velocity $v_p = \\frac{\\omega}{k}$ and group velocity $v_g = \\frac{d\\omega}{dk}$, with dispersion causing pulse spreading in many physical systems."
