  "summary": "Section 3.7 establishes the comprehensive analysis of forced oscillatory systems, where external periodic drives interact with damped oscillators to produce characteristic frequency-dependent responses. The steady-state solution exhibits resonant amplification when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency, with amplitude and phase relationships determined by damping. Complex impedance methods provide elegant solutions, while energy analysis reveals optimal power transfer conditions. Advanced concepts include frequency response characterization, nonlinear effects creating jump phenomena and bistability, and applications across disciplines from electrical engineering to structural dynamics. Forced oscillation principles form the foundation for understanding resonant systems, filters, transducers, and countless devices that exploit frequency-selective behavior."
