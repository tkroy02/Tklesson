  "summary": "Forced oscillations occur when oscillators are driven by external periodic forces. The steady-state response $x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)$ has amplitude $A = \\frac{F_0/k}{\\sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}}$ and phase lag $\\delta = \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{2\\zeta r}{1-r^2})$, where $r = \\omega/\\omega_0$. Resonance produces maximum amplitude at $\\omega_{res} = \\omega_0\\sqrt{1-2\\zeta^2}$ with $A_{max} = \\frac{F_0/k}{2\\zeta\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}$. The quality factor $Q = \\frac{1}{2\\zeta} = \\frac{\\omega_0}{\\Delta\\omega}$ quantifies resonance sharpness. Average power input $\\langle P \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}F_0\\omega A\\sin\\delta$ maximizes at $\\omega = \\omega_0$ with $\\langle P \\rangle_{max} = \\frac{F_0^2}{2b}$. Vibration isolation requires operation above $r > \\sqrt{2}$ with transmissibility $T = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + (2\\zeta r)^2}{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\\zeta r)^2}}$. These principles apply across mechanical, electrical, and acoustic systems, enabling the design of resonant energy transfer systems, vibration isolators, filters, and numerous other engineering applications."
