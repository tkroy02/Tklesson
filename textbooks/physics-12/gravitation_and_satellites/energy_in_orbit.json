  "summary": "Orbital energy analysis provides a powerful framework for understanding and predicting celestial motion. The fundamental relationship $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}$ governs all gravitational orbits, with bound states (E < 0) following closed trajectories and unbound states (E ≥ 0) following open paths. The vis-viva equation $v^2 = GM(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a})$ derived from energy conservation enables calculation of orbital speeds at any point. Practical applications include Hohmann transfers for efficient orbital changes, gravity assists for interplanetary missions, and Lagrange point utilization for specialized orbits. Advanced concepts extend to multi-body systems through the Jacobi integral and relativistic regimes where gravitational wave emission causes orbital decay. From satellite operations to black hole mergers, orbital energy principles remain essential tools for space mission design and astrophysical analysis."
