Defined as $U = -\\frac{GMm}{r}$ for point masses with zero at infinite separation, this energy formulation enables application of conservation principles to complex gravitational problems. Escape velocity $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}$ represents the minimum speed needed to overcome gravitational binding, while orbital energy $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2a}$ determines orbital characteristics. The virial theorem $\\langle K \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\langle U \\rangle$ provides a fundamental constraint on stable gravitational systems. These concepts find application in space mission planning, astrophysical energy calculations, and understanding formation and evolution of astronomical bodies from planets to galaxies."
