  "summary": "Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation provides a complete mathematical description of gravitational interactions, explaining phenomena from falling apples to planetary orbits through the inverse-square relationship $F_g = G\\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$. The concepts of gravitational fields and potential energy enable powerful methods for analyzing orbital motion, with Kepler's laws emerging as mathematical consequences. This framework successfully describes celestial mechanics throughout the solar system and beyond, while its limitations in extreme conditions motivated the development of Einstein's general relativity. Mastery of Newtonian gravitation remains essential for space mission planning, astronomical research, and understanding fundamental physical interactions."
