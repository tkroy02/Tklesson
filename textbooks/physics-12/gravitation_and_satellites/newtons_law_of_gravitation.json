Also find the acceleration each body experiences due to this force.\n\n**Answer:** **Direct Gravitational Force Analysis:**\n\n**Force Calculation:**\n- F = G(MₑMₘ/r²)\n- F = (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹) × (5.97 × 10²⁴ × 7.35 × 10²²) / (3.84 × 10⁸)²\n- Numerator: 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ × 4.388 × 10⁴⁷ = 2.928 × 10³⁷\n- Denominator: (3.84 × 10⁸)² = 1.475 × 10¹⁷\n- F = 2.928 × 10³⁷ / 1.475 × 10¹⁷ = 1.985 × 10²⁰ N\n\n**Acceleration Analysis:**\n- Moon's acceleration: aₘ = F/Mₘ = 1.985 × 10²⁰ / 7.35 × 10²² = 0.00270 m/s²\n- Earth's acceleration: aₑ = F/Mₑ = 1.985 × 10²⁰ / 5.97 × 10²⁴ = 3.32 × 10⁻⁵ m/s²\n\n**Physical Significance:**\n- The Moon experiences 0.0027 m/s² acceleration toward Earth\n- Earth experiences only 3.32 × 10⁻⁵ m/s² toward Moon (81× smaller)\n- This explains why Moon orbits Earth rather than both orbiting a common point equally\n- The force magnitude (~2 × 10²⁰ N) is enormous yet produces small accelerations due to the massive bodies involved"

  "summary": "Section 2.1 establishes Newton's law of universal gravitation as the fundamental principle describing gravitational interactions between all masses. The inverse-square force law F = G(m₁m₂/r²) explains phenomena from everyday weight to planetary motion, while the vector nature and superposition principle enable analysis of complex multi-body systems. The universal gravitational constant G quantifies the strength of this weakest fundamental force, and the shell theorem simplifies calculations for spherical bodies. This foundation supports all subsequent gravitational concepts from fields and potential energy to orbital mechanics."
