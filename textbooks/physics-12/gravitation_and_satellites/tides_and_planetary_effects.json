  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Tidal forces arise from gravitational field gradients across extended bodies, creating differential accelerations that deform objects and transfer energy and angular momentum within gravitational systems.",
    "explanation": "Tidal effects result from the difference in gravitational attraction between different parts of an extended body, not the absolute gravitational strength. These differential forces create tidal bulges, drive orbital evolution through tidal friction, and can lead to dramatic phenomena like tidal locking, orbital circularization, and even tidal disruption of celestial bodies."

Tidal forces create measurable accelerations, drive long-term orbital evolution through angular momentum transfer, and can generate substantial internal heating. Key concepts include the Roche limit for tidal disruption, tidal locking as an equilibrium state, and resonant systems that maintain orbital eccentricities against tidal circularization. These effects explain diverse phenomena from ocean tides on Earth to the volcanic activity on Io, with applications spanning planetary science, exoplanet studies, and understanding the dynamical evolution of gravitational systems throughout the universe."
