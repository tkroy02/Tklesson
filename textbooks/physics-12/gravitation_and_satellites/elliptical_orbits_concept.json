  "summary": "Elliptical orbits represent the general case of bound orbital motion under inverse-square gravitational forces. Characterized by semi-major axis a, eccentricity e, and orientation parameters, elliptical orbits exhibit continuous energy exchange between kinetic and potential forms while maintaining constant total energy E = -GMm/2a. The vis-viva equation v² = GM(2/r - 1/a) governs velocity variations, with maximum speed at perihelion and minimum at aphelion. Kepler's second law ensures equal areas are swept in equal times, while Kepler's equation M = E - e sin E relates time to orbital position. Practical applications range from efficient Hohmann transfers between orbits to specialized Molniya orbits for high-latitude communications. Elliptical orbit analysis provides the foundation for understanding planetary motion, designing space missions, and predicting celestial phenomena throughout the solar system and beyond."
