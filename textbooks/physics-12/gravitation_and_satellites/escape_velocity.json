  "summary": "Escape velocity, defined as $v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$, represents the minimum speed needed to overcome gravitational binding and achieve a parabolic trajectory to infinity. Derived from energy conservation principles, it provides fundamental insights into celestial mechanics and space mission requirements. In multi-body systems, concepts like sphere of influence and gravity assists become crucial for efficient trajectory design. Relativistic corrections become significant near compact objects, with the Schwarzschild radius $R_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2}$ marking the event horizon where escape becomes impossible. From practical space mission planning to fundamental black hole physics, escape velocity concepts connect Newtonian mechanics with general relativity and continue to shape our understanding of gravitational systems across the cosmos."
