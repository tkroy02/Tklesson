  "summary": "Kepler's three laws of planetary motion represent foundational principles in celestial mechanics. The first law establishes that orbits are ellipses with the central mass at one focus. The second law, derived from angular momentum conservation, states that equal areas are swept in equal times. The third law relates orbital period to semi-major axis: $T^2 \\propto a^3$. These empirical laws, derived from Tycho Brahe's precise observations, were later explained theoretically by Newton's law of universal gravitation. Modern applications extend from exoplanet detection using transit and radial velocity methods to testing general relativity through Mercury's perihelion precession. Kepler's laws remain essential tools in astronomy, spacecraft navigation, and astrophysics, demonstrating the enduring power of mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena."
