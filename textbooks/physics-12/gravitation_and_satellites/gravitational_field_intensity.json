The related concept of gravitational potential offers a scalar description connected to the field through $\\vec{g} = -\\nabla V$, with equipotential surfaces providing important references for elevation measurements. Gauss's Law for gravitation, $\\oint \\vec{g} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = -4\\pi G M_{enc}$, provides a powerful method for calculating fields of symmetric mass distributions. These concepts form the foundation for analyzing gravitational effects from laboratory scales to astronomical systems, with applications in geophysics, orbital mechanics, and fundamental physics research."
