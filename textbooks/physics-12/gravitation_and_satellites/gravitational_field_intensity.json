The field intensity g = F_g/m provides a mass-independent description of gravitational effects, enabling analysis through vector superposition, Gauss's law for symmetric distributions, and integration for complex shapes. This field perspective reveals important phenomena like tidal forces and provides the foundation for potential theory, while connecting Newtonian gravitation to more advanced concepts in field theory and general relativity."
