Maximum energy limited by relativistic mass increase. Synchrotrons: Use time-varying B fields and RF cavities synchronized with particle motion, accommodating relativistic effects by increasing B as momentum increases. Storage Rings: Use precise magnetic fields to maintain circular orbits for extended periods, with focusing magnets maintaining beam stability. Betatron: Uses changing magnetic flux through orbit to accelerate particles via induced electric fields. Key considerations: (1) Magnetic rigidity Bρ = p/q determines bending radius, (2) Strong focusing using alternating gradient magnets minimizes beam size, (3) Synchrotron radiation energy loss significant for light particles at high energies, (4) Beam injection and extraction require precise magnetic control. These principles enable accelerators for fundamental research, medical isotope production, and radiation therapy.",

  "summary": "Charged particles in magnetic fields follow curved paths due to the perpendicular magnetic force. In uniform fields: perpendicular velocity causes circular motion with r=mv/(qB), ω=qB/m; velocity components create helical trajectories. Key parameters: cyclotron radius (momentum-dependent), frequency (mass-dependent), pitch (parallel velocity dependent). In non-uniform fields: magnetic mirrors reflect particles via magnetic moment conservation; gradient and curvature drifts cause transverse motion. Applications include: particle accelerators (exploiting constant period), plasma confinement (using magnetic mirrors and twisted fields), mass spectrometers (separating by m/q ratio), and space physics (radiation belts, aurora). Understanding these motions enables precise particle control from laboratory scales to astrophysical phenomena."
