This force: (1) Drives charge separation along the conductor, with positive and negative charges accumulating at opposite ends, (2) Creates an internal electric field $\\vec{E}_{induced} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$ within the conductor, (3) Establishes a potential difference $V = \\oint \\vec{E}_{induced} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\oint (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot d\\vec{l}$ between conductor ends, (4) Reaches equilibrium when electric force $qE$ balances magnetic force $qvB$, giving $E = vB$. This induced electric field is non-conservative and cannot be described by a scalar potential. In closed circuits, this EMF drives current according to Ohm's Law: $I = \\mathcal{E}/R$.

  "summary": "Motional EMF arises when conductors move through magnetic fields, generating electromotive force through the Lorentz force mechanism: ℰ = ∮(v×B)·dl. For straight conductors: ℰ = Blv when mutually perpendicular. For rotational systems: integration gives ℰ = ½BωL² for rods, ℰ = ½BωR² for disks. The induced EMF drives current in closed circuits, with the magnetic force on this current opposing the motion (Lenz's Law). Applications include: electrical generators converting mechanical to electrical energy, electromagnetic flowmeters measuring fluid velocity, homopolar generators producing high DC currents, and space tethers generating power from orbital motion. Energy conservation ensures mechanical work input equals electrical energy output plus losses. Motional EMF enables direct energy conversion without intermediate steps, forming the basis for much of modern electrical power generation."
