  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Motional EMF is generated when a conductor moves through a magnetic field, given by ε = ∫(v × B)·dl, where the motion-induced Lorentz force on charge carriers creates a potential difference along the conductor, with the total EMF equal to the rate of magnetic flux sweep.",
    "explanation": "When a conductor moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, charge carriers experience a magnetic force F = q(v × B) that separates them, creating an electric field within the conductor. This establishes an EMF ε = Bℓv for straight conductors moving perpendicular to uniform fields, where ℓ is the conductor length. The motional EMF can also be understood as the rate at which the conductor sweeps through magnetic flux: ε = dΦ/dt = B(dA/dt)."

For straight conductors in uniform fields perpendicular to motion, this simplifies to ε = Bℓv. The phenomenon can be understood through both microscopic Lorentz force on charge carriers and macroscopic magnetic flux sweep rate. Rotational systems generate EMF through angular motion, with applications in generators and sensors. Advanced concepts include complex motion patterns, relativistic frame invariance, and magnetohydrodynamic systems where conducting fluids replace solid conductors. Motional EMF principles underpin electric generators, magnetic braking systems, various sensors, and energy harvesting technologies, demonstrating the fundamental connection between mechanical motion and electromagnetic energy conversion."
