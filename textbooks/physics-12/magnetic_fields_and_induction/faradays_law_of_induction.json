This is represented by the negative sign in Faraday's Law: $\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}$. Physical interpretation: (1) If flux is increasing, induced current creates a magnetic field opposing the increase, (2) If flux is decreasing, induced current creates a field that tries to maintain the original flux, (3) The induced current always flows in a direction to oppose the motion or change causing induction. This opposition ensures conservation of energy - work must be done against the induced effects to change the flux. For example, pushing a magnet into a coil requires work to overcome the repulsive force from the induced current. Lenz's Law provides a simple method for determining induced current direction without complex calculations: identify the change in flux, then determine what current would create opposite flux change.",

Key principles: (1) Changing current in primary coil creates changing magnetic flux in the core, (2) This changing flux induces EMF in secondary coil according to Faraday's Law, (3) For ideal transformers (no losses, perfect coupling): $\\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \\frac{N_s}{N_p}$ and $\\frac{I_s}{I_p} = \\frac{N_p}{N_s}$, so power is conserved ($V_pI_p = V_sI_s$), (4) The core enhances coupling and confines flux, (5) Transformers only work with AC currents - constant DC produces no induction. The mutual inductance M defines the relationship: $\\mathcal{E}_2 = -M\\frac{dI_1}{dt}$, where M depends on geometry and coupling. Real transformers have losses from: resistance in windings, eddy currents in core, hysteresis in magnetic material, and leakage flux. Transformer efficiency is typically 95-99% for large power transformers. This principle enables efficient voltage transformation for power transmission and distribution.",

  "summary": "Faraday's Law states that a changing magnetic flux induces an EMF: ℰ = -dΦ_B/dt. Lenz's Law specifies that the induced EMF opposes the change creating it. Magnetic flux can change through: varying field strength, changing area, or changing orientation. Motional EMF occurs when conductors move through magnetic fields: ℰ = ∮(v×B)·dl. Applications include: AC generators (ℰ = NBAωsinωt), transformers (V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p), induction heating, and electromagnetic braking. Self-induction (ℰ = -L dI/dt) and mutual induction (ℰ₂ = -M dI₁/dt) describe induced effects from changing currents. Electromagnetic induction enables efficient energy conversion between electrical and mechanical forms and is fundamental to modern electrical technology."
