  "expanded_description": "This section develops Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, establishing the fundamental relationship between changing magnetic flux and induced electromotive force (EMF), and analyzing the various mechanisms through which EMF can be generated in circuits and conductors.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Faraday's Law states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) in any closed circuit equals the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit: ε = -dΦ_B/dt, where Φ_B = ∫B·dA is the magnetic flux, and the negative sign indicates the direction of induced current opposes the change in flux (Lenz's Law).",
    "explanation": "Electromagnetic induction occurs through three primary mechanisms: changing magnetic field strength with stationary circuit (transformer EMF), moving conductors in static magnetic fields (motional EMF), and changing circuit area or orientation in static fields. The induced EMF drives current that creates its own magnetic field opposing the original flux change, embodying energy conservation. Faraday's Law connects electricity and magnetism, enabling generators, transformers, and countless electromagnetic devices."

  "summary": "Section 5.6 establishes Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction (ε = -dΦ_B/dt) as the fundamental relationship governing induced electromotive forces from changing magnetic flux. The law encompasses three primary mechanisms: changing magnetic field strength (transformer EMF), conductor motion in static fields (motional EMF), and changing circuit geometry. Lenz's Law provides the direction of induced currents, ensuring they oppose the flux change that creates them, thereby conserving energy. Applications range from simple generators and transformers to sophisticated systems like eddy current brakes, induction heating, and resonant wireless power transfer. Advanced concepts include the differential form (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t), relativistic formulations, and quantum effects like flux quantization, demonstrating that electromagnetic induction underpins much of modern electrical technology while revealing deep connections between electricity, magnetism, and fundamental physics."
