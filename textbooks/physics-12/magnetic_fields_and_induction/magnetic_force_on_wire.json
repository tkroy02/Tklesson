    "principle": "The magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor is given by F = I(L × B), where I is the current, L is the length vector pointing in the current direction, and B is the magnetic field, representing the cumulative effect of Lorentz forces on all moving charges within the conductor.",
    "explanation": "This macroscopic force results from the sum of individual Lorentz forces F = q(v_d × B) on each charge carrier, with the drift velocity v_d relating to current through I = nqAv_d. For straight wires in uniform fields, the force magnitude is F = ILB sinθ, perpendicular to both the current direction and magnetic field. The force direction follows the right-hand rule: point fingers in current direction, curl toward B field, thumb shows force direction."

The force is always perpendicular to both current direction and magnetic field, with magnitude F = ILB sinθ. Closed loops in uniform fields experience zero net force but non-zero torque τ = μ × B, where μ is the magnetic moment. Practical applications include electric motors, loudspeakers, and measurement devices, where optimization involves balancing force requirements with power dissipation, mass constraints, and magnetic field design. These principles form the foundation for electromechanical energy conversion and precise force control in numerous technological systems."
