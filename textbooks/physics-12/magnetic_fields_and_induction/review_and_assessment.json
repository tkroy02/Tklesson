  "summary": "Unit 5 review integrates magnetic fields, forces, electromagnetic induction, and energy conversion into a unified electromagnetic framework. Mastery involves: fluid movement between different representations (fields, forces, induction, energy); recognizing optimal solution strategies for different problems; applying principles to novel situations; understanding scaling laws and physical limits; connecting mathematical results to physical reality. Comprehensive assessment evaluates conceptual understanding, problem-solving flexibility, experimental design capability, and ability to apply principles to real-world applications and emerging technologies. This integrated perspective transforms electromagnetic knowledge from isolated formulas to a powerful toolkit for analyzing diverse physical systems across multiple scales and applications, from microscopic sensors to utility-scale power systems."
