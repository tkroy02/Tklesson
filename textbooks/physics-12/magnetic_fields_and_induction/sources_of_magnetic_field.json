  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges and currents, with the field from a current element given by the Biot-Savart Law dB = (μ₀/4π)(I dl × r̂)/r², and the net magnetic field from any current distribution obtained through superposition and integration of these elemental contributions.",
    "explanation": "The Biot-Savart Law provides the fundamental relationship between current elements and the magnetic fields they produce, while Ampere's Law (∮B·dl = μ₀I_enc) offers a powerful alternative for calculating fields in highly symmetric situations. Magnetic fields from currents form concentric circles around straight wires, with field strength decreasing as 1/r, and exhibit characteristic patterns for loops, solenoids, and toroids that are crucial for practical applications in electromagnets, transformers, and magnetic sensors."
