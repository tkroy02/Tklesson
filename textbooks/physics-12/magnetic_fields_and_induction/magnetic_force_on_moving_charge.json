Particles with $v < E/B$ curve toward E direction, those with $v > E/B$ curve opposite. E×B Drift: When forces don't balance, particles undergo complex motion combining oscillation with steady drift velocity $\\vec{v}_d = \\frac{\\vec{E} \\times \\vec{B}}{B^2}$ perpendicular to both fields. This drift is independent of charge sign, mass, and velocity. Crossed Field Applications: (1) Velocity selectors for producing monoenergetic particle beams, (2) Mass spectrometers for separating ions by mass, (3) Thomson's e/m experiment for measuring charge-to-mass ratio, (4) Plasma confinement in fusion devices, (5) Hall effect measurements in semiconductors.

  "summary": "Magnetic forces on moving charges follow $\\vec{F}_B = q\\vec{v} × \\vec{B}$, always perpendicular to both velocity and field. This force changes direction but not speed, causing curved trajectories. In uniform B with v⟂B, circular motion occurs with radius r=mv/(qB) and period T=2πm/(qB). With velocity components both parallel and perpendicular to B, helical motion results. Crossed electric and magnetic fields enable velocity selection when v=E/B. Applications include mass spectrometers (separating ions by mass), cyclotrons (resonant acceleration), velocity selectors (producing monoenergetic beams), and Hall effect devices (measuring carrier properties). Magnetic forces enable precise control of charged particles for numerous scientific, medical, and technological applications."
