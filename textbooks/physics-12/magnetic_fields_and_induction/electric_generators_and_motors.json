    "explanation": "Generators operate by moving conductors through magnetic fields to induce EMF according to ε = -dΦ_B/dt, with mechanical work input overcoming the opposing magnetic forces. Motors operate by passing current through conductors in magnetic fields, generating forces F = I(L × B) that produce mechanical torque. The same physical device can often operate as either generator or motor depending on energy flow direction, with efficiency limited by losses including resistive heating, magnetic hysteresis, and mechanical friction."

Generators convert mechanical energy to electrical energy through Faraday's Law of induction (ε = -dΦ_B/dt), with mechanical work input overcoming opposing magnetic forces. Motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy through Lorentz forces (F = I(L × B)) on current-carrying conductors, with back EMF limiting current flow. Key machine types include DC machines with commutators, synchronous machines with constant speed operation, and induction machines with slip-dependent behavior.
