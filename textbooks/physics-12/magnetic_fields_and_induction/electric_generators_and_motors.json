(2) Back EMF Development: When the generator supplies current to a load, this current flowing through the armature windings creates a magnetic field that interacts with the main field, producing a torque that opposes the rotation. This counter-torque is the motor action of the generator and represents the electromagnetic reaction to power extraction. The mechanical power input must overcome this counter-torque plus mechanical losses. The back EMF ensures energy conservation: $P_{mechanical} = P_{electrical} + P_{losses}$. In loaded operation, the terminal voltage drops due to armature resistance. Voltage regulation methods include: varying field current, controlling prime mover speed, or using automatic voltage regulators. Understanding this dual nature - generator action creating voltage and motor action creating opposition - is crucial for analyzing generator performance under load.",

  "summary": "Electric generators convert mechanical energy to electrical energy via electromagnetic induction (Faraday's Law), while electric motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy via magnetic forces on currents (Lorentz force). Generators produce back EMF that creates counter-torque under load, while motors develop back EMF proportional to speed that regulates current flow. Key types include: AC generators (alternators) with slip rings, DC generators with commutators, induction motors (most common), synchronous motors (constant speed), and DC motors (easy speed control). System efficiency optimization involves proper sizing, power factor correction, variable speed drives, and regenerative braking. Applications span from utility-scale power generation to precision motion control, with modern systems achieving efficiencies over 95% in large devices. The generator-motor duality demonstrates the reversible nature of electromagnetic energy conversion."
