    "principle": "Magnetic fields (B) are vector fields that exert forces on moving charges and magnetic dipoles, characterized by field lines that form continuous closed loops emerging from north poles and entering south poles, with zero divergence (∇·B=0) indicating no magnetic monopoles.",
    "explanation": "Unlike electric fields that originate and terminate on charges, magnetic field lines always form closed loops due to the absence of magnetic monopoles. The magnetic field strength is measured in teslas (T), where 1 T = 1 N·s/(C·m) = 1 N/(A·m), and is defined by the force on a moving charge. Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges (currents), changing electric fields, and intrinsic magnetic moments of particles."

Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges, magnetic materials, and changing electric fields, measured in teslas with field line density indicating strength. Visualization techniques include field line patterns and vector plots, while measurement methods employ Hall effect sensors, magnetometers, and compass alignment. The Earth's magnetic field approximates a dipole with ~30-60 μT strength, demonstrating practical geophysical significance. Advanced concepts include microscopic origins from electron motion and spin, material magnetic responses, and relativistic field transformations, establishing the foundation for all subsequent magnetic phenomena analysis in this unit."
