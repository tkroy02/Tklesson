  "summary": "Section 1.8 establishes angular momentum as a fundamental conserved quantity in physics, with L = Iω for rigid bodies and L = r × p for particles. Its conservation under zero net external torque provides powerful constraints on rotational motion, explaining phenomena from figure skater spins to planetary orbits. The vector nature of angular momentum leads to gyroscopic precession when torques act, while its quantization in quantum mechanics reveals fundamental particle properties. Angular momentum conservation serves as a unifying principle across classical, quantum, and relativistic physics with applications from everyday objects to astrophysical systems."
