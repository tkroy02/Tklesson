  "summary": "Torque and rotational dynamics extend Newtonian mechanics to rotational motion, with torque $\\tau$ serving as the rotational analog of force and moment of inertia I as the rotational analog of mass. The fundamental relationship $\\tau = I\\alpha$ connects applied torques to angular acceleration, while energy concepts $W = \\int\\tau d\\theta$ and $K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$ provide powerful alternative solution methods. For complex motions involving both translation and rotation, coupled equations $\\sum F = Ma_{CM}$ and $\\sum\\tau = I\\alpha$ with appropriate constraints completely describe the motion. These principles enable analysis of diverse systems from simple rotations to complex rolling motion, physical pendulums, and mechanical systems, demonstrating the universal applicability of Newtonian mechanics across all types of motion."
