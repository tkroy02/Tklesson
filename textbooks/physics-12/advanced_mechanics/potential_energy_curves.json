  "summary": "Potential energy curves provide a powerful unified framework for analyzing physical systems across classical and quantum domains. Through the fundamental relationship $F = -dU/dx$, these curves encode complete information about force behavior, equilibrium positions, and stability. The small oscillations approximation enables analytical treatment of complex systems near stable equilibria, while connections to quantum mechanics reveal how classical concepts evolve into probabilistic descriptions with phenomena like energy quantization and barrier tunneling. Mastery of potential energy analysis develops crucial intuition for understanding diverse physical systems from molecular vibrations to nuclear processes, establishing foundational concepts that bridge Newtonian mechanics with quantum theory and modern physics applications."
