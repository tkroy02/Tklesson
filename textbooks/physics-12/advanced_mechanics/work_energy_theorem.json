  "summary": "The work-energy theorem represents a fundamental and powerful reformulation of Newtonian mechanics that provides significant computational advantages for many physical problems. Through the relationship $W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta K$, this theorem enables efficient analysis of motion by focusing on energy transformations rather than detailed force calculations. The generalized form $W_{\\text{nc}} = \\Delta K + \\Delta U$ extends this approach to systems with both conservative and non-conservative forces. While remarkably robust within classical mechanics, the theorem has specific limitations in relativistic regimes, quantum systems, and variable mass scenarios that reveal the boundaries of classical physics and point toward more advanced physical theories. Mastery of the work-energy theorem provides not only practical problem-solving tools but also deep conceptual understanding of energy principles that form the foundation for advanced physics study."
