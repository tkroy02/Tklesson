    "principle": "Moment of inertia quantifies a body's resistance to angular acceleration, depending on both total mass and its distribution relative to the rotation axis, making it the rotational equivalent of mass in linear motion.",
    "explanation": "The moment of inertia I = Σmᵢrᵢ² for discrete systems or I = ∫r²dm for continuous bodies represents how mass distribution affects rotational behavior. Unlike mass, it is not an intrinsic property but depends on the chosen axis of rotation, leading to different values for the same object rotated about different axes."

  "summary": "Section 1.6 establishes moment of inertia as the fundamental quantity governing rotational dynamics, representing a body's resistance to angular acceleration. Through integration techniques and transformation theorems, we can calculate I for any rigid body about any axis. The moment of inertia depends critically on both total mass and its distribution relative to the rotation axis, with mass farther from the axis contributing disproportionately more to rotational inertia. This concept connects directly to rotational kinetic energy, angular momentum, and the rotational form of Newton's second law, providing the foundation for analyzing all rotational motion."
