  "summary": "Moment of inertia serves as the fundamental quantity characterizing rotational inertia, playing the same role in rotational dynamics that mass plays in linear motion. Defined as $I = \\int r^2  dm$ for continuous objects, it depends critically on both the total mass and its spatial distribution relative to the rotation axis. The parallel axis theorem $I = I_{CM} + Md^2$ enables calculation about any axis from the center of mass moment, while composite objects can be analyzed by summing component moments. Through its appearance in $\\tau = I\\alpha$, $K_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$, and $L = I\\omega$, moment of inertia governs rotational acceleration, energy storage, and angular momentum in diverse systems from rolling objects to physical pendulums, making it essential for understanding and designing rotational mechanical systems."
