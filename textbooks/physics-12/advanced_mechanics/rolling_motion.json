  "summary": "Rolling motion represents a fundamental case of combined translation and rotation where an object moves without slipping, constrained by $v_{CM} = R\\omega$. This pure rolling condition ensures the contact point is stationary relative to the surface, with static friction providing the necessary torque without energy dissipation. The dynamics involve coupled equations for translation and rotation, with acceleration depending on the object's moment of inertia through $a = F/(M + I/R^2)$. Energy partitions between translational and rotational forms according to the object's geometry. Real-world rolling involves additional complexities including slipping transitions, rolling resistance from deformation, and different friction behavior in driven versus pushed scenarios. These principles find widespread application in vehicle dynamics, sports physics, and industrial processes where controlled rolling motion is essential."
