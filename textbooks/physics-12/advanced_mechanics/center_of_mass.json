  "summary": "Section 1.4 establishes the center of mass as a fundamental concept that simplifies complex system analysis by concentrating total mass at an average position. Through discrete summations and continuous integrations, we can locate the CM for any mass distribution. The CM moves according to Newton's second law with all external forces, while internal motions and rotations occur around it. This powerful concept enables simplified analysis of stability, collisions, and system dynamics across scales from everyday objects to astronomical systems."
