  "summary": "The center of mass concept provides powerful simplification for analyzing complex physical systems by separating overall translational motion from internal dynamics. Through the fundamental relationship $\\vec{F}_{ext} = M\\vec{a}_{CM}$, the center of mass moves as if all mass were concentrated at that point, unaffected by internal forces. This enables elegant analysis of collisions through the center of mass frame, simplifies rotational dynamics via the parallel axis theorem, and provides insights into system stability. From everyday objects to astrophysical systems, the center of mass serves as a unifying concept that reveals the essential physics underlying diverse phenomena while maintaining mathematical tractability for complex multi-body problems."
