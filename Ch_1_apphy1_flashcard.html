  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the difference between **distance** and **displacement**?", answer: "Distance is a scalar quantity and refers to the total path traveled. Displacement is a vector and is the change in position from start to end." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **speed** and **velocity**?", answer: "Speed is a scalar quantity (distance/time). Velocity is a vector (displacement/time) that includes direction." },
    { question: "What does the slope of a **position-time graph** represent?", answer: "The velocity of the object." },
    { question: "What does the slope of a **velocity-time graph** represent?", answer: "The acceleration of the object." },
    { question: "What does the area under a **velocity-time graph** represent?", answer: "The displacement of the object." },
    { question: "What does the area under an **acceleration-time graph** represent?", answer: "The change in velocity." },
    { question: "State the first kinematic equation that relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time.", answer: "$$v_f = v_i + at$$" },
    { question: "State the second kinematic equation that relates displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, and time.", answer: "$$\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t$$" },
    { question: "State the third kinematic equation that relates displacement, initial velocity, time, and acceleration.", answer: "$$\\Delta x = v_it + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$$" },
    { question: "State the fourth kinematic equation that relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and displacement.", answer: "$$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\\Delta x$$" },
    { question: "What is the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity on Earth?", answer: "$$g \\approx 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$$" },
    { question: "When an object is in free fall, what is its acceleration?", answer: "It is constant and equal to the acceleration due to gravity, $$g$$, downward." },
    { question: "At the peak of its trajectory, what is the vertical velocity of a projectile?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "For projectile motion, how do you treat the horizontal and vertical components of motion?", answer: "They are independent of each other." },
    { question: "In the absence of air resistance, what is the horizontal acceleration of a projectile?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "In the absence of air resistance, what is the vertical acceleration of a projectile?", answer: "Constant and equal to $$-g$$ (downward)." },
    { question: "What does a negative velocity on a position-time graph indicate?", answer: "The object is moving in the negative direction." },
    { question: "What does a horizontal line on a velocity-time graph indicate?", answer: "Constant velocity, meaning zero acceleration." },
    { question: "What does a curved line on a position-time graph indicate?", answer: "Changing velocity, meaning there is acceleration." },
    { question: "What is **instantaneous velocity**?", answer: "The velocity of an object at a specific moment in time." },
    { question: "What is **average velocity**?", answer: "The total displacement divided by the total time taken." },
    { question: "How can you find the instantaneous velocity from a position-time graph?", answer: "By finding the slope of the tangent line at that specific point in time." },
    { question: "What does a line with a negative slope on a velocity-time graph indicate?", answer: "The object is slowing down if its velocity is positive, or speeding up if its velocity is negative." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **vector** and a **scalar**?", answer: "A vector has both magnitude and direction, while a scalar has only magnitude." },
    { question: "Is speed a scalar or a vector?", answer: "A scalar." },
    { question: "Is displacement a scalar or a vector?", answer: "A vector." },
    { question: "Is acceleration a scalar or a vector?", answer: "A vector." },
    { question: "For an object thrown straight up, what is its acceleration at the highest point?", answer: "It is still constant at $$-9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$$ (downward)." },
    { question: "What happens to the acceleration of a falling object as it approaches terminal velocity?", answer: "Its acceleration decreases to zero." },
    { question: "How does the time it takes for a projectile to reach its max height compare to the time it takes to fall back down from that height?", answer: "The times are equal, assuming the launch and landing heights are the same." },
    { question: "For a projectile launched horizontally, how does its horizontal velocity change?", answer: "It remains constant (in the absence of air resistance)." },
    { question: "What is the primary difference between kinematics and dynamics?", answer: "Kinematics describes motion, while dynamics explains the causes of motion (forces)." },
    { question: "What does a horizontal line at zero on an acceleration-time graph mean?", answer: "Constant velocity." },
    { question: "If a position-time graph is a straight line, what can you say about the object's acceleration?", answer: "Its acceleration is zero." },
    { question: "What are the standard SI units for displacement?", answer: "Meters (m)." },
    { question: "What are the standard SI units for velocity?", answer: "Meters per second (m/s)." },
    { question: "What are the standard SI units for acceleration?", answer: "Meters per second squared ($$m/s^2$$)." },
    { question: "An object is thrown straight up. What is the direction of its velocity on the way up?", answer: "Upward (positive)." },
    { question: "What is the direction of an object's velocity on the way down?", answer: "Downward (negative)." },
    { question: "What does a non-zero, horizontal line on a velocity-time graph indicate?", answer: "Constant, non-zero velocity." }
