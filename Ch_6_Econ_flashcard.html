  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **perfect competition**?", answer: "A market structure with many sellers, identical products, easy entry and exit, and no single firm having control over price." },
    { question: "What is a **monopoly**?", answer: "A market structure where there is a single seller of a product with no close substitutes, and high barriers to entry." },
    { question: "What is **monopolistic competition**?", answer: "A market structure with many sellers, but each offers a slightly differentiated product, and there is easy entry and exit." },
    { question: "What is an **oligopoly**?", answer: "A market structure with a few large firms that dominate the market, often with high barriers to entry and a focus on strategic interaction." },
    { question: "In which market structure are firms considered **price takers**?", answer: "Perfect competition, because they have to accept the market price set by the forces of supply and demand." },
    { question: "How is price determined in a perfectly competitive market?", answer: "The market price is determined by the intersection of market supply and demand curves. Individual firms sell at this price." },
    { question: "How does a monopolist determine its price and output?", answer: "A monopolist maximizes profit by producing where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC), and then sets the price according to the demand curve at that output level." },
    { question: "What is the key characteristic of products in monopolistic competition?", answer: "Product differentiation, which gives firms some control over their prices." },
    { question: "What is a major barrier to entry in an oligopoly?", answer: "High capital requirements, economies of scale, patents, or control of essential resources." },
    { question: "What is **long-run equilibrium** for a perfectly competitive firm?", answer: "A state where the firm earns zero economic profit, as new firms have entered the market, driving down price to the minimum of the average total cost curve." },
    { question: "Can a monopolist earn economic profits in the long run?", answer: "Yes, because high barriers to entry prevent new firms from entering the market to compete away profits." },
    { question: "How does monopolistic competition differ from a monopoly?", answer: "In monopolistic competition, there are many firms and easy entry/exit, while a monopoly has only one firm and high barriers to entry." },
    { question: "What is a **cartel**?", answer: "A formal agreement among a group of oligopoly firms to coordinate their output and prices, often acting like a single monopoly." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between price and marginal revenue in a monopoly?", answer: "Price is always greater than marginal revenue because the monopolist must lower the price on all units sold to sell one more unit." },
    { question: "Why do firms in monopolistic competition spend money on advertising?", answer: "To highlight the unique features of their products and convince consumers that their product is superior to those of their competitors." },
    { question: "In a perfectly competitive market, what is the relationship between price, marginal revenue, and average revenue?", answer: "Price = Marginal Revenue (MR) = Average Revenue (AR)." },
    { question: "What is an example of an oligopoly?", answer: "The market for airlines, cell phone carriers, or soft drinks, where a few large companies dominate." },
    { question: "What is the primary goal of a firm, regardless of market structure?", answer: "To maximize profit." },
    { question: "What is a natural monopoly?", answer: "A type of monopoly that exists due to the high start-up costs or powerful economies of scale in a particular industry, making it efficient for a single firm to serve the entire market." },
    { question: "How does a firm in monopolistic competition determine its price and output in the short run?", answer: "Similar to a monopoly, it produces where marginal revenue equals marginal cost and then sets the price on the demand curve." }
