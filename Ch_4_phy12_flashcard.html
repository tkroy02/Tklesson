    { question: "What is **Coulomb's Law**?", answer: "The force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the magnitude of the electrostatic force?", answer: "$$F = k\\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the value of **Coulomb's constant** ($$k$$)?", answer: "$$8.99 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{C}^2$$" },
    { question: "What is an **electric field**?", answer: "A region of space where a charged object would experience an electric force." },

    { question: "What is the formula for the electric field from a point charge?", answer: "$$E = k\\frac{|q|}{r^2}$$" },
    { question: "How are electric field lines drawn around a positive charge?", answer: "They point radially outward from the charge." },
    { question: "How are electric field lines drawn around a negative charge?", answer: "They point radially inward towards the charge." },
    { question: "How does the density of electric field lines indicate field strength?", answer: "A higher density of lines indicates a stronger electric field." },
    { question: "What is **electric potential energy**?", answer: "The energy a charge possesses due to its position in an electric field." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the electric potential energy of two point charges?", answer: "$$U = k\\frac{q_1q_2}{r}$$" },
    { question: "What is **electric potential** (or **voltage**)?", answer: "Electric potential energy per unit charge, representing the potential for a charge to do work at a given location." },
    { question: "What is the formula for electric potential from a point charge?", answer: "$$V = k\\frac{q}{r}$$" },
    { question: "What is **potential difference**?", answer: "The change in electric potential between two points, also known as voltage ($$\\Delta V$$)." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between electric potential and electric field?", answer: "The electric field is the negative gradient of the electric potential ($$\\vec{E} = -\\nabla V$$)." },
    { question: "What is an **equipotential line**?", answer: "A line or surface where the electric potential is constant. No work is done moving a charge along an equipotential line." },
    { question: "How do equipotential lines relate to electric field lines?", answer: "They are always perpendicular to each other." },
    { question: "What is the electric field inside a charged conductor in electrostatic equilibrium?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "Where does all the excess charge reside on a conductor?", answer: "On its outer surface." },
    { question: "What is the electric potential on the surface of a charged conductor?", answer: "It is constant and equal to the potential at all points inside the conductor." },
    { question: "What is a **dielectric**?", answer: "An insulating material that becomes polarized in the presence of an electric field, reducing the field's strength." },
    { question: "What is the **Principle of Superposition** for electric forces?", answer: "The net force on a charge is the vector sum of all individual forces exerted by other charges." },
    { question: "What is the **Principle of Superposition** for electric fields?", answer: "The net electric field at a point is the vector sum of the electric fields from all individual charges." },
    { question: "How does the electrostatic force between two charges change if the distance between them is tripled?", answer: "The force decreases to one-ninth of its original value." },
    { question: "How does the electric potential from a point charge change if the distance from the charge is doubled?", answer: "The potential is halved." },

    { question: "What is the formula for the work done by an electric field on a charge?", answer: "$$W = -\\Delta U = -q\\Delta V$$" },
    { question: "What is the **electron-volt** (eV)?", answer: "A unit of energy equal to the work done on an electron when it is moved through a potential difference of 1 volt." },
    { question: "Why is the electric field always perpendicular to the surface of a charged conductor?", answer: "If it had a parallel component, it would cause charges to move on the surface, which contradicts the state of electrostatic equilibrium." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **conductor** and an **insulator**?", answer: "Conductors allow charges to move freely, while insulators restrict charge movement." },
    { question: "In a uniform electric field, how does the potential difference relate to the field strength?", answer: "$$\\Delta V = -E\\Delta d$$ where $$\\Delta d$$ is the displacement in the direction of the field." },
    { question: "How can you tell the direction of an electric field by looking at equipotential lines?", answer: "The electric field points from higher potential to lower potential, and is perpendicular to the equipotential lines." },
    { question: "What is the magnitude of the force a proton would experience in an electric field of 500 N/C?", answer: "The force is the product of the field strength and the elementary charge ($$F = Eq$$)." },
    { question: "What is the value of an elementary charge ($$e$$)?", answer: "$$1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$$" },
    { question: "What is the total charge of an object that has 5 excess electrons?", answer: "The total charge is $$5 \\times (-e)$$." },
    { question: "How does the electrostatic force between two charges compare to the gravitational force between them?", answer: "The electrostatic force is significantly stronger than the gravitational force." }
