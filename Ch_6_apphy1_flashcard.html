  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)**?", answer: "A type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to the displacement." },
    { question: "What is **Hooke's Law**?", answer: "The restoring force of an ideal spring is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium: $$F_s = -kx$$" },
    { question: "In Hooke's Law, what does the variable $$k$$ represent?", answer: "The **spring constant**, which is a measure of the stiffness of the spring." },
    { question: "What is **amplitude**?", answer: "The maximum displacement or distance moved by a point on a vibrating body or wave from its equilibrium position." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the **period** ($$T$$) of a mass-spring system?", answer: "$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the **frequency** ($$f$$) of a mass-spring system?", answer: "$$f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$$" },
    { question: "What is the relationship between period ($$T$$) and frequency ($$f$$)?", answer: "$$f = \\frac{1}{T}$$" },
    { question: "If the mass attached to a spring is quadrupled, what happens to the period of oscillation?", answer: "It doubles, because $$T \\propto \\sqrt{m}$$." },
    { question: "If the spring constant is quadrupled, what happens to the period?", answer: "It is halved, because $$T \\propto 1/\\sqrt{k}$$." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the elastic potential energy stored in a spring?", answer: "$$U_s = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$" },
    { question: "How does the total mechanical energy change in an ideal mass-spring system?", answer: "It remains constant, as energy is continuously converted between kinetic energy and elastic potential energy." },
    { question: "At what point in its oscillation is the speed of an object in SHM at a maximum?", answer: "At the equilibrium position." },
    { question: "At what point in its oscillation is the acceleration of an object in SHM at a maximum?", answer: "At the maximum displacement (amplitude)." },
    { question: "At what point in its oscillation is the kinetic energy of an object in SHM at a maximum?", answer: "At the equilibrium position." },
    { question: "At what point in its oscillation is the potential energy of an object in SHM at a maximum?", answer: "At the maximum displacement (amplitude)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the **period** ($$T$$) of a simple pendulum?", answer: "$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the **frequency** ($$f$$) of a simple pendulum?", answer: "$$f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}$$" },
    { question: "For what condition does a pendulum approximate SHM?", answer: "For small angles of displacement (generally less than 15 degrees)." },
    { question: "What happens to the period of a pendulum if its length is quadrupled?", answer: "It doubles, because $$T \\propto \\sqrt{L}$$." },
    { question: "What happens to the period of a pendulum if the mass of the bob is doubled?", answer: "Nothing; the period is independent of the mass." },
    { question: "If a pendulum is moved from Earth to the moon, what happens to its period?", answer: "It increases, because the acceleration due to gravity ($$g$$) is smaller on the moon." },
    { question: "What does the slope of a position-time graph for SHM represent?", answer: "The instantaneous velocity." },
    { question: "What does the slope of a velocity-time graph for SHM represent?", answer: "The instantaneous acceleration." },
    { question: "What does a position-time graph of SHM look like?", answer: "A sinusoidal curve (either a sine or cosine wave)." },
    { question: "Where is the acceleration vector for an object in SHM always pointing?", answer: "Towards the equilibrium position." },
    { question: "Where is the velocity vector for an object in SHM always pointing?", answer: "Tangent to the path of the motion." },
    { question: "Does the amplitude of oscillation affect the period of a mass-spring system?", answer: "No, the period is independent of amplitude for an ideal SHM system." },
    { question: "Does the amplitude of oscillation affect the period of a simple pendulum?", answer: "Yes, for large amplitudes, the period increases slightly, but it is considered independent for small angles." },
    { question: "What provides the restoring force for a pendulum?", answer: "A component of the gravitational force." },
    { question: "What provides the restoring force for a mass-spring system?", answer: "The spring force." },
    { question: "If the spring is compressed from equilibrium, what is the direction of the spring force?", answer: "The spring force is in the positive direction (away from the equilibrium position)." },
    { question: "If a pendulum is at its highest point, what is the magnitude of its velocity and acceleration?", answer: "Velocity is zero, and acceleration is at its maximum magnitude." },
    { question: "How does a pendulum's energy change as it swings from its highest point to its lowest point?", answer: "Potential energy is converted into kinetic energy." },
    { question: "How does a spring's energy change as a mass moves from maximum compression to the equilibrium position?", answer: "Elastic potential energy is converted into kinetic energy." },
    { question: "What is the total mechanical energy in a mass-spring system at any point?", answer: "The sum of the kinetic energy and the elastic potential energy ($$E = K + U_s$$)." },
    { question: "What is the total mechanical energy in a pendulum system at any point?", answer: "The sum of the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy ($$E = K + U_g$$)." },
    { question: "Does a spring-mass system's period change on the moon?", answer: "No, because the period formula ($$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k}$$) does not depend on $$g$$." },
    { question: "What does the slope of a force-displacement graph for a spring represent?", answer: "The spring constant, $$k$$." },
    { question: "What does the area under a force-displacement graph for a spring represent?", answer: "The work done on the spring, which is equal to the elastic potential energy stored in the spring." },
    { question: "Is the acceleration in SHM constant?", answer: "No, acceleration is constantly changing, being a maximum at the amplitude and zero at equilibrium." }
