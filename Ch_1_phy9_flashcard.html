  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **physics**?", answer: "The study of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature." },
    { question: "What is the correct sequence of the scientific method?", answer: "Observation, hypothesis, experiment, analysis, and conclusion." },
    { question: "What is a **hypothesis**?", answer: "A testable explanation or educated guess based on observations." },
    { question: "What is a **scientific theory**?", answer: "A broad, well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, supported by a large body of evidence." },
    { question: "What is a **scientific law**?", answer: "A concise statement or mathematical equation that describes a natural phenomenon under specific conditions." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a theory and a law?", answer: "A theory explains *why* something happens, while a law describes *what* happens." },
    { question: "What is an **independent variable**?", answer: "The variable that is changed or manipulated by the experimenter." },
    { question: "What is a **dependent variable**?", answer: "The variable that is measured or observed as a result of the changes to the independent variable." },
    { question: "What is a **control variable** (or constant)?", answer: "A variable that is kept the same throughout the experiment to ensure a fair test." },
    { question: "What is **qualitative data**?", answer: "Descriptive data that uses words to describe observations (e.g., color, texture, sound)." },
    { question: "What is **quantitative data**?", answer: "Numerical data that uses numbers and units to describe observations (e.g., length, mass, temperature)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **length**?", answer: "The meter (m)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **mass**?", answer: "The kilogram (kg)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **time**?", answer: "The second (s)." },
    { question: "What does the prefix **kilo-** mean?", answer: "One thousand ($10^3$)." },
    { question: "What does the prefix **centi-** mean?", answer: "One-hundredth ($10^{-2}$)." },
    { question: "What does the prefix **milli-** mean?", answer: "One-thousandth ($10^{-3}$)." },
    { question: "Convert 500 grams to kilograms.", answer: "0.5 kilograms (kg)." },
    { question: "Convert 2 meters to centimeters.", answer: "200 centimeters (cm)." },
    { question: "Convert 3000 milliseconds to seconds.", answer: "3 seconds (s)." },
    { question: "What is **accuracy** in measurement?", answer: "How close a measurement is to the true or accepted value." },
    { question: "What is **precision** in measurement?", answer: "How close a series of measurements are to one another." },
    { question: "What is the main purpose of an experiment?", answer: "To test a hypothesis under controlled conditions." },
    { question: "Why is it important to use a **control group** in an experiment?", answer: "To provide a baseline for comparison and to isolate the effect of the independent variable." },
    { question: "How do you calculate the average of a set of measurements?", answer: "Add all the measurements together and divide by the number of measurements." },
    { question: "What is **matter** in physics?", answer: "Anything that has mass and takes up space." },
    { question: "What is **energy**?", answer: "The ability to do work or cause change." },
    { question: "Why do scientists use the SI system?", answer: "To provide a standard, universal system of measurement for clear communication and consistency." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **temperature**?", answer: "The kelvin (K)." },
    { question: "What is a **derived unit**?", answer: "A unit that is a combination of two or more base units (e.g., speed in m/s, or force in kg·m/s²)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a constant and a variable?", answer: "A constant is a factor that remains unchanged; a variable is a factor that can change." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of peer review in science?", answer: "To have other scientists evaluate a study for accuracy, validity, and reliability before it is published." },
    { question: "What is a **model** in physics?", answer: "A simplified representation of a complex system or phenomenon used to explain or predict its behavior." },
    { question: "What is the importance of a well-designed experiment?", answer: "It ensures that the results are valid and reliable and that the conclusion can be trusted." },
    { question: "If you want to measure the force of an object, what SI unit would you use?", answer: "The Newton (N)." },
    { question: "What is the scientific attitude?", answer: "A mindset that involves curiosity, skepticism, objectivity, and a willingness to change your ideas based on evidence." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a direct observation and an inference?", answer: "An observation is what you directly perceive with your senses; an inference is a conclusion or guess based on that observation." },
    { question: "What does the prefix **nano-** mean?", answer: "One billionth ($10^{-9}$)." },
    { question: "What is the main difference between physics and chemistry?", answer: "Physics focuses on matter and energy at the fundamental level, while chemistry focuses on the composition and reactions of matter." },
    { question: "What is the final step of the scientific method?", answer: "Forming a conclusion that states whether the hypothesis was supported or rejected by the data." }
