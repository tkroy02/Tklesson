    { question: "What is **Kirchhoff's Current Law** (Junction Rule)?", answer: "The sum of all currents entering a junction equals the sum of all currents leaving that junction." },
    { question: "What is **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law** (Loop Rule)?", answer: "The sum of all voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to the total voltage of the sources in that loop." },
    { question: "What happens to the brightness of light bulbs in a series circuit if one bulb is removed?", answer: "All the other bulbs will go out because the circuit is broken." },
    { question: "What happens to the brightness of light bulbs in a parallel circuit if one bulb is removed?", answer: "The other bulbs remain lit and their brightness does not change." },
    { question: "Why do household appliances use parallel circuits?", answer: "So each appliance can be operated independently and receives the full voltage from the power source." },
    { question: "What is an **ohmmeter** used to measure?", answer: "Resistance." },
    { question: "What is a **diode**?", answer: "A semiconductor device that allows current to flow in only one direction." },
