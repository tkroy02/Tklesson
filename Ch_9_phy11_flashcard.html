    { question: "What is the SI unit of resistance?", answer: "The Ohm ($$\\Omega$$)." },
    { question: "What is a **series circuit**?", answer: "A circuit where components are connected end-to-end, so there is only one path for the current to flow." },
    { question: "In a series circuit, what is constant?", answer: "The current is the same at all points." },
    { question: "What is a **parallel circuit**?", answer: "A circuit where components are connected across the same two points, creating multiple paths for the current." },
    { question: "In a parallel circuit, what is constant?", answer: "The voltage is the same across all components." },
    { question: "What is **electric power**?", answer: "The rate at which electric energy is consumed or generated." },
