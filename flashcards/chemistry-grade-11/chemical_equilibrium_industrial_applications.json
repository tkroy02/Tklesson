          "front": "What is the **equilibrium constant ($K_c$)**?",
          "back": "The ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients: $K_c = \\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$ for $aA + bB \\rightleftharpoons cC + dD$"

          "front": "What does a **small $K$ value** indicate?",
          "back": "Reactants are favored at equilibrium; the reaction does not proceed significantly."

          "front": "What is the **reaction quotient ($Q$)**?",
          "back": "A ratio with the same form as $K$, but calculated using non-equilibrium concentrations: $Q = \\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$"

        {
          "front": "How do you use **$Q$ to predict reaction direction**?",
          "back": "If $Q < K$, the reaction proceeds forward (toward products). If $Q > K$, the reaction proceeds reverse (toward reactants). If $Q = K$, the system is at equilibrium."

          "front": "What is **Le Chatelier's Principle**?",

          "front": "How does **increasing pressure** affect a gas-phase equilibrium?",
          "back": "The equilibrium shifts toward the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce pressure."

          "front": "How does **temperature change** affect equilibrium?",
          "back": "For an exothermic reaction, increasing temperature shifts equilibrium toward reactants (left). For an endothermic reaction, increasing temperature shifts equilibrium toward products (right)."

          "front": "How does a **catalyst** affect equilibrium?",
          "back": "A catalyst does not change the position of equilibrium or the value of $K$; it only increases the rate at which equilibrium is reached."

        {
          "front": "Why is **high pressure** used in the Haber process?",

          "front": "Why is **moderate temperature (400-500°C)** used in the Haber process despite the reaction being exothermic?",
          "back": "To balance equilibrium position (favored by low temperature) with reaction rate (favored by high temperature); a catalyst helps increase the rate at moderate temperatures."

          "front": "What is the **Contact process**?",
          "back": "An industrial process for producing sulfuric acid, involving the oxidation of $SO_2$ to $SO_3$: $2SO_2(g) + O_2(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2SO_3(g)$ using a vanadium(V) oxide catalyst."
