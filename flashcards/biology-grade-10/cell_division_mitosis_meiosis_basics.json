          "front": "What is the main goal of **Mitosis**?",
          "back": "To produce two identical daughter cells for growth and tissue repair."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the main goal of **Meiosis**?",
          "back": "To produce four genetically different haploid gametes (sperm and egg cells) for sexual reproduction."
        },
        {
          "front": "Define **Haploid (n)** vs. **Diploid (2n)**.",
          "back": "Diploid cells have two full sets of chromosomes (46 in humans); Haploid cells have only one set (23 in humans)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are **Homologous Chromosomes**?",
          "back": "Pairs of chromosomes (one from each parent) that are the same size and contain the same types of genes."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **Crossing Over** and when does it occur?",
          "back": "The exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during Prophase I of Meiosis; it creates genetic variation."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **Independent Assortment**?",
          "back": "The random way homologous pairs line up during Metaphase I, ensuring that offspring have a unique mix of maternal and paternal genes."
        },
        {
          "front": "How many divisions occur in Mitosis vs. Meiosis?",
          "back": "Mitosis has one division (PMAT); Meiosis has two successive divisions (PMAT I and PMAT II)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are **Somatic Cells**?",
          "back": "Body cells (like skin or muscle cells) that are diploid and produced through mitosis."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **Zygote**?",
          "back": "The diploid cell formed when a haploid sperm cell fertilizes a haploid egg cell."
        },
        {
          "front": "What happens during **Anaphase I** of Meiosis?",
          "back": "Homologous pairs are pulled apart toward opposite poles (unlike Mitosis, where sister chromatids are pulled apart)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **Nondisjunction**?",
          "back": "An error in Meiosis where chromosomes fail to separate properly, resulting in gametes with too many or too few chromosomes."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are **Sister Chromatids**?",
          "back": "Two identical copies of a single replicated chromosome that are joined together at the centromere."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why is **genetic variation** important for a species?",
          "back": "It increases the chances that some individuals will survive if the environment changes, preventing extinction."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the 'reduction division'?",
          "back": "Another name for Meiosis I, because it reduces the chromosome number from diploid to haploid."
        },
        {
          "front": "Does DNA replication happen between Meiosis I and Meiosis II?",
          "back": "No. DNA is only replicated once (during Interphase) before the whole process begins."
