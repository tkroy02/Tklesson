        {
          "front": "Who is considered the **Father of Genetics** and what organism did he study?",
          "back": "Gregor Mendel. He studied inheritance patterns in pea plants."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **Gene**?",
          "back": "A segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or trait."

          "back": "A **dominant** allele masks the expression of a **recessive** allele when both are present. Dominant traits are expressed with one copy; recessive traits require two copies."

          "back": "During gamete formation, the two alleles for a trait separate (segregate) so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene."

        {
          "front": "What is **Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment**?",
          "back": "Genes for different traits are inherited independently of each other (applies to genes on different chromosomes)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **Punnett Square** and what is it used for?",
          "back": "A diagram used to predict the probability of different genotypes and phenotypes in offspring from a genetic cross."

          "back": "Crossing an individual with an unknown genotype (but dominant phenotype) with a homozygous recessive individual to determine the unknown genotype."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **Incomplete Dominance**?",
          "back": "When neither allele is completely dominant, resulting in a blended intermediate phenotype (e.g., red flower × white flower = pink flower)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **Codominance**?",
          "back": "When both alleles are fully expressed in the heterozygote (e.g., AB blood type, roan coat color in cattle)."

          "back": "Traits controlled by two or more genes, resulting in a range of phenotypes (e.g., human height, skin color)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are **Sex-linked Traits**?",
          "back": "Traits controlled by genes located on the sex chromosomes (usually the X chromosome)."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why are **sex-linked disorders** (like colorblindness or hemophilia) more common in males?",
          "back": "Males have only one X chromosome, so a single recessive allele on that X will express the disorder. Females have two X chromosomes and need two copies to express it."
