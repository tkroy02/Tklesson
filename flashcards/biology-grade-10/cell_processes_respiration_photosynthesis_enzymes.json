          "front": "Where does **Aerobic Respiration** occur in the cell?",
          "back": "It begins in the cytoplasm but most of the process occurs in the Mitochondria."

        {
          "front": "What is the difference between **Aerobic** and **Anaerobic** respiration?",
          "back": "Aerobic requires oxygen and produces a lot of ATP; Anaerobic (fermentation) occurs without oxygen and produces very little ATP."

        {
          "front": "What are the two products of **Fermentation**?",
          "back": "Lactic acid (in animals/muscles) or Ethanol and CO2 (in yeast/plants)."

        {
          "front": "How are the equations for Photosynthesis and Respiration related?",
          "back": "They are opposites: the products of one are the reactants of the other."

        {
          "front": "What is **Activation Energy**?",
          "back": "The minimum amount of energy required to start a chemical reaction."

        {
          "front": "How do **Enzymes** affect activation energy?",
          "back": "They lower the activation energy, allowing reactions to happen much faster at body temperature."

        {
          "front": "What is a **Substrate**?",
          "back": "The specific reactant molecule that an enzyme acts upon."

        {
          "front": "What is the **Active Site** of an enzyme?",
          "back": "The specific region on the enzyme where the substrate binds and the chemical reaction occurs."

        {
          "front": "How do **Temperature** and **pH** affect enzyme activity?",
          "back": "Each enzyme has an 'optimal' range; extreme changes can cause the enzyme to denature (lose its shape and stop working)."

        {
          "front": "What is an **Enzyme-Substrate Complex**?",
          "back": "The temporary intermediate structure formed when an enzyme binds to its substrate."

        {
          "front": "What is **Chlorophyll** and what is its role?",
          "back": "A green pigment in chloroplasts that absorbs light energy (specifically red and blue wavelengths) for photosynthesis."

        {
          "front": "Why is Cellular Respiration considered an **Exergonic** reaction?",
          "back": "Because it releases energy (ATP) by breaking down complex glucose molecules."
