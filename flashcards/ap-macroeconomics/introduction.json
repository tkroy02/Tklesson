          "front": "What is **scarcity** in economics?",
          "back": "The fundamental economic problem: unlimited human wants exceed the limited resources available to satisfy them. Scarcity requires choices to be made."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **choice** in the context of scarcity?",
          "back": "Because resources are scarce, individuals, firms, and governments must choose among alternatives—what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the **three basic economic questions** every society must answer due to scarcity?",
          "back": "1. **What** goods and services will be produced?\n2. **How** will they be produced?\n3. **For whom** will they be produced?"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **opportunity cost**?",
          "back": "The value of the next best alternative that is given up when a choice is made. It is the real cost of any decision."
        },
        {
          "front": "Give an example of **opportunity cost** in a personal decision.",
          "back": "If you choose to spend an hour studying economics instead of working a $15/hour job, the opportunity cost is the $15 you could have earned."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **trade-off**?",
          "back": "A situation in which achieving one desirable goal requires giving up another desirable goal. All choices involve trade-offs."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **cost-benefit analysis**?",
          "back": "A decision-making process that compares the additional benefits of an action to its additional costs. A rational choice is made when marginal benefit ≥ marginal cost."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **marginal analysis**?",
          "back": "Examining the additional (marginal) benefits and costs of a decision. Rational decision-makers continue an activity until marginal benefit equals marginal cost (MB = MC)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)**?",
          "back": "A graph that shows the maximum combination of two goods an economy can produce with its available resources and technology, assuming full and efficient resource use."
        },

          "front": "What do points **on**, **inside**, and **outside** the PPF represent?",
          "back": "**On the curve**: Efficient production (resources fully employed). **Inside the curve**: Inefficient/underemployment. **Outside the curve**: Unattainable with current resources."
        },
        {
          "front": "What does the **slope of the PPF** represent?",
          "back": "The **opportunity cost** of producing one more unit of the good on the x-axis in terms of the good on the y-axis. A steeper slope means higher opportunity cost."
        },
        {
          "front": "What causes a **PPF to shift outward** (economic growth)?",
          "back": "1. **Increase in resources** (more labor, capital, land).\n2. **Technological advancement**.\n3. **Improved institutions** (better laws, property rights)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **straight-line PPF** vs. a **bowed-out (concave) PPF**?",
          "back": "**Straight-line**: Constant opportunity cost (resources perfectly adaptable). **Bowed-out**: Increasing opportunity cost (resources are not perfectly adaptable)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What does **comparative advantage** mean?",
          "back": "The ability to produce a good or service at a **lower opportunity cost** than another producer. It is the basis for mutually beneficial trade."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **absolute advantage**?",
          "back": "The ability to produce more of a good with the same resources (or the same amount with fewer resources) than another producer."
        },
        {
          "front": "Who should specialize and trade according to comparative advantage?",
          "back": "Each producer should specialize in the good for which they have the **lower opportunity cost** (comparative advantage), then trade."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do you **calculate opportunity cost** from a production table?",
          "back": "For Good X: Opportunity cost of 1 X = (Loss in Y production) / (Gain in X production). This ratio gives how many Y must be given up to produce one more X."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the **gains from trade**?",
          "back": "The increase in total output and consumption that results from specialization according to comparative advantage and voluntary exchange."

        {
          "front": "What determines the **terms of trade**?",
          "back": "The rate at which one good is traded for another. It must lie between the opportunity costs of the two traders for trade to be mutually beneficial."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **market economy (capitalism)**?",
          "back": "An economic system where decisions about production and consumption are made by individuals and firms interacting in markets, with minimal government intervention."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **command economy (centrally planned)**?",
          "back": "An economic system where the government makes all major decisions about production and distribution (e.g., former Soviet Union)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **mixed economy**?",
          "back": "An economy that combines elements of market and command systems. Most modern economies (like the U.S.) are mixed."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the **five fundamental economic goals** societies pursue?",
          "back": "1. **Economic efficiency** (no waste)\n2. **Economic equity** (fairness)\n3. **Economic freedom** (choice)\n4. **Economic growth** (increased output)\n5. **Economic security** (safety nets)"
        },
        {
          "front": "How do **property rights** influence economic behavior?",
          "back": "Well-defined and enforced property rights encourage investment, innovation, and maintenance of resources, leading to greater economic efficiency and growth."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **role of incentives** in a market economy?",
          "back": "Prices and profits act as incentives that guide producers and consumers. Positive incentives encourage actions; negative incentives discourage them."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **consumer sovereignty**?",
          "back": "The idea that consumers' wants and preferences, expressed through their spending, ultimately determine what is produced in a market economy."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **invisible hand** concept (Adam Smith)?",
          "back": "The idea that individuals pursuing their own self-interest in a market economy are led, as if by an invisible hand, to promote the social good."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **specialization** and how does it increase productivity?",
          "back": "Focusing efforts on a specific task or product. It increases productivity through:\n1. **Developing expertise**\n2. **Saving time** (no switching tasks)\n3. **Using specialized tools**"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **division of labor**?",
          "back": "Breaking down production into a series of specific tasks performed by different workers. A form of specialization that increases efficiency."
        },
        {
          "front": "How can **international trade** be shown using a PPF?",
          "back": "Trade allows a country to consume at a point **outside its PPF**. By specializing and trading, a country can consume more than it could produce alone."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **economic efficiency**?",
          "back": "Getting the maximum output from available resources (productive efficiency) and producing the mix of goods most desired by society (allocative efficiency)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **productive efficiency**?",
          "back": "Producing at the lowest possible cost (any point on the PPF)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **allocative efficiency**?",
          "back": "Producing the specific mix of goods and services that society most desires (where marginal benefit = marginal cost)."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why does **voluntary exchange** create wealth?",
          "back": "Both parties expect to gain from a voluntary trade; otherwise, they wouldn't agree to it. Trade moves goods to those who value them more, increasing total satisfaction."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **law of increasing opportunity cost**?",
          "back": "As production of one good increases, the opportunity cost of producing additional units of that good typically increases because resources are not perfectly adaptable."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does a **natural disaster** affect the PPF?",
          "back": "It would likely shift the PPF **inward** (at least temporarily) by destroying resources (capital, land) or disrupting technology, reducing productive capacity."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **human capital** and how does it affect the PPF?",
          "back": "The skills, knowledge, and experience of workers. Investment in human capital (education, training) increases productivity and shifts the PPF outward over time."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the difference between **capital goods** and **consumer goods**?",
          "back": "**Capital goods**: Used to produce other goods (machines, factories). **Consumer goods**: Final products for immediate satisfaction. More capital goods today → greater economic growth (PPF shift) tomorrow."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **traditional economy**?",
          "back": "An economic system where decisions are based on customs, traditions, and beliefs passed down through generations (e.g., some indigenous communities)."
