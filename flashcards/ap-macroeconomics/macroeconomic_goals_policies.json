          "front": "What happens in AD-AS if **expansionary fiscal policy** is used during a recession?",
          "back": "AD shifts right → price level ↑, real GDP ↑ → moves toward potential GDP, reduces unemployment. In long run, self-correction may occur if output exceeds potential."

          "front": "What happens in AD-AS if **contractionary monetary policy** is used during inflation?",
          "back": "AD shifts left → price level ↓, real GDP ↓ → moves toward potential GDP, reduces inflation. May cause recession if overdone."

          "back": "Policies aimed at increasing productive capacity (LRAS) by:\n1. **Tax incentives** for investment\n2. **Deregulation**\n3. **Investment in human capital**\n4. **Infrastructure spending**"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **balanced budget multiplier**?",
          "back": "When government spending increases matched by equal tax increase (balanced budget), still has expansionary effect because spending has direct AD impact while taxes reduce spending only partially."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **quantitative easing (QE)**?",
          "back": "Unconventional monetary policy where central bank buys long-term securities to inject money into economy when conventional policy (lowering interest rates) is ineffective (near zero)."

          "front": "What is the **difference between actual and potential GDP** in policy context?",
          "back": "**Actual GDP**: Current output. **Potential GDP**: Maximum sustainable output. **GDP gap** = Potential - Actual. Positive gap = recessionary gap; negative gap = inflationary gap."

          "front": "What is **inflation targeting**?",
          "back": "Monetary policy strategy where central bank announces explicit target inflation rate (e.g., 2%) and uses policy tools to achieve it."

        {
          "front": "What are **liquidity traps**?",
          "back": "Situation when interest rates are near zero and monetary policy becomes ineffective (people hoard cash rather than spend/invest). Requires unconventional policies like QE."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **political business cycle theory**?",
          "back": "Politicians might manipulate economy (expansionary policies before elections, contractionary after) to improve re-election chances, creating artificial business cycles."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do **automatic stabilizers** work in AD-AS during recession?",
          "back": "During recession: tax revenues automatically ↓ (progressive system), transfer payments automatically ↑ → helps stabilize AD, reducing severity of downturn without new legislation."

          "front": "What is the **Taylor Rule**?",
          "back": "Monetary policy guideline suggesting how central bank should adjust interest rates in response to changes in inflation and GDP gap: Interest rate = Neutral rate + (0.5 × Inflation gap) + (0.5 × Output gap)."
