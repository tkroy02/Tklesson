        {
          "front": "**Conceptual Understanding**: Explain why expansionary fiscal policy might be less effective during a recession if there's significant crowding out.",
          "back": "When the government borrows to finance deficit spending, it competes with private borrowers for limited loanable funds, driving up interest rates. Higher interest rates discourage private investment, partially offsetting the stimulative effect of government spending. This 'crowding out' is especially problematic when the economy is near full capacity, but can still occur in recessions if financial markets are tight."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Policy Trade-offs**: Describe the conflict between fighting inflation and maintaining employment in the short run.",
          "back": "The short-run Phillips Curve illustrates this trade-off: policies that reduce inflation (contractionary monetary/fiscal policy) typically increase unemployment temporarily, while policies that reduce unemployment (expansionary policy) risk increasing inflation. Policymakers must choose which problem to prioritize, knowing they can't solve both simultaneously in the short term."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Economic Systems**: Contrast how a market economy versus a command economy would respond to a shortage of a critical resource like oil.",
          "back": "In a **market economy**, rising oil prices would signal scarcity, encouraging conservation, substitution (alternative energy), and increased exploration. In a **command economy**, the government would ration oil, dictate conservation measures, and direct resources to alternatives. Markets use price signals; command economies use administrative orders."
        },
        {
          "front": "**International Linkages**: Explain how expansionary monetary policy in the United States affects other countries through exchange rates.",
          "back": "When the Fed lowers interest rates, the dollar tends to depreciate as investors seek higher returns elsewhere. A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper and imports more expensive. Trading partners may see their currencies appreciate, hurting their exports and potentially leading them to implement their own expansionary policies—a form of international policy transmission."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Long-run vs Short-run**: Why can't the economy sustainably produce beyond its potential GDP?",
          "back": "Potential GDP represents the economy's maximum sustainable output using all available resources efficiently. Attempting to produce beyond this (creating an inflationary gap) leads to overheating: labor shortages push up wages, raw material scarcity raises costs, and these higher production costs eventually force a return to potential output, but at higher price levels."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Institutional Foundations**: Why are property rights and rule of law essential for economic growth?",
          "back": "Secure property rights give people confidence to invest, innovate, and maintain resources. The rule of law ensures contracts are enforced and disputes resolved fairly. Without these, uncertainty discourages long-term investment, reduces specialization and trade, and leads to resources being used for protection rather than production—all hindering growth."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Behavioral Economics Integration**: How might 'animal spirits' (Keynes) or 'irrational exuberance' (Greenspan) challenge traditional economic models?",
          "back": "Traditional models assume rational actors responding systematically to incentives. Behavioral economics recognizes that psychological factors—overconfidence, herd mentality, loss aversion—can drive economic decisions. These can create asset bubbles, amplify business cycles, and make economies less predictable than pure rational models suggest."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Distributional Consequences**: Who typically benefits and loses from unexpected inflation, and why?",
          "back": "**Winners**: Debtors (repay loans with less valuable money), flexible-income workers (wages adjust), and owners of real assets (values keep pace). **Losers**: Credors (repaid with cheaper dollars), fixed-income retirees, and cash holders. Inflation redistributes wealth unpredictably, creating arbitrary winners and losers."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Historical Application**: What lessons from the Great Depression inform modern macroeconomic policy?",
          "back": "Key lessons: 1) Letting banks fail can trigger systemic collapse (hence FDIC). 2) Monetary tightening during downturn worsens depression (avoid premature rate hikes). 3) Fiscal austerity during recession deepens it (counter-cyclical spending needed). 4) International cooperation matters (protectionism worsens global downturns)."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Sustainability Debate**: How does the traditional GDP measure fail to account for environmental sustainability?",
          "back": "GDP counts economic activity without distinguishing between beneficial and harmful production. Polluting industries add to GDP while clean-up costs also add to GDP—creating perverse incentives. It ignores depletion of natural capital, degradation of ecosystems, and doesn't account for whether current consumption compromises future generations' well-being."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Crisis Response**: Compare the 2008 Financial Crisis response with potential future crisis management approaches.",
          "back": "2008 saw unconventional tools: bank bailouts (TARP), quantitative easing, near-zero rates. Future crises may require: digital currency tools, climate-risk banking regulations, international coordination for global shocks, and addressing inequality as a stability issue. The toolbox has expanded but political constraints remain."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Technological Disruption**: How might AI and automation challenge traditional macroeconomic policy tools?",
          "back": "Automation could: 1) Reduce effectiveness of traditional job creation policies, 2) Change the nature of structural unemployment, 3) Affect income distribution dramatically, 4) Challenge tax systems based on labor income, and 5) Potentially increase productivity but with disruptive transition periods requiring new policy approaches."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Globalization Dilemma**: Explain the tension between national policy autonomy and global economic integration.",
          "back": "Integrated economies face the 'trilemma': countries can't simultaneously have fixed exchange rates, free capital movement, and independent monetary policy. Choosing globalization (free capital flows) means sacrificing either exchange rate stability or policy autonomy. This limits nations' ability to tailor policies to domestic needs without causing international spillovers."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Political Economy**: Why might democratically elected governments struggle to implement optimal long-term economic policies?",
          "back": "Political cycles (2-4 years) conflict with economic cycles (longer). Politicians face incentives to: stimulate before elections (creating political business cycles), avoid short-term pain for long-term gain (deficit reduction, inflation fighting), and cater to vocal interest groups rather than overall economic efficiency."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Future of Work**: How might the changing nature of work (gig economy, remote work) challenge traditional economic measurement and policy?",
          "back": "Traditional measures struggle with: classifying gig workers (employed? self-employed?), measuring productivity in remote settings, capturing non-market work, and addressing social safety nets for non-traditional employment. Policies designed for 9-5 jobs with benefits may become increasingly inadequate."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Ethical Dimensions**: What are the ethical considerations in using contractionary policy to fight inflation when unemployment is already high?",
          "back": "This creates an ethical dilemma: fighting inflation helps savers and those on fixed incomes but hurts unemployed workers and debtors. Policymakers must weigh: intergenerational equity (inflation harms future planning), distributional effects (who bears the cost), and whether there are less painful alternatives (supply-side measures, targeted relief)."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Monetary Policy Evolution**: How has the Federal Reserve's approach changed from the Volcker era to today?",
          "back": "**Volcker (1970s-80s)**: Aggressive inflation fighting, accepted high unemployment as necessary cost. **Greenspan-Bernanke**: More balanced dual mandate, forward guidance, transparency. **Today**: Average inflation targeting, greater focus on employment, unconventional tools readiness. Evolution reflects lessons learned and changing economic consensus."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Inequality-Macro Link**: How might rising income inequality affect overall macroeconomic stability and growth?",
          "back": "High inequality can: 1) Reduce aggregate demand (rich save more), 2) Increase debt-driven consumption (poor borrow to maintain living standards), 3) Reduce social mobility and human capital development, 4) Create political instability affecting investment, and 5) Potentially slow long-term growth by underutilizing talent from lower-income groups."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Climate Macroeconomics**: How should macroeconomic policy account for climate change risks?",
          "back": "Central banks now consider: climate-related financial risks in banking supervision, 'green' quantitative easing, climate stress tests. Fiscal policy faces: carbon tax vs. spending dilemmas, just transition funding for affected workers, infrastructure investment for adaptation. Traditional growth models may need adjustment for sustainability constraints."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Digital Currency Implications**: How might central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) change monetary policy implementation?",
          "back": "CBDCs could: allow direct central bank accounts bypassing commercial banks (changing money transmission), enable programmable money (targeted stimulus), provide new monetary policy tools (negative rates more feasible), increase financial inclusion, but also risk bank disintermediation and privacy concerns."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Pandemic Economics**: What unique economic challenges did COVID-19 present that differed from traditional recessions?",
          "back": "Traditional recessions involve deficient demand; pandemic involved **supply shocks** (lockdowns) plus **demand shifts** (from services to goods). Policy response was unique: massive direct transfers (stimulus checks), support for idled workers (enhanced unemployment), business survival loans (PPP). Recovery was sectorally uneven and involved reallocation challenges."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Deglobalization Trends**: How might reshoring and supply chain nationalism affect inflation and growth?",
          "back": "Reshoring could: increase production costs (higher wages, regulations) → cost-push inflation, reduce efficiency gains from specialization → slower productivity growth, increase economic resilience but at higher cost, and potentially reshape global trade patterns with geopolitical implications."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Intergenerational Equity**: How do deficit spending and national debt create ethical questions across generations?",
          "back": "Current deficit spending transfers costs to future taxpayers. Justification depends on: whether funds finance consumption (burden) vs investment (benefit), whether economic growth outpaces debt costs, and intergenerational fairness. There's tension between stimulating current economy and burdening future generations—especially with aging populations."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Mental Models**: Contrast the Keynesian and Classical approaches to recession response.",
          "back": "**Keynesian**: Markets don't self-correct quickly; animal spirits matter; active government intervention needed (fiscal policy) to boost demand. **Classical**: Markets self-correct; wages/prices adjust; government intervention often worsens things; focus on long-run growth. Modern policy blends both but debates continue about timing and magnitude of intervention."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Financialization Critique**: How might excessive financial sector growth distort the real economy?",
          "back": "Critics argue financialization: diverts talent from productive sectors, encourages short-termism, increases systemic risk, can create asset bubbles disconnected from fundamentals, and may increase inequality (finance captures disproportionate profits). Defenders argue efficient financial markets are essential for capital allocation and risk management."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Optimal Currency Areas**: Why wasn't the Eurozone an optimal currency area initially, and what problems resulted?",
          "back": "The Eurozone lacked: labor mobility (language/cultural barriers), fiscal transfers (no EU-wide unemployment system), similar business cycles (Germany vs Greece). Result: asymmetric shocks hit countries differently, but one monetary policy couldn't fit all. The crisis revealed need for either more integration or more flexibility."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Post-Keynesian View**: How would a Post-Keynesian critique mainstream inflation fighting approaches?",
          "back": "Post-Keynesians argue: inflation often comes from conflict over income distribution (wage-price spiral), not excess demand. Fighting inflation with unemployment creates unnecessary suffering. Better approach: incomes policies, coordinated wage-price guidelines, addressing root distributional conflicts. They emphasize institutional and power dynamics over pure market mechanisms."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Development vs Environment**: Can developing countries achieve rapid growth while addressing environmental concerns?",
          "back": "Traditional path: grow now, clean later (environmental Kuznets curve). New view: must 'leapfrog' to clean technology, but this requires technology transfer, financing, and may slow initial growth. Equity issue: developed countries polluted during their growth; can they deny same to developing world? Tension between growth imperative and planetary boundaries."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Future of Central Banking**: What new challenges will central banks face in the coming decades?",
          "back": "Digital currency management, climate risk integration, inequality considerations, navigating fiscal dominance (high debt limits monetary independence), international policy coordination in multipolar world, managing transition risks from structural changes (automation, aging), and maintaining credibility amid political pressures."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Economic Paradigm Shifts**: How has economic thinking evolved from the Great Moderation to today's polycrisis world?",
          "back": "**Great Moderation** (1980s-2007): Belief in stable growth, efficient markets, inflation targeting sufficient. **Post-2008**: Recognition of financial instability, need for macroprudential regulation, limits of conventional policy. **Today**: Facing simultaneous challenges (climate, pandemic, geopolitical, inequality) requiring integrated, resilient approaches beyond traditional models."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Human Development Approach**: How does the capabilities approach (Sen) differ from GDP growth as development goal?",
          "back": "GDP measures output; capabilities approach asks: what can people do and be? Focuses on health, education, political freedom, social connections. Economic growth is means, not end. Policies should expand human capabilities. This shifts focus from production metrics to well-being and opportunity metrics."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Circular Economy**: How might circular economy principles challenge traditional growth models?",
          "back": "Traditional linear economy: take-make-dispose, assumes infinite resources. Circular economy: reduce-reuse-recycle, designs out waste. Challenges: may reduce measured GDP (fewer sales of new goods), requires different business models, needs policy support, but offers sustainability. Questions whether GDP growth is compatible with resource constraints."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Geopolitical Economics**: How does great power competition affect global economic stability and policy?",
          "back": "Fragmentation of global system into blocs reduces efficiency gains from trade, increases costs (duplicate supply chains), creates currency competition (de-dollarization attempts), leads to economic statecraft (sanctions), and complicates policy coordination on global issues (climate, pandemic). May increase volatility and reduce growth potential."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Philosophical Foundations**: What different views of human nature underlie different economic schools?",
          "back": "**Classical/Neoclassical**: Rational, self-interested, utility-maximizing individuals. **Keynesian**: Sometimes irrational, influenced by animal spirits, need guidance. **Behavioral**: Boundedly rational, influenced by biases. **Institutional**: Shaped by social structures and norms. These assumptions drive different policy prescriptions."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Resilience Economics**: How should we rethink economic policy for a world of more frequent shocks?",
          "back": "Move from efficiency optimization to resilience building: redundancy over leanness (strategic reserves), diversity over specialization, adaptive capacity over static optimization, precautionary principle over risk-taking. This may mean accepting slightly lower growth in normal times for better shock absorption—a fundamental trade-off."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Digital Platform Power**: How do tech platforms challenge traditional antitrust and macroeconomic thinking?",
          "back": "Network effects create natural monopolies, data as new economic resource, blur lines between sectors, challenge traditional productivity measurement, create new forms of market power. Macro implications: concentration may affect innovation, income distribution, and traditional monetary transmission (platforms' pricing power)."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Well-being Economics**: What would a well-being focused macroeconomic framework look like?",
          "back": "Beyond GDP dashboard: include health, education, environmental quality, social connections, leisure time, security, political voice. Policies evaluated by well-being impact, not just growth. May prioritize different investments (mental health, community, environment) and consider distribution more centrally. Several countries now use well-being budgets."
        },
        {
          "front": "**Final Synthesis**: What are the three most important conceptual insights from macroeconomics for informed citizenship?",
          "back": "1) **Trade-offs are everywhere** (inflation vs unemployment, efficiency vs equity, present vs future). 2) **Markets are powerful but imperfect**—need smart regulation and social insurance. 3) **Everything is connected**—local decisions have global impacts, economic choices have social and environmental consequences. Wise policy navigates these complexities."
