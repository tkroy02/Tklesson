          "back": "**Expansionary mix**:\n- **Fiscal**: ↑G or ↓T to stimulate AD\n- **Monetary**: ↓interest rates to stimulate I and C\n**Why**: Recessionary gap means AD < potential. Need to shift AD right. Both policies work together, with monetary avoiding crowding out."
        },

          "front": "**Scenario**: Inflation is at 8% (target 2%), unemployment at 4% (NRU = 5%), and real GDP above potential. What's happening and what policies?",
          "back": "**Inflationary gap** (AD > LRAS). Need **contractionary policies**:\n- **Fiscal**: ↓G or ↑T\n- **Monetary**: ↑interest rates\n**Risk**: Could trigger recession if overdone. Self-correction would eventually occur via rising wages shifting SRAS left."

          "front": "**Scenario**: Stagflation - inflation 7%, unemployment 8%, stagnant growth. What caused it and policy response?",
          "back": "**Cause**: Negative supply shock (SRAS left).\n**Policy dilemma**: AD policies worsen one problem. Focus on **supply-side policies**:\n- Business tax cuts\n- Deregulation\n- R&D incentives\n- Improve productivity to shift SRAS right"

          "front": "**Graph Interpretation**: Show the **short-run and long-run effects** of expansionary fiscal policy in AD-AS model.",
          "back": "1. **Short run**: AD shifts right → P↑, Y↑ (movement along SRAS)\n2. **Transition**: Y > Y* → unemployment < NRU → wages rise → SRAS shifts left\n3. **Long run**: Back to Y* at higher P (only price level changed)"

          "front": "**Calculate**: If MPC = 0.8, what is spending multiplier? Tax multiplier? If government increases spending by $100 billion, what's ΔGDP? If cuts taxes by $100B?",
          "back": "Spending multiplier = 1/(1-0.8) = 5\nTax multiplier = -0.8/(1-0.8) = -4\nΔGDP from $100B G = $500B\nΔGDP from $100B tax cut = $400B\nTax cut less effective due to saving."

        {
          "front": "**Policy Conflict**: Government wants to reduce both unemployment and budget deficit. Possible? What policies?",
          "back": "**Conflict**: Reducing unemployment needs expansionary policy (↑G or ↓T) which worsens deficit.\n**Possible solution**: Expansionary monetary policy to reduce unemployment + contractionary fiscal to reduce deficit. Or supply-side policies to grow economy ↑tax revenue."

          "front": "**Automatic Stabilizers**: During recession, how do they work? Numerical example with progressive tax.",
          "back": "**Progressive tax**: Income falls → move to lower bracket → tax rate falls → disposable income falls less than pre-tax income.\n**Example**: 25% bracket → 22% bracket = 3% tax cut automatically.\n**Unemployment benefits**: Automatically ↑ as layoffs ↑."

          "front": "**Rational Expectations Critique**: If people anticipate Fed's inflation, what happens to Phillips Curve?",
          "back": "**No short-run trade-off**: If people perfectly anticipate inflation, they adjust wages/prices immediately. SRPC becomes vertical immediately. **Policy ineffective** for real variables."

          "front": "**Fiscal Multiplier in Open Economy**: Why smaller than closed economy?",
