      "cards": [
        {
          "front": "Explain why expansionary fiscal policy might be less effective during a recession if there's significant crowding out.",
          "back": "When the government borrows to finance deficit spending, it competes with private borrowers for limited loanable funds, driving up interest rates. Higher interest rates discourage private investment, partially offsetting the stimulative effect of government spending."
        },
        {
          "front": "Describe the conflict between fighting inflation and maintaining employment in the short run.",
          "back": "The short-run Phillips Curve illustrates this trade-off: policies that reduce inflation typically increase unemployment temporarily, while policies that reduce unemployment risk increasing inflation. Policymakers must choose which problem to prioritize."
        },
        {
          "front": "Contrast how a market economy versus a command economy would respond to a shortage of a critical resource like oil.",
          "back": "In a market economy, rising oil prices would signal scarcity, encouraging conservation and alternative energy. In a command economy, the government would ration oil and dictate conservation measures. Markets use price signals; command economies use administrative orders."
        },
        {
          "front": "Explain how expansionary monetary policy in the United States affects other countries through exchange rates.",
          "back": "When the Fed lowers interest rates, the dollar tends to depreciate. A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper and imports more expensive. Trading partners may see their currencies appreciate, hurting their exports."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why can't the economy sustainably produce beyond its potential GDP?",
          "back": "Potential GDP represents the economy's maximum sustainable output. Attempting to produce beyond this leads to overheating: labor shortages push up wages, and higher production costs eventually force a return to potential output at higher price levels."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why are property rights and rule of law essential for economic growth?",
          "back": "Secure property rights give people confidence to invest, innovate, and maintain resources. The rule of law ensures contracts are enforced. Without these, uncertainty discourages long-term investment and reduces specialization and trade."
        },
        {
          "front": "How might 'animal spirits' or 'irrational exuberance' challenge traditional economic models?",
          "back": "Traditional models assume rational actors. Behavioral economics recognizes that psychological factors—overconfidence, herd mentality—can drive economic decisions. These can create asset bubbles and amplify business cycles."
        },
        {
          "front": "Who typically benefits and loses from unexpected inflation, and why?",
          "back": "Winners: Debtors (repay loans with less valuable money) and flexible-income workers. Losers: Creditors (repaid with cheaper dollars) and fixed-income retirees. Inflation redistributes wealth unpredictably."
        },
        {
          "front": "What lessons from the Great Depression inform modern macroeconomic policy?",
          "back": "Key lessons: Letting banks fail can trigger systemic collapse. Monetary tightening during downturn worsens depression. Fiscal austerity during recession deepens it. International cooperation matters."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does the traditional GDP measure fail to account for environmental sustainability?",
          "back": "GDP counts economic activity without distinguishing between beneficial and harmful production. It ignores depletion of natural capital and doesn't account for whether current consumption compromises future generations' well-being."
        },
        {
          "front": "Compare the 2008 Financial Crisis response with potential future crisis management approaches.",
          "back": "2008 saw unconventional tools: bank bailouts, quantitative easing. Future crises may require: digital currency tools, climate-risk regulations, international coordination, and addressing inequality as a stability issue."
        },
        {
          "front": "How might AI and automation challenge traditional macroeconomic policy tools?",
          "back": "Automation could reduce effectiveness of traditional job creation policies, change the nature of structural unemployment, affect income distribution dramatically, and challenge tax systems based on labor income."
        },
        {
          "front": "Explain the tension between national policy autonomy and global economic integration.",
          "back": "Integrated economies face the 'trilemma': countries can't simultaneously have fixed exchange rates, free capital movement, and independent monetary policy. Choosing globalization means sacrificing either exchange rate stability or policy autonomy."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why might democratically elected governments struggle to implement optimal long-term economic policies?",
          "back": "Political cycles conflict with economic cycles. Politicians face incentives to stimulate before elections, avoid short-term pain for long-term gain, and cater to vocal interest groups rather than overall economic efficiency."
        },
        {
          "front": "How might the changing nature of work challenge traditional economic measurement and policy?",
          "back": "Traditional measures struggle with classifying gig workers, measuring productivity in remote settings, and addressing social safety nets for non-traditional employment. Policies designed for traditional jobs may become inadequate."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the ethical considerations in using contractionary policy to fight inflation when unemployment is already high?",
          "back": "This creates an ethical dilemma: fighting inflation helps savers but hurts unemployed workers. Policymakers must weigh intergenerational equity, distributional effects, and whether there are less painful alternatives."
        },
        {
          "front": "How has the Federal Reserve's approach changed from the Volcker era to today?",
          "back": "Volcker focused on aggressive inflation fighting. Today's Fed uses average inflation targeting, greater focus on employment, and readiness for unconventional tools. Evolution reflects lessons learned and changing economic consensus."
        },
        {
          "front": "How might rising income inequality affect overall macroeconomic stability and growth?",
          "back": "High inequality can reduce aggregate demand, increase debt-driven consumption, reduce social mobility, create political instability affecting investment, and potentially slow long-term growth by underutilizing talent."
        },
        {
          "front": "How should macroeconomic policy account for climate change risks?",
          "back": "Central banks now consider climate-related financial risks. Fiscal policy faces carbon tax dilemmas, just transition funding, and infrastructure investment for adaptation. Traditional growth models may need adjustment."
        },
        {
          "front": "How might central bank digital currencies change monetary policy implementation?",
          "back": "CBDCs could allow direct central bank accounts bypassing commercial banks, enable programmable money for targeted stimulus, provide new monetary policy tools, but also risk bank disintermediation and privacy concerns."
        },
        {
          "front": "What unique economic challenges did COVID-19 present that differed from traditional recessions?",
          "back": "Traditional recessions involve deficient demand; pandemic involved supply shocks plus demand shifts. Policy response was unique: massive direct transfers, support for idled workers, business survival loans."
        },
        {
          "front": "How might reshoring and supply chain nationalism affect inflation and growth?",
          "back": "Reshoring could increase production costs leading to cost-push inflation, reduce efficiency gains from specialization slowing productivity growth, but increase economic resilience at higher cost."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do deficit spending and national debt create ethical questions across generations?",
          "back": "Current deficit spending transfers costs to future taxpayers. Justification depends on whether funds finance consumption vs investment, whether growth outpaces debt costs, and intergenerational fairness considerations."
        },
        {
          "front": "Contrast the Keynesian and Classical approaches to recession response.",
          "back": "Keynesian: Markets don't self-correct quickly; active government intervention needed. Classical: Markets self-correct; government intervention often worsens things; focus on long-run growth."
        },
        {
          "front": "How might excessive financial sector growth distort the real economy?",
          "back": "Financialization may divert talent from productive sectors, encourage short-termism, increase systemic risk, create asset bubbles, and increase inequality through disproportionate profit capture."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why wasn't the Eurozone an optimal currency area initially, and what problems resulted?",
          "back": "The Eurozone lacked labor mobility, fiscal transfers, and similar business cycles. Asymmetric shocks hit countries differently, but one monetary policy couldn't fit all, requiring either more integration or more flexibility."
        },
        {
          "front": "How would a Post-Keynesian critique mainstream inflation fighting approaches?",
          "back": "Post-Keynesians argue inflation often comes from conflict over income distribution, not excess demand. Fighting inflation with unemployment creates unnecessary suffering. Better approach: incomes policies addressing root distributional conflicts."
        },
        {
          "front": "Can developing countries achieve rapid growth while addressing environmental concerns?",
          "back": "Traditional path: grow now, clean later. New view: must 'leapfrog' to clean technology, but this requires technology transfer and financing. Equity issue: developed countries polluted during their growth."
        },
        {
          "front": "What new challenges will central banks face in the coming decades?",
          "back": "Digital currency management, climate risk integration, inequality considerations, navigating fiscal dominance, international policy coordination, managing transition risks, and maintaining credibility amid political pressures."
        },
        {
          "front": "How has economic thinking evolved from the Great Moderation to today's polycrisis world?",
          "back": "Great Moderation believed in stable growth and efficient markets. Today recognizes financial instability, need for macroprudential regulation, limits of conventional policy, and facing simultaneous challenges requiring integrated approaches."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does the capabilities approach differ from GDP growth as development goal?",
          "back": "GDP measures output; capabilities approach asks what people can do and be. Focuses on health, education, political freedom. Economic growth is means, not end. Policies should expand human capabilities."
        },
        {
          "front": "How might circular economy principles challenge traditional growth models?",
          "back": "Traditional economy: take-make-dispose. Circular economy: reduce-reuse-recycle. Challenges: may reduce measured GDP, requires different business models, needs policy support. Questions whether GDP growth is compatible with resource constraints."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does great power competition affect global economic stability and policy?",
          "back": "Fragmentation reduces efficiency gains from trade, increases costs, creates currency competition, leads to economic statecraft, and complicates policy coordination on global issues. May increase volatility."
        },
        {
          "front": "What different views of human nature underlie different economic schools?",
          "back": "Classical: Rational, self-interested individuals. Keynesian: Sometimes irrational, influenced by animal spirits. Behavioral: Boundedly rational, influenced by biases. Institutional: Shaped by social structures."
        },
        {
          "front": "How should we rethink economic policy for a world of more frequent shocks?",
          "back": "Move from efficiency optimization to resilience building: redundancy over leanness, diversity over specialization, adaptive capacity over static optimization. May mean accepting lower growth for better shock absorption."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do tech platforms challenge traditional antitrust and macroeconomic thinking?",
          "back": "Network effects create natural monopolies, data as new economic resource, blur sector lines, challenge productivity measurement, create new market power. Macro implications for innovation, distribution, and monetary transmission."
        },
        {
          "front": "What would a well-being focused macroeconomic framework look like?",
          "back": "Beyond GDP dashboard: include health, education, environmental quality, social connections. Policies evaluated by well-being impact. May prioritize different investments and consider distribution more centrally."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the three most important conceptual insights from macroeconomics for informed citizenship?",
          "back": "1) Trade-offs are everywhere. 2) Markets are powerful but imperfect—need smart regulation. 3) Everything is connected—local decisions have global impacts, economic choices have social and environmental consequences."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why do economists disagree about the optimal size of government in the economy?",
          "back": "Different views on: market efficiency vs failure, equity-efficiency trade-off, crowding out effects, bureaucratic efficiency, and philosophical differences about individual vs collective responsibility."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does the concept of 'externalities' justify government intervention in market economies?",
          "back": "Externalities occur when market transactions affect third parties. Negative externalities (pollution) lead to overproduction; positive externalities (education) lead to underproduction. Government intervention (taxes, subsidies, regulations) can correct these market failures."
