          "front": "What is **aggregate demand (AD)**?",
          "back": "The total quantity of all goods and services (real GDP) that households, firms, government, and foreigners are willing and able to buy at different price levels, holding all else constant."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why is the **AD curve downward sloping**?",
          "back": "Due to three effects:\n1. **Wealth effect** (higher prices reduce real wealth → less consumption)\n2. **Interest rate effect** (higher prices increase demand for money → higher interest rates → less investment)\n3. **Foreign trade effect** (higher domestic prices reduce exports, increase imports → lower net exports)"
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the **four components of aggregate demand**?",
          "back": "Same as GDP expenditure approach:\n**AD = C + I + G + (X - M)**\nConsumption + Investment + Government spending + Net exports"

          "front": "What are the **determinants of aggregate demand** (factors that shift AD)?",
          "back": "Changes in:\n1. **Consumer spending**\n2. **Investment spending**\n3. **Government spending**\n4. **Net exports**\nNOT changes in the price level (which cause movement along AD curve)."

        {
          "front": "What factors increase **consumer spending (C)**, shifting AD right?",
          "back": "1. **Increase in consumer wealth** (stock/housing prices rise)\n2. **Decrease in personal taxes**\n3. **Increase in consumer confidence/optimism**\n4. **Decrease in household debt**\n5. **Expectations of future price increases**"

          "front": "What factors increase **government spending (G)**, shifting AD right?",
          "back": "1. **Increase in government purchases** of goods/services\n2. **Fiscal policy**: Expansionary spending increases\n(NOT transfer payments, which affect C indirectly)"
        },
        {
          "front": "What factors increase **net exports (X-M)**, shifting AD right?",
          "back": "1. **Depreciation of domestic currency** (exports cheaper, imports dearer)\n2. **Increase in foreign income** (buy more exports)\n3. **Decrease in domestic prices relative to foreign prices**\n4. **Trade policy favoring exports**"

        {
          "front": "What is the difference between **short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)** and **long-run aggregate supply (LRAS)**?",
          "back": "**SRAS**: Prices of resources (especially wages) are 'sticky' or slow to adjust. **LRAS**: All prices and wages are fully flexible, economy at full employment."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why is the **SRAS curve upward sloping**?",
          "back": "Three theories:\n1. **Sticky wage theory**: Nominal wages adjust slowly, so higher prices increase profits → more output\n2. **Sticky price theory**: Some prices adjust slowly\n3. **Misperceptions theory**: Firms confuse general price increases with increased demand for their product"

          "front": "Why is **LRAS vertical**?",
          "back": "In the long run, output depends only on:\n1. **Quantity/quality of resources**\n2. **Technology**\n3. **Institutions**\nNOT the price level (all prices/wages adjust fully)."

          "front": "What is **stagflation** and what causes it?",
          "back": "Simultaneous inflation and recession (high unemployment). Caused by **negative supply shock** (SRAS shifts left)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What happens in the AD-AS model if **AD increases** in short run vs. long run?",
          "back": "**Short run**: AD↑ → price level↑, real GDP↑ (movement along SRAS). **Long run**: Wages adjust → SRAS shifts left → price level↑ further, real GDP back to potential."

        {
          "front": "What is the **difference between movement along vs. shift of AD curve**?",
          "back": "**Movement along**: Caused by change in price level (wealth, interest rate, foreign trade effects). **Shift**: Caused by change in C, I, G, or (X-M) at every price level."

          "front": "What happens if **AD increases while economy is already at potential GDP**?",
          "back": "Short-run: real GDP↑ above potential (inflationary gap). Long-run: SRAS shifts left as wages rise, returning to potential GDP but at higher price level → **demand-pull inflation**."
