          "front": "What is **fiscal policy**?",
          "back": "Government decisions about **taxation** and **spending** to influence the economy and achieve macroeconomic goals (full employment, price stability, economic growth)."
        },
        {
          "front": "Who conducts **fiscal policy** in the United States?",
          "back": "**Congress and the President** through the federal budget process. State and local governments also have fiscal policies but are less impactful for macroeconomic stabilization."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the **two main tools of fiscal policy**?",
          "back": "1. **Government Spending** (purchases of goods/services)\n2. **Taxation** (revenue collection)"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **expansionary fiscal policy** and when is it used?",
          "back": "**Increasing government spending** and/or **decreasing taxes** to stimulate Aggregate Demand (AD). Used during **recessions** to reduce unemployment."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **contractionary fiscal policy** and when is it used?",
          "back": "**Decreasing government spending** and/or **increasing taxes** to reduce Aggregate Demand (AD). Used during **inflationary periods** to combat inflation."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **difference between discretionary and automatic fiscal policy**?",
          "back": "**Discretionary**: Deliberate changes in spending/taxes through new legislation. **Automatic**: Built-in stabilizers that work without new laws (e.g., unemployment benefits, progressive taxes)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are **automatic stabilizers**?",
          "back": "Features of fiscal policy that automatically dampen business cycle fluctuations:\n1. **Progressive income tax** (revenues fall in recession)\n2. **Unemployment insurance** (spending rises in recession)\n3. **Welfare programs** (spending rises in recession)"
        },
        {
          "front": "How do **automatic stabilizers** work during a recession?",
          "back": "Tax revenues automatically ↓ (people earn less, move to lower tax brackets). Transfer payments automatically ↑ (more unemployment claims). This helps stabilize disposable income and AD without new legislation."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do **automatic stabilizers** work during expansion?",
          "back": "Tax revenues automatically ↑ (people earn more, move to higher brackets). Transfer payments automatically ↓ (fewer need benefits). This helps cool off overheating economy."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **spending multiplier effect**?",
          "back": "The idea that an initial change in spending causes a larger change in overall GDP.\nSpending multiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC)\nWhere MPC = Marginal Propensity to Consume"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **tax multiplier effect**?",
          "back": "The idea that a change in taxes causes a smaller change in GDP than an equal change in spending.\nTax multiplier = -MPC / (1 - MPC)\n(Negative sign: tax cut increases GDP, tax hike decreases GDP)"
        },
        {
          "front": "Why is the **spending multiplier larger than the tax multiplier**?",
          "back": "Because government spending directly enters GDP (C + I + G + X-M), while tax changes only affect disposable income, and some of that may be saved rather than spent."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **balanced budget multiplier**?",
          "back": "When government spending increases by the same amount as taxes increase (balanced budget), GDP still increases by the amount of the spending increase.\nBalanced budget multiplier = 1"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **crowding out**?",
          "back": "When government borrowing to finance deficit spending drives up interest rates, reducing private investment. Can weaken effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does **crowding out** occur?",
          "back": "Government runs deficit → borrows money → increased demand for loanable funds → interest rates rise → private investment falls (I↓) → partially offsets AD increase from fiscal policy."
        },
        {
          "front": "When is **crowding out** most likely to occur?",
          "back": "When economy is near full employment. In deep recession with lots of idle resources, crowding out is less likely."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the **time lags** in fiscal policy?",
          "back": "1. **Recognition lag** (identifying problem)\n2. **Administrative/Implementation lag** (passing legislation)\n3. **Operational/Impact lag** (policy takes effect)\nTotal lag can be 12-18 months, making timely stabilization difficult."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **political business cycle** theory?",
          "back": "Politicians might manipulate economy (expansionary policies before elections, contractionary after) to improve re-election chances, creating artificial business cycles."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **budget deficit**?",
          "back": "When government spending exceeds tax revenue in a given year.\nDeficit = G - T\n(where G = government spending, T = tax revenue)"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a **budget surplus**?",
          "back": "When tax revenue exceeds government spending in a given year.\nSurplus = T - G"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **national debt**?",
          "back": "The **accumulation** of all past budget deficits minus surpluses. Total amount government owes to holders of its securities."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the difference between **deficit and debt**?",
          "back": "**Deficit**: Annual shortfall (flow). **Debt**: Total accumulated amount owed (stock).\nAnalogy: Deficit = annual overspending; Debt = total credit card balance."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **cyclical deficit** vs. **structural deficit**?",
          "back": "**Cyclical deficit**: Part of deficit due to business cycle (recession reduces tax revenue). **Structural deficit**: Part that would exist even at full employment (due to permanent spending/tax policies)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the **arguments for using fiscal policy**?",
          "back": "1. Can be targeted to specific problems\n2. Direct impact on AD\n3. Automatic stabilizers work quickly\n4. Can address both demand-side and supply-side issues"
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the **arguments against using fiscal policy**?",
          "back": "1. Time lags\n2. Crowding out\n3. Political constraints\n4. Could worsen budget deficits/debt\n5. May create inflation if overused"
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **supply-side fiscal policy**?",
          "back": "Policies aimed at increasing productive capacity (LRAS) rather than just stimulating AD. Examples: investment tax credits, R&D incentives, education spending, infrastructure."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do **supply-side tax cuts** work?",
          "back": "Reduce marginal tax rates to increase incentives to work, save, invest. Theory: Increases potential GDP (shifts LRAS right). Critics argue benefits mainly go to wealthy."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **Laffer Curve**?",
          "back": "Theoretical relationship between tax rates and tax revenue. At very high tax rates, cutting rates might increase revenue by stimulating economic activity. At low rates, cutting reduces revenue."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **Ricardian equivalence**?",
          "back": "Theory that people anticipate future taxes to pay for current deficits, so they save rather than spend tax cuts, making fiscal policy ineffective. Controversial and not fully supported by evidence."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does fiscal policy affect **AD-AS model**?",
          "back": "**Expansionary**: AD shifts right → higher price level, higher real GDP (short run). **Contractionary**: AD shifts left → lower price level, lower real GDP (short run)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What fiscal policy would you use for **demand-pull inflation**?",
          "back": "**Contractionary fiscal policy**: Decrease G and/or increase T to shift AD left, reducing inflationary pressure."
        },
        {
          "front": "What fiscal policy would you use for **cost-push inflation (stagflation)**?",
          "back": "Problem: AD policies worsen one problem while helping other. Focus on **supply-side policies** to shift SRAS right (e.g., reduce business taxes, deregulation)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **difference between government purchases and transfer payments** in fiscal policy?",
          "back": "**Purchases**: Direct spending on goods/services (part of G in GDP). **Transfers**: Payments to individuals without goods/services in return (not in G, affect C)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **impact of fiscal policy on income distribution**?",
          "back": "Progressive tax increases and targeted transfers can reduce inequality. Regressive taxes and spending cuts can increase inequality."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **austerity policy**?",
          "back": "Contractionary fiscal policy involving spending cuts and/or tax increases to reduce government debt, but can worsen recession in short run."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **fiscal stimulus**?",
          "back": "Expansionary fiscal policy, especially during recession. Examples: 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ($831 billion in spending/tax cuts)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are **unfunded liabilities**?",
          "back": "Future spending commitments (Social Security, Medicare) not covered by current revenue or dedicated taxes. A long-term fiscal challenge."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **role of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)**?",
          "back": "Non-partisan agency that provides economic data, estimates fiscal impact of legislation, and projects budget deficits/surpluses."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is **fiscal federalism**?",
          "back": "Division of fiscal responsibilities between federal, state, and local governments. Federal handles macroeconomic stabilization; states handle education, infrastructure."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **current U.S. fiscal policy stance** typically?",
          "back": "Historically, U.S. runs deficits during recessions (expansionary) and sometimes surpluses during expansions (though often deficits persist). National debt has grown significantly since 1980s."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the **impact of fiscal policy on trade balance**?",
          "back": "Expansionary fiscal policy (deficit spending) can worsen trade deficit: stimulates imports, may appreciate currency. Part of **twin deficits hypothesis**."
