          "back": "As price increases, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa (inverse relationship), ceteris paribus."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why does the demand curve slope downward?",
          "back": "1) Substitution effect (cheaper alternatives), 2) Income effect (purchasing power changes), 3) Diminishing marginal utility."

          "back": "The more inelastic side bears more of the tax burden. If demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers pay more of the tax."
