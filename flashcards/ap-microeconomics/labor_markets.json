          "front": "What is the law of demand for labor?",
          "back": "As wage increases, quantity of labor demanded decreases (inverse relationship), ceteris paribus."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why does the labor demand curve slope downward?",
          "back": "1) Substitution effect: firms substitute capital for labor as wages rise\n2) Output effect: higher wages increase production costs, reducing output and labor needed"

        {
          "front": "What is marginal revenue product of labor (MRP)?",
          "back": "The additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker. MRP = MP × MR."

        {
          "front": "What is the backward-bending labor supply curve?",
          "back": "At very high wages, the income effect may dominate: workers work fewer hours as wages rise, valuing leisure more."

        {
          "front": "How does a monopsony differ from competitive labor markets?",
          "back": "Monopsonist faces upward-sloping labor supply curve, must raise wages to hire more workers, so MFC > wage."
