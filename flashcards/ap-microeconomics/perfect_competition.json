          "front": "What are the five characteristics of a perfectly competitive market?",
          "back": "1) Many buyers and sellers\n2) Identical (homogeneous) products\n3) Perfect information\n4) Free entry and exit\n5) Price takers"
        },
        {
          "front": "What does 'price taker' mean in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Individual firms cannot influence market price. They must accept the market-determined price and can sell any quantity at that price."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why are perfectly competitive firms price takers?",
          "back": "Each firm is so small relative to the market that its output decisions don't affect market price. Products are identical, so no buyer would pay more."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the demand curve faced by an individual perfectly competitive firm?",
          "back": "Perfectly elastic (horizontal) at the market price. MR = P = D for the firm."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the relationship between market demand and firm demand in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Market demand slopes downward. Individual firm demand is horizontal at market price. Firm demand ≠ market demand."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is marginal revenue for a perfectly competitive firm?",
          "back": "MR = P. Each additional unit sold adds exactly the price to total revenue."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the profit-maximizing rule for a perfectly competitive firm?",
          "back": "Produce where MR = MC. Since MR = P for perfect competition, produce where P = MC."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does a perfectly competitive firm determine its profit-maximizing output?",
          "back": "Finds where P = MC on the rising portion of the MC curve."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the short-run supply curve for a perfectly competitive firm?",
          "back": "The portion of the MC curve above the minimum AVC. Shows how much the firm will produce at each price."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the short-run market supply curve in perfect competition?",
          "back": "The horizontal sum of all individual firms' supply curves (MC above AVC)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the shut-down rule in the short run?",
          "back": "Shut down if P < AVC. Continue operating if P > AVC, even if P < ATC (covering variable costs helps minimize losses)."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why would a firm continue operating at a loss in the short run?",
          "back": "If P > AVC, the firm covers variable costs and contributes something to fixed costs, which must be paid anyway."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the break-even point for a perfectly competitive firm?",
          "back": "Where P = minimum ATC. Firm makes zero economic profit (normal profit only)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What happens to economic profits in perfect competition in the long run?",
          "back": "They are eliminated by entry of new firms if positive, or exit of firms if negative. Long-run equilibrium: zero economic profit."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is long-run equilibrium in perfect competition?",
          "back": "P = MC = minimum ATC. Zero economic profit, only normal profit."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is productive efficiency in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Producing at minimum ATC. Achieved in long-run equilibrium."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is allocative efficiency in perfect competition?",
          "back": "P = MC. Resources allocated to produce what consumers value most. Achieved in long-run equilibrium."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does entry affect market equilibrium in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Entry increases market supply, lowers market price, reduces profits for all firms until zero economic profit."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does exit affect market equilibrium in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Exit decreases market supply, raises market price, increases profits for remaining firms until zero economic profit."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a constant-cost industry in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Entry/exit doesn't affect input prices. Long-run supply curve is horizontal at minimum ATC."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is an increasing-cost industry in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Entry increases input prices. Long-run supply curve slopes upward."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a decreasing-cost industry in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Entry decreases input prices (rare). Long-run supply curve slopes downward."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the relationship between short-run and long-run supply?",
          "back": "Long-run supply is more elastic because firms can enter/exit and adjust all inputs."
        },
        {
          "front": "What happens when demand increases in a perfectly competitive market?",
          "back": "Short run: Price rises, firms increase output along MC curve, make economic profits.\nLong run: Entry occurs, supply increases, price returns to minimum ATC, zero economic profit."
        },
        {
          "front": "What happens when demand decreases in a perfectly competitive market?",
          "back": "Short run: Price falls, firms reduce output along MC curve, incur losses.\nLong run: Exit occurs, supply decreases, price returns to minimum ATC, zero economic profit."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is normal profit?",
          "back": "The minimum return needed to keep resources in their current use. Included in costs, so zero economic profit includes normal profit."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the difference between economic profit and accounting profit?",
          "back": "Economic profit = Total revenue - All costs (explicit + implicit). Accounting profit = Total revenue - Explicit costs only."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why is perfect competition considered the most efficient market structure?",
          "back": "Achieves both productive efficiency (minimum ATC) and allocative efficiency (P = MC) in long run."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is consumer surplus in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Area below demand curve and above price. Maximized due to low prices and high output."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is producer surplus in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Area above supply curve and below price. Only covers opportunity costs in long run."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is total surplus in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Consumer surplus + producer surplus. Maximized, with no deadweight loss."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the role of profits in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Short-run profits signal entry, losses signal exit. Long-run zero economic profit provides normal return to resources."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why do perfectly competitive firms have no incentive to advertise?",
          "back": "Products are identical, so advertising wouldn't increase demand for individual firms. Would only increase costs."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the difference between firm and industry in perfect competition?",
          "back": "Firm: Individual producer. Industry: All firms producing the product. Firm decisions don't affect industry, but industry affects firms."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the shape of the total revenue curve for a perfectly competitive firm?",
          "back": "Straight line through origin with slope = P (since TR = P × Q)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the relationship between price, marginal revenue, and average revenue in perfect competition?",
          "back": "P = MR = AR. All are equal and constant for the firm."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does a perfectly competitive firm respond to price changes?",
          "back": "Moves along its MC curve. Higher price → produce more. Lower price → produce less (if above AVC)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the significance of the minimum AVC point?",
          "back": "Shut-down point. If price falls below minimum AVC, firm should shut down."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the significance of the minimum ATC point?",
          "back": "Break-even point. In long run, firms produce here with zero economic profit."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why can't perfectly competitive firms earn long-run economic profits?",
          "back": "Free entry means new firms enter when profits exist, increasing supply and lowering price until profits disappear."
        },
        {
          "front": "What happens to efficiency when a perfectly competitive market is in long-run equilibrium?",
          "back": "Both productive efficiency (minimum ATC) and allocative efficiency (P = MC) are achieved."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is an example of a market that approximates perfect competition?",
          "back": "Agricultural markets (wheat, corn), foreign exchange markets, stock markets (for individual stocks)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the limitations of the perfect competition model?",
          "back": "Assumes perfect information, no externalities, homogeneous products, no barriers to entry—conditions rarely met in reality."
