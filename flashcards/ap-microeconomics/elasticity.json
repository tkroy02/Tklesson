          "front": "How do you interpret elasticity coefficient values?",

        {
          "front": "What does elastic demand mean for consumers' price sensitivity?",
          "back": "Consumers are highly sensitive to price changes. Small price changes lead to large quantity changes."

        {
          "front": "What does inelastic demand mean for consumers' price sensitivity?",
          "back": "Consumers are not very sensitive to price changes. Price changes lead to proportionally smaller quantity changes."

          "front": "What are the key determinants of price elasticity of demand?",
          "back": "1) Availability of close substitutes\n2) Necessity vs luxury\n3) Proportion of income spent\n4) Time horizon"

        {
          "front": "How does availability of substitutes affect elasticity?",
          "back": "More substitutes = more elastic demand. Fewer substitutes = more inelastic demand."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why are luxuries generally more elastic than necessities?",
          "back": "Consumers can more easily postpone or forego luxury purchases when prices rise."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does the proportion of income spent affect elasticity?",
          "back": "Goods that take a large portion of income tend to have more elastic demand (consumers are more price-sensitive)."
        },
        {
          "front": "Why is demand usually more elastic in the long run?",
          "back": "Consumers have more time to adjust behavior: find substitutes, change habits, or alter consumption patterns."

          "front": "What is the midpoint (arc) elasticity formula?",
          "back": "Ed = [(Q2 - Q1) / ((Q1 + Q2)/2)] / [(P2 - P1) / ((P1 + P2)/2)]\nUses averages to avoid direction bias."

        {
          "front": "If demand is elastic, should a firm raise or lower price to increase revenue?",
          "back": "Lower price. The percentage increase in quantity demanded will exceed the percentage decrease in price, increasing total revenue."
        },
        {
          "front": "If demand is inelastic, should a firm raise or lower price to increase revenue?",
          "back": "Raise price. The percentage decrease in quantity demanded will be less than the percentage increase in price, increasing total revenue."

        {
          "front": "What does a perfectly elastic demand curve look like?",
          "back": "Horizontal line at a specific price. Consumers will buy any quantity at that price, but none at any higher price."
        },
        {
          "front": "What does a perfectly inelastic demand curve look like?",
          "back": "Vertical line at a specific quantity. Quantity demanded does not change regardless of price."

          "front": "Why is supply more elastic in the long run?",
          "back": "Firms have more time to adjust production: build new facilities, train workers, develop new technologies."

        {
          "front": "What does perfectly elastic supply look like?",
          "back": "Horizontal line at a specific price. Producers will supply any quantity at that price."

        {
          "front": "What is a luxury good in terms of income elasticity?",
          "back": "Normal good with income elasticity > 1. Demand increases more than proportionally to income increases."

        {
          "front": "What is a necessity in terms of income elasticity?",

          "front": "What is cross-price elasticity of demand?",

        {
          "front": "What does zero cross-price elasticity indicate?",
          "back": "Unrelated goods: price change of one has no effect on demand for the other."
        },
        {
          "front": "How is elasticity related to the slope of a demand curve?",
          "back": "Elasticity varies along a straight-line demand curve. It is not the same as slope: elasticity = (1/slope) × (P/Q)."

          "front": "What is the relationship between elasticity and the burden of a tax?",
          "back": "The more inelastic side bears more of the tax burden. If demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers pay more of the tax."

          "front": "Why do agricultural products often have inelastic demand?",
          "back": "They are necessities with few substitutes, and represent a small portion of consumer budgets."

          "front": "Why is demand for gasoline relatively inelastic in the short run?",
          "back": "Few immediate substitutes, necessary for commuting, and habit-driven consumption patterns."

        {
          "front": "What happens to elasticity as you move from a specific brand to a general product category?",
          "back": "Demand becomes more inelastic. Example: Demand for Coca-Cola (specific) is more elastic than demand for soda (category)."

        {
          "front": "How does addiction affect elasticity of demand?",
          "back": "Makes demand more inelastic. Addicted consumers are less responsive to price changes."
