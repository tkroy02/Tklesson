          "back": "If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $k$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists at least one $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = k$."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are the two main hypotheses of the IVT?",
          "back": "1) $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$. 2) $k$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$."
        },
        {
          "front": "What does the IVT guarantee?",
          "back": "The existence of at least one $c$ in $(a,b)$ where $f(c)$ equals a given intermediate value $k$."
        },
        {
          "front": "What does the IVT NOT tell you?",
          "back": "It does not tell you how many $c$ values exist, what they are, or how to find them—only that at least one exists."
        },
        {
          "front": "How is the IVT used to prove a root exists?",
          "back": "If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, then by IVT with $k=0$, there exists $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f(c)=0$."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the special case of IVT for roots?",
          "back": "If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, then $f$ has at least one zero in $(a,b)$."
        },
        {
          "front": "Can the IVT be applied if $f$ is not continuous?",
          "back": "No, continuity on the closed interval is essential for the theorem to hold."
        },
        {
          "front": "Does the IVT require $f(a) \\neq f(b)$?",
          "back": "No, but if $f(a)=f(b)$, then $k$ must equal that common value, and $c$ could be any point in $(a,b)$ if $f$ is constant."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the graphical interpretation of the IVT?",
          "back": "A continuous curve from $(a,f(a))$ to $(b,f(b))$ must cross every horizontal line $y=k$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ at least once."

          "front": "How do you apply the IVT to show $x^3 + x - 1 = 0$ has a solution between 0 and 1?",
          "back": "Let $f(x)=x^3+x-1$. $f(0)=-1$, $f(1)=1$. Since $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and $-1 < 0 < 1$, by IVT there exists $c \\in (0,1)$ with $f(c)=0$."

        {
          "front": "What is the difference between IVT and the Mean Value Theorem?",
          "back": "IVT deals with function values; MVT deals with derivatives (slopes)."
        },
        {
          "front": "Can the IVT be applied on an open interval $(a,b)$?",
          "back": "No, the theorem requires continuity on the closed interval $[a,b]$ (but the point $c$ is in the open interval $(a,b)$)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is a common counterexample when IVT fails?",
          "back": "$f(x) = 1/x$ on $[-1,1]$ with $k=0$—not continuous on $[-1,1]$ because discontinuous at $x=0$."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does IVT relate to the concept of connectedness?",
          "back": "Continuous functions map connected intervals to connected intervals; the image of $[a,b]$ under $f$ is an interval containing all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the generalized Intermediate Value Theorem?",
          "back": "If $f$ is continuous on a connected set, then its image is also connected (preserves intervals)."
        },
        {
          "front": "Can IVT be used for functions that are not defined at some points in $[a,b]$?",
          "back": "No, $f$ must be defined and continuous at every point in $[a,b]$ to apply IVT."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do you use IVT to show a temperature change must have reached a certain value?",
          "back": "If temperature is continuous over time and was $T_1$ at time $a$ and $T_2$ at time $b$, then for any $T$ between $T_1$ and $T_2$, there was some time $c$ when temperature was exactly $T$."

        {
          "front": "If $f(1) = 3$ and $f(4) = 9$, can we conclude $f$ takes the value $5$ somewhere between 1 and 4?",
          "back": "Only if $f$ is continuous on $[1,4]$. If continuous, yes by IVT since $3 < 5 < 9$."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the converse of the IVT?",
          "back": "False. If for every $k$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ there exists $c \\in (a,b)$ with $f(c)=k$, $f$ is not necessarily continuous."
        },
        {
          "front": "Can a discontinuous function satisfy the conclusion of IVT?",
          "back": "Yes, but not for every interval. Some discontinuous functions (like derivatives) may still have the intermediate value property (Darboux property)."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is Darboux's Theorem?",
          "back": "If $f$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$, then $f'$ has the intermediate value property (even if not continuous)."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does IVT help prove the existence of fixed points?",
          "back": "For $g(x)=f(x)-x$, if $g(a) \\ge 0$ and $g(b) \\le 0$ (or vice versa) and $g$ is continuous, then IVT gives $c$ with $g(c)=0$, so $f(c)=c$."

          "front": "How do you show $\\cos x = x$ has a solution?",
          "back": "Let $f(x)=\\cos x - x$. $f(0)=1$, $f(\\pi/2)=-\\pi/2<0$. Since continuous, IVT guarantees $c \\in (0,\\pi/2)$ with $f(c)=0$, so $\\cos c = c$."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the connection between IVT and the Extreme Value Theorem?",
          "back": "Both require continuity on $[a,b]$. EVT says $f$ attains max/min; IVT says $f$ attains all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$."
        },
        {
          "front": "Can IVT be applied to functions with jump discontinuities?",
          "back": "No, jump discontinuities violate the continuity requirement."

        {
          "front": "What if $f(a) = f(b)$ and we choose $k$ outside $[f(a),f(b)]$?",
          "back": "IVT does not guarantee existence of $c$; $k$ must be between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$."

        {
          "front": "How do you write the conclusion of IVT mathematically?",
          "back": "$\\exists\\, c \\in (a,b) \\text{ such that } f(c) = k$."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the difference between IVT for continuous functions and the intermediate value property?",
          "back": "All continuous functions have the IVP, but some discontinuous functions (like derivatives) also have IVP."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do you use IVT to prove an equation has at least one real solution?",
          "back": "Rewrite as $f(x)=0$, find $a,b$ with $f(a)<0$ and $f(b)>0$ (or vice versa), verify continuity, then apply IVT."

        {
          "front": "What is a practical real-world application of IVT?",
          "back": "Proving that at some time during a car trip, your speedometer read exactly 50 mph if you started at 0 mph and ended at 60 mph (assuming continuous speed)."
