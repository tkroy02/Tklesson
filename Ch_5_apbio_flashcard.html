  const flashcards = [
    { question: "In a lab, you add an enzyme to a substrate solution. How would you measure the rate of the reaction?", answer: "By measuring the rate of product formation or the rate of substrate consumption over time." },
    { question: "A student adds a strong acid to a solution with an enzyme. What will happen to the enzyme's activity?", answer: "The enzyme will likely denature, losing its shape and function, so its activity will decrease significantly or stop completely." },
    { question: "How would you identify the products of a hydrolysis reaction in a lab setting?", answer: "You could use specific chemical indicators or tests to detect the presence of the monomers that were produced." },
    { question: "A lab involves using a dialysis bag to represent a cell membrane. If you place a bag with a 20% sucrose solution into a beaker with a 10% sucrose solution, what will happen to the bag's mass?", answer: "The bag's mass will increase because water will move into the bag by osmosis to balance the solute concentrations." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of a control group in an experiment on enzyme activity?", answer: "To serve as a baseline for comparison, showing what happens in the absence of the variable being tested (e.g., without the enzyme or with a denatured enzyme)." },
    { question: "A student observes a red blood cell placed in an unknown solution. The cell shrinks. Is the solution hypertonic, hypotonic, or isotonic?", answer: "The solution is **hypertonic** because water moved out of the cell, causing it to shrink." },
    { question: "You are given a graph showing reaction rate vs. temperature. The rate increases to a peak and then drops sharply. What does the peak represent?", answer: "The **optimal temperature** for the enzyme's activity before it begins to denature." },
    { question: "What type of macromolecule would you test for using the Benedict's test?", answer: "Monosaccharides (simple sugars) or other reducing sugars." },
    { question: "You are asked to analyze a diagram of a cell. What feature would definitively tell you it is a eukaryotic cell?", answer: "The presence of a **membrane-bound nucleus** or other membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria or chloroplasts." },
    { question: "What is the primary role of the Golgi apparatus as shown in a diagram of a cell?", answer: "To modify, sort, and package proteins and lipids for transport." },
    { question: "Based on its function, which organelle would you expect to be numerous in a muscle cell, and why?", answer: "**Mitochondria**, because muscle cells require a large amount of ATP for contraction." },
    { question: "A diagram shows a cell membrane with a substance moving from a high concentration to a low concentration with the help of a protein channel. What type of transport is this?", answer: "**Facilitated diffusion**." },
    { question: "A molecule is shown binding to a receptor on a cell surface, triggering a cascade of intracellular reactions. What is the overall process called?", answer: "Signal transduction." },
    { question: "If a cell is unable to produce ribosomes, what would be the immediate effect on the cell's function?", answer: "The cell would be unable to synthesize proteins, leading to a complete cessation of most cellular functions." },
    { question: "In a lab measuring photosynthesis, you find that increasing the light intensity beyond a certain point no longer increases the rate of oxygen production. What is this point called?", answer: "The **light saturation point**, where light is no longer the limiting factor." },
    { question: "What is the independent variable in a lab where you test the effect of pH on enzyme activity?", answer: "The **pH** level." },
    { question: "What is the dependent variable in a lab where you test the effect of pH on enzyme activity?", answer: "The **rate of enzyme activity** (e.g., product formation)." },
    { question: "An MCQ asks you to identify a characteristic of a prokaryotic cell. What would be a correct answer?", answer: "It lacks a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles." },
    { question: "An FRQ asks you to describe how a cell maintains homeostasis. What is a key mechanism you should mention?", answer: "The **cell membrane**'s ability to regulate the movement of substances via passive and active transport." },
    { question: "How would you explain the concept of induced fit in the context of an enzyme-substrate interaction?", answer: "The enzyme's active site changes shape slightly after the substrate binds, providing a more precise fit for catalysis." },
    { question: "You are given a diagram showing a cell completing mitosis. What is a key feature you would look for to confirm it is an animal cell?", answer: "The presence of a **cleavage furrow** during cytokinesis, rather than a cell plate." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of the mitotic spindle?", answer: "To organize and separate the chromosomes during mitosis." },
    { question: "In a lab, you test the effects of a substance on a cell and observe that the cell cycle stops at the G1 checkpoint. What is the substance most likely affecting?", answer: "The cell's ability to grow and replicate its DNA, likely by inhibiting the synthesis of proteins needed for the S phase." },
    { question: "An MCQ asks about the final electron acceptor in cellular respiration. What is the correct answer?", answer: "**Oxygen**." },
    { question: "If a plant cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, what prevents it from bursting?", answer: "The rigid **cell wall**." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between an enzyme and its substrate?", answer: "An enzyme is highly specific to a particular substrate due to the shape of its active site." },
    { question: "Why is the inner mitochondrial membrane highly folded?", answer: "To increase its surface area, which allows for more space for the electron transport chain and ATP synthase to function." },
    { question: "An FRQ asks you to justify why enzymes are essential for life. What is a key point you would make?", answer: "They lower activation energy, allowing chemical reactions to occur at a rate necessary to sustain life under physiological conditions." },
    { question: "In a lab, you use a spectrophotometer to measure the concentration of a colored product. How does this relate to reaction rate?", answer: "The rate of change in absorbance over time is proportional to the rate of the reaction." },
    { question: "What is the role of cholesterol in the cell membrane?", answer: "It acts as a buffer, maintaining membrane fluidity and stability across a range of temperatures." },
    { question: "A student incorrectly states that both mitosis and meiosis produce genetically identical cells. What is the correct statement?", answer: "Mitosis produces genetically identical cells, but meiosis produces genetically unique cells." },
    { question: "What is the role of ATP in active transport?", answer: "ATP provides the energy needed to change the shape of transport proteins to move molecules against their concentration gradient." },
    { question: "An FRQ asks you to explain the difference between osmosis and diffusion. What is a key distinction?", answer: "Diffusion is the movement of any substance from high to low concentration, while osmosis is specifically the diffusion of water across a membrane." },
    { question: "A scientist observes that a cell does not divide even though it has a large amount of DNA. Which cell cycle checkpoint is likely being regulated?", answer: "The **G2 checkpoint**, which ensures that DNA replication is complete and accurate before entering mitosis." },
    { question: "You are given a diagram of a cell and notice a large central vacuole. Is this cell from a plant or an animal?", answer: "A **plant** cell." },
    { question: "In an enzyme experiment, you add a substance and observe that the maximum reaction rate is unchanged, but a higher substrate concentration is needed to reach it. What type of inhibitor did you add?", answer: "A **competitive inhibitor**, which competes with the substrate for the active site." },
    { question: "A lab involves staining cells to observe their nuclei. What dye would you use?", answer: "A dye that binds to DNA, such as methylene blue or DAPI." },
    { question: "What would be the effect of a mutation that permanently activates a cell cycle-promoting gene?", answer: "It could lead to uncontrolled cell division and cancer." },
    { question: "In a graph of an enzyme reaction, what is represented by the slope of the line during the initial phase?", answer: "The **initial reaction rate**." },
    { question: "An MCQ asks you to identify the organelle responsible for protein synthesis. What is the correct answer?", answer: "The **ribosome**." }
