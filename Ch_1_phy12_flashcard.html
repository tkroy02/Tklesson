  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the key difference between an **inertial** and a **non-inertial** reference frame?", answer: "An inertial frame is one that is not accelerating, whereas a non-inertial frame is accelerating and requires the use of fictitious forces to explain motion." },
    { question: "What is the velocity of a projectile at the peak of its flight?", answer: "Its vertical velocity is zero, but its horizontal velocity is constant (neglecting air resistance)." },
    { question: "For a projectile launched at an angle, what is the vertical acceleration?", answer: "Constant and equal to the gravitational acceleration ** - g ** (- 9.8m/s^2) throughout its flight." },
    { question: "When are the horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's motion independent?", answer: "Always, assuming gravity is the only force acting vertically and there is no horizontal force." },
    { question: "What is **relative velocity**?", answer: "The velocity of an object as observed from a particular reference frame." },
    { question: "How is the velocity of a boat relative to the shore calculated if it is moving across a river with a current?", answer: "By vector addition of the boat's velocity relative to the water and the water's velocity relative to the shore ($$\\vec{v}_{BS} = \\vec{v}_{BW} + \\vec{v}_{WS}$$)." },
    { question: "What is the **impulse-momentum theorem**?", answer: "The impulse applied to an object is equal to the change in its momentum ($$J = \\Delta p$$)." },
    { question: "What is **impulse**?", answer: "The product of the average force applied to an object and the time interval over which the force is applied ($$J = F_{avg}\\Delta t$$)." },
    { question: "When is **momentum conserved** in a collision?", answer: "When the net external force on the system is zero." },
    { question: "What is an **elastic collision**?", answer: "A collision in which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved." },
    { question: "What is an **inelastic collision**?", answer: "A collision in which momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not." },
    { question: "In a perfectly inelastic collision, what happens to the objects?", answer: "They stick together and move as a single unit after the collision." },
    { question: "What is the **center of mass** of a system?", answer: "The average position of all the mass in a system. For a system of particles, it is the point where the entire mass can be considered to be concentrated." },
    { question: "What happens to the velocity of the center of mass in a collision?", answer: "It remains constant, assuming no net external force acts on the system." },
    { question: "How does friction affect the conservation of mechanical energy?", answer: "Friction is a non-conservative force that converts mechanical energy into thermal energy." },
    { question: "What is a **non-conservative force**?", answer: "A force for which the work done in moving an object between two points depends on the path taken (e.g., friction, air resistance)." },
    { question: "What is **power**?", answer: "The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred ($$P = \\frac{W}{\\Delta t}$$)." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between power, force, and velocity?", answer: "The power can be calculated as the dot product of force and velocity ($$P = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}$$)." },
    { question: "What is a **fictitious force**?", answer: "An apparent force that arises in a non-inertial reference frame (e.g., centrifugal force)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between centripetal force and centrifugal force?", answer: "Centripetal force is a real force that points inward, while centrifugal force is a fictitious force that appears to point outward in a rotating reference frame." },
    { question: "What is the **normal force** on an object on an inclined plane?", answer: "The component of the gravitational force perpendicular to the surface." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the component of gravity parallel to an inclined plane?", answer: "$$F_\\parallel = mg\\sin\\theta$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the component of gravity perpendicular to an inclined plane?", answer: "$$F_\\perp = mg\\cos\\theta$$" },
    { question: "What is **static friction**?", answer: "The force that prevents an object from starting to slide." },
    { question: "What is **kinetic friction**?", answer: "The force that opposes the motion of a sliding object." },
    { question: "Which is typically greater: static friction or kinetic friction?", answer: "Static friction." },
    { question: "What is the net force on an object in **uniform circular motion**?", answer: "The centripetal force, which is directed towards the center." },
    { question: "What is the work done by the centripetal force?", answer: "Zero, because the force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion." },
    { question: "What is the **work-energy theorem**?", answer: "The net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy ($$W_{net} = \\Delta K$$)." },
    { question: "In what type of collision is momentum conserved in both the x and y directions?", answer: "Any 2-dimensional collision where there is no net external force." },
    { question: "What is a **system** in physics?", answer: "A set of objects or particles chosen for analysis." },
    { question: "How does the period of a pendulum's swing change if the length of the string is doubled?", answer: "The period increases by a factor of $$\\sqrt{2}$$, since $$T \\propto \\sqrt{L}$$." },
    { question: "How does the maximum speed of a mass on a spring change if the amplitude is doubled?", answer: "The maximum speed doubles, as $$v_{max} \\propto A$$." },
    { question: "What is the **coefficient of kinetic friction**?", answer: "A dimensionless constant that relates the force of kinetic friction to the normal force." },
    { question: "What is **terminal velocity**?", answer: "The constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium (e.g., air) prevents further acceleration." },
    { question: "In a two-mass Atwood machine, what is the magnitude of the tension force?", answer: "The tension is less than the gravitational force of the heavier mass and greater than the gravitational force of the lighter mass." },
    { question: "What is the **principle of superposition** for forces?", answer: "The net force on an object is the vector sum of all individual forces acting on it." },
    { question: "How does a car turning a corner demonstrate a non-inertial reference frame?", answer: "In the car's frame of reference, you feel a 'centrifugal' force pushing you outward, which is not a real force." },
    { question: "If an object is launched from a moving train, what is its velocity relative to the ground?", answer: "The vector sum of its velocity relative to the train and the train's velocity relative to the ground." },
    { question: "When a system's momentum is conserved, what is the net external force on the system?", answer: "Zero." }
