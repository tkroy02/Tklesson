Based on the provided tables showing her expected scores: \n(a) Calculate her gain from the second hour spent studying history. \n(b) Calculate the opportunity cost of the second hour spent studying history. \n(c) Assume Nirali increases the time she allocates to studying history. What happens to the opportunity cost of studying history? Explain. \n(d) Assume Nirali has a goal of maximizing the sum of her test scores. How many hours should she study for each exam? \n(e) If Nirali's tennis practice is canceled, freeing up an additional hour (6 total), will she allocate it to Microeconomics or History to maximize her total scores?

        {
          "step": "Part (a): Marginal Benefit of History",
          "explanation": "The gain from the second hour is the marginal score increase. Studying History for 1 hour gives a score of 40; 2 hours gives 60. Gain = 60 - 40 = 20 points."
        },
        {
          "step": "Part (b): Opportunity Cost calculation",
          "explanation": "With 5 hours total, to spend a 2nd hour on History, Nirali must reduce Microeconomics study from 4 hours to 3 hours. Her Micro score drops from 96 to 90. Opportunity cost = 96 - 90 = 6 points."
        },
        {
          "step": "Part (c): Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost",
          "explanation": "As she studies more History, she studies less Micro. The marginal loss of Micro scores increases (from 4 to 6 to 8 to 22 to 60) for each additional hour of History. Therefore, the opportunity cost increases."
        },
        {
          "step": "Part (d): Total Score Maximization",
          "explanation": "Calculate the sum for all combinations: (5M,0H)=100; (4M,1H)=136; (3M,2H)=150; (2M,3H)=154; (1M,4H)=137; (0M,5H)=80. The maximum sum is 154."
        },
        {
          "step": "Part (e): Marginal Analysis for 6th Hour",
          "explanation": "Starting from 2M/3H, the 6th hour could be the 3rd hour of Micro (MB = 90 - 82 = 8 points) or the 4th hour of History (MB = 77 - 72 = 5 points). Since 8 > 5, she chooses Microeconomics."
        }
      ],

  "problem": "A country can produce only two goods: laptops and textbooks. The table below shows the maximum output combinations that can be produced with full employment of resources.\n\n(a) Calculate the opportunity cost of producing the 2nd laptop.\n(b) Identify whether the opportunity cost of laptops is increasing, constant, or decreasing, and explain.\n(c) If the economy is currently producing 3 laptops and 9 textbooks, determine whether this point is efficient, inefficient, or unattainable.\n(d) Suppose a technological improvement occurs in laptop production only. Illustrate and explain how the PPF changes.\n(e) Explain how this scenario demonstrates the concept of scarcity.",
  "image": "images/fundecon2.png",
  "step_by_step": [
    {
      "step": "Part (a): Opportunity Cost Calculation",
      "explanation": "To find the opportunity cost of the 2nd laptop, compare textbook production at 1 laptop (14) vs 2 laptops (12). The difference is $14 - 12 = 2$ textbooks."
    },
    {
      "step": "Part (b): Identifying the Pattern",
      "explanation": "The opportunity cost is increasing. The cost of each additional laptop rises sequentially (1, 2, 3, 4, then 5 textbooks). This is due to the Law of Increasing Opportunity Costs, where resources are specialized and not perfectly adaptable to both goods."
    },
    {
      "step": "Part (c): Efficiency Analysis",
      "explanation": "The point (3, 9) is efficient. According to the table, 9 textbooks is the maximum possible output when 3 laptops are produced. Since the economy is producing on its maximum frontier, it is efficient."
    },
    {
      "step": "Part (d): Technological Shift",
      "explanation": "A technological improvement in laptops causes an outward pivot of the PPF along the laptop axis. The maximum textbooks (y-intercept) stays at 15, while the maximum laptops (x-intercept) moves to the right."
    },
    {
      "step": "Part (e): Demonstrating Scarcity",
      "explanation": "Scarcity is shown by the existence of the frontier itself and the necessary trade-offs. Because resources are finite, the country cannot produce beyond the curve, and obtaining more of one good requires sacrificing some of the other."
    }
  ],
  "final_answer": "(a) 2 textbooks; (b) Increasing opportunity cost due to resource specialization; (c) Efficient (it lies on the PPF); (d) Outward pivot on the laptop axis; (e) Shown by the limit of the frontier and the need for trade-offs."

(b) If the country is at Combination C, what is the 'per unit' opportunity cost of moving to Combination D?

    {
      "step": "Part (a): Total Opportunity Cost",
      "explanation": "At 0 Robots, the economy produces 100 Pizza. At 3 Robots (Point D), it produces 55 Pizza. The total opportunity cost is the total amount sacrificed to reach that level: $100 - 55 = 45$ units of Pizza."
    },
    {
      "step": "Part (b): Marginal (Per Unit) Opportunity Cost",
      "explanation": "Moving from Combination C (2 Robots) to Combination D (3 Robots) represents a gain of 1 Robot. To get this specific unit, Pizza production falls from 75 to 55. Therefore, the marginal cost is exactly 20 units of Pizza."
    },
    {
      "step": "Part (d): Law of Increasing Opportunity Costs",
      "explanation": "The table shows that each additional Robot costs more Pizza than the last (10, 15, 20, 25, 30). This is the Law of Increasing Opportunity Costs, caused by the fact that resources are not equally efficient at producing both goods."
    },
    {
      "step": "Part (d): Investment and Economic Growth",
      "explanation": "Combination E produces 4 Robots, while Combination B produces only 1. Since Robots are Capital Goods used to create more production capacity, choosing E will cause the PPF to shift outward much more significantly in the future than choosing B would."
    },
    {
      "step": "Part (e): Scarcity and Unattainability",
      "explanation": "Any point above the curve (e.g., 4 Robots and 80 Pizza) is unattainable. Scarcity means that given current technology and a fixed supply of resources, the economy is physically limited to the production combinations on or inside the frontier."
    }
  ],
  "final_answer": "(a) 45 units of Pizza; (b) 20 units of Pizza; (c) Law of Increasing Opportunity Costs; (d) Choice E results in a larger future outward shift of the PPF; (e) Any point outside the curve is unattainable due to scarcity."
