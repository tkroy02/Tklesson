      "problem": "Nirali has 5 hours to study for Microeconomics and History. Based on the provided tables showing her expected scores: \n(a) Calculate her gain from the second hour spent studying history. \n(b) Calculate the opportunity cost of the second hour spent studying history. \n(c) Assume Nirali increases the time she allocates to studying history. What happens to the opportunity cost of studying history? Explain. \n(d) Assume Nirali has a goal of maximizing the sum of her test scores. How many hours should she study for each exam? \n(e) If Nirali's tennis practice is canceled, freeing up an additional hour (6 total), will she allocate it to Microeconomics or History to maximize her total scores? Explain using marginal analysis.",

        {
          "step": "Part (a): Marginal Benefit of History",
          "explanation": "The gain from the second hour is the marginal score increase. Studying History for 1 hour gives a score of 40; 2 hours gives 60. Gain = 60 - 40 = 20 points."
        },
        {
          "step": "Part (b): Opportunity Cost calculation",
          "explanation": "With 5 hours total, to spend a 2nd hour on History, Nirali must reduce Microeconomics study from 4 hours to 3 hours. Her Micro score drops from 96 to 90. Opportunity cost = 96 - 90 = 6 points."
        },
        {
          "step": "Part (c): Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost",
          "explanation": "As she studies more History, she studies less Micro. The marginal loss of Micro scores increases (from 4 to 6 to 8 to 22 to 60) for each additional hour of History. Therefore, the opportunity cost increases."

          "step": "Part (e): Marginal Analysis for 6th Hour",
          "explanation": "Starting from 2M/3H, the 6th hour could be the 3rd hour of Micro (MB = 90 - 82 = 8 points) or the 4th hour of History (MB = 77 - 72 = 5 points). Since 8 > 5, she chooses Microeconomics."
