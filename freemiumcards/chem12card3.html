    { question: "What is **base hydrolysis (saponification)** of esters?", answer: "Ester reacts with a base (usually $NaOH$) to form a carboxylate salt and alcohol (irreversible). $R-COO-R' + NaOH \\rightarrow R-COONa + R'-OH$" },
    { question: "What is **saponification**?", answer: "The base hydrolysis of fats or oils (which are esters) to produce soap (fatty acid salts) and glycerol" },
    { question: "What is the structure of a **fat or oil**?", answer: "A triester of glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol) with three long-chain carboxylic acids (fatty acids); also called triglycerides" },

    { question: "How does **soap clean**?", answer: "The hydrophobic tail dissolves in grease/oil, while the hydrophilic head remains in water; micelles form and are washed away, removing dirt." },
    { question: "What is a **micelle**?", answer: "A spherical cluster of soap molecules in water, with hydrophobic tails pointing inward and hydrophilic heads pointing outward; traps oil and dirt." },
    { question: "What is **acid anhydride**?", answer: "A compound formed by removing water from two carboxylic acid molecules; general formula $(RCO)_2O$; more reactive than carboxylic acids." },
