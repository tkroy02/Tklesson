  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **work** in physics?", answer: "The energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement." },
    { question: "What is the formula for work?", answer: "$$W = Fd\\cos\\theta$$" },
    { question: "When is **work** done?", answer: "When a force causes a displacement, and the force has a component in the direction of the displacement." },
    { question: "What is the unit of work?", answer: "The Joule (J)." },
    { question: "What is the **work-energy theorem**?", answer: "The net work done on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy ($$W_{net} = \\Delta E_k$$)." },
    { question: "What is **energy**?", answer: "The ability to do work." },
    { question: "What is **kinetic energy**?", answer: "The energy of motion." },
    { question: "What is the formula for kinetic energy?", answer: "$$E_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$" },
    { question: "What is **potential energy**?", answer: "Stored energy due to an object's position or configuration." },
    { question: "What is **gravitational potential energy**?", answer: "Energy stored in an object due to its height in a gravitational field." },
    { question: "What is the formula for gravitational potential energy?", answer: "$$E_p = mgh$$" },
    { question: "What is **elastic potential energy**?", answer: "Energy stored in a deformed elastic object, like a stretched spring." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Conservation of Energy**?", answer: "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another." },
    { question: "What is **mechanical energy**?", answer: "The sum of an object's kinetic and potential energy ($$ME = E_k + E_p$$)." },
    { question: "What is **power**?", answer: "The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred." },
    { question: "What is the formula for power?", answer: "$$P = \\frac{W}{t}$$" },
    { question: "What is the unit of power?", answer: "The Watt (W)." },
    { question: "What is another formula for power, in terms of force and velocity?", answer: "$$P = Fv$$" },
    { question: "When is negative work done on an object?", answer: "When the force is applied in the direction opposite to the displacement (e.g., friction)." },
    { question: "What is the kinetic energy of a stationary object?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "What is the gravitational potential energy of an object at ground level?", answer: "Zero (assuming the ground is the reference height)." },
    { question: "How does a car's kinetic energy change if its speed is doubled?", answer: "Its kinetic energy increases by a factor of four ($$E_k \\propto v^2$$)." },
    { question: "What is the work done by the force of gravity on an object sliding horizontally?", answer: "Zero, because gravity is perpendicular to the displacement." },
    { question: "If a person lifts a box from the floor to a table, what is the work done by the person?", answer: "Positive work, as the force and displacement are in the same direction." },
    { question: "If a person lowers a box from a table to the floor, what is the work done by gravity?", answer: "Positive work, as the force and displacement are in the same direction (downward)." },
    { question: "What is the work done by gravity on a satellite in a circular orbit around Earth?", answer: "Zero, because the gravitational force is perpendicular to the satellite's displacement." },
    { question: "Why does the Law of Conservation of Energy appear to be violated when a moving object slows down?", answer: "The mechanical energy is converted into other forms, like thermal energy due to friction." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between horsepower (hp) and watts (W)?", answer: "1 horsepower is equal to approximately 746 watts." },
    { question: "What is **1 kilowatt-hour** a measure of?", answer: "Electric energy, commonly used for billing." },
    { question: "What is the efficiency of a machine?", answer: "The ratio of useful work output to total energy input." },
    { question: "Why is the efficiency of any real machine always less than 100%?", answer: "Because some energy is always converted to a non-useful form, like heat due to friction." },
    { question: "If a machine does a lot of work in a short amount of time, is its power high or low?", answer: "High, because power is inversely proportional to time." },
    { question: "A force is applied to a wall, but the wall does not move. How much work is done?", answer: "Zero, because there is no displacement." },
    { question: "What happens to the kinetic and potential energy of a falling object (ignoring air resistance)?", answer: "Potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but the total mechanical energy remains constant." },
    { question: "In a swinging pendulum, where is the kinetic energy maximum?", answer: "At the lowest point of its swing." },
    { question: "In a swinging pendulum, where is the gravitational potential energy maximum?", answer: "At the highest points of its swing." },
    { question: "What is the **conservation of mechanical energy**?", answer: "In a system where only conservative forces (like gravity) are at work, the total mechanical energy remains constant." },
    { question: "Why is work done on a spring a type of potential energy?", answer: "Because the work done to compress or stretch it is stored as elastic potential energy." },
    { question: "What is the difference between positive and negative work?", answer: "Positive work increases an object's energy; negative work decreases an object's energy." },
    { question: "What does a negative change in potential energy mean?", answer: "The potential energy has decreased, meaning the object has lost energy, usually converted to kinetic energy." }
