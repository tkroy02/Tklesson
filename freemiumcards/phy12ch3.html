  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What are the two conditions for an object to be in **Simple Harmonic Motion** (SHM)?", answer: "The restoring force must be directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, and the restoring force must act in the opposite direction of the displacement." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the restoring force in a mass-spring system?", answer: "$$F = -kx$$ (Hooke's Law)" },
    { question: "What is the **period** of an oscillation?", answer: "The time it takes for one complete cycle or oscillation." },
    { question: "What is the **frequency** of an oscillation?", answer: "The number of cycles or oscillations that occur per unit of time." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between period and frequency?", answer: "$$T = \\frac{1}{f}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the period of a mass-spring system?", answer: "$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$$" },
    { question: "How does increasing the mass affect the period of a mass-spring system?", answer: "The period increases, as it is directly proportional to the square root of the mass." },
    { question: "How does using a stiffer spring affect the period of a mass-spring system?", answer: "The period decreases, as it is inversely proportional to the square root of the spring constant ($$k$$)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the period of a simple pendulum?", answer: "$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}$$" },
    { question: "How does increasing the length of a pendulum affect its period?", answer: "The period increases, as it is directly proportional to the square root of the length." },
    { question: "How does the mass of the bob affect the period of a simple pendulum?", answer: "It does not affect the period." },
    { question: "In SHM, where is the object's **kinetic energy** at a maximum?", answer: "At the equilibrium position, where velocity is at a maximum." },
    { question: "In SHM, where is the object's **potential energy** at a maximum?", answer: "At the points of maximum displacement (amplitude), where the restoring force is greatest." },
    { question: "What is **damping** in an oscillation?", answer: "The dissipation of energy from an oscillating system due to forces like friction or air resistance, causing the amplitude to decrease over time." },
    { question: "What is **underdamped oscillation**?", answer: "An oscillation that slowly decreases in amplitude but still completes several cycles." },
    { question: "What is **overdamped oscillation**?", answer: "An oscillation that returns to equilibrium without oscillating at all, taking a long time to do so." },
    { question: "What is **critical damping**?", answer: "The fastest return to equilibrium without any oscillation, an ideal state for many systems like car shocks and door closers." },
    { question: "What is a **forced oscillation**?", answer: "An oscillation that is maintained by a periodic external force." },
    { question: "What is **resonance**?", answer: "The large increase in amplitude that occurs when the frequency of a forced oscillation is equal to the system's natural frequency." },
    { question: "Give a famous example of resonance causing a large-scale structural failure.", answer: "The collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940." },
    { question: "How do musical instruments use resonance?", answer: "They use resonance to amplify sound by forcing air inside a tube or a vibrating string to oscillate at its natural frequency." },
    { question: "What is the **angular frequency** ($$\\omega$$) of an oscillation?", answer: "The rate of change of the angular position of a system in SHM. It is related to frequency by $$\\omega = 2\\pi f$$." },
    { question: "What is the formula for maximum velocity in SHM?", answer: "$$v_{max} = A\\omega$$ where $$A$$ is amplitude." },
    { question: "What is the total energy of an undamped mass-spring system?", answer: "The sum of its kinetic and potential energy, which remains constant ($$E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$$)." },
    { question: "What is a **transverse wave**?", answer: "A wave in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation (e.g., a wave on a string)." },
    { question: "What is a **longitudinal wave**?", answer: "A wave in which the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation (e.g., sound waves)." },
    { question: "What is a **standing wave**?", answer: "A wave pattern that remains in a constant position, formed by the superposition of two waves traveling in opposite directions." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a wave and an oscillation?", answer: "An oscillation is a single point moving back and forth, while a wave is a disturbance that transfers energy through a medium." },
    { question: "What is a **node** in a standing wave?", answer: "A point that remains at rest and has zero amplitude." },
    { question: "What is an **antinode** in a standing wave?", answer: "A point of maximum amplitude." },
    { question: "What happens to the period of a pendulum if it is taken to the Moon?", answer: "The period increases because the acceleration due to gravity ($$g$$) is lower on the Moon." },
    { question: "What is the **amplitude** of an oscillation?", answer: "The maximum displacement or distance moved by a point on a vibrating body or wave, measured from its equilibrium position." },
    { question: "In a mass-spring system, what happens to the period if the spring is stretched further before release?", answer: "The period remains the same, as the period is independent of amplitude." },
    { question: "What is **wave interference**?", answer: "The phenomenon that occurs when two or more waves overlap and combine to form a new wave." },
    { question: "What is **constructive interference**?", answer: "When two waves combine to produce a wave with a larger amplitude." },
    { question: "What is **destructive interference**?", answer: "When two waves combine to produce a wave with a smaller or zero amplitude." },
    { question: "What is a **natural frequency**?", answer: "The frequency at which a system oscillates when disturbed from its equilibrium position." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the natural frequency of a system and resonance?", answer: "Resonance occurs when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency." },
    { question: "How does the total energy of a damped oscillator change?", answer: "It decreases over time as energy is dissipated into the environment." },
    { question: "What is the speed of a wave?", answer: "The product of its frequency and wavelength ($$v = f\\lambda$$)." }
