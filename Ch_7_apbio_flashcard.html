  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What are the three components of a DNA nucleotide?", answer: "A deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base." },
    { question: "What are the four nitrogenous bases in DNA?", answer: "Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T)." },
    { question: "What is the name of the model that describes DNA's structure?", answer: "The **double-helix model**." },
    { question: "What type of bond holds the two strands of the DNA double helix together?", answer: "Weak **hydrogen bonds** between the nitrogenous bases." },
    { question: "What does it mean that DNA replication is **semi-conservative**?", answer: "Each new DNA molecule consists of one old strand (from the parent molecule) and one newly synthesized strand." },
    { question: "What is the role of the enzyme **helicase** in DNA replication?", answer: "It unwinds and unzips the DNA double helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds." },
    { question: "What is the role of the enzyme **DNA polymerase** in replication?", answer: "It adds new nucleotides to the growing DNA strand, building the new strand in the 5' to 3' direction." },
    { question: "What is the role of the enzyme **ligase**?", answer: "It joins the fragments of DNA on the lagging strand together." },
    { question: "What is the **Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**?", answer: "The flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein." },
    { question: "What is **transcription**?", answer: "The synthesis of an RNA molecule from a DNA template." },
    { question: "What is **translation**?", answer: "The synthesis of a polypeptide (protein) from an mRNA template." },
    { question: "Where does transcription occur in a eukaryotic cell?", answer: "In the **nucleus**." },
    { question: "Where does translation occur?", answer: "On the **ribosomes** in the cytoplasm." },
    { question: "What is the role of **mRNA**?", answer: "Messenger RNA carries the genetic message from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm." },
    { question: "What is the role of **tRNA**?", answer: "Transfer RNA carries specific amino acids to the ribosome to be added to the growing polypeptide chain." },
    { question: "What is a **codon**?", answer: "A three-nucleotide sequence on mRNA that codes for a specific amino acid." },
    { question: "What is the start codon for translation?", answer: "**AUG**." },
    { question: "What is the process of **gene regulation**?", answer: "The mechanisms that control which genes are expressed and at what level." },
    { question: "What is a **mutation**?", answer: "A permanent change in the DNA sequence." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a point mutation and a frameshift mutation?", answer: "A point mutation changes a single nucleotide; a frameshift mutation is an insertion or deletion that shifts the reading frame of the codons." },
    { question: "What is an **operon**?", answer: "A cluster of genes in a prokaryote with a single promoter that are transcribed together." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of the **lac operon**?", answer: "To regulate the expression of genes needed to metabolize lactose in bacteria." },
    { question: "How does the lac operon work in the presence of lactose?", answer: "Lactose acts as an inducer, binding to the repressor and inactivating it, allowing transcription to proceed." },
    { question: "How does the lac operon work in the absence of lactose?", answer: "The active repressor protein binds to the operator, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of the **trp operon**?", answer: "To regulate the expression of genes needed to synthesize tryptophan." },
    { question: "How does the trp operon work in the presence of tryptophan?", answer: "Tryptophan acts as a corepressor, binding to the repressor and activating it, which then blocks transcription." },
    { question: "What is a **promoter** in gene regulation?", answer: "A specific DNA sequence where RNA polymerase binds and initiates transcription." },
    { question: "What is a **transcription factor**?", answer: "A protein that binds to DNA and regulates gene expression, common in eukaryotes." },
    { question: "What is the function of **histone modification** in eukaryotic gene regulation?", answer: "Adding or removing chemical groups to histones can either loosen or tighten DNA packing, affecting access for transcription." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a template strand and a coding strand of DNA?", answer: "The template strand is the one used by RNA polymerase to synthesize mRNA; the coding strand has the same sequence as the mRNA (with T instead of U)." },
    { question: "What is the function of **RNA polymerase** in transcription?", answer: "It unzips the DNA and adds complementary RNA nucleotides to build the mRNA strand." },
    { question: "What is a **start codon** and a **stop codon**?", answer: "A start codon signals the beginning of translation; a stop codon signals the end of translation." },
    { question: "What is **post-transcriptional regulation**?", answer: "Control of gene expression that occurs after transcription, such as alternative RNA splicing." },
    { question: "What is **alternative splicing**?", answer: "The process by which different mRNA molecules are produced from the same primary transcript, allowing one gene to code for multiple proteins." },
    { question: "What is a **ribosome** made of?", answer: "Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins." },
    { question: "What is the role of a **repressor** protein?", answer: "To prevent or reduce gene transcription by binding to the operator region of an operon." },
    { question: "What is the function of **Okazaki fragments**?", answer: "Short segments of DNA synthesized on the lagging strand during DNA replication." },
    { question: "What is the role of the **operator** in an operon?", answer: "A DNA segment that serves as a binding site for the repressor protein." },
    { question: "What is a **silent mutation**?", answer: "A mutation that changes a codon but does not change the amino acid it codes for, so there is no change in the protein." },
    { question: "What is the final product of translation?", answer: "A polypeptide chain (a protein)." }
