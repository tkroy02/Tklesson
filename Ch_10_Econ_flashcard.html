  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **fiscal policy**?", answer: "The use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy's performance." },
    { question: "What is the primary goal of **expansionary fiscal policy**?", answer: "To stimulate the economy during a recession by increasing government spending or cutting taxes." },
    { question: "What is the primary goal of **contractionary fiscal policy**?", answer: "To slow down an economy during a period of high inflation by decreasing government spending or raising taxes." },
    { question: "What is a **budget deficit**?", answer: "A situation where a government's spending exceeds its revenue (taxes) in a given fiscal year." },
    { question: "What is **national debt**?", answer: "The total accumulation of a country's budget deficits over time." },
    { question: "What are some examples of government spending?", answer: "Spending on infrastructure (roads), defense, education, and social programs." },
    { question: "What are the two main types of taxes?", answer: "Direct taxes (on income and wealth) and indirect taxes (on goods and services)." },
    { question: "How can fiscal policy affect aggregate demand?", answer: "An increase in government spending or a decrease in taxes shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right." },
    { question: "What is the **crowding-out effect**?", answer: "A situation where increased government spending financed by borrowing leads to higher interest rates and a reduction in private investment." },
    { question: "What is the **Keynesian multiplier**?", answer: "The idea that an initial change in spending (by government or consumers) can lead to a much larger change in national income." },
    { question: "What is an **automatic stabilizer**?", answer: "A feature of the tax and transfer system that automatically works to stabilize the economy without deliberate government action (e.g., unemployment benefits)." },
    { question: "What is a major potential problem with fiscal policy?", answer: "It can be subject to significant time lags (recognition, administrative, and impact lags), which can make it difficult to implement effectively." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **progressive tax** and a **regressive tax**?", answer: "A progressive tax takes a larger percentage of income from high-income earners, while a regressive tax takes a larger percentage from low-income earners." },
    { question: "What is a **balanced budget**?", answer: "A situation where government revenues are equal to government spending in a fiscal year." },
    { question: "How can a government finance a budget deficit?", answer: "By borrowing money, typically by selling government bonds to the public." },
    { question: "What are the potential consequences of high national debt?", answer: "Higher interest payments, a potential burden on future generations, and a risk to a country's credit rating." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between fiscal policy and monetary policy?", answer: "They are the two primary tools used by governments to manage the economy, often used in conjunction." },
    { question: "What is **discretionary fiscal policy**?", answer: "Fiscal policy that involves intentional changes in government spending or taxes to influence the economy, as opposed to automatic stabilizers." },
    { question: "How do tax cuts affect the economy?", answer: "They increase consumers' disposable income, which can lead to increased consumption and investment, stimulating the economy." },
    { question: "What is the **Ricardian equivalence** theory?", answer: "The idea that taxpayers will anticipate future tax increases to pay for current deficits and will therefore save more, negating the stimulative effect of the deficit." }
