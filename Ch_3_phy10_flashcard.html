    { question: "What is the formula for the conservation of mechanical energy?", answer: "$$KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$$" },
    { question: "What is the **work-energy theorem**?", answer: "The net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the work-energy theorem?", answer: "$$W_{net} = \\Delta KE$$" },
    { question: "What is **power**?", answer: "The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred." },

    { question: "Can work be done on an object at rest?", answer: "No, because there is no displacement." },
    { question: "When an object is lifted at a constant velocity, what is the net work done on it?", answer: "Zero, because there is no change in kinetic energy." },
