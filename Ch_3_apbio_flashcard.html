  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **ATP**?", answer: "Adenosine triphosphate, the main energy currency of a cell." },
    { question: "How does ATP store energy?", answer: "In the chemical bonds between its three phosphate groups. The breaking of the outermost bond releases a large amount of energy." },
    { question: "What is **energy coupling**?", answer: "The use of an exergonic (energy-releasing) process to drive an endergonic (energy-requiring) one." },
    { question: "What is the overall equation for **photosynthesis**?", answer: "$6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \\text{light energy} \\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$." },
    { question: "Where in a plant cell does photosynthesis take place?", answer: "In the **chloroplasts**." },
    { question: "What are the two main stages of photosynthesis?", answer: "The **light-dependent reactions** and the **Calvin cycle** (or light-independent reactions)." },
    { question: "What is the primary function of the light-dependent reactions?", answer: "To convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH)." },
    { question: "What is the primary function of the Calvin cycle?", answer: "To use the ATP and NADPH from the light reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose." },
    { question: "What is the overall equation for **cellular respiration**?", answer: "$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \\rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \\text{ATP}$." },
    { question: "Where in a cell does cellular respiration take place?", answer: "Primarily in the **mitochondria**." },
    { question: "What are the three main stages of aerobic cellular respiration?", answer: "**Glycolysis**, the **Krebs cycle** (or citric acid cycle), and **oxidative phosphorylation**." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of glycolysis?", answer: "To split one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of the Krebs cycle?", answer: "To complete the breakdown of pyruvate and release energy in the form of ATP, NADH, and $FADH_2$." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of oxidative phosphorylation?", answer: "To use the NADH and $FADH_2$ from previous steps to create a proton gradient and generate a large amount of ATP." },
    { question: "What is the final electron acceptor in aerobic cellular respiration?", answer: "**Oxygen ($O_2$)**." },
    { question: "What happens in a cell when oxygen is not available?", answer: "It undergoes **fermentation**, which allows glycolysis to continue producing a small amount of ATP." },
    { question: "What is the difference between alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation?", answer: "Alcoholic fermentation produces ethanol and carbon dioxide; lactic acid fermentation produces lactic acid." },
    { question: "What is a **photoautotroph**?", answer: "An organism that uses light to synthesize organic molecules (e.g., plants, algae)." },
    { question: "What is a **chemoheterotroph**?", answer: "An organism that obtains energy by consuming other organisms (e.g., animals, fungi)." },
    { question: "What is the pigment responsible for absorbing light energy in photosynthesis?", answer: "**Chlorophyll**." },
    { question: "What is the waste product of photosynthesis?", answer: "Oxygen ($O_2$) gas." },
    { question: "What is the waste product of aerobic cellular respiration?", answer: "Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and water ($H_2O$)." },
    { question: "What is the role of the electron transport chain in photosynthesis?", answer: "To use the energy from electrons to pump protons and create a proton gradient for ATP synthesis." },
    { question: "What is the role of the electron transport chain in cellular respiration?", answer: "To use the energy from electrons to pump protons into the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient." },
    { question: "What enzyme synthesizes ATP using the proton gradient?", answer: "**ATP synthase**." },
    { question: "What is **NADH** and **$FADH_2$**?", answer: "Electron carriers that transport high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain." },
    { question: "What is the process of splitting water molecules during photosynthesis?", answer: "**Photolysis**." },
    { question: "What is **photophosphorylation**?", answer: "The process of generating ATP from ADP and phosphate by using light energy." },
    { question: "What is **oxidative phosphorylation**?", answer: "The process of generating ATP from ADP and phosphate by using the energy from the oxidation of electron carriers." },
    { question: "In photosynthesis, where do the light-dependent reactions occur?", answer: "In the **thylakoid membranes** of the chloroplasts." },
    { question: "In photosynthesis, where does the Calvin cycle occur?", answer: "In the **stroma** of the chloroplasts." },
    { question: "In cellular respiration, where does glycolysis occur?", answer: "In the **cytoplasm**." },
    { question: "In cellular respiration, where does the Krebs cycle occur?", answer: "In the **mitochondrial matrix**." },
    { question: "In cellular respiration, where does oxidative phosphorylation occur?", answer: "In the **inner mitochondrial membrane**." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of fermentation from the perspective of glycolysis?", answer: "To regenerate **$NAD^+$** from NADH so that glycolysis can continue to produce ATP." },
    { question: "What is the net gain of ATP from one molecule of glucose during glycolysis?", answer: "2 ATP." },
    { question: "What is the net gain of ATP from one molecule of glucose during the Krebs cycle?", answer: "2 ATP (one for each pyruvate)." },
    { question: "Why is the total ATP yield from cellular respiration an estimate (around 32-38 ATP)?", answer: "Because the number of ATPs produced per NADH and $FADH_2$ can vary, and some energy is used for transport." },
    { question: "What is the first step of the Calvin cycle?", answer: "**Carbon fixation**, where $CO_2$ is incorporated into an organic molecule." },
    { question: "What is the main purpose of photosynthesis from a biological perspective?", answer: "To convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, which can be used by the plant and by organisms that eat the plant." }
