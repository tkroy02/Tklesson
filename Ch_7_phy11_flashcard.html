  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **thermodynamics**?", answer: "The branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation, and the physical properties of matter." },
    { question: "What is the **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**?", answer: "If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other." },
    { question: "What is **temperature**?", answer: "A measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance." },
    { question: "What is **heat**?", answer: "The transfer of thermal energy from one system to another due to a temperature difference." },
    { question: "What are the three methods of **heat transfer**?", answer: "Conduction, convection, and radiation." },
    { question: "What is **conduction**?", answer: "Heat transfer through direct contact, without the movement of the material itself." },
    { question: "What is **convection**?", answer: "Heat transfer through the movement of fluids (liquids or gases)." },
    { question: "What is **radiation**?", answer: "Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves, which can occur through a vacuum." },
    { question: "What is **internal energy**?", answer: "The total energy of all the particles within a substance, including both kinetic and potential energy." },
    { question: "What is the **First Law of Thermodynamics**?", answer: "The change in a system's internal energy is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system ($$\\Delta U = Q - W$$)." },
    { question: "What is the symbol for heat added to a system?", answer: "$$Q$$" },
    { question: "What is the symbol for work done by a system?", answer: "$$W$$" },
    { question: "What is **specific heat capacity**?", answer: "The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius." },
    { question: "What is the formula for heat absorbed or released during a temperature change?", answer: "$$Q = mc\\Delta T$$" },
    { question: "What is **latent heat**?", answer: "The energy absorbed or released during a phase change without a change in temperature." },
    { question: "What is **latent heat of fusion**?", answer: "The energy required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid at its melting point." },
    { question: "What is **latent heat of vaporization**?", answer: "The energy required to change a substance from a liquid to a gas at its boiling point." },
    { question: "What is **entropy**?", answer: "A measure of the disorder or randomness in a system." },
    { question: "What is the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**?", answer: "The total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time." },
    { question: "What is the Kelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics?", answer: "It is impossible to create a heat engine that operates in a cycle and converts all heat into work." },
    { question: "What is a **heat engine**?", answer: "A device that converts thermal energy into mechanical work." },
    { question: "What is the **Third Law of Thermodynamics**?", answer: "The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero." },
    { question: "What is **absolute zero**?", answer: "The theoretical temperature at which all particle motion ceases ($$0\\text{ K}$$ or $$-273.15°\\text{C}$$)." },
    { question: "How does a refrigerator work?", answer: "It transfers heat from a cold reservoir (inside) to a hot reservoir (outside) using work." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the efficiency of a heat engine?", answer: "$$\\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{W}{Q_H}$$" },
    { question: "What is **Carnot efficiency**?", answer: "The maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two temperatures." },
    { question: "What is the formula for Carnot efficiency?", answer: "$$\\text{Efficiency}_{Carnot} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}$$ where T is in Kelvin." },
    { question: "Does a substance's temperature change during a phase change?", answer: "No, the added energy is used to break intermolecular bonds." },
    { question: "Why does sweat cool the human body?", answer: "When sweat evaporates (phase change), it absorbs latent heat of vaporization from the body, cooling it down." },
    { question: "If work is done on a system, is $$W$$ in the First Law of Thermodynamics positive or negative?", answer: "Negative. The work is done on the system, not by it, so $$W$$ is negative." },
    { question: "Why is a good radiator of heat also a good absorber?", answer: "According to the principles of radiation, a surface that emits radiation efficiently also absorbs it efficiently." },
    { question: "What is the specific heat capacity of water?", answer: "Approximately $$4186\\text{ J/(kg·°C)}$$." },
    { question: "Why does sand get hotter than water on a sunny beach?", answer: "Sand has a lower specific heat capacity than water, so it requires less energy to increase its temperature." },
    { question: "What happens to the internal energy of an ideal gas when its temperature is increased?", answer: "Its internal energy increases." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a spontaneous and a non-spontaneous process?", answer: "A spontaneous process increases the entropy of the universe, while a non-spontaneous one requires energy input to occur." },
    { question: "What does the Second Law of Thermodynamics imply about energy transformations?", answer: "Some energy is always lost as unusable heat, so no process can be 100% efficient." },
    { question: "What happens to the entropy of a substance as it changes from solid to liquid to gas?", answer: "It increases, because the particles become more disordered." },
    { question: "What is a **cyclic process** in thermodynamics?", answer: "A process in which a system returns to its initial state." },
    { question: "If heat is added to a system but no work is done, what happens to its internal energy?", answer: "It increases by an amount equal to the added heat ($$\\Delta U = Q$$)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a heat engine and a heat pump?", answer: "A heat engine converts heat to work, while a heat pump uses work to transfer heat." }
