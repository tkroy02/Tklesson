  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the key principle of Darwin's theory of natural selection?", answer: "Individuals with inherited traits better suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce." },
    { question: "How is **genetic variation** important for natural selection?", answer: "It provides the raw material for evolution; without it, there would be no differences for selection to act upon." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **phenotypic adaptation** and a **genotypic adaptation**?", answer: "A phenotypic adaptation is a temporary, non-heritable change (e.g., getting a tan); a genotypic adaptation is a heritable change in a trait over generations." },
    { question: "Define **directional selection**.", answer: "A mode of natural selection that favors individuals at one extreme of a phenotypic range, shifting the population's trait distribution in that direction." },
    { question: "Define **stabilizing selection**.", answer: "A mode of natural selection that favors intermediate phenotypes and acts against extreme variants, narrowing the range of variation." },
    { question: "Define **disruptive selection**.", answer: "A mode of natural selection that favors individuals at both extremes of a phenotypic range over individuals with intermediate phenotypes." },
    { question: "What is **speciation**?", answer: "The process by which one species splits into two or more new species." },
    { question: "What is the difference between **allopatric** and **sympatric** speciation?", answer: "Allopatric speciation occurs when a population is geographically isolated; sympatric speciation occurs within the same geographic area." },
    { question: "What are **prezygotic barriers**?", answer: "Reproductive isolating mechanisms that prevent different species from interbreeding or from forming a zygote." },
    { question: "What are some examples of **prezygotic barriers**?", answer: "Habitat isolation, temporal isolation (mating at different times), behavioral isolation, mechanical isolation, and gametic isolation." },
    { question: "What are **postzygotic barriers**?", answer: "Reproductive isolating mechanisms that prevent a hybrid zygote from developing into a fertile adult." },
    { question: "What are some examples of **postzygotic barriers**?", answer: "Reduced hybrid viability (the hybrid fails to develop or dies), reduced hybrid fertility (the hybrid is sterile), and hybrid breakdown." },
    { question: "What is a **phylogenetic tree** or **cladogram**?", answer: "A diagram representing a hypothesis about the evolutionary relationships among a group of organisms." },
    { question: "On a phylogenetic tree, what does a **branch point** or **node** represent?", answer: "The most recent common ancestor of the lineages branching from that point." },
    { question: "What is a **clade**?", answer: "A group of species that includes an ancestral species and all of its descendants." },
    { question: "What is a **shared derived character**?", answer: "A unique feature that arose in a specific lineage and is shared by all of its members, but not by their ancestors." },
    { question: "What is **adaptive radiation**?", answer: "The rapid evolution of many new species from a single common ancestor when they colonize a new area with diverse opportunities." },
    { question: "How does the **fossil record** provide evidence for evolution?", answer: "It shows a historical sequence of organisms, from older, simpler forms to younger, more complex ones, and includes transitional forms." },
    { question: "What are **homologous structures**?", answer: "Anatomical similarities between organisms that indicate a shared ancestry (e.g., the forelimbs of a human, bat, and whale)." },
    { question: "What is **convergent evolution**?", answer: "The process by which unrelated species evolve similar traits because they have to adapt to similar environmental pressures." },
    { question: "How does **biogeography** support the theory of evolution?", answer: "The geographic distribution of species provides evidence of how they have evolved from common ancestors in a particular location." },
    { question: "How does **comparative embryology** provide evidence for evolution?", answer: "Similarities in the embryonic development of different species suggest a shared evolutionary history." },
    { question: "How does **molecular evidence** (DNA/proteins) support evolution?", answer: "The more similar the DNA or protein sequences are between two species, the more recently they shared a common ancestor." },
    { question: "What is **gene flow**?", answer: "The movement of alleles between populations, which can change allele frequencies and reduce genetic differences between populations." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a gene pool and allele frequency?", answer: "The gene pool is all the genes in a population; allele frequency is the proportion of a specific allele in that pool." },
    { question: "What is the **Hardy-Weinberg equation**?", answer: "$$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$" },
    { question: "What does '$p$' represent in the Hardy-Weinberg equation?", answer: "The frequency of the dominant allele in the population." },
    { question: "What does '$q$' represent in the Hardy-Weinberg equation?", answer: "The frequency of the recessive allele in the population." },
    { question: "What does '$2pq$' represent in the Hardy-Weinberg equation?", answer: "The frequency of the heterozygous genotype." },
    { question: "How does **genetic drift** affect a population?", answer: "It can cause random changes in allele frequencies, often leading to a loss of genetic variation, and is more significant in small populations." },
    { question: "What is the difference between the **bottleneck effect** and the **founder effect**?", answer: "The bottleneck effect is a population reduction due to a disaster; the founder effect is a new population started by a few individuals." },
    { question: "What is **coevolution**?", answer: "The process by which two or more species reciprocally influence each other's evolution." },
    { question: "How is a **vestigial structure** evidence of evolution?", answer: "It suggests that the organism's ancestors had a use for the structure, indicating a change in the species over time." },
    { question: "What is the role of **mutations** in evolution?", answer: "Mutations are the ultimate source of new genetic variation, creating new alleles that can be acted on by natural selection." },
    { question: "What is a **molecular clock**?", answer: "A method used to estimate the time of evolutionary divergence between two species based on the number of genetic differences." },
    { question: "What is **punctuated equilibrium**?", answer: "A model of evolution that proposes that species remain relatively unchanged for long periods and then undergo rapid bursts of change." },
    { question: "What is **gradualism**?", answer: "A model of evolution that proposes that species change slowly and steadily over long periods of time." },
    { question: "What is a **species** according to the biological species concept?", answer: "A group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed and produce viable, fertile offspring." },
    { question: "What is **hybrid breakdown**?", answer: "A postzygotic barrier where the first-generation hybrids are fertile, but their offspring are sterile or inviable." },
    { question: "What is **sexual selection**?", answer: "A form of natural selection in which individuals with certain inherited characteristics are more likely than others to obtain mates." }
