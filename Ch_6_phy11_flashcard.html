  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is a **fluid**?", answer: "A substance that flows, such as a liquid or a gas." },
    { question: "What is **density**?", answer: "The mass of a substance per unit volume." },
    { question: "What is the formula for density?", answer: "$$\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$$" },
    { question: "What is **pressure**?", answer: "The force exerted per unit area." },
    { question: "What is the formula for pressure?", answer: "$$P = \\frac{F}{A}$$" },
    { question: "What is the SI unit of pressure?", answer: "The Pascal (Pa)." },
    { question: "What is **atmospheric pressure**?", answer: "The pressure exerted by the weight of the air in the atmosphere." },
    { question: "What does **Pascal's Principle** state?", answer: "A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and to the walls of the container." },
    { question: "What is **hydrostatic pressure**?", answer: "The pressure exerted by a fluid at rest due to the force of gravity." },
    { question: "What is the formula for hydrostatic pressure?", answer: "$$P = \\rho gh$$" },
    { question: "What does **Archimedes' Principle** state?", answer: "The buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces." },
    { question: "What is **buoyancy**?", answer: "The upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object." },
    { question: "What is the formula for buoyant force?", answer: "$$F_b = \\rho_{fluid} V_{displaced} g$$" },
    { question: "Why does an object float?", answer: "Because the buoyant force is greater than or equal to the object's weight." },
    { question: "Why does a steel ship float while a steel ball sinks?", answer: "The ship is hollow, so its average density is less than water. The ball's density is greater than water." },
    { question: "What is a **streamline**?", answer: "The path a particle in a moving fluid follows." },
    { question: "What is **turbulent flow**?", answer: "Irregular flow characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow speed." },
    { question: "What does the **continuity equation** for an incompressible fluid state?", answer: "The product of the cross-sectional area and the flow speed is constant ($$A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$$)." },
    { question: "What does the continuity equation imply for a fluid flowing through a constricted pipe?", answer: "The fluid must speed up in the narrow sections." },
    { question: "What does **Bernoulli's Principle** state?", answer: "Where the velocity of a fluid is high, the pressure is low, and where the velocity is low, the pressure is high." },
    { question: "What is the Bernoulli's Equation for an ideal fluid?", answer: "$$P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 + \\rho gh_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho gh_2$$" },
    { question: "What does Bernoulli's Principle explain?", answer: "Why an airplane wing generates lift." },
    { question: "How does an airplane wing create lift?", answer: "The curved shape causes air to flow faster over the top surface, creating lower pressure there and a net upward force." },
    { question: "What is **viscosity**?", answer: "A fluid's resistance to flow." },
    { question: "Give an example of a fluid with high viscosity.", answer: "Honey." },
    { question: "What is an **ideal fluid**?", answer: "A fluid with no viscosity, no turbulence, and that is incompressible." },
    { question: "What is the unit of density?", answer: "Kilograms per cubic meter ($$kg/m^3$$)." },
    { question: "How does pressure change with depth in a fluid?", answer: "Pressure increases linearly with depth." },
    { question: "What is **surface tension**?", answer: "The property of the surface of a liquid that allows it to resist an external force due to the cohesive nature of its molecules." },
    { question: "Why does a water strider walk on water?", answer: "Because its weight is supported by the surface tension of the water." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the forces in a hydraulic press?", answer: "The ratio of the forces equals the ratio of the piston areas ($$\\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \\frac{F_2}{A_2}$$)." },
    { question: "If an object is suspended in a fluid, with a weight greater than the buoyant force, what happens?", answer: "It sinks." },
    { question: "What happens to the buoyant force on a submerged object as it is lowered to a greater depth?", answer: "It remains the same, because the buoyant force depends on the volume of fluid displaced, not the depth." },
    { question: "What is the difference between gauge pressure and absolute pressure?", answer: "Gauge pressure is relative to atmospheric pressure; absolute pressure includes atmospheric pressure." },
    { question: "What is the principle behind a siphon?", answer: "The combination of pressure difference and gravity." },
    { question: "What is **laminar flow**?", answer: "Smooth, orderly fluid flow in layers or sheets." },
    { question: "Why does the water coming out of a faucet get thinner as it falls?", answer: "As it falls, it gains speed due to gravity. By the continuity equation, as velocity increases, the cross-sectional area must decrease." },
    { question: "What happens to the pressure of a fluid when its speed increases?", answer: "Its pressure decreases." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a liquid and a gas?", answer: "A liquid has a fixed volume but can change shape; a gas has no fixed shape or volume." },
    { question: "What is the role of viscosity in a fluid's motion?", answer: "It resists the fluid's motion, converting kinetic energy into thermal energy." }
