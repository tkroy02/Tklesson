  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the definition of **Uniform Circular Motion**?", answer: "Motion of an object in a circle at a constant speed." },
    { question: "In uniform circular motion, is the velocity constant? Is the speed constant?", answer: "Speed is constant, but velocity is not constant because its direction is always changing." },
    { question: "What is the direction of the velocity vector in uniform circular motion?", answer: "Tangent to the circular path." },
    { question: "What is the direction of the acceleration vector in uniform circular motion?", answer: "Towards the center of the circle (centripetal acceleration)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for **centripetal acceleration**?", answer: "$$a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for **centripetal force**?", answer: "$$F_c = ma_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$$" },
    { question: "Is centripetal force a fundamental force of nature?", answer: "No, it is the net force that causes circular motion; it can be provided by tension, gravity, friction, etc." },
    { question: "If the radius of a circular path is doubled while speed remains constant, what happens to the centripetal acceleration?", answer: "It is halved." },
    { question: "If the speed of an object in circular motion is doubled while the radius is constant, what happens to the centripetal force?", answer: "It becomes four times as large ($$F_c \\propto v^2$$)." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between linear speed ($$v$$) and angular speed ($$\\omega$$)?", answer: "$$v = r\\omega$$" },
    { question: "What is **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**?", answer: "Every particle attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the force of universal gravitation?", answer: "$$F_g = \\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the value of the **universal gravitational constant** ($$G$$)?", answer: "$$6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2$$" },
    { question: "If the distance between two objects is doubled, what happens to the gravitational force between them?", answer: "It decreases to one-fourth of its original value ($$F_g \\propto 1/r^2$$)." },
    { question: "If the mass of one of the objects is doubled, what happens to the gravitational force?", answer: "It doubles." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the gravitational field strength ($$g$$) at a distance $$r$$ from a central mass $$M$$?", answer: "$$g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}$$" },
    { question: "In a stable circular orbit, what force provides the centripetal force?", answer: "The force of gravity." },
    { question: "For an object in orbit around a planet, what is the relationship between centripetal force and gravitational force?", answer: "$$F_c = F_g \\Rightarrow \\frac{mv^2}{r} = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$" },
    { question: "Derive the formula for the speed of a satellite in a circular orbit.", answer: "$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$$" },
    { question: "Does the orbital speed of a satellite depend on its own mass?", answer: "No, the mass of the satellite ($$m$$) cancels out in the derivation of the orbital speed formula." },
    { question: "What is the definition of **orbital period** ($$T$$)?", answer: "The time it takes for a satellite to complete one full revolution around an orbit." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the orbital period in terms of velocity and radius?", answer: "$$T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v}$$" },
    { question: "If a satellite is in a stable orbit, does gravity do work on it?", answer: "No, gravity is always perpendicular to the direction of motion, so no work is done." },
    { question: "In a vertical circular loop, where is the tension in the string or track greatest?", answer: "At the bottom of the loop." },
    { question: "In a vertical circular loop, where is the tension in the string or track smallest?", answer: "At the top of the loop." },
    { question: "What is the minimum speed an object must have at the top of a vertical circular loop to complete the loop?", answer: "The minimum speed is when the normal force or tension becomes zero; $$v = \\sqrt{gr}$$." },
    { question: "What is the force that keeps a car in a horizontal circular turn on a flat road?", answer: "Static friction." },
    { question: "How does the centripetal force on a car in a turn relate to the friction force?", answer: "$$F_{friction} = F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$$" },
    { question: "How does the gravitational force on an object on a planet's surface relate to its weight?", answer: "The force of gravity is the object's weight ($$F_g = mg$$)." },
    { question: "What does the gravitational constant $$G$$ tell us?", answer: "It is a proportionality constant that determines the strength of the gravitational force." },
    { question: "If a satellite's orbital radius is increased, what happens to its orbital period?", answer: "It increases significantly." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the period and radius of an orbit, according to Kepler's Third Law?", answer: "$$T^2 \\propto r^3$$" },
    { question: "What is the direction of the centripetal acceleration vector?", answer: "Always pointing radially inward toward the center of the circle." },
    { question: "What are the two components of the acceleration of an object in non-uniform circular motion?", answer: "Tangential acceleration (due to changing speed) and centripetal acceleration (due to changing direction)." },
    { question: "How does the speed of a satellite change if it moves from a lower to a higher stable orbit?", answer: "Its speed decreases." },
    { question: "For an object to be in a stable orbit, what must be true about the direction of its velocity and the force of gravity?", answer: "Its velocity vector must be perpendicular to the force of gravity vector." },
    { question: "What is a **geosynchronous orbit**?", answer: "An orbit where a satellite's orbital period matches the Earth's rotational period (24 hours)." },
    { question: "If the period of an orbit is measured in seconds, and the radius in meters, what are the units for the universal gravitational constant $$G$$?", answer: "$$\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2$$." },
    { question: "If a planet's mass is doubled but its radius stays the same, how does its surface gravitational acceleration change?", answer: "It doubles." },
    { question: "Why do astronauts in orbit feel 'weightless'?", answer: "They are in a continuous state of free fall around the Earth, so they don't experience a normal force pushing on them." }
