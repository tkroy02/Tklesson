  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the definition of **linear momentum**?", answer: "The product of an object's mass and its velocity." },
    { question: "What is the formula for momentum?", answer: "$$\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$$" },
    { question: "Is momentum a scalar or a vector quantity?", answer: "It is a **vector** quantity, having both magnitude and direction." },
    { question: "What is the definition of **impulse**?", answer: "The change in momentum of an object." },
    { question: "What is the formula for impulse?", answer: "$$\\vec{J} = \\vec{F}_{avg}\\Delta t$$" },
    { question: "What is the **Impulse-Momentum Theorem**?", answer: "Impulse on an object is equal to the change in its momentum ($$\\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p}$$)." },
    { question: "State the **Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum**.", answer: "The total momentum of a closed, isolated system remains constant." },
    { question: "What is a **closed, isolated system**?", answer: "A system with no external forces acting on it." },
    { question: "In a collision, what is always conserved?", answer: "Linear momentum, as long as the system is isolated." },
    { question: "What is an **elastic collision**?", answer: "A collision in which both linear momentum and kinetic energy are conserved." },
    { question: "What is an **inelastic collision**?", answer: "A collision in which linear momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not." },
    { question: "What is a **perfectly inelastic collision**?", answer: "A type of inelastic collision in which the colliding objects stick together after the collision." },
    { question: "If a bowling ball collides head-on with a stationary bowling pin, what happens to the total momentum of the system?", answer: "The total momentum of the ball-pin system is conserved." },
    { question: "In a perfectly inelastic collision, what happens to the kinetic energy of the system?", answer: "Kinetic energy is lost, often converted into sound, heat, or deformation." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the momentum of a system of multiple objects?", answer: "$$\\vec{p}_{total} = \\sum\\vec{p}_i = m_1\\vec{v}_1 + m_2\\vec{v}_2 + ...$$" },
    { question: "What is the **center of mass** of an object or system?", answer: "The point at which the entire mass of the object or system can be considered to be concentrated." },
    { question: "How does the center of mass of an isolated system move?", answer: "It continues to move with a constant velocity, even if the individual parts of the system are moving." },
    { question: "Why is it safer to extend the time of impact in a collision (e.g., using an airbag)?", answer: "Increasing the time of impact decreases the average force applied to the object, according to the impulse-momentum theorem ($$F_{avg} = \\Delta p/\\Delta t$$)." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between impulse and the change in momentum?", answer: "They are equal: a given impulse will produce a predictable change in momentum." },
    { question: "If two objects of equal mass collide in an elastic collision, what happens to their velocities?", answer: "They exchange velocities." },
    { question: "For an explosion, what is the initial momentum of the system?", answer: "Zero, assuming the system was initially at rest." },
    { question: "Why is it easier to push a car that is already rolling?", answer: "Less force is required to maintain its momentum than to give it the initial impulse from rest." },
    { question: "How does an isolated system's total momentum change during a collision?", answer: "It does not change; it is conserved." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the center of mass of two objects along the x-axis?", answer: "$$x_{cm} = \\frac{m_1x_1 + m_2x_2}{m_1+m_2}$$" },
    { question: "Is momentum conserved in an inelastic collision?", answer: "Yes, momentum is always conserved in a collision if the system is isolated." },
    { question: "What happens to the kinetic energy of the system in a perfectly inelastic collision?", answer: "The loss of kinetic energy is at a maximum." },
    { question: "How does a rocket work, in terms of momentum conservation?", answer: "The rocket expels exhaust gases at high velocity (backward momentum), and to conserve momentum, the rocket gains forward momentum." },
    { question: "If a tennis ball hits a wall and bounces back, is momentum conserved?", answer: "No, because the wall-Earth system is not included; there is an external force from the wall on the ball." },
    { question: "In a collision where two objects stick together, what is their final velocity?", answer: "$$v_f = \\frac{m_1v_1 + m_2v_2}{m_1+m_2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the relationship between Newton's Second Law and momentum?", answer: "$$\\vec{F}_{net} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}$$ (Net force is the rate of change of momentum)." },
    { question: "What is the total momentum of a system of two objects with equal and opposite momenta?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "What is the condition for total momentum to be conserved?", answer: "The net external force on the system must be zero." },
    { question: "For an object sliding on a frictionless surface, is its momentum conserved?", answer: "Yes, because the only external forces (gravity and normal force) are vertical and cancel out, so there is no net horizontal force." },
    { question: "What does the area under a Force vs. Time graph represent?", answer: "Impulse ($$J = F_{avg}\\Delta t$$)." },
    { question: "If a heavy truck and a small car collide, how do their impulses compare?", answer: "They experience an equal and opposite impulse, according to Newton's Third Law and the impulse-momentum theorem." },
    { question: "Is kinetic energy conserved in a perfectly inelastic collision?", answer: "No." },
    { question: "Is momentum conserved in an explosion?", answer: "Yes, assuming the system is isolated." },
    { question: "How is the conservation of momentum different from the conservation of energy?", answer: "Momentum is a vector quantity and is conserved in all isolated collisions, while kinetic energy is a scalar and is only conserved in elastic collisions." },
    { question: "What happens to the kinetic energy of a system during an explosion?", answer: "It increases." },
    { question: "An object is at rest. It breaks into two pieces. What is the total momentum of the two pieces?", answer: "Zero, because momentum is conserved from the initial state." }
