    { question: "What is **momentum**?", answer: "A measure of an object's mass in motion." },
    { question: "What is the formula for momentum?", answer: "$$p = mv$$" },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for momentum?", answer: "Kilogram-meter per second (kg·m/s)." },
    { question: "Is momentum a scalar or vector quantity?", answer: "It is a **vector** quantity." },
    { question: "What is **impulse**?", answer: "The change in momentum of an object." },
    { question: "What is the formula for impulse?", answer: "$$J = F\\Delta t$$" },
    { question: "What is the impulse-momentum theorem?", answer: "Impulse is equal to the change in an object's momentum ($$J = \\Delta p$$)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for impulse?", answer: "Newton-second (N·s) or kg·m/s." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Conservation of Momentum**?", answer: "The total momentum of an isolated system remains constant." },
    { question: "What is an **isolated system**?", answer: "A system with no net external forces acting on it." },
    { question: "What are the two main types of collisions?", answer: "Elastic and inelastic collisions." },
    { question: "In an **elastic collision**, what is conserved?", answer: "Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved." },
    { question: "In an **inelastic collision**, what is conserved?", answer: "Only momentum is conserved; kinetic energy is not." },
    { question: "What is a **perfectly inelastic collision**?", answer: "A collision in which the colliding objects stick together after impact." },
    { question: "What is the formula for conservation of momentum?", answer: "$$\\Sigma p_{initial} = \\Sigma p_{final}$$" },
    { question: "When two objects collide in a perfectly inelastic collision, what is their final velocity?", answer: "They share the same final velocity." },
    { question: "In a collision, what is the change in momentum of object 1 compared to object 2?", answer: "The change in momentum is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction." },
    { question: "What is a **recoil**?", answer: "The backward momentum of an object (e.g., a gun) after firing." },
    { question: "In an explosion, what is the total momentum of the pieces immediately after the explosion?", answer: "The same as the total momentum before the explosion." },
    { question: "If a moving object collides with a stationary object and sticks to it, what type of collision is it?", answer: "Perfectly inelastic." },
    { question: "How does the mass of an object affect its momentum?", answer: "Momentum is directly proportional to mass." },
    { question: "How does the velocity of an object affect its momentum?", answer: "Momentum is directly proportional to velocity." },
    { question: "Can a less massive object have more momentum than a more massive object?", answer: "Yes, if its velocity is high enough." },
    { question: "When is the total momentum of a system not conserved?", answer: "When there is a net external force acting on the system." },
    { question: "What force is responsible for the change in momentum during a collision?", answer: "The impulsive force from the impact." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the impulse of a force and the time it acts?", answer: "Impulse is directly proportional to the time interval." },
    { question: "How can you minimize the force of impact in a collision?", answer: "By increasing the time of the collision (e.g., using a crumple zone)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the total momentum of a system of two objects?", answer: "$$p_{total} = m_1v_1 + m_2v_2$$" },
    { question: "What is the principle of conservation of momentum applied to a recoil?", answer: "The momentum of the gun equals the momentum of the bullet, but in the opposite direction." },
    { question: "What type of collision is a billiard ball hitting another billiard ball?", answer: "Approximately elastic." },
    { question: "What type of collision is a car crash?", answer: "Inelastic." },
    { question: "In an elastic collision, what happens to the total kinetic energy?", answer: "It remains constant." },
    { question: "In an inelastic collision, what happens to the total kinetic energy?", answer: "It decreases." },
    { question: "How is a momentum change related to Newton's Second Law?", answer: "Newton's Second Law can be expressed as $$F_{net} = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$$." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the final velocity in a perfectly inelastic collision?", answer: "$$v_f =$$ <br> $$\\frac{m_1v_{1i} + m_2v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the relative velocity of separation in an elastic collision?", answer: "$$v_{1f} - v_{2f} =$$ <br> $$ -(v_{1i} - v_{2i})$$" },
    { question: "What is a collision?", answer: "An event in which two or more bodies exert forces on each other over a short period of time." },
    { question: "Can an isolated system lose momentum?", answer: "No." },
    { question: "In a collision, why is total momentum conserved?", answer: "The internal forces cancel out, and there are no external forces." },
    { question: "What is the formula for conservation of kinetic energy in an elastic collision?", answer: "$$\\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1i}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2i}^2 =$$ <br> $$\\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2f}^2$$" }
