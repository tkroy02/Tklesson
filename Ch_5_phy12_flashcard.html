  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the source of a **magnetic field**?", answer: "Moving electric charges (currents) or permanent magnets." },
    { question: "What is a **magnetic field line**?", answer: "An imaginary line representing the direction of the magnetic field at any point, tangent to the field at that point." },
    { question: "How do magnetic field lines behave around a magnet?", answer: "They emerge from the north pole and enter the south pole, forming closed loops." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the **magnetic force** on a moving charge?", answer: "$$\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$$, or for magnitude, $$F = |q|vB\\sin\\theta$$." },
    { question: "How do you find the direction of the magnetic force on a positive charge using the **Right-Hand Rule**?", answer: "Point fingers in the direction of velocity ($$\\vec{v}$$), curl towards the magnetic field ($$\\vec{B}$$), and the thumb points in the direction of the force ($$\\vec{F}$$)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire?", answer: "$$\\vec{F} = I(\\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B})$$, or for magnitude, $$F = ILB\\sin\\theta$$." },
    { question: "What is the unit of magnetic field strength?", answer: "The Tesla (T)." },
    { question: "What is **magnetic flux** ($$\\Phi_B$$)?", answer: "The measure of the total number of magnetic field lines passing through a given area." },
    { question: "What is the formula for magnetic flux?", answer: "$$\\Phi_B = BA\\cos\\theta$$" },
    { question: "What is **Faraday's Law of Induction**?", answer: "The induced electromotive force ($$\\mathcal{E}$$) in a closed loop is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop." },
    { question: "What is the formula for Faraday's Law?", answer: "$$\\mathcal{E} = -N\\frac{\\Delta\\Phi_B}{\\Delta t}$$" },
    { question: "What is **Lenz's Law**?", answer: "The direction of the induced current creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it." },
    { question: "When a magnet is moved towards a coil, in what direction does the induced magnetic field point?", answer: "It points away from the magnet to repel its motion, in opposition to the change in flux." },
    { question: "How does a simple electric **generator** work?", answer: "It converts mechanical energy into electrical energy by rotating a coil in a magnetic field, inducing a current." },
    { question: "How does a simple electric **motor** work?", answer: "It converts electrical energy into mechanical energy by using the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field to cause rotation." },
    { question: "What is a **transformer**?", answer: "A device that uses induction to change AC voltage from one level to another." },
    { question: "What is the **transformer equation**?", answer: "$$\\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \\frac{N_s}{N_p}$$" },
    { question: "What is the purpose of a **step-up transformer**?", answer: "To increase voltage by having more turns on the secondary coil than on the primary coil ($$N_s > N_p$$)." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of a **step-down transformer**?", answer: "To decrease voltage by having fewer turns on the secondary coil than on the primary coil ($$N_s < N_p$$)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a current loop?", answer: "$$B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the magnetic field inside a long solenoid?", answer: "$$B = \\mu_0 nI$$ where $$n$$ is the number of turns per unit length." },
    { question: "What is the permeability of free space ($$\\mu_0$$)?", answer: "$$4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ T} \\cdot \\text{m/A}$$" },
    { question: "What is the difference between a DC motor and an AC motor?", answer: "A DC motor requires a commutator to reverse current direction, while an AC motor's current naturally alternates." },
    { question: "What happens to the magnetic force on a charged particle if it moves parallel to the magnetic field?", answer: "The force is zero, because the angle between velocity and the magnetic field is zero." },
    { question: "What type of material is strongly attracted to a magnet?", answer: "**Ferromagnetic** materials, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt." },
    { question: "What is a **paramagnetic** material?", answer: "A material that is weakly attracted to a magnetic field." },
    { question: "What is a **diamagnetic** material?", answer: "A material that is weakly repelled by a magnetic field." },
    { question: "What is an **electromagnet**?", answer: "A type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current." },
    { question: "How can you increase the strength of an electromagnet?", answer: "By increasing the number of turns in the coil, increasing the current, or inserting an iron core." },
    { question: "What is the force on a wire in a magnetic field if the wire is parallel to the field?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "What is a **Hall effect**?", answer: "The production of a voltage difference across an electrical conductor that is transverse to an electric current and to an applied magnetic field." },
    { question: "What is an **eddy current**?", answer: "A circular electrical current induced within conductors by a changing magnetic field." },
    { question: "How does an induction stove work?", answer: "It uses an oscillating magnetic field to induce eddy currents in a metal pot, which then heats up due to the resistance of the metal." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of a **transformer core**?", answer: "To concentrate the magnetic flux lines and improve the efficiency of the transformer." },
    { question: "What happens to the magnetic flux through a coil if the coil is rotated from being perpendicular to a magnetic field to being parallel?", answer: "The flux decreases from a maximum value to zero." },
    { question: "What is the direction of the magnetic field outside a long, straight current-carrying wire?", answer: "It forms concentric circles around the wire, determined by the Right-Hand Grip Rule." },
    { question: "What is the **Right-Hand Grip Rule** for a straight wire?", answer: "Point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the current, and your fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines." },
    { question: "In a transformer, what is the relationship between power in the primary and secondary coils (assuming 100% efficiency)?", answer: "$$P_p = P_s$$ or $$I_p V_p = I_s V_s$$." },
    { question: "What is the phenomenon of **electromagnetic induction**?", answer: "The production of an electromotive force (EMF) across an electrical conductor by its motion in a magnetic field." },
    { question: "What is the maximum force on a charged particle in a magnetic field?", answer: "The maximum force occurs when the velocity of the particle is perpendicular to the magnetic field ($$\\sin\\theta = 1$$)." }
