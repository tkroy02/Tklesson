  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **simple harmonic motion (SHM)**?", answer: "A type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the opposite direction." },
    { question: "What is **Hooke's Law**?", answer: "The force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to its displacement from equilibrium ($$F = -kx$$)." },
    { question: "What is the **equilibrium position** in SHM?", answer: "The position where the net force on the oscillating object is zero." },
    { question: "What is the **amplitude** of an oscillation?", answer: "The maximum displacement or distance moved by a point on a vibrating body or wave measured from its equilibrium position." },
    { question: "What is the **period** of an oscillation?", answer: "The time it takes for one complete cycle of motion." },
    { question: "What is the **frequency** of an oscillation?", answer: "The number of cycles per unit of time." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between period and frequency?", answer: "They are inversely related: $$f = \\frac{1}{T}$$." },
    { question: "Where is the velocity of an oscillator at its maximum in SHM?", answer: "At the equilibrium position." },
    { question: "Where is the velocity of an oscillator at its minimum (zero) in SHM?", answer: "At the points of maximum displacement (amplitude)." },
    { question: "Where is the restoring force at its maximum in SHM?", answer: "At the points of maximum displacement (amplitude)." },
    { question: "What is a **wave**?", answer: "A disturbance that transfers energy through a medium or a vacuum." },
    { question: "What is a **medium**?", answer: "The substance through which a wave travels." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a mechanical wave and an electromagnetic wave?", answer: "A mechanical wave requires a medium to travel (e.g., sound), while an electromagnetic wave does not (e.g., light)." },
    { question: "What is a **transverse wave**?", answer: "A wave in which the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation." },
    { question: "What is a **longitudinal wave**?", answer: "A wave in which the particles of the medium vibrate parallel to the direction of wave propagation." },
    { question: "Give an example of a transverse wave.", answer: "Light waves or waves on a string." },
    { question: "Give an example of a longitudinal wave.", answer: "Sound waves." },
    { question: "What is the **wavelength** ($$\\lambda$$)?", answer: "The distance between two consecutive identical points on a wave, such as two crests or two troughs." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength?", answer: "Wave speed equals frequency times wavelength ($$v = f\\lambda$$)." },
    { question: "What is a **crests** and a **trough**?", answer: "The crest is the highest point of a transverse wave; the trough is the lowest point." },
    { question: "What is **reflection**?", answer: "The bouncing back of a wave when it hits a boundary." },
    { question: "What is **refraction**?", answer: "The bending of a wave as it passes from one medium to another." },
    { question: "What is **diffraction**?", answer: "The bending of a wave as it passes through an opening or around an obstacle." },
    { question: "What is the **principle of superposition**?", answer: "When two or more waves meet, the resulting disturbance is the vector sum of the individual disturbances." },
    { question: "What is **constructive interference**?", answer: "When two waves combine to form a wave with a larger amplitude." },
    { question: "What is **destructive interference**?", answer: "When two waves combine to form a wave with a smaller or zero amplitude." },
    { question: "What are **nodes** and **antinodes**?", answer: "Nodes are points of zero amplitude in a standing wave; antinodes are points of maximum amplitude." },
    { question: "What is a **standing wave**?", answer: "A wave that appears to stand still, created by the interference of two waves traveling in opposite directions." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the period and frequency of a wave?", answer: "They are inversely proportional ($$T = \\frac{1}{f}$$)." },
    { question: "How does the speed of sound change in different mediums?", answer: "It is fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases." },
    { question: "What determines the pitch of a sound?", answer: "The frequency of the sound wave." },
    { question: "What determines the loudness of a sound?", answer: "The amplitude of the sound wave." },
    { question: "What is a **seismic wave**?", answer: "An elastic wave in the Earth produced by an earthquake or other means." },
    { question: "What happens to a wave's frequency when it travels from one medium to another?", answer: "Its frequency remains unchanged." },
    { question: "What happens to a wave's speed and wavelength when it travels from one medium to another?", answer: "They both change." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between potential and kinetic energy in SHM?", answer: "When potential energy is maximum, kinetic energy is zero, and vice versa." },
    { question: "Where is the potential energy of a pendulum at its maximum?", answer: "At the highest points of its swing." },
    { question: "Where is the kinetic energy of a pendulum at its maximum?", answer: "At the lowest point of its swing." },
    { question: "What is the **Doppler Effect**?", answer: "The apparent change in the frequency of a wave due to the relative motion between the source and the observer." },
    { question: "What is the **Doppler effect** for a source moving towards an observer?", answer: "The observer detects a higher frequency." }
