  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What does **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** measure?", answer: "The total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period." },
    { question: "What is the key difference between GDP and **Gross National Product (GNP)**?", answer: "GDP measures production within a country's borders, while GNP measures the production of a country's citizens, regardless of where they are located." },
    { question: "What is the **circular flow of income** model?", answer: "A diagram that shows the flow of money, goods, and services between different sectors of the economy, such as households and firms." },
    { question: "In the simplest circular flow model, what flows from firms to households?", answer: "Wages, rent, interest, and profit (income)." },
    { question: "In the simplest circular flow model, what flows from households to firms?", answer: "Spending on goods and services." },
    { question: "What are **leakages** in the circular flow model?", answer: "Money that leaves the circular flow of income, reducing the amount available for spending (e.g., saving, taxes, and imports)." },
    { question: "What are **injections** in the circular flow model?", answer: "Money that enters the circular flow of income, increasing the amount available for spending (e.g., investment, government spending, and exports)." },
    { question: "What is the equation for GDP using the expenditure approach?", answer: "GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, X is exports, and M is imports." },
    { question: "Why are intermediate goods not included in GDP calculations?", answer: "To avoid double-counting. Only the value of final goods and services is counted." },
    { question: "What is **Nominal GDP**?", answer: "The value of goods and services produced, measured at current market prices." },
    { question: "What is **Real GDP**?", answer: "The value of goods and services produced, adjusted for inflation, to reflect changes in the actual quantity of output." },
    { question: "How do you calculate Real GDP?", answer: "By dividing Nominal GDP by the GDP deflator (a price index)." },
    { question: "What does GDP per capita measure?", answer: "The average economic output per person in a country, often used as a measure of a country's standard of living." },
    { question: "What is the primary difference between Net National Product (NNP) and GNP?", answer: "NNP is GNP minus capital consumption allowance (depreciation)." },
    { question: "What is a major limitation of GDP as a measure of a nation's well-being?", answer: "It does not account for non-market activities (like household production), income distribution, environmental quality, or leisure time." },
    { question: "What happens to the circular flow of income if saving exceeds investment?", answer: "The level of national income will decrease." },
    { question: "What happens to the circular flow of income if government spending exceeds taxation?", answer: "The level of national income will increase." },
    { question: "What happens to the circular flow of income if exports exceed imports?", answer: "The level of national income will increase." },
    { question: "What is the **income approach** to calculating GDP?", answer: "Summing up all the incomes earned from production, such as wages, rent, interest, and profits." },
    { question: "What is a **transfer payment** and why is it excluded from GDP calculations?", answer: "A payment made without goods or services being received in return (e.g., social security). It is excluded because it is not a payment for current production." }
