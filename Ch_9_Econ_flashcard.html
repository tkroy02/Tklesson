  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **unemployment rate**?", answer: "The percentage of the labour force that is unemployed." },
    { question: "Who is considered **unemployed**?", answer: "A person who is not currently working but is actively looking for a job." },
    { question: "What is **frictional unemployment**?", answer: "Unemployment that occurs when people are voluntarily moving between jobs." },
    { question: "What is **structural unemployment**?", answer: "Unemployment caused by a mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the skills required for the jobs available." },
    { question: "What is **cyclical unemployment**?", answer: "Unemployment that rises during economic downturns and falls when the economy improves." },
    { question: "What is **inflation**?", answer: "A general, sustained increase in the prices of goods and services over a period of time." },
    { question: "How is inflation commonly measured?", answer: "Using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the GDP deflator." },
    { question: "What is the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**?", answer: "A measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services." },
    { question: "What is **demand-pull inflation**?", answer: "Inflation caused by an increase in aggregate demand, which pulls prices up." },
    { question: "What is **cost-push inflation**?", answer: "Inflation caused by an increase in the costs of production, which pushes prices up." },
    { question: "What is the **Phillips Curve**?", answer: "A curve that shows the historical inverse relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation." },
    { question: "What does the short-run Phillips Curve suggest about the trade-off between inflation and unemployment?", answer: "It suggests that policymakers can choose between a lower rate of unemployment and a higher rate of inflation, or vice versa." },
    { question: "What is the natural rate of unemployment?", answer: "The unemployment rate that would exist in a healthy economy, consisting only of frictional and structural unemployment." },
    { question: "What is **deflation**?", answer: "A decrease in the general price level of goods and services." },
    { question: "What is the **labour force**?", answer: "The total number of employed and unemployed people in an economy." },
    { question: "How is the unemployment rate calculated?", answer: "Unemployment rate = (Number of Unemployed / Labour Force) x 100." },
    { question: "What are some of the costs of inflation?", answer: "Reduced purchasing power, uncertainty, and a redistribution of wealth from savers to borrowers." },
    { question: "What is **stagflation**?", answer: "A period of high inflation and high unemployment, contradicting the traditional Phillips Curve." },
    { question: "How can government policy affect unemployment?", answer: "Through fiscal policies like government spending or monetary policies like interest rate changes." },
    { question: "Why might the long-run Phillips Curve be vertical?", answer: "Because in the long run, unemployment will return to its natural rate regardless of the inflation rate." }
