  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element?", answer: "An **atom**." },
    { question: "What are the three subatomic particles and their charges?", answer: "Protons (+), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (-)." },
    { question: "What is a **covalent bond**?", answer: "A strong chemical bond formed by the sharing of one or more pairs of valence electrons." },
    { question: "What is an **ionic bond**?", answer: "A chemical bond resulting from the attraction between oppositely charged ions after a transfer of electrons." },
    { question: "What is a **hydrogen bond**?", answer: "A weak chemical bond formed between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a partially negative atom (like oxygen or nitrogen)." },
    { question: "What is a **polar covalent bond**?", answer: "A covalent bond where electrons are shared unequally between atoms, creating partial positive and negative charges." },
    { question: "What property of water causes it to be a good solvent?", answer: "Its **polarity**. The partial positive and negative charges on the water molecule allow it to dissolve other polar substances." },
    { question: "What is **cohesion**?", answer: "The sticking together of water molecules to other water molecules due to hydrogen bonds." },
    { question: "What is **adhesion**?", answer: "The clinging of water molecules to other polar surfaces." },
    { question: "Why does water have a high specific heat?", answer: "Hydrogen bonds absorb a lot of heat when they break and release heat when they form, allowing water to resist changes in temperature." },
    { question: "What is a **macromolecule**?", answer: "A large biological molecule, such as a carbohydrate, lipid, protein, or nucleic acid." },
    { question: "What is the building block (monomer) of carbohydrates?", answer: "Monosaccharides, such as glucose." },
    { question: "What is the function of carbohydrates?", answer: "To provide a primary source of quick energy (e.g., starch, glucose) and structural support (e.g., cellulose)." },
    { question: "What are the building blocks of a protein?", answer: "Amino acids." },
    { question: "What is the bond that links amino acids together?", answer: "A **peptide bond**." },
    { question: "What are some functions of proteins?", answer: "Catalyzing reactions (enzymes), structural support, transport, and defense." },
    { question: "What is the building block of a lipid?", answer: "Glycerol and fatty acids." },
    { question: "What are some functions of lipids?", answer: "Long-term energy storage, insulation, and forming cell membranes." },
    { question: "What are the building blocks of nucleic acids?", answer: "Nucleotides." },
    { question: "What is the function of nucleic acids?", answer: "To store and transmit hereditary information (DNA and RNA)." },
    { question: "What are **enzymes**?", answer: "Biological catalysts that speed up the rate of chemical reactions without being consumed in the reaction." },
    { question: "How do enzymes speed up reactions?", answer: "By lowering the **activation energy** required for the reaction to occur." },
    { question: "What is a **substrate**?", answer: "The reactant an enzyme acts on." },
    { question: "What is the **active site** of an enzyme?", answer: "The specific region of an enzyme that binds to the substrate." },
    { question: "Explain the **induced-fit model** of enzyme-substrate binding.", answer: "The active site changes its shape slightly to fit the substrate more snugly after binding, like a handshake." },
    { question: "What happens to an enzyme's shape when it is **denatured**?", answer: "Its 3D structure changes, causing it to lose its function." },
    { question: "What two factors can denature an enzyme?", answer: "Extreme temperature and pH levels outside of the enzyme's optimal range." },
    { question: "What is an **inhibitor**?", answer: "A molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a competitive and a non-competitive inhibitor?", answer: "A competitive inhibitor binds to the active site; a non-competitive inhibitor binds to a different site, changing the active site's shape." },
    { question: "What is a **catalyst**?", answer: "A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without itself being changed." },
    { question: "What is the process of building a polymer from monomers?", answer: "Dehydration synthesis (or condensation reaction), which removes a water molecule." },
    { question: "What is the process of breaking down a polymer into monomers?", answer: "Hydrolysis, which adds a water molecule to break the bond." },
    { question: "What is the name for a molecule with a long carbon backbone and a carboxyl group, found in lipids?", answer: "A **fatty acid**." },
    { question: "What is the primary function of DNA?", answer: "To contain the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms." },
    { question: "What is a **phospholipid**?", answer: "A lipid that is the main component of cell membranes, having a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail." },
    { question: "What is a **buffer**?", answer: "A substance that minimizes changes in pH by accepting or donating H+ ions." },
    { question: "What is the term for a molecule that has both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic part?", answer: "Amphipathic." },
    { question: "How does an enzyme's active site relate to its substrate?", answer: "It has a specific shape and chemical properties that are complementary to the substrate." },
    { question: "What is the energy currency of the cell?", answer: "ATP (adenosine triphosphate)." },
    { question: "What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats?", answer: "Saturated fats have no double bonds in their fatty acid chains, making them straight; unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds, causing them to bend." }
