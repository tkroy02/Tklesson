  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the difference between **heat** and **temperature**?", answer: "Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from one object to another." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **temperature**?", answer: "The Kelvin (K)." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for **heat** or energy?", answer: "The Joule (J)." },
    { question: "What are the three main temperature scales?", answer: "Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin." },
    { question: "At what temperature does water freeze on the Celsius scale?", answer: "0°C." },
    { question: "At what temperature does water boil on the Celsius scale?", answer: "100°C." },
    { question: "What is **absolute zero**?", answer: "The lowest possible temperature at which all molecular motion stops (0 K or -273.15 °C)." },
    { question: "What are the three methods of **heat transfer**?", answer: "Conduction, convection, and radiation." },
    { question: "What is **conduction**?", answer: "The transfer of heat through direct contact between particles, without the movement of the material itself." },
    { question: "What is **convection**?", answer: "The transfer of heat through the movement of fluids (liquids or gases)." },
    { question: "What is **radiation**?", answer: "The transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves, which can occur in a vacuum." },
    { question: "Give an example of **conduction**.", answer: "The handle of a metal spoon getting hot while in a pot of hot soup." },
    { question: "Give an example of **convection**.", answer: "The boiling of water in a pot, where hot water rises and cooler water sinks." },
    { question: "Give an example of **radiation**.", answer: "Feeling the heat from the sun or a campfire." },
    { question: "What is a **conductor**?", answer: "A material that transfers heat and electricity well (e.g., metals)." },
    { question: "What is an **insulator**?", answer: "A material that does not transfer heat or electricity well (e.g., plastic, wood)." },
    { question: "What is **specific heat capacity**?", answer: "The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1°C." },
    { question: "Why does sand get hot faster than water at the beach?", answer: "Sand has a lower specific heat capacity than water, so it requires less energy to increase its temperature." },
    { question: "What is **thermal expansion**?", answer: "The tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature." },
    { question: "Why do bridges have expansion joints?", answer: "To allow the bridge to expand and contract with temperature changes without cracking." },
    { question: "What is a **phase change**?", answer: "The transition of matter from one state (solid, liquid, gas) to another." },
    { question: "What is the process of a solid turning into a liquid?", answer: "Melting." },
    { question: "What is the process of a liquid turning into a gas?", answer: "Boiling or vaporization." },
    { question: "What is the process of a liquid turning into a solid?", answer: "Freezing or solidification." },
    { question: "What is the process of a gas turning into a liquid?", answer: "Condensation." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Conservation of Energy** in the context of heat?", answer: "The total amount of thermal energy in an isolated system remains constant; heat lost by one object equals the heat gained by another." },
    { question: "What is **thermal equilibrium**?", answer: "A state where two objects in contact have reached the same temperature and there is no net transfer of heat between them." },
    { question: "What is the formula for calculating heat energy?", answer: "$$Q = mcΔT$$ where Q is heat, m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is change in temperature." },
    { question: "What is the freezing point of water on the Fahrenheit scale?", answer: "32°F." },
    { question: "What is the boiling point of water on the Fahrenheit scale?", answer: "212°F." },
    { question: "How does the kinetic theory of matter relate to temperature?", answer: "It states that all matter is made of particles in constant motion, and temperature is a measure of their average kinetic energy." },
    { question: "Why are some cooking pots made of a metal base and a plastic handle?", answer: "The metal is a good conductor to heat the food, and the plastic handle is an insulator to protect your hand." },
    { question: "What happens to the molecules of a substance as its temperature increases?", answer: "They move faster and vibrate more, and the substance generally expands." },
    { question: "How do ocean currents transfer heat around the globe?", answer: "Through convection, where warm water from the equator moves towards the poles and cooler water moves towards the equator." },
    { question: "What is **latent heat**?", answer: "The energy absorbed or released during a phase change, without a change in temperature." },
    { question: "Is heat a form of energy?", answer: "Yes, it is the transfer of thermal energy." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a hot object and a cold object at the molecular level?", answer: "The molecules in the hot object are, on average, moving faster than the molecules in the cold object." },
    { question: "In a hot air balloon, how is the air inside heated?", answer: "The air is heated by a burner, and the hot air rises through convection, causing the balloon to lift." },
    { question: "Why does steam cause a more severe burn than boiling water?", answer: "Steam has a large amount of latent heat of vaporization, which is released when it condenses on your skin." },
    { question: "Why is a good thermos designed to prevent all three types of heat transfer?", answer: "It has a vacuum to prevent conduction and convection, and a reflective surface to prevent radiation, keeping the contents at a stable temperature." }
