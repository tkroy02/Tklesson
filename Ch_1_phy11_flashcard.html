  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the difference between a **scalar** and a **vector** quantity?", answer: "A scalar has magnitude only; a vector has both magnitude and direction." },
    { question: "Is **distance** a scalar or a vector?", answer: "Scalar." },
    { question: "Is **displacement** a scalar or a vector?", answer: "Vector." },
    { question: "Is **speed** a scalar or a vector?", answer: "Scalar." },
    { question: "Is **velocity** a scalar or a vector?", answer: "Vector." },
    { question: "Is **acceleration** a scalar or a vector?", answer: "Vector." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the final velocity of an object with uniform acceleration?", answer: "$$v_f = v_i + at$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the displacement of an object with uniform acceleration?", answer: "$$\\Delta d = v_i t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$$" },
    { question: "What is the 'timeless' kinematic equation?", answer: "$$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\\Delta d$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for displacement using average velocity?", answer: "$$\\Delta d = \\frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t$$" },
    { question: "What is **free-fall**?", answer: "The motion of an object solely under the influence of gravity, with no air resistance." },
    { question: "What is the value of acceleration due to gravity on Earth?", answer: "$$g \\approx 9.8\\text{ m/s²}$$" },
    { question: "What is the acceleration of a projectile at its highest point?", answer: "$$9.8\\text{ m/s²}$$ downward." },
    { question: "What is the horizontal acceleration of a projectile (ignoring air resistance)?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "What is a **projectile**?", answer: "An object that is thrown or launched into the air and is subject only to the force of gravity." },
    { question: "How does the time it takes for an object to fall from a height compare to an identical object thrown horizontally from the same height?", answer: "The time is the same, as the vertical motion is independent of the horizontal motion." },
    { question: "What is the slope of a **position-time graph**?", answer: "Velocity." },
    { question: "What does a horizontal line on a position-time graph represent?", answer: "An object at rest (zero velocity)." },
    { question: "What does a straight, sloped line on a position-time graph represent?", answer: "Constant velocity." },
    { question: "What is the slope of a **velocity-time graph**?", answer: "Acceleration." },
    { question: "What does a horizontal line on a velocity-time graph represent?", answer: "Constant velocity (zero acceleration)." },
    { question: "What does a straight, sloped line on a velocity-time graph represent?", answer: "Constant acceleration." },
    { question: "What is the area under a **velocity-time graph**?", answer: "Displacement." },
    { question: "What is the area under an **acceleration-time graph**?", answer: "Change in velocity." },
    { question: "What is **terminal velocity**?", answer: "The constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium (air) prevents further acceleration." },
    { question: "What is **uniform acceleration**?", answer: "A constant rate of change of velocity." },
    { question: "What is the **trajectory** of a projectile?", answer: "The path that the projectile follows, which is a parabola." },
    { question: "What is the **range** of a projectile?", answer: "The total horizontal distance traveled by the projectile." },
    { question: "What is **relative velocity**?", answer: "The velocity of an object with respect to another object or frame of reference." },
    { question: "If a car is traveling at $$100\\text{ km/h}$$ and a truck is traveling at $$80\\text{ km/h}$$ in the same direction, what is the car's speed relative to the truck?", answer: "$$20\\text{ km/h}$$" },
    { question: "What is the vertical velocity of a projectile at its maximum height?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "What is the horizontal velocity of a projectile at its maximum height?", answer: "It is constant and equal to its initial horizontal velocity." },
    { question: "What is the significance of the sign (+/-) in kinematic quantities?", answer: "It indicates the direction of the vector." },
    { question: "What is the difference between instantaneous and average velocity?", answer: "Instantaneous velocity is at a specific moment in time; average velocity is over a time interval." },
    { question: "When can the kinematic equations be used?", answer: "Only when the acceleration is uniform (constant)." },
    { question: "What is the shape of a position-time graph for an object with constant acceleration?", answer: "A parabola (a curved line)." },
    { question: "What does the initial velocity ($$v_i$$) represent in a free-fall problem?", answer: "The velocity at the moment the object begins to fall (often zero)." },
    { question: "In a kinematic problem, why is the negative sign for acceleration crucial?", answer: "It indicates that the object is slowing down or accelerating in the opposite direction." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the time to reach the peak and the total flight time for a projectile launched and landing at the same height?", answer: "The time to the peak is exactly half of the total flight time." },
    { question: "What is a **frame of reference**?", answer: "A system of coordinates used to describe the position and motion of an object." }
