    { question: "What is **price elasticity of demand**?", answer: "A measure of how sensitive the quantity demanded is to a change in price." },
    { question: "What does it mean if demand is **elastic**?", answer: "The quantity demanded changes by a larger percentage than the price change. Price elasticity of demand (PED) is greater than 1." },
    { question: "What does it mean if demand is **inelastic**?", answer: "The quantity demanded changes by a smaller percentage than the price change. PED is less than 1." },
    { question: "What is **unit elastic** demand?", answer: "The percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price. PED is equal to 1." },
    { question: "What is **price elasticity of supply**?", answer: "A measure of how sensitive the quantity supplied is to a change in price." },
    { question: "What does it mean if supply is **elastic**?", answer: "The quantity supplied changes by a larger percentage than the price change. Price elasticity of supply (PES) is greater than 1." },
    { question: "What does it mean if supply is **inelastic**?", answer: "The quantity supplied changes by a smaller percentage than the price change. PES is less than 1." },
    { question: "What is **income elasticity of demand**?", answer: "A measure of how the quantity demanded for a good changes in response to a change in consumer income." },
    { question: "What is a **normal good** in terms of income elasticity?", answer: "A good with a positive income elasticity; as income rises, demand for the good also rises." },
    { question: "What is an **inferior good** in terms of income elasticity?", answer: "A good with a negative income elasticity; as income rises, demand for the good falls." },
    { question: "What is **cross-price elasticity of demand**?", answer: "A measure of how the quantity demanded for one good changes in response to a change in the price of another good." },
    { question: "What does a **positive** cross-price elasticity of demand indicate?", answer: "That the two goods are **substitutes**. An increase in the price of one leads to an increase in demand for the other (e.g., coffee and tea)." },
    { question: "What does a **negative** cross-price elasticity of demand indicate?", answer: "That the two goods are **complements**. An increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in demand for the other (e.g., printers and ink cartridges)." },
    { question: "Name a key factor that influences the price elasticity of demand.", answer: "The availability of close substitutes." },
    { question: "How does elasticity help businesses?", answer: "It helps them predict how sales will change if they adjust their prices, which is crucial for pricing strategy." },
    { question: "How does elasticity help the government?", answer: "It helps them predict the impact of taxes or subsidies on a market. For example, a tax on an inelastic good (like cigarettes) will generate more revenue." },
    { question: "When is demand for a good perfectly inelastic?", answer: "When a change in price causes no change in the quantity demanded. The PED is 0 (e.g., life-saving medicine)." },
    { question: "What is the formula for calculating price elasticity of demand?", answer: "Percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price." },
    { question: "If the price of a good increases by 10% and the quantity demanded falls by 20%, what is the PED?", answer: "2 (since | -20% / 10% | = 2). The demand is elastic." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the slope of a demand curve and elasticity?", answer: "While related, they are not the same. A steeper demand curve is generally more inelastic, but elasticity changes along a linear demand curve even though the slope is constant." }
