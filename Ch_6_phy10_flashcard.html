    { question: "What is a **wave**?", answer: "A disturbance that transfers energy through a medium or a vacuum." },
    { question: "What is a **mechanical wave**?", answer: "A wave that requires a medium to travel through." },
    { question: "What is an **electromagnetic wave**?", answer: "A wave that can travel through a vacuum and does not require a medium." },
    { question: "What is a **transverse wave**?", answer: "A wave in which particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer." },
    { question: "What is a **longitudinal wave**?", answer: "A wave in which particles of the medium vibrate parallel to the direction of energy transfer." },
    { question: "What is the **period (T)** of a wave?", answer: "The time it takes for a single wave cycle to pass a given point." },
    { question: "What is the **frequency (f)** of a wave?", answer: "The number of wave cycles that pass a given point per unit of time." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between period and frequency?", answer: "$$T = \\frac{1}{f}$$" },
    { question: "What is **wavelength (λ)**?", answer: "The distance between two consecutive identical points on a wave, such as from crest to crest." },
    { question: "What is the **amplitude** of a wave?", answer: "The maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium position." },
    { question: "What is the formula for wave speed?", answer: "$$v = f\\lambda$$" },
    { question: "What is a **standing wave**?", answer: "A wave pattern that remains in a constant position due to interference between two waves traveling in opposite directions." },
    { question: "What is a **node** on a standing wave?", answer: "A point of zero displacement where destructive interference is at its maximum." },
    { question: "What is an **antinode** on a standing wave?", answer: "A point of maximum displacement where constructive interference is at its maximum." },
    { question: "What is **reflection**?", answer: "The bouncing back of a wave when it hits a boundary." },
    { question: "What is **refraction**?", answer: "The change in direction of a wave as it passes from one medium to another." },
    { question: "What is **diffraction**?", answer: "The bending of waves as they pass around an obstacle or through an opening." },
    { question: "What is **constructive interference**?", answer: "When two waves overlap and their amplitudes add to create a larger-amplitude wave." },
    { question: "What is **destructive interference**?", answer: "When two waves overlap and their amplitudes subtract, resulting in a smaller-amplitude wave." },
    { question: "What is **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)**?", answer: "A type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the opposite direction." },
    { question: "What is the **restoring force** in SHM?", answer: "The force that always acts to return the oscillating object to its equilibrium position." },
    { question: "What is **Hooke's Law**?", answer: "The law that states the restoring force of a spring is proportional to the displacement. ($$F = -kx$$)" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the period of a simple pendulum?", answer: "$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the period of a mass-spring system?", answer: "$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$$" },
    { question: "How does the period of a simple pendulum change if the mass is doubled?", answer: "It remains the same (the period is independent of mass)." },
    { question: "How does the period of a mass-spring system change if the mass is doubled?", answer: "It increases by a factor of $$\sqrt{2}$$." },
    { question: "How does the period of a pendulum change if the length is doubled?", answer: "It increases by a factor of $$\sqrt{2}$$." },
    { question: "What happens to the period of a pendulum on the moon?", answer: "It increases because gravity is weaker ($$g$$ is smaller)." },
    { question: "Where is the velocity of an object in SHM at its maximum?", answer: "At the equilibrium position." },
    { question: "Where is the kinetic energy of an object in SHM at its maximum?", answer: "At the equilibrium position." },
    { question: "Where is the potential energy of an object in SHM at its maximum?", answer: "At the maximum displacement from equilibrium." },
    { question: "Where is the acceleration of an object in SHM at its maximum?", answer: "At the maximum displacement from equilibrium." },
    { question: "What is the **medium** of a wave?", answer: "The substance or material that a mechanical wave travels through." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **crest** and a **trough**?", answer: "A crest is the highest point of a transverse wave, while a trough is the lowest point." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a **compression** and a **rarefaction**?", answer: "A compression is a region of high density in a longitudinal wave, while a rarefaction is a region of low density." },
    { question: "What is the principle of **superposition**?", answer: "When two or more waves overlap, the resulting displacement is the vector sum of the individual displacements." },
    { question: "What is the **phase** of a wave?", answer: "The position of a point on a wave cycle, often measured in degrees or radians." },
    { question: "Do waves transfer matter?", answer: "No, they transfer energy, but the particles of the medium only oscillate in place." },
    { question: "What is the main property of a sound wave that determines its pitch?", answer: "Frequency." },
    { question: "What is the main property of a sound wave that determines its loudness?", answer: "Amplitude." }
