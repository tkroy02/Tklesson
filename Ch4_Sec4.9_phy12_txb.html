      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This section provides a variety of problems that combine concepts from electric fields, potential, and capacitance. The aim is to strengthen problem-solving skills through application and integration of ideas.</p>

      <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Point Charge Field:</strong> A +6 μC charge is placed 0.3 m away from a point. Find the electric field at that point.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Superposition:</strong> Two equal charges of +2 μC are located 1 m apart. What is the electric field at the midpoint between them?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Potential Difference:</strong> A charge of +4 μC creates a potential of 1200 V at some point. How far is that point from the charge?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Capacitance:</strong> A capacitor stores 2 × 10⁻³ C of charge when a potential difference of 50 V is applied. What is its capacitance?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Series Capacitors:</strong> Two capacitors, 6 μF and 12 μF, are connected in series across a 24 V battery. Find the equivalent capacitance and the charge on each capacitor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Parallel Capacitors:</strong> Two capacitors, 10 μF and 20 μF, are connected in parallel across a 12 V battery. Find the total stored energy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Work Done:</strong> Calculate the work required to move a +1 μC charge from a point at 20 V potential to another point at 80 V potential.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Electric Field Between Plates:</strong> A parallel-plate capacitor with plate separation 2 mm is connected to a 9 V battery. Find the electric field inside the capacitor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Dielectrics:</strong> A 5 μF capacitor is filled with a dielectric of ε<sub>r</sub> = 3. What is the new capacitance?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A proton is released from rest at the positive plate of a capacitor with a potential difference of 100 V. What is its speed just before it reaches the negative plate? (ignore non-electric forces)</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Hints for Selected Problems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Problem 2:</strong> Consider the vector directions of fields; at the midpoint, they point opposite and may cancel or add depending on sign of charges.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem 5:</strong> Use the series capacitance formula, then calculate voltage across each capacitor using <em>Q = CV</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem 10:</strong> Use energy conservation: qV = ½ mv², with q = e (charge of proton).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>These problems integrate the major concepts of Chapter 4: electric fields, potential, work, and capacitance. They are intended for practice before attempting the chapter test.</p>
