  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **uniform circular motion**?", answer: "The motion of an object traveling at a constant speed in a circular path." },
    { question: "What is **tangential velocity**?", answer: "The velocity of an object at any point in its circular path, which is always tangent to the circle." },
    { question: "In uniform circular motion, is velocity constant?", answer: "No. The speed is constant, but the velocity is always changing direction." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the magnitude of tangential velocity?", answer: "$$v_t = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$$" },
    { question: "What is the **centripetal force**?", answer: "The net force that causes an object to move in a circular path. It is always directed toward the center of the circle." },
    { question: "What is the formula for centripetal force?", answer: "$$F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$$" },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for centripetal force?", answer: "The Newton (N)." },
    { question: "What is **centripetal acceleration**?", answer: "The acceleration of an object moving in a circle, always directed toward the center." },
    { question: "What is the formula for centripetal acceleration?", answer: "$$a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r}$$" },
    { question: "What is the relationship between centripetal force and centripetal acceleration?", answer: "$$F_c = ma_c$$" },
    { question: "What is **centrifugal force**?", answer: "A fictitious force that appears to push an object away from the center of a circular path. It is not a real force." },
    { question: "What is the difference between centripetal and centrifugal force?", answer: "Centripetal force is a real force directed inward, while centrifugal force is an apparent force directed outward due to inertia." },
    { question: "What is the **period (T)** of circular motion?", answer: "The time it takes for an object to complete one full revolution." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for period?", answer: "The second (s)." },
    { question: "What is the **frequency (f)** of circular motion?", answer: "The number of revolutions per unit of time." },
    { question: "What is the SI unit for frequency?", answer: "Hertz (Hz)." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between period and frequency?", answer: "$$T = \\frac{1}{f}$$" },
    { question: "How does the centripetal force change if the mass of the object is doubled?", answer: "It doubles." },
    { question: "How does the centripetal force change if the radius is halved?", answer: "It doubles." },
    { question: "How does the centripetal force change if the speed is doubled?", answer: "It quadruples." },
    { question: "What force provides the centripetal force for a car turning a corner?", answer: "Friction between the tires and the road." },
    { question: "What force provides the centripetal force for a satellite orbiting Earth?", answer: "Gravity." },
    { question: "What force provides the centripetal force for a ball swung on a string?", answer: "Tension in the string." },
    { question: "At the top of a vertical circle, what two forces provide the centripetal force?", answer: "Tension (or Normal Force) and the force of gravity (weight)." },
    { question: "At the bottom of a vertical circle, what two forces provide the centripetal force?", answer: "Tension (or Normal Force) minus the force of gravity (weight)." },
    { question: "What is the minimum speed needed for an object to complete a vertical loop?", answer: "The speed at the top where tension is zero." },
    { question: "How does the centripetal acceleration change if the radius is doubled?", answer: "It is halved." },
    { question: "What happens to a satellite's speed if it moves into a larger orbit?", answer: "Its speed decreases." },
    { question: "What is the formula for centripetal force using period?", answer: "$$F_c = \\frac{4\\pi^2 mr}{T^2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for centripetal acceleration using period?", answer: "$$a_c = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r}{T^2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for tangential speed using frequency?", answer: "$$v_t = 2\\pi rf$$" },
    { question: "On a vertical loop, at what point is the tension in the string highest?", answer: "The bottom." },
    { question: "On a vertical loop, at what point is the tension in the string lowest?", answer: "The top." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the net force at the bottom of a vertical loop?", answer: "$$\\Sigma F_{net} = F_T - F_g = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$$" },
    { question: "What is the formula for the net force at the top of a vertical loop?", answer: "$$\\Sigma F_{net} = F_T + F_g = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$$" },
    { question: "Why do passengers in a car feel pushed outward when turning a corner?", answer: "Their inertia causes them to want to continue in a straight line, while the car turns." },
    { question: "What happens to an object's path if the centripetal force suddenly vanishes?", answer: "It will fly off in a straight line tangent to the circular path." },
    { question: "Why are banked curves used on racetracks and highways?", answer: "To use a component of the normal force to provide the necessary centripetal force." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the radius of a turn and the centripetal force required?", answer: "The force is inversely proportional to the radius." },
    { question: "What is the angular velocity of an object in circular motion?", answer: "The rate of change of the angle, measured in radians per second." }
