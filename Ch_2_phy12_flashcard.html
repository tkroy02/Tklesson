  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**?", answer: "Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them." },
    { question: "What is the formula for Universal Gravitation?", answer: "$$F = G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$" },
    { question: "What is the value of the **Universal Gravitational Constant** ($$G$$)?", answer: "$$6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2$$" },
    { question: "What is a **gravitational field**?", answer: "A region of space around a massive object where another object would experience a gravitational force." },
    { question: "What is the formula for **gravitational field strength** ($$g$$)?", answer: "$$g = G\\frac{M}{r^2}$$" },
    { question: "How does the gravitational force change if the distance between two objects is doubled?", answer: "The force decreases to one-quarter of its original value." },
    { question: "How does the gravitational force change if one of the masses is doubled?", answer: "The force doubles." },
    { question: "What is **gravitational potential energy**?", answer: "The energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field." },
    { question: "What is the formula for gravitational potential energy?", answer: "$$U = -G\\frac{Mm}{r}$$" },
    { question: "Why is gravitational potential energy always a negative value?", answer: "It is defined as zero at an infinite distance, and energy must be added to a system to move objects apart from a closer distance." },
    { question: "What is the **orbital velocity** of a satellite?", answer: "The tangential speed required for a satellite to maintain a stable orbit around a central body." },
    { question: "What is the formula for orbital velocity?", answer: "$$v_{orbital} = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$$" },
    { question: "What is **escape velocity**?", answer: "The minimum speed an object needs to escape the gravitational pull of a planet or star completely." },
    { question: "What is the formula for escape velocity?", answer: "$$v_{esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$$" },
    { question: "What is the relationship between orbital velocity and escape velocity?", answer: "Escape velocity is $$\\sqrt{2}$$ times the orbital velocity at the same radius." },
    { question: "Why does a satellite not fall back to Earth?", answer: "It is constantly falling towards the Earth, but its horizontal velocity is high enough that it continually 'misses' the surface." },
    { question: "What is **Kepler's First Law**?", answer: "The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci." },
    { question: "What is **Kepler's Second Law**?", answer: "A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time." },
    { question: "What is **Kepler's Third Law**?", answer: "The square of the orbital period ($$T^2$$) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the average distance from the sun ($$r^3$$)." },
    { question: "What is a **geostationary satellite**?", answer: "A satellite that orbits the Earth at a specific altitude and has an orbital period of 24 hours, so it appears stationary from the ground." },
    { question: "At what point in an elliptical orbit is a planet moving fastest?", answer: "When it is closest to the Sun (at perihelion)." },
    { question: "At what point in an elliptical orbit is a planet moving slowest?", answer: "When it is farthest from the Sun (at aphelion)." },
    { question: "What is **total mechanical energy** in an orbital system?", answer: "The sum of the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy ($$E_{total} = K + U$$)." },
    { question: "How does the total mechanical energy of an orbiting satellite change?", answer: "It remains constant, assuming no external forces like air resistance." },
    { question: "What is the **centripetal force** that keeps a satellite in orbit?", answer: "The gravitational force of the central body." },
    { question: "If the mass of a planet were to double, how would the orbital speed of a satellite at the same radius change?", answer: "It would increase by a factor of $$\\sqrt{2}$$." },
    { question: "What is the **orbital period**?", answer: "The time it takes for a satellite to complete one full revolution around its central body." },
    { question: "Why are astronauts weightless in orbit?", answer: "They are in a state of continuous freefall, so they do not feel the normal force that creates the sensation of weight." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between gravitational potential energy and distance from the central body?", answer: "Gravitational potential energy increases (becomes less negative) as the distance increases." },
    { question: "Why do satellites require a launch vehicle to reach orbit?", answer: "They need to be lifted to a high altitude and given a high tangential velocity to achieve a stable orbit." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a geosynchronous and a geostationary orbit?", answer: "A geosynchronous orbit has a 24-hour period but can be inclined. A geostationary orbit is a type of geosynchronous orbit that is directly above the equator." },
    { question: "How does the angular momentum of a planet in orbit change?", answer: "It remains constant because there is no net external torque acting on it." },
    { question: "What is the purpose of the **G** in the Universal Gravitation formula?", answer: "It is a proportionality constant that allows the equation to be used with standard units of force, mass, and distance." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between the period and radius of a satellite's orbit?", answer: "The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the radius ($$T^2 \\propto r^3$$)." },
    { question: "What is the condition for a stable circular orbit?", answer: "The gravitational force must be equal to the required centripetal force." },
    { question: "What is the **tidal force**?", answer: "The differential gravitational force exerted by a celestial body on a body of a different size, causing tides." },
    { question: "What are the two major forces acting on a rocket during launch?", answer: "The upward thrust from its engines and the downward force of gravity." },
    { question: "How does the value of the acceleration due to gravity ($$g$$) on a planet change with altitude?", answer: "It decreases as altitude increases, following the inverse square law." },
    { question: "How does the energy of a satellite change if it is moved to a higher orbit?", answer: "Its total energy increases (becomes less negative) because its gravitational potential energy increases." },
    { question: "What does the **escape velocity** depend on?", answer: "The mass and radius of the central body." }
