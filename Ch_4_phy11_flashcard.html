  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is **momentum**?", answer: "A measure of the mass in motion. It is the product of an object's mass and its velocity." },
    { question: "What is the formula for momentum?", answer: "$$p = mv$$" },
    { question: "What is the unit of momentum?", answer: "Kilogram-meter per second ($$kg \\cdot m/s$$)." },
    { question: "Is momentum a scalar or a vector quantity?", answer: "A vector, because it has both magnitude and direction." },
    { question: "What is **impulse**?", answer: "The product of the average net force on an object and the time interval over which the force acts." },
    { question: "What is the formula for impulse?", answer: "$$J = F\\Delta t$$" },
    { question: "What is the unit of impulse?", answer: "Newton-second ($$N \\cdot s$$)." },
    { question: "What does the **Impulse-Momentum Theorem** state?", answer: "The impulse on an object equals its change in momentum ($$J = \\Delta p$$)." },
    { question: "What is the **Law of Conservation of Momentum**?", answer: "The total momentum of an isolated system remains constant." },
    { question: "What is an **isolated system**?", answer: "A system on which no net external force acts." },
    { question: "What is a perfectly **elastic collision**?", answer: "A collision in which both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved." },
    { question: "What is a perfectly **inelastic collision**?", answer: "A collision in which the objects stick together and move as one. Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not." },
    { question: "In a collision, if objects bounce off each other, is it likely elastic or inelastic?", answer: "Elastic." },
    { question: "In a collision, if objects stick together, is it likely elastic or inelastic?", answer: "Inelastic." },
    { question: "Why do airbags and crumple zones save lives in a car crash?", answer: "They increase the time of impact, which reduces the force on the occupants, as $$F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$$." },
    { question: "A force is applied to an object for a short time vs. a long time. Which produces a greater change in momentum?", answer: "A longer time, as change in momentum is directly proportional to the time of force application ($$\\Delta p = F\\Delta t$$)." },
    { question: "If two objects collide, is the force they exert on each other equal and opposite?", answer: "Yes, according to Newton's Third Law of Motion." },
    { question: "A person fires a rifle. The momentum of the bullet is equal and opposite to what?", answer: "The momentum of the rifle's recoil." },
    { question: "If a bowling ball and a tennis ball have the same momentum, which has the greater velocity?", answer: "The tennis ball, since its mass is smaller and $$p=mv$$." },
    { question: "What is a **recoil**?", answer: "The backward motion of an object after a forward push, like a gun firing a bullet." },
    { question: "In an explosion, what is the total momentum of the fragments immediately after the explosion?", answer: "The same as the total momentum of the system before the explosion." },
    { question: "How can you determine the final velocity of an object after a perfectly inelastic collision?", answer: "By setting the initial total momentum equal to the final total momentum: $$m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = (m_1 + m_2)v_f$$." },
    { question: "Why is kinetic energy not conserved in an inelastic collision?", answer: "Energy is converted to other forms, such as heat, sound, or deformation of the objects." },
    { question: "A karate chop can break a brick. What physics principle is being applied?", answer: "A large force is delivered over a very short time, which results in a large impulse and a rapid change in momentum." },
    { question: "Is momentum conserved in an explosion?", answer: "Yes, assuming the system is isolated." },
    { question: "What is the relationship between force and the rate of change of momentum?", answer: "According to Newton's Second Law, force is equal to the rate of change of momentum ($$F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$$)." },
    { question: "A small object and a large object have the same kinetic energy. Which has a greater momentum?", answer: "The larger object." },
    { question: "A small object and a large object have the same momentum. Which has a greater kinetic energy?", answer: "The smaller object." },
    { question: "What is the difference between a collision and an explosion?", answer: "In a collision, objects come together. In an explosion, an object breaks apart." },
    { question: "A person pushes on a box. If the box moves, what can you say about the impulse on the person?", answer: "It is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the impulse on the box." },
    { question: "Why do athletes land on soft surfaces like foam when jumping?", answer: "The soft surface increases the time of impact, reducing the force on their body." },
    { question: "A baseball player follows through with a swing. What effect does this have on the impulse?", answer: "It increases the time of impact, which increases the impulse and thus the final momentum of the ball." },
    { question: "What is the momentum of a stationary object?", answer: "Zero." },
    { question: "What is the change in momentum of an object that is thrown and then caught?", answer: "The initial momentum minus the final momentum, which would be a large negative value." },
    { question: "A system of two billiard balls collides. What can you say about their total momentum?", answer: "It remains constant (conserved) before and after the collision." },
    { question: "Is momentum a vector or scalar? How does that affect calculations?", answer: "It's a vector. Direction must be taken into account using positive and negative signs." },
    { question: "What does a zero net external force on a system imply about its momentum?", answer: "That the total momentum of the system is conserved." },
    { question: "A hockey puck is gliding across frictionless ice. Is its momentum conserved?", answer: "Yes, because there is no net external force acting on it." },
    { question: "In a 'perfectly' elastic collision, what happens to the total kinetic energy of the system?", answer: "It remains constant." },
    { question: "What is the unit equivalence of the Impulse-Momentum Theorem?", answer: "$$N \\cdot s = kg \\cdot m/s$$" }
